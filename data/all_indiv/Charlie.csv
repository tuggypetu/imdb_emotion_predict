8,"A visual treat,a joy ride","Travel, adventure, standing up and fighting injustices heroically, being one with people from poorer or less fortunate sections of society, being able to express the goodness in oneself boldly and completely, not being confined to small predictable lives - these are all longings that will resonate with a lot of people. Charlie fulfills all these beautifully, providing the viewer some emotional satisfaction. Cinema as a business is built around it's ability to be an escape from the boring routines and predictabilities of life. Charlie fits the business model nicely. Dulqar is the star of the movie. The movie rests squarely on his shoulders. If he had not delivered, the movie had absolutely no chance. I think this is his best performance so far. He has effectively challenged himself by rising above just being a behavior actor. He is a star. His likability sold. His work on his physique shows. His dialogue delivery is endearing. Charming fellow.Parvathy is an awesome actress. She has a very crucial role as well. She has much more screen time than Dulqar though the movie revolves fully around DQ. She is beautiful and has kept her presence sweet throughout the movie.The situations in the movie were not predictable though not all of them were totally new. The story line has been drawn very carefully, wary of the viewer and holding some tricks up the sleeve all the way. Spotted with interesting incidents, the movie is a feel gooder. The movie has good art work. I will not be surprised if the movie wins awards for it's art work in addition to many others. The sets are interesting. Lot of nice objects have been used to tell the story of the movie. The songs are impressive and is at par with the movie. Coming at pretty regular intervals, the movie is kept pleasant and musical all through. Cinematography is excellent. The movie has been written to use lot of beautiful/ varied / striking sights and the camera has captured them nicely - be it the saturated colors of fort kochi, the striking costumes, pooram. However, the fact of the matter is that the movie is quite sublime and just whiffs off pretty quickly. It was not meant to be deep or leave a lasting impact. It is just a nice roller coaster ride into Charlie's life. I would see it again.",visual treat joy ride,travel adventure standing up fighting injustices heroically being one with people poorer or less fortunate sections society being able express goodness oneself boldly completely not being confined small predictable lives these are all longings that will resonate with lot people charlie fulfills all these beautifully providing viewer some emotional satisfaction cinema as business is built around its ability be escape boring routines predictabilities life charlie fits business model nicely dulqar is star movie movie rests squarely his shoulders if he had not delivered movie had absolutely no chance i think this is his best performance so far he has effectively challenged himself by rising above just being behavior actor he is star his likability sold his work his physique shows his dialogue delivery is endearing charming fellow parvathy is awesome actress she has very crucial role as well she has much more screen time than dulqar though movie revolves fully around dq she is beautiful has kept her presence sweet throughout movie situations movie were not predictable though not all them were totally new story line has been drawn very carefully wary viewer holding some tricks up sleeve all way spotted with interesting incidents movie is feel gooder movie has good art work i will not be surprised if movie wins awards its art work addition many others sets are interesting lot nice objects have been used tell story movie songs are impressive is at par with movie coming at pretty regular intervals movie is kept pleasant musical all through cinematography is excellent movie has been written use lot beautiful varied striking sights camera has captured them nicely be it saturated colors fort kochi striking costumes pooram however fact matter is that movie is quite sublime just whiffs off pretty quickly it was not meant be deep or leave lasting impact it is just nice roller coaster ride into charlies life i would see it again,0.6548939156082012,0.3374768089053803,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"

7,A feel good movie nothing more,"A December release and a movie from Dulquer Salman after a long gap, there was bound to be a lot of buzz and hype around the movie. Naturally the expectations were too high. Also since Dulquer-Martin Prakaat's previous venture ABCD was a hit with positive feedback. Charlie however does not have a great story or comedy scenes like ABCD. The movie is simply a search by Parvathi Menon to find Charlie. Where the movie scores: 1The curiosity raised among the audience by Parvathi Menon around this Charlie character. 2The positive vibes created by the attitude of Charlie towards life and all those who he meets along the way 3The moments were Dulquer's commanding laugh reminded of his father Mammooty. 4A helpless daughter, an ill-fated wife and an unlucky doctor who gets back happiness thanks to Charlie However amidst all these positives, the end felt like i was told to get out of the train before reaching the destination.

9,A Palette of Color,"Charlie is a shout out to the inner spirit within us straining to get out of its self-imposed restraints, a joyous call to the wild and free. This is not as much a movie of strong plot line as a palette of fresh colors and exuberance, at the center of which are two characters unrelenting in their search for meaning in the disorderly and their sheer rejection of the order which familiar society tries to impose on them.The story? We have Tessa, played by a luminous Parvathy escaping from the confined environs of her extended family (and from a job in Bangalore), especially her mother, who want to impose order and compliance onto her supposed wayward lifestyle by getting her betrothed to one of the present party. She ends up in a ramshackle rented room in one of the less savory parts of Kochi, and is captivated by the fascinating remnants of the life of the previous occupant (Dulqar Salman) of the place. As she tries to trace this seemingly almost mythical presence, she gets further emotionally drawn into this kindred spirit who appears to have perfected the art of living for anecdotal episodes of an unpredictable life, while at the same time leaving a mark with his humanity on the lives he has touched. The episodes with disparate characters are wonderfully captured. There is the thief who tries to break into his place, but who ends up being accompanied by Charlie on a night of unpredictability. The young woman whose life is indelibly influenced by Charlie also has a poignant tale to tell, while the long suffering Kunjappan (Nedumudi Venu) may hold the key to the hopeful final meeting of the two. The story arc involving Kalpana is another touching and bittersweet portion of the movie which endears all the characters to us. This is one of my favorite Malayalam films of the year and also one of the best pairs I've seen in a while, though the actual number of scenes in which they are together is quite few. The climactic reveal amidst the vibrant colors and pomp of the Thrissur pooram is delightfully handled, and this is one movie where a sequel may be genuinely warranted, if only to see where these characters end up.Speaking of which, Parvathy finally seems to be holding up her end of the bargain and finally fulfilling the immense promise she showed from her Notebook and City of God days. Here she captures the viewers as the throbbing heart of the movie and wins us over. Dulqar Salman as the titular character also exudes some great screen presence and has great chemistry with Parvathy. The supporting cast too is flawless, and adds on to make this one of the best movies of the year.",palette color,charlie is shout out inner spirit within us straining get out its self imposed restraints joyous call wild free this is not as much movie strong plot line as palette fresh colors exuberance at center which are two characters unrelenting their search meaning disorderly their sheer rejection order which familiar society tries impose them story we have tessa played by luminous parvathy escaping confined environs her extended family job bangalore especially her mother who want impose order compliance onto her supposed wayward lifestyle by getting her betrothed one present party she ends up ramshackle rented room one less savory parts kochi is captivated by fascinating remnants life previous occupant dulqar salman place as she tries trace this seemingly almost mythical presence she gets further emotionally drawn into this kindred spirit who appears have perfected art living anecdotal episodes unpredictable life while at same time leaving mark with his humanity lives he has touched episodes with disparate characters are wonderfully captured there is thief who tries break into his place but who ends up being accompanied by charlie night unpredictability young woman whose life is indelibly influenced by charlie also has poignant tale tell while long suffering kunjappan nedumudi venu may hold key hopeful final meeting two story arc involving kalpana is another touching bittersweet portion movie which endears all characters us this is one my favorite malayalam films year also one best pairs ive seen while though actual number scenes which they are together is quite few climactic reveal amidst vibrant colors pomp thrissur pooram is delightfully handled this is one movie where sequel may be genuinely warranted if only see where these characters end up speaking which parvathy finally seems be holding up her end bargain finally fulfilling immense promise she showed her notebook city god days here she captures viewers as throbbing heart movie wins us over dulqar salman as titular character also exudes some great screen presence has great chemistry with parvathy supporting cast too is flawless adds make this one best movies year,0.547644927536232,0.22336956521739132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.43}"

6,"Nice Happy Movie , too much happiness at times.","Zahir - someone or something which, once we have come into contact with them or it, gradually occupies our every thought, until we can think of nothing else. This is what Tessa(Parvathy) goes through, who while running away from her family and their expectations, finds anonymity in a secluded small town/village somewhere in Kerala. She moves into a small unkempt apartment which is full of things belonging to a previous mysterious owner who goes by the name ""Charlie"" (Dulquer) the plot of the movie is Tessa falling in love with Charlie - a person whom she has seen only 1 small photograph with a bunch of children and what from she learns about him from the people whose life he has touched and changed.Tessa finds an incomplete comic illustration in the apartment and her initial quest is to simply find out how does the comic end, she meets various characters sketched by Charlie and they in paint an image of Charlie which she slowly starts falling in love with. She eventually does find out how the comic ends, but by that time she is crazy in love with Charlie and meeting him is the only thing that matters in her life.Charlie however is very elusive, and they both don't meet until the climax before which there are a bunch of near misses.Good Things - Parvathy Menon as Tessa , Dulquer as Charlie are good, although all that 24x7 effervescent bubbling portrayal of the ever optimist Charlie does get on your nerves at times. There is a lot of thought into characterization, even the side characters are memorable and give credible performances.Not so good things - The movie is too much sweet at times, which is alright if you are a 17 year old. but mature audiences might end up wanting more emotions from the movie than just feeling awesome all the time. All characters are shown as very positive people in their life - as in there's nothing negative about them - which kinds of makes you feel like you are watching some Utopian movie, and might end up with you mumbling to yourself - this doesn't happen like this in real life at all. I am not a fan Dulquer, but this is his best performance in my opinion, and is a welcome change from the brat,speaking in accent rich man's son with issues portrayal he usually does in his other movie.

9,A feel good movie with a good message,"Charliee...ONe of the most expected Malayalam movies of 2015. Its a fact that people were expecting so much out of Charlie..From the costumes and first look poster of Charlie, all were expecting something like the Nivin Poly starer ""Premam"", or something like that.And its due to this reason, people are not ready to accept the fact that Charlie is a good movie. Movies are always not about, mass entertainment,comedy or tragedy.As I said in the title..Charlie is a feel good movie where, peace,excitement,optimism and moreover..love is promoted. The character portrayed by Dulquer Salman , is the soul of the movie. Undoubtedly its DQ's best performance till date and shows complete confidence and screen presence in the movie. He is of the opinion that..We have to live out our life happily forever. He is ready to turn the sorrows of many people in to happiness...or he is ready to turn the hopes of the people in to a reality. The character played by Parvathy Menon..""Tessa"" is in search of Charlie all throughout the movie..She knows Charlie well from all the people who came across Charlie and she gradually falls in love with ""that idea of being with 'Charlie'"". The credit goes to Martin Prakkat, who has shown extreme skills of craftsmanship in building such a wonderful and joyful movie. I have been noticing many in the social media..trying to degrade the movie. Its a different sort of movie..put in front of Malayali community. Try to see the movie as a feel good movie and please do not expect a ""premam"" or ""moideen"" out of it. Its the best Malayalam movie for me in 2015..and I am ready to watch it again and again... And fellow readers..please do not encourage the degradation of such a wonderful movie. If done so..Charlie will turn itself in to one of the most under-rated Malayalam movies...",feel good movie with good message,charliee one most expected malayalam movies 2015 its fact that people were expecting so much out charlie costumes first look poster charlie all were expecting something like nivin poly starer premam or something like that its due this reason people are not ready accept fact that charlie is good movie movies are always not about mass entertainment comedy or tragedy as i said title charlie is feel good movie where peace excitement optimism moreover love is promoted character portrayed by dulquer salman is soul movie undoubtedly its dqs best performance till date shows complete confidence screen presence movie he is opinion that we have live out our life happily forever he is ready turn sorrows many people happiness or he is ready turn hopes people reality character played by parvathy menon tessa is search charlie all throughout movie she knows charlie well all people who came across charlie she gradually falls love with that idea being with charlie credit goes martin prakkat who has shown extreme skills craftsmanship building such wonderful joyful movie i have been noticing many social media trying degrade movie its different sort movie put front malayali community try see movie as feel good movie please do not expect premam or moideen out it its best malayalam movie me 2015 i am ready watch it again again fellow readers please do not encourage degradation such wonderful movie if done so charlie will turn itself one most under rated malayalam movies,0.52734375,0.4021780303030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"
