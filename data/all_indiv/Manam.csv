9.0,Beautiful love story: Perfect Tribute to the Legendary ANR.,"Manam: Its a perfect befitting farewell to ANR. Right from the first frame to end, Manam is a sure shot entertainer and it entertains you to the core. It is a beautiful and youthful love story that involves rebirth (cosmic balance) as well. What to say about Nag, right from the roles as industrialist, rich landlord and as poor farmer he had immersed perfectly in these roles and has done a impeccable job. He did these roles with so ease like the way he has done for annamayya, ramadasu & shirdi sai.He once again proved that he is a George Clooney of Tollywood.ANR's role is so pivotal in the movie, What can I say about him.100 years cinema History lo 70 years athanide. We should feel proud to have him. The scenes between, ANR, Nag & Chaitanya are the best ever I saw. From the time ANR brought the industry to Hyd to Nag taking it further on to a new age cinema, this is what I called a great Journey. The only sad thing is ANR is not alive to see all this celebration. Thank you Vikram Kumar for showing us entire Akkineni Family in a single frame. There is a standing Ovation at the end in the theater I saw, which I doubt ever happens for a tollywood film. PS Vinod's brilliant cinematography and Anup Rubens' background score are riveting. Lastly one thing I can say is a small, simple & perfect cameo, debut from Akhil AkKineni. #ANRLivesOn #Manam #DejaVu #KingIsBack.",beautiful love story perfect tribute legendary anr,manam its perfect befitting farewell anr right first frame end manam is sure shot entertainer it entertains you core it is beautiful youthful love story that involves rebirth cosmic balance as well what say about nag right roles as industrialist rich landlord as poor farmer he had immersed perfectly these roles has done impeccable job he did these roles with so ease like way he has done annamayya ramadasu shirdi sai he once again proved that he is george clooney tollywood anrs role is so pivotal movie what can i say about him 100 years cinema history lo 70 years athanide we should feel proud have him scenes between anr nag chaitanya are best ever i saw time anr brought industry hyd nag taking it further new age cinema this is what i called great journey only sad thing is anr is not alive see all this celebration thank you vikram kumar showing us entire akkineni family single frame there is standing ovation at end theater i saw which i doubt ever happens tollywood film ps vinods brilliant cinematography anup rubens background score are riveting lastly one thing i can say is small simple perfect cameo debut akhil akkineni,0.701915358946609,0.42223011363636365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Love Reincarnated,"What if you could not keep your promises to your beloved since one life wasn't enough for it? and what if there was something unsaid in your relationship which could have made it better if it had been said? MANAM answers these questions and takes us on a fantastic journey spanning three generations and keeps us spellbound connecting us to all the lead actors in the movie. The movie begins with a tragic & fatal accident of couple Radha mohan (Akkineni Chaitanya) & Krishnaveni (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) while on their way to get a divorce to end their bickering and battering marriage. Nageshwar Rao A.K.A. Bittu (Akkineni Nagarjuna), their son grows up and becomes a business man big enough to land on the Forbes cover. A chance encounter with Nagarjuna (Akkineni Chaitanya) on a flight shocks him and he realizes that it is his father who has been reincarnated. He decides to search for his mother and reunite her with his father and finally meets Priya (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) and gets them together even going to the extent of breaking up Nagarjuna's present relationship with Prema (Rashi Khanna). Out of the blue enters Anjali (Shreya Saran) a doctor who forces Nageshwar rao to help get a patient, a 80-year-old Chaitanya (Akkineni Nageshwar Rao, doing his swan song) to a hospital and also forces him to donate blood. Anjali and Nageshwar Rao find it strange that their hearts keep beating faster when ever they meet each other. The secret is known only to Chaitanya who realizes that both of them are his parents who died tragically when he was kid due to an innocent childish prank played by him. He decides to bring them together. The movie belongs completely to Nagarjuna as he plays the main protagonist Nageshwar Rao as well as Seetharamudu and acts as the connecting link between the two generations in this story. He does the romantic as well as the emotional scenes with equal ease and can still give the younger lot a run for their money. Samantha Ruth Prabhu rules the movie with her ""momma"" act, first as the dejected housewife, next as the caring and bubbly teen who loves to talk and talk. She excels in the prologue as well as the scenes where she remembers her past life and her salsa act was the best in the movie. Shreya Saran does her bit and does it flawlessly as the stammering farmer and the stammering doctor in her present life. The movie takes the term ILOVE YOU to a new level with her story. Akkineni Naga Chaitanya is the surprise package, he really does act in this one. First as the helpless husband to trying to win over his wife and next as the lovelorn boy trying to woo the new love in his life. The death scene showcases the best performance from this actor. Akkineni Nageshwar Rao, notwithstanding the low screen time he has, makes his presence felt and does give some of the finest performances ever on screen, especially the hospital scene where he recognizes his parents and the pre-climax scene. Cameos by Amala Akkineni, Amitabh Bachan and Akkineni Akhil leave you surprised and asking for more.Vikram Kumar has taken tollywood to a new level with this fantasy love story and actually gives us four stories for the price of one and in certain scenes, you are not sure if you are watching a telugu movie or an episode from the TWILIGHT ZONE. His amazing scene to detail down to the cars of that period to the changing fashions of a bygone era is brilliant. The climax sequences chill you and remind you of the FINAL DESTINATION movies. This is one of those movies where you are actually looking at the characters instead of the actors playing them. A role reversal by the three protagonists was really clever along with the names. The movie is loosely based on the Steven Spielberg produced Robert Zemekis Film BACK TO THE FUTURE, but without the time travel. Reincarnation trades places with time travel, although I feel that time travel could have been a better choice too. Dialogues by Harshavardhan are hilarious especially the scene where Priya takes Nageshwar Rao to meet Anjali in the hospital and also each of the characters had some of the best one liners ever devoted to them. Music by Anoop Reubens is good but easily forgettable, anyways people would not remember this movie for its music. After watching this movie, the words I LOVE YOU and LADIES FIRST would in fact change the perception you had of them before watching this movie.",love reincarnated,what if you could not keep your promises your beloved since one life wasnt enough it what if there was something unsaid your relationship which could have made it better if it had been said manam answers these questions takes us fantastic journey spanning three generations keeps us spellbound connecting us all lead actors movie movie begins with tragic fatal accident couple radha mohan akkineni chaitanya krishnaveni samantha ruth prabhu while their way get divorce end their bickering battering marriage nageshwar rao k bittu akkineni nagarjuna their son grows up becomes business man big enough land forbes cover chance encounter with nagarjuna akkineni chaitanya flight shocks him he realizes that it is his father who has been reincarnated he decides search his mother reunite her with his father finally meets priya samantha ruth prabhu gets them together even going extent breaking up nagarjunas present relationship with prema rashi khanna out blue enters anjali shreya saran doctor who forces nageshwar rao help get patient 80 year old chaitanya akkineni nageshwar rao doing his swan song hospital also forces him donate blood anjali nageshwar rao find it strange that their hearts keep beating faster when ever they meet each other secret is known only chaitanya who realizes that both them are his parents who died tragically when he was kid due innocent childish prank played by him he decides bring them together movie belongs completely nagarjuna as he plays main protagonist nageshwar rao as well as seetharamudu acts as connecting link between two generations this story he does romantic as well as emotional scenes with equal ease can still give younger lot run their money samantha ruth prabhu rules movie with her momma act first as dejected housewife next as caring bubbly teen who loves talk talk she excels prologue as well as scenes where she remembers her past life her salsa act was best movie shreya saran does her bit does it flawlessly as stammering farmer stammering doctor her present life movie takes term ilove you new level with her story akkineni naga chaitanya is surprise package he really does act this one first as helpless husband trying win over his wife next as lovelorn boy trying woo new love his life death scene showcases best performance this actor akkineni nageshwar rao notwithstanding low screen time he has makes his presence felt does give some finest performances ever screen especially hospital scene where he recognizes his parents pre climax scene cameos by amala akkineni amitabh bachan akkineni akhil leave you surprised asking more vikram kumar has taken tollywood new level with this fantasy love story actually gives us four stories price one certain scenes you are not sure if you are watching telugu movie or episode twilight zone his amazing scene detail down cars that period changing fashions bygone era is brilliant climax sequences chill you remind you final destination movies this is one those movies where you are actually looking at characters instead actors playing them role reversal by three protagonists was really clever along with names movie is loosely based steven spielberg produced robert zemekis film back future but without time travel reincarnation trades places with time travel although i feel that time travel could have been better choice too dialogues by harshavardhan are hilarious especially scene where priya takes nageshwar rao meet anjali hospital also each characters had some best one liners ever devoted them music by anoop reubens is good but easily forgettable anyways people would not remember this movie its music after watching this movie words i love you ladies first would fact change perception you had them before watching this movie,0.4799051537687903,0.18067017157926246,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,A well crafted Family fantasy,"A story that fits only to Akkineni family and a film that only looks plausible with Telugu viewers. When time and misfortune separates, love and re-incarnation brings and ties them together. Performances were decent but nothing outstanding. Samantha looked more comfortable out of them all. ANR has less screen time but he did enough justice even at that age. Some comedy scenes in first half should have been chopped to move forward to the plot point as fast as it can. But it didn't. So we have to wait till the interval for the main proceedings to happen. Interval and Climax were its strongest points. Vikram Kumar has a classic taste in direction and i want to see his work more in the future. Cinematography was neat and clean but the color tones should have been changed accordingly to bring the contemporary look to the varied time periods. Background score and Prema Prema song are excellent. Even some cinematic clichés are sugar coated with feel good factor and then you can't help but to appreciate and enjoy.Yes.

10.0,A beautiful story,"I loved it. It wasn't the same old thing that Tollywood is now releasing. There were no over dramatic fights or cheesy jokes that weren't funny at all. It a clean cut beautiful story that will melt your heart. I loved the family aspect of this movie. The importance of family and communication and understanding. Nagajurna's character ""Bittu"" was downright adorable. How he yearns for his mom and dad brought tears to my eyes and his love with Sherya was by far the cutest thing ever. The acting was really well done. I have to give props to Sherya, she really killed it. I felt that Chaitanya's acting was a bit dramatic, specially when he was in his collage student phase. All in all, I really really enjoyed this movie. There were so many moments when I was just smiling like an idiot and just being happy with the movie. This is by far the best movie I have seen a while from Tollywood and I hope they keep making more like this.",beautiful story,i loved it it wasnt same old thing that tollywood is now releasing there were no over dramatic fights or cheesy jokes that werent funny at all it clean cut beautiful story that will melt your heart i loved family aspect this movie importance family communication understanding nagajurnas character bittu was downright adorable how he yearns his mom dad brought tears my eyes his love with sherya was by far cutest thing ever acting was really well done i have give props sherya she really killed it i felt that chaitanyas acting was bit dramatic specially when he was his collage student phase all all i really really enjoyed this movie there were so many moments when i was just smiling like idiot just being happy with movie this is by far best movie i have seen while tollywood i hope they keep making more like this,0.6152472527472527,0.2502747252747252,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.2}"
9.0,"Heartwarming, engaging and above all, an endearing film about love and relationships","This is truly a marvelous effort by the Akkineni Family - a movie that, in coming times, will be fondly remembered for its ingenuity, depth and substance.The storyline is not your typical run-of-the-mill type. It is unconventional, demanding and views family relationships from a new, different level. This is a movie about Children, their Parents and the strong bonds between them. It sends out a powerful message that Love lasts forever, and will bring people together, even though certain events have torn them apart. Coming to the performances - in my opinion, everyone played their respective parts very well. Samantha has a pivotal role and she doesn't disappoint. It's a cakewalk for Nagarjuna and ANR - the versatile actors that they are, they excel in all their scenes. And yes, even Shreya has a good role and she carries it out with much grace. The comedy scenes fit well in the movie - MSN, Ali have good roles, though I felt that Brahmanandam could have been given a little more screen time.The background score is outstanding. The songs (except the dance number at the end) add a new dimension to the drama on screen - especially the flashback scenes.The film holds all the elements together very well. You are totally immersed from beginning till end. I thank the Akkineni family for this stellar contribution to Telugu Cinema, one which I'm certain the audience will whole-heartedly embrace and experience.PS : *Watch out for the explosive entry of a new star at the end - one of the best entry scenes I have seen till date.

8.0,Indeed A Classic,"After a spate of Masala blockbusters this year like 'Legend' and 'Race Gurram', Telugu cinema gets a Feel Good entertaining blockbuster which will nestle well in your heart. With the structure going slightly slow in both halves, despite having great moments and having shades of films like 'Classic' (Korean/2006), director Vikram Kumar not only brilliantly casts the Akkineni family in this re-incarnation theme based film, but it's his well-layered hyperlink narrative, along with the songs (well-composed by Anoop Rubens) used as narrative device and the cinematography by P.S. Vinod that add ultimate grace in the film. The performances are riveting, including the usual comic timing by Brahmi and MS Narayana. Veteran actor ANR gives a graces the screen with his performance in his last film. Shreya and Samantha are equally good. Nagarjuna and Naga Chaitanya both share an amazing chemistry on screen.

6.0,"I liked this film and it was wonderful to see a legend, ANR for the last time on silver screen.","I liked this film and it was wonderful to see a legend, ANR for the last time on silver screen.The screenplay, though inspired is well written to adapt to the nativity of Telugu audiences. Thankfully, I did not take my brain inside the movie theater, so I just went with the flow and reacted for whatever was happening, without thinking anything. So I could appreciate some genuine feelings which made me feel for the characters.Produced by Akkineni Family, this films uses many things about them, from their names to fitting whole of the family in a frame. Nagarjuna as a surprise acted well and was the best among the lot. He showcased his skills very effortlessly and he just went along with the flow. I cannot remember even one dialog which I thought was out of place or uncalled for. Dialogues between ANR and Naga Chaitanya were a bit overboard I felt.The film is not devoid of flaws, it has some huge and big holes. But, all those can be forgiven if the sheer effort of writing down this piece and putting all the pieces together are considered. Nagarjuna again proved to be a good producer who wishes to take challenges and it was heartening to see this script having such a huge cast. It's an experiment in Telugu Film Industry and I am happy it has paid off. It involves multiple flashbacks and the same people wearing different characters. It would have been really tough had this been complicated. This was a very simplified and spoon-fed screenplay and that's the reason I believe it worked. Of all the stories that were put in, I liked the story of Seeta (Nagarjuna) and Rama (Shriya) in the village. That was a real treat in the film. A 3/5 for a film that I liked and I hope to see such endeavors being encouraged in Telugu Film Industry.Just a spoiler, please watch the film ""Back To The Future"" which I believe is a huge inspiration for this film.",i liked this film it was wonderful see legend anr last time silver screen,i liked this film it was wonderful see legend anr last time silver screen screenplay though inspired is well written adapt nativity telugu audiences thankfully i did not take my brain inside movie theater so i just went with flow reacted whatever was happening without thinking anything so i could appreciate some genuine feelings which made me feel characters produced by akkineni family this films uses many things about them their names fitting whole family frame nagarjuna as surprise acted well was best among lot he showcased his skills very effortlessly he just went along with flow i cannot remember even one dialog which i thought was out place or uncalled dialogues between anr naga chaitanya were bit overboard i felt film is not devoid flaws it has some huge big holes but all those can be forgiven if sheer effort writing down this piece putting all pieces together are considered nagarjuna again proved be good producer who wishes take challenges it was heartening see this script having such huge cast its experiment telugu film industry i am happy it has paid off it involves multiple flashbacks same people wearing different characters it would have been really tough had this been complicated this was very simplified spoon fed screenplay thats reason i believe it worked all stories that were put i liked story seeta nagarjuna rama shriya village that was real treat film 3 5 film that i liked i hope see such endeavors being encouraged telugu film industry just spoiler please watch film back future which i believe is huge inspiration this film,0.5115873015873017,0.2587301587301587,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9.0,A Treat,"The movie is story strong with characters built around. It is boring during the titles but picks up superbly, a little predictable here n there. First half is good, interval touch is nice. Second half also goes well, but is boring in parts. Movie is tightly scripted and directed, all minute details were taken care of. ANR was limited but was awesome for his age, Nag was good as usual and Chaitu was cool. Scenes with all three were interesting and they all did well. Samantha and Shreya were as required. Brahmi n Ali were a come-n-go, but the comedy was by the lead characters. Direction stands out, Vikram was real good, few things could have been taken care of. DOP was great, very colorful. Production values were awesome. On a whole, the movie is a treat to watch, if u can ignore few boring parts.

,Above-average Mainstream Romantic Drama,"For once, the hype is warranted. The trailers did a disservice to this flick for sure, since they did not motivate me to watch it, but boy am I glad I did, that too with my dad on father's day. The fact that this has 3 generations of actors leading the setup is incidental, though it helps, and it is indeed ironic noting the applicability of the lines written for the characters, versus the real- life personas of the celebrity family members portraying them, and its surprising that the overwhelming feeling is something nice, rather than something typically overdone, which this could've devolved into quickly. Due credit to the writer/helmer for not succumbing to such temptation.One more point of note - each frame looks prefect. The skill of the cinematographer and the production designer (and the art designer) should be placed on a pedestal for this one, since the look of the movie, even during the period sequences, is almost perfect. It never calls attention to itself, which is a feat by itself.Considering the loops the tale goes through, another aspect that the helmer needs to be appreciated for is the attention paid to details like individual character quirks. In each iteration, there is a callback to each of those, that act as a refresher to the audience as well, and bring a smile to the lips. Small details like the ones highlighted here are lost, more often than not, and a nitpicking critic dwells on them to no avail. Good news is that this flick tries hard to address each one of those, and is successful more often than not, that I am tempted to overlook those instances in which it fails.The performances are all way above-average, and befitting a work such as this, and this plays as a perfect swan-song to the dearly departed acting juggernaut of the yesteryear, Akkinneni Nageswar Rao. His latter generation heirs in acting can never quite reach that pinnacle, as evidenced by their body of work, but the goal is quite lofty, so one cannot fault them either, since all of them do serviceable jobs (except for the one in the quite needless cameo).The music is hummable too, and I'm quite glad to note that the technical aspects highlight themselves subtle in a piece of work that could have gotten know more for the presence of a thespian and his family rather than anything else.Definitely worth a watch on the big screen, with your family, perhaps even more than once. Tollywood's best this year for sure.",above average mainstream romantic drama,once hype is warranted trailers did disservice this flick sure since they did not motivate me watch it but boy am i glad i did that too with my dad fathers day fact that this has 3 generations actors leading setup is incidental though it helps it is indeed ironic noting applicability lines written characters versus real life personas celebrity family members portraying them its surprising that overwhelming feeling is something nice rather than something typically overdone which this couldve devolved into quickly due credit writer helmer not succumbing such temptation one more point note each frame looks prefect skill cinematographer production designer art designer should be placed pedestal this one since look movie even during period sequences is almost perfect it never calls attention itself which is feat by itself considering loops tale goes through another aspect that helmer needs be appreciated is attention paid details like individual character quirks each iteration there is callback each those that act as refresher audience as well bring smile lips small details like ones highlighted here are lost more often than not nitpicking critic dwells them no avail good news is that this flick tries hard address each one those is successful more often than not that i am tempted overlook those instances which it fails performances are all way above average befitting work such as this this plays as perfect swan song dearly departed acting juggernaut yesteryear akkinneni nageswar rao his latter generation heirs acting can never quite reach that pinnacle as evidenced by their body work but goal is quite lofty so one cannot fault them either since all them do serviceable jobs except one quite needless cameo music is hummable too im quite glad note that technical aspects highlight themselves subtle piece work that could have gotten know more presence thespian his family rather than anything else definitely worth watch big screen with your family perhaps even more than once tollywoods best this year sure,0.4940568475452197,0.21821705426356588,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.47}"

It's one of the best-written movies in recent times, this one is easily both intriguing and entertaining - something that is rare for a Telugu film in recent times.
