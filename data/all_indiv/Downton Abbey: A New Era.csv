10.0,Brings all our favorite characters together again in interesting circumstances. Fans will love what's in store in this new film.,"The Crawley family returns once more! Downton Abbey: A New Era brings all our favorite characters together again in interesting circumstances. Fans will love what's in store in this new film.Downton Abbey: A New Era focuses on the secret past of the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith). She comes into possession of a property in the South of France. Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and his family head to France to investigate why the villa was given to his mother. Meanwhile back at Downton, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) hosts a crew of filmmakers and actors who use the estate as a set for their new film.It's so incredible to return to the Downton Abbey era and the Crawley family. Each one is out of their comfort zone in this new movie, which is absolutely hilarious. Lady Mary becomes a voice actress temporarily and seeing Robert hate the film crew for taking over his property is as funny as possible. The Crawleys have seen the times change and preparing for cinema to take over is amazing. It makes audiences realize how this generation saw life change so rapidly. Tom Branson (Allen Leech) is happily married and some new couples flourish in the film too. It's beautiful to see how much the characters have changed since the first time we met them in 2010. This movie focuses on relationships and characters that we haven't seen that often. It's refreshing to watch the pure relationship Daisy (Sophia McShera) and Andrew (Michael Fox) have and I loved watching fan-favorite Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) chase her love. The wardrobe is as spectacular as ever, even adding some Victorian pieces for the film being madet at Downton. The comedy is brilliant and cunning, reminding us why we love Violet as much as we do.There are many messages to take away here. Lady Mary learns to embrace the new era of filmmaking and life as she gets out of her comfort zone and realizes that it's okay to try new things. Lord Grantham learns that, even though being Earl and having property is a big part of his life, it is not everything. He realizes how important his family is to him.I give Downton Abbey: A New Era 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18 plus adults. It releases in theaters May 18, 2022.

,The Downton mystique is alive and well. And the cinematography is superb.,"High-class soap-opera-like Downton Abbey: A New Era should be called what it really is: high-class melodrama. Here is a rambling story with too many characters, but who cares? Because it's told so well with each character clearly defined and loveable.After the binge-worthy six-sessions TV series in the early 2010's, the 2019 film, with its visit from royalty, held up well enough to spawn this sequel, Downton Abbey: A New Era, in which the aristocratic Crawley family is crawling into the 1930's, with The Great Depression, wars, and innovations imminent. The film creates a vitality even in a staid Brit world largely because of a robust screenplay and spot-on actors. Not to forget drone shots of the impossibly cinematic estate.In fact, no melodramatic villain appears, if you exclude the arch-disturber, Change. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis have crafted a rousing fable about a new era as it approaches the third decade of the 20th century through the lens of a visiting Hollywood production to the Abbey.Marry that modern incursion to the hidebound Brit tradition and you have a sentimental farewell to the old world, signified by the sharp-witted Dowager Countess Violet (Maggie Smith), who is ready to pass the estate and a newly-added villa in the south of France to the younger Granthams. A formidable subplot is the change the Hollywood production itself must face as sound trounces silent movies and same-sex relationships emerge, galaxies away from our modern acceptance of sexual orientations.The most moving scene is when the production learns it has to create a sound track in order to continue filming. Watching them sync the sound (dubbing so to speak) to the actors for the first time since they saw Jolson say a few words in The Jazz Singer is just as if we were in a time machine witnessing that monumental change almost 100 years ago.Downton Abbey is a state of mind, not a place, where our dreams of upper-class blissful isolation clash with the realities of life both for the rich and the poor. Throughout is a benign sense of humanity's essential goodness and our common bonds. Cinema has brought us together in time and sympathy-see A New Era in a theater with its glorious visuals and commanding sound-We've come a long way, Baby.",downton mystique is alive well cinematography is superb,high class soap opera like downton abbey new era should be called what it really is high class melodrama here is rambling story with too many characters but who cares because its told so well with each character clearly defined loveable after binge worthy six sessions tv series early 2010s 2019 film with its visit royalty held up well enough spawn this sequel downton abbey new era which aristocratic crawley family is crawling into 1930s with great depression wars innovations imminent film creates vitality even staid brit world largely because robust screenplay spot actors not forget drone shots impossibly cinematic estate fact no melodramatic villain appears if you exclude arch disturber change writer julian fellowes director simon curtis have crafted rousing fable about new era as it approaches third decade 20th century through lens visiting hollywood production abbey marry that modern incursion hidebound brit tradition you have sentimental farewell old world signified by sharp witted dowager countess violet maggie smith who is ready pass estate newly added villa south france younger granthams formidable subplot is change hollywood production itself must face as sound trounces silent movies same sex relationships emerge galaxies away our modern acceptance sexual orientations most moving scene is when production learns it has create sound track order continue filming watching them sync sound dubbing so speak actors first time since they saw jolson say few words jazz singer is just as if we were time machine witnessing that monumental change almost 100 years ago downton abbey is state mind not place where our dreams upper class blissful isolation clash with realities life both rich poor throughout is benign sense humanitys essential goodness our common bonds cinema has brought us together time sympathy see new era theater with its glorious visuals commanding sound weve come long way baby,0.4234022953790395,0.14998691231249375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,A Masterpiece Can't wait for the 3rd film,"The title of ""Downton Abbey: A New Era"" pledges that change has arrived at the Grantham family's mansion after six seasons of television, a previous film and a zeitgeist shift that has caused a chunk of the show's original audience to start regarding its characters' generational wealth with disgust and relish, as though it were a wheel of rotten Stilton. The stately series that began its story with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 has now arrived at the tail end of the 1920s. The choppy waters of modernity are materializing on the horizon. To stay afloat, this amiable sequel decides to ever so slightly democratize itself: The upstairs-downstairs division that has long separated the estate's masters from their servants begins to leak. So does Downton Abbey's roof, which motivates Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) to rent the cash-poor estate to a team shooting a silent film - makers of ""kin-ema,"" as Lady Mary's father, Robert (Hugh Bonneville), calls it, disdainfully mispronouncing the name of the art form. (The moviemaking plot point may have been inspired by real life: The franchise's shooting location, Highclere Castle, which resembles a vampire bat's underbite, opened its doors to the show after Geordie Herbert, the Eighth Earl of Carnarvon and Queen Elizabeth II's godson, realized that dozens of its rooms were rotting.) Downton Abbey: A New Era takes us back to those familiar faces, but it's clear from the first bars of that gorgeous, rousing theme music that things are a little different this time around. The establishing shots of the house and the surrounding estate make the place seem so stately and grand that I actually gasped when I beheld them. The 2019 film was directed by Michael Engler, who has spent more than 25 years helming episodes of TV shows like My So-Called Life, Sex and the City, and, yes, Downton Abbey. Not, I hasten to add, that there's anything wrong with that. There were some excellent sequences in the first film, especially its dynamic opening scene. But it looked like an episode of television, specifically an extended episode of Downton Abbey., the acting, the emotion of the film was the best I've seen since the first episode of Downton Abbey in 2010.Thank you Maggie Smith.",masterpiece cant wait 3rd film,title downton abbey new era pledges that change has arrived at grantham familys mansion after six seasons television previous film zeitgeist shift that has caused chunk shows original audience start regarding its characters generational wealth with disgust relish as though it were wheel rotten stilton stately series that began its story with sinking titanic 1912 has now arrived at tail end 1920s choppy waters modernity are materializing horizon stay afloat this amiable sequel decides ever so slightly democratize itself upstairs downstairs division that has long separated estates masters their servants begins leak so does downton abbeys roof which motivates lady mary michelle dockery rent cash poor estate team shooting silent film makers kin ema as lady marys father robert hugh bonneville calls it disdainfully mispronouncing name art form moviemaking plot point may have been inspired by real life franchises shooting location highclere castle which resembles vampire bats underbite opened its doors show after geordie herbert eighth earl carnarvon queen elizabeth iis godson realized that dozens its rooms were rotting downton abbey new era takes us back those familiar faces but its clear first bars that gorgeous rousing theme music that things are little different this time around establishing shots house surrounding estate make place seem so stately grand that i actually gasped when i beheld them 2019 film was directed by michael engler who has spent more than 25 years helming episodes tv shows like my so called life sex city yes downton abbey not i hasten add that theres anything wrong with that there were some excellent sequences first film especially its dynamic opening scene but it looked like episode television specifically extended episode downton abbey acting emotion film was best ive seen since first episode downton abbey 2010 thank you maggie smith,0.407820136852395,0.12909335288367546,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.27}"

9.0,"An Iconic Movie For the New Era, But Has A Lot Crammed In","LIKES:It's Fun: I may not be the biggest drama lover in terms of many movies, but something about Downton Abbey makes for an exception for me. The British humor works on wetting the dry dialogue, and the antics of the high nobility really are entertaining for me and my fellow audience member. The two stories present in this film play well with each other, and the constant back and forth exchange keeps things balanced between exciting drama and the usual sad tones this family faces. It kept the pace moving for much of the film, and I quite liked how many laughs and smiles filled my face in the adventures to be had.The Setting: This show has always been excellent in the setting it chooses to film in, and this New Era, is no exception. The second film takes us back to the familiar grounds and rooms of the palace, making the fantasies real as the Abbey's life unfolds before you. Luscious lawns, immaculate rooms add that royal experience to the movie, while adding the servant quarters and farms grounds the fantasy element and gives you those times. The Chateaux is just as beautiful, a new venue that adds a different environment to enjoy, and potentially a new stage to play with in the future installments. Those who appreciate the splendor of the European country sides are in for a treat with this one.The Story : Fans of the series expect the continuing lore to be rich, deep, and tackle the issues that make life, and the drama genre, engaging to immerse ourselves in. For the most part, it succeeds well in this endeavor of ushering the audience into the new age of legacy without sacrificing the fun to be had. Old plot points and gimmicks from the past series resurface again and are used well, helping to please the old fans that their investment is not lost. However, new elements await to be explored, with a few twists to mix things up that Downton has done so well in years past. I applaud the writers for this balance, making sure to have happy and sad crisscrossing in hopes of keeping so many emotions going strong.The Presentation: As I said with the story, the presentation is the key to enjoying the tales the director and staff cooked up for us. This second film does a nice job of bouncing between the two main stories, keeping the plots of both running in tandem and yet mostly avoiding getting stock in any repetitive moments. What's nice is the multiple components of each story, and how they managed to shine lights on each as the tale continued to keep things fresh and only circle back when necessary. Though you might feel the answers are going nowhere, in truth they are and these little peeks into each life helps keep things feeling new and fresh, all while keeping as many character in the light as possible.The Music: A friend of mine talked about how Downton Abbey uses its music well to boost the emotion, but yet keep you calm with the soothing tones. You are in luck, for the score accomplishes much in this film to inject some life and design into the film and alleviate the pressure of the sadder moments. The standard orchestral work is very peaceful, classy and upscale to be fitting of background music that keeps you just in the mood of British drama. However, there are other times where the entertainment brings their own brand of music, giving you a little more pep in the step as the fun of the moment begins. It's wonderful all around, and again very fitting for the sequences chosen to surely strengthen the overall presence of the movie.The Acting: The strongest component for me, Downton Abbey's acting has always been the keystone of success to the franchise. Everyone again hits their mark for characters, really bringing the characters to life and making the feel realistic and relatable. They handle the issues quite well, and I felt the reactions humane, filled with life and sensations, rather than cardboard cutting acting. The way they deliver the lines, the way they get into their interactions, and the way they feel the emotion of the moment is super powerful to watch. I wish I could comment on them all, but that would take too much room, so I'm going to talk the top billed stars quickly. Bonneville is not quite the centerpiece of the film, but nevertheless handles the new roles and twists with the same composure and craft you love, but having those emotional ties you want in this film. Jim Carter is hilarious, the funniest of the bunch and still the driving force to both the serious and dry comedy the series is famous for having. Yet Michelle Dockery takes the cake for best performance for me, her jump into the fires of taking on the household having much more dynamic than expected in this film She's funny, elegant, and deep, really integrating well with all the cast and holding many story threads together with such top-notch acting.DISLIKES:The Pace At Times: There are times where Downton Abbey as a movie seems off in its pace, proving how the series was the better approach for handling all the characters. At times the moment seems to drag out, a very bloated conversation that you get the gist of in two minutes but takes six instead. Other times, you are expecting deeper moments that pull the full deck of emotional cards out, but are cut to the barebones and sort of robbing the scene of the full glory. Fortunately the other elements help weather the uneven pace for the most part, but other times are a bit too noticeable to be ignored.A Bit Predictable: Most of the moments are very easy to predict what will happen, with very big foreshadowing happening well in the first thirty minutes. If you are a fan of the series, or you keep your ears open, most of these moments are easy to figure out what is going to happen by the end of the two hour runtime. However, I will admit there are a few curveballs thrown into the mix to keep you guessing of the old bait and switch routine that again help blunt the easy to know nature.Hasty Tie Ups Remember when I said the pace seems a bit off? This is the component where you really feel it, or at least I felt it during my viewing. A New Era brings a lot of things to the table in its attempt to balance old and new legacies together. And while the balance if fun and complete, it's also a bit hasty in how things sort of tie up compared to the show. I know, there is a lot more time in each season to flesh out details and find that epic way to do the story, but the first movie did not feel as crammed and quick natured to tell the story they wanted to tell. Some big moments sort of seem to just happen and sadly I wanted more of the Abbey magic to shine in this particular installment.Ending Jump: The events of the end happen very fast, leading to a lot of potential for the future of the series to leap from in the next installment. However, a time jump like they chose in this film was not the way I wanted the ending of the series to go, as the stories they had right before the jump could have been fascinating to explore. In addition, the jump seems rather pointless for all the other tales, with only one small subplot coming to fruition and executing the symbology of the moment. It's not that it is lame or distasteful, it's just not the ending I think the series could have chosen given the masterpiece in the past.The VERDICT The second installment is a wonderful addition to the Abbey legacy, offering the same quality bones that made the series so famous to begin with. All the setting and music brings that etiquette and drama you love, with plenty of fun, new arms of the story, and new venues for our cast to play in helping keep things balanced. Whatever tales you like of old or new, the acting is certainly on point to bring that amazing award-winning feeling that you all love with this series. The main issue I have with the film, is that there is a lot of stuff pushed into the film, and the uneven pacing to get it all done seemed a little off balance to not deliver the full potential of the film. Still... the movie is a solid viewing experience in the theater and certainly worth checking out at home for fans of this genre, or even bigger fans of the series. My scores for the New Era are:Drama/Romance: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0.",iconic movie new era but has lot crammed,likes its fun i may not be biggest drama lover terms many movies but something about

10.0,What a Gorgeous Film!,"Yes, gorgeous, a wonderful British cast (who look like they had great fun along the way), and no shoot-outs, car chases, daft monsters, witches, hobgoblins, or nutters running amok, but a great script that skilfully juggles 2 stories, one at Downton, one on the Riviera.There's a wedding, a proposal, a birth, and sadly a death (that won't be a surprise to longterm fans) but it's all wonderfully handled - and a few of the servants show some hitherto hidden talents, as indeed does one of the 'above-stairs' crowd. Just about all the cast gets a moment in the spotlight -- some, quite a few! -- and there are lots of great lines to savour, one of our favourite bits was Maud choosing a straw hat for Carson (wearing a bowler in the extreme Riviera heat!) and the shop assistant referring to ""your husband"", which he IS of course in real life, but their social strata in the play are miles apart!! {She giggles going out of the shop}.Just a joy to watch, and though at least one reviewer refers to ""end of the road"", and ""dotting Is, crossing Ts"", I wouldn't be certain to rule out a further film, after all there are quite a few of the cast who are not that old, and the 1930s as they move towards WW2 could have some interesting stories to tell?Given the absolute joy of watching this one, let's hope they CAN do another one?!",what gorgeous film,yes gorgeous wonderful british cast who look like they had great fun along way no shoot outs car chases daft monsters witches hobgoblins or nutters running amok but great script that skilfully juggles 2 stories one at downton one riviera theres wedding proposal birth sadly death that wont be surprise longterm fans but its all wonderfully handled few servants show some hitherto hidden talents as indeed does one above stairs crowd just about all cast gets moment spotlight some quite few there are lots great lines savour one our favourite bits was maud choosing straw hat carson wearing bowler extreme riviera heat shop assistant referring your husband which he is course real life but their social strata play are miles apart she giggles going out shop just joy watch though at least one reviewer refers end road dotting is crossing ts i wouldnt be certain rule out further film after all there are quite few cast who are not that old 1930s as they move towards ww2 could have some interesting stories tell given absolute joy watching this one lets hope they can do another one,0.49313186813186805,0.2790750915750915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Hits the right notes,"Fans of the tv show and earlier film will get the most out of this, with plenty of dangling plot threads deftly picked up and woven into a satisfying series of resolutions.There's plenty of strongly emotional moments here. It plays like one of the Christmas specials but more so, and combines an appropriately high stakes 19th century historical family mystery with an examination of an industry on the cusp of a revolution, as metaphor for Downton and the Crawleys doing their best to survive in a changing world. Hints are given how they will manage it.This is not the place to start with Downton, and the movie assumes wise viewers know that. With so many characters, with so much history, the audience are given not so much introductions as little reminders.As is traditional, Maggie Smith gets most of the best lines, but there are no weak performances.

9.0,I love being British,"I haven't watch the TV series outside a few random episodes I walked in on but this movie still managed to engage me right from the start. The humour is great, the acting is phenomenal and there are many emotional moments throughout the film. This film makes me proud to be British.It's a perfect example on how to do strong female characters. For some reason Hollywood's method to creating strong female characters is just give them characteristics typically associated with men. This film manages to have strong female characters while actually keeping them female. Not only that but it's also the perfect example on how to include gay characters without it feeling forced.I love that this is a film about making a film. I especially love how the film basically pokes fun at the entire industry. As someone who has worked on film sets, this movie perfectly depicts the behind the scenes of filmmaking. The sound guy in this movie is my favourite character since I have met many sound guys and they pretty much all act in the exact same way he does.",i love being british,i havent watch tv series outside few random episodes i walked but this movie still managed engage me right start humour is great acting is phenomenal there are many emotional moments throughout film this film makes me proud be british its perfect example how do strong female characters some reason hollywoods method creating strong female characters is just give them characteristics typically associated with men this film manages have strong female characters while actually keeping them female not only that but its also perfect example how include gay characters without it feeling forced i love that this is film about making film i especially love how film basically pokes fun at entire industry as someone who has worked film sets this movie perfectly depicts behind scenes filmmaking sound guy this movie is my favourite character since i have met many sound guys they pretty much all act exact same way he does,0.485892857142857,0.2583928571428572,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,An enjoyable era...,"The film's slow start had me believing that I wasn't going to like it very much, but once it found its mojo, it sucked me in and had me intrigued in the story.My enjoyment of the film came from the storyline of a movie being created within the movie. It made me giddy watching a silent film be transformed into a talkie and it made so glad to see it. The overall story was just as intriguing causing a few rumours along the way. While the end result was relatively clear early on it was still a fun watch.As with the first film this one contains an amazing score, beautiful costume design, and gorgeous cinematography. The acting was superb along with the convincing dialogue. I was gladly sucked into the era.I don't know how ""Downton"" fans will find the film. With amount of women present during my showing and the laughter they produced along with a few shed tears, it appeared that it was well received. I found myself getting emotional as well because it touched a nerve with a real life experience I had.Overall, a fantastic ""Downton"" sequel in my eyes. I loved the visuals and sound along with the story. The acting was great too. I would definitely recommend seeing this film if you enjoyed the first film.Thank you for reading my review.
