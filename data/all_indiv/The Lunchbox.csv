9.0,Mixes food and romance in a very appealing combination,"An old saying repeated in Ritesh Batra's charming The Lunchbox is that sometimes the wrong train will bring you to the right station. In this case, however, the train turns out to be a dabba (lunchbox), wrongly delivered by a dabbawala to a middle-aged government claims adjuster on the brink of retirement. It works out well even though, in reality, with about 5,000 dabbawalas in the city of Mumbai who deliver more than 130,000 lunch boxes each day, they rarely make a mistake. Written by Stefan Tomke in the mode of You Got Mail, Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a young housewife dutifully prepares a lunch for her emotionally distant husband every day and has it sent to him via the courier.On the advice of her upstairs Auntie, Mrs. Deshpande (Bharati Achreka), Ila tries to have her husband notice her by putting more spice in the food. When it is wrongly delivered to Saajan (Irrfan Khan, Life of Pi), however, a series of unintended consequences unfold. What begins with a short note from Sajaan to Ila that ""the food was salty today"" develops into a series of exchanges passed back and forth in the lunchbox everyday in which the two open up to each other about their lives, memories, and their hopes and dreams for the future. A subplot involving Aslam Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), an aggressively upbeat successor to Sajaan, adds a touch of humor to the proceedings but also serves to draw a contrast between himself and the grumpy Saajan.Both Aslam and Sajaan become more endearing, however, as the film progresses. While the ending may thwart expectations if you are used to having all the pieces neatly fit together, The Lunchbox mixes food and romance in a very appealing combination, removing any doubt that Ila and Sajaan have moved to a new level. Impeccably acted and beautifully realized, the film provides an honest appreciation of what it is like to live in Mumbai without exploiting its poverty for Western audiences. Though the wrong train may indeed bring you to the right station, ultimately there is no wrong train and no right station. As The Lunchbox demonstrates, there is just the train and the journey, and it's all perfect.",mixes food romance very appealing combination,old saying repeated ritesh batras charming lunchbox is that sometimes wrong train will bring you right station this case however train turns out be dabba lunchbox wrongly delivered by dabbawala middle aged government claims adjuster brink retirement it works out well even though reality with about 5 000 dabbawalas city mumbai who deliver more than 130 000 lunch boxes each day they rarely make mistake written by stefan tomke mode you got mail ila nimrat kaur young housewife dutifully prepares lunch her emotionally distant husband every day has it sent him via courier advice her upstairs auntie mrs deshpande bharati achreka ila tries have her husband notice her by putting more spice food when it is wrongly delivered saajan irrfan khan life pi however series unintended consequences unfold what begins with short note sajaan ila that food was salty today develops into series exchanges passed back forth lunchbox everyday which two open up each other about their lives memories their hopes dreams future subplot involving aslam shaikh nawazuddin siddiqui aggressively upbeat successor sajaan adds touch humor proceedings but also serves draw contrast between himself grumpy saajan both aslam sajaan become more endearing however as film progresses while ending may thwart expectations if you are used having all pieces neatly fit together lunchbox mixes food romance very appealing combination removing any doubt that ila sajaan have moved new level impeccably acted beautifully realized film provides honest appreciation what it is like live mumbai without exploiting its poverty western audiences though wrong train may indeed bring you right station ultimately there is no wrong train no right station as lunchbox demonstrates there is just train journey its all perfect,0.5665321165321164,0.17368374868374864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,Tightrope walk between heartwarming and heartbreaking,"""The Lunchbox"" is one of these films that are so great that it's almost impossible to put into words why they are that good. You just have to experience them. I'll give it a try though. The film centers around a lonely widower who, thanks to coincidence, has two strangers enter and enrich his life that may or may not have an impact on him in the future. The factor of coincidence is a very crucial one here as these happenings depict perfectly how one random thing happening can change your life forever. Often you can't even force it, you just have to hope for it to happen. The lunchbox simply could have gotten addressed correctly or the new employee could have tried his luck at another company and nothing from the action we were so lucky to see would have happened.But back to the film: It's Ritesh Batra's first directorial effort for a full feature after a few short films, which makes the final result even more impressive. I was shocked to hear that India decided to submit another movie as the entry to the Foreign Language category at next year's Academy Awards. I haven't seen that one (yet) though, so no further elaboration on it, except I'd be quite surprised if I end up liking their choice as much as ""The Lunchbox"". Indian cinema is one of not too many areas that I'm not too familiar with. I've seen ""Slumdog Millionaire"" of course and ""Gandhi"", but that's pretty much all I can say. Anyway, if the level of ""The Lunchbox"" is the one several Indian films deliver these days, I can't wait to get more into the matter. I especially liked Irrfan Khan (with ""Life of Pi"" and Slumdog Millionaire"" recently under his belt probably the biggest star from his country right now internationally) as a lonesome widower who did so much with so little and should easily be a contender for Best Actor of the Year at the next Oscars, but obviously he won't be. In Khan's shadow, Nimrat Kaur, who's surprisingly new to the film industry, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a likable pain in the neck shine as well.The other great strength of the movie besides its lead actor is the writing. The film is packed from start to finish with dialog that so fits the tone and situation and a large number of symbolisms that will impossibly leave you cold. At least that's what I can tell for me and most of the audience sitting in my viewing. You don't have to have lost your wife as well to feel the lead character's bitterness and despair early on in the film, to feel his loneliness in one of the most populated cities on Earth. But the film is far from being emotional torture porn. It's sometimes genuinely funny, namely in those parts where both lead characters communicate with their most important person (the colleague, the upstairs neighbor) and even if these obviously have a great deal of problems as well, including loneliness or taking care of a very sick partner for 15 years, these interactions result in very entertaining situations. The scene with the chili in the basket was hilarious and brought some great comic relief that moment.And that was only one of many smart scenes that perfectly display the characters' emotions or state of minds. You can also mention the children in the yard and how they interact with Khan's character, the ventilator metaphor (with the people below them and their similarities, coma patient and office worker) which may very well be the greatest symbolism I've seen in theaters all year. Another great scene is the moment in which his new colleague invite Khan's character and he rejects the invitation for the same evening as he's so deep down in his shell he needs preparation time for such a seemingly normal event. Very authentic display and that is exactly the way it is. Then there's the scene where he asks him to be his best man, scenes in which he watches the old shows his wife loved or a scene in which he makes a joke and you can see the impact of loneliness on his ability to make jokes or the empty lunchbox after the unsuccessful meeting, the aging without realizing... And there's many more scenes I didn't mention that made the movie the most wonderful experience for me. ""The Lunchbox"" is one of the saddest films of the year and, at the same time, one of the best, probably my number 2 of 2013 at this point.I'm not sure if there's a movie where I would say that if you liked this, you'll have a great time watching ""The Lunchbox"" as well. The closest I can think of is ""Lost in Translation"", which has some parallels, even if, compared to the Coppola movie, all the interaction here happens merely in written form. The ending is pretty good too. It was not entirely happy the way I hoped it would be, no big emotional bang like for ""Lost in Translation"", but still it was in a way uplifting and maybe more realistic and puts a smile on your lips. And you can speculate nicely how things will go from there.So to sum it all up, I really really loved ""The Lunchbox"". I was always curious about the next note the two would exchange and it probably could have run for at least another hour to meet the extreme length of many Indian films these days and I wouldn't have been bored a bit. It doesn't have spectacular music or dancing as you may know it from a few Indian films these days, but it does have many sequences with very tasty food. Is there something I criticize about this film? Actually there is: the fact that I missed watching it at the premiere with the cast and director around.

8.0,Quite touching and sad....,"In Mumbai (formerly 'Bombay'), India, there is a very complex network of 5000 Dabbawallahs. Their job is to arrive at the homes of Indian workers to get homemade lunches from the wives and transport them all over the city so that the men can have hot, home-cooked meals every day. Then, after lunch, they collect all the empty lunch pails and deliver them to the wives. Despite this being a logistical nightmare, the meals get delivered to the right person all the time with very, very few mistakes—carried by hand and on bicycles and scooters by mostly illiterate men! With the movie Dabba, a mistake amazingly happens and a wife's meal arrives for a total stranger instead of her husband. At first, the man doesn't realize he's eating another man's lunch—he just thinks the restaurant that delivers his lunch box has suddenly improved! However, once the wife realizes her mistake, she sends the next meal along with a note explaining the mix-up—and soon the pair begin exchanging letters. At first, they are quite simple and formal. Later, they become much more complicated, as by now the wife has realized that her husband has been cheating—and this total stranger becomes her confidante. All during this long exchange of letters, the woman CONTINUES sending lunches to this stranger and they forge an odd friendship! There's far more to the film than this—see it yourself and you'll see what I mean.Dabba is the sort of film Hollywood could never make. Part of it is, of course, because there is no comparable lunch system in the States. Part of it, too, is that the film does NOT have a perfect happy ending and it doesn't follow a typical formula. There is a lot of sadness and longing and the film leaves you with this, as it's not afraid to leave the audience slightly dissatisfied. Now I am NOT complaining—but Hollywood films seem to have an implicit understanding that everything must be resolved perfectly before a movie can end. Not so with Dabba. This might upset some viewers, but it shouldn't—it's still a very good movie. Plus, a 'Hollywoodized' ending would have been far less realistic. And, as far as realism goes, this Indian film is not typical of a Bollywood flick either. While it was directed and written by an Indian, Ritesh Batra, and stars Indian actors (Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur), it is also a French/German co-production. As such, it lacks the usual song and dance numbers you find in most Indian films and is only a little over an hour and a half (most Indian films are considerably longer—often twice as long or longer). Instead following convention, the film is all about realism. It makes for a nice change of pace even if the ending will be vaguely unsatisfying to many viewers. Worth seeing as long as you don't demand formula. And, worth seeing as long as you don't mind reading subtitles. A film that is truly unique and the acting is really lovely.",quite touching sad,mumbai formerly bombay india there is very complex network 5000 dabbawallahs their job is arrive at homes indian workers get homemade lunches wives transport them all over city so that men can have hot home cooked meals every day then after lunch they collect all empty lunch pails deliver them wives despite this being logistical nightmare meals get delivered right person all time with very very few mistakes carried by hand bicycles scooters by mostly illiterate men with movie dabba mistake amazingly happens wifes meal arrives total stranger instead her husband at first man doesnt realize hes eating another mans lunch he just thinks restaurant that delivers his lunch box has suddenly improved however once wife realizes her mistake she sends next meal along with note explaining mix up soon pair begin exchanging letters at first they are quite simple formal later they become much more complicated as by now wife has realized that her husband has been cheating this total stranger becomes her confidante all during this long exchange letters woman continues sending lunches this stranger they forge odd friendship theres far more film than this see it yourself youll see what i mean dabba is sort film hollywood could never make part it is course because there is no comparable lunch system states part it too is that film does not have perfect happy ending it doesnt follow typical formula there is lot sadness longing film leaves you with this as its not afraid leave audience slightly dissatisfied now i am not complaining but hollywood films seem have implicit understanding that everything must be resolved perfectly before movie can end not so with dabba this might upset some viewers but it shouldnt its still very good movie plus hollywoodized ending would have been far less realistic as far as realism goes this indian film is not typical bollywood flick either while it was directed written by indian ritesh batra stars indian actors irrfan khan nimrat kaur it is also french german co production as such it lacks usual song dance numbers you find most indian films is only little over hour half most indian films are considerably longer often twice as long or longer instead following convention film is all about realism it makes nice change pace even if ending will be vaguely unsatisfying many viewers worth seeing as long as you dont demand formula worth seeing as long as you dont mind reading subtitles film that is truly unique acting is really lovely,0.5111924939467313,0.13283696529459238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.52}"
8.0,Most sumptuous and delicious fare Bollywood has offered in ages.,"""The Lunchbox"" is the most honest love story to come out of Bollywood in ages. It is a delightful story of love blossoming slowly, one letter a day, between two most unlikely but equally despondent characters you could ever match make.Debutant Director, Ritesh Batra, who is also done the script writing, has crafted an exquisite gem of a movie. Batra impresses because he does not set out to impress. He conveys eloquently the state of the mind of each character because he is economical with emotions and does not exaggerate. Batra makes a memorable movie with multiple layers because he is honest with himself and his craft. Ritesh Batra is simply magnificent.The performances by the 3 leading actors, Irrfan Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nimrat Kaur are disarmingly natural, poignant and memorable. Pitted against the two stalwarts (comparatively speaking), Khan and Siddiqui, newcomer Nimrat Kaur more than holds her own. I am at a loss of words to describe her performance. Her character is nuanced, neglected, grieving and most complex yet Kaur's is the most memorable performance in the movie. Her role would be talked about for a long time to come. While ironically, the whole serendipity bit of the film kicks off with a delivery mistake made by Bombay's Dabbawalas, world famous for their Six Sigma (99.999666% ) accuracy, Batra's movie reassures that even if the odds of finding true love in life is Six Sigma stacked against you, it is worth waiting for and taking your chances.

9.0,Extraordinary Story of Ordinary Lives!,"The Lunchbox(Movie -2013) Review - The movie ""The Last Samurai"" ended with a quote something like ""We all seek some small measure of peace, and few of us ever find"". After many years ""The Lunchbox"", a movie from a completely different background and culture echoed the same thought to my ears, really it is never too late to start your life again. You can expect the movie will be a gem as you have the two best character-artists of this decade – Irrfan Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui playing the lead roles. However I didn't expect Nimrat Kaur will also give such an awesome performance as I never followed her before except ""Cadbuy Dairy Milk-Silk adds"", and I apologize for my ignorance sincerely! Nimrat was equally great. This movie can be an excellent demonstration of what extraordinary performance really means in any acting-learning institute of any part of the world, trust me on this!!!The start of the story - A frustrated housewife prepares an excellent lunch for her husband with great care. But unfortunately (or fortunately!), it reaches to an equally lonely person on the verge of retirement - Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan) whose wife died long back. This simple cross connection by Mumbai Dubbawalas in the age of digital era starts a beautiful and interesting romantic relationship however ending of which has been kept open-ended for our own imagination. At the same time we can see an excellent equation and emotional turmoil building up between Saajan /Irrfann, the serious and lonely parting boss and Shaikh/Nawazuddin, his future replacement, who is funny and enthusiastic and quiet opposite to his boss.In some cases Nawazuddin has overshadowed Irfann too! The direction was superb, specially the depiction of the supply chain of the Mumbai Dabbawalas through the city is just extraordinary.Hats-off Ritesh Batra for his unbelievable first time direction.Disclaimer: This movie is 4.5/5 from me, 0.5 is deducted only for its little slow pace , otherwise it in an extraordinary story about very ordinary lives. To me, this movie deserves all the critical appreciations it has received both in India and Outside.

9.0,Lonely people connect over misdelivered meals,"From different contexts two characters cite the same adage: ""Sometimes the wrong train gets you to the right station."" The duplication confirms the implication of the saying: A larger harmony may overlay the apparent chaos and insularity of our lives.The food delivery error finds the right recipient: not the neglectful, unfaithful husband Rajeev (for whom it's intended) but the genuinely appreciative and needy widower Saajan. In the days of cellphones and email the two strangers' connection by paper notes smuggled in the food-tins speaks of older traditions and values. Even if all the paper files and manual accounting in Saajan's claims department are curiously archaic. Since losing his wife Saajan is tight, silent, unexpressive. His colleagues warn his trainee Shaikh that he won't get anything out of Saajan. He's removed from his colleagues and alienated from his neighbors. Ila is almost equally isolated, despite being married, with a delightful daughter and a cheery adviser in the upstairs ""Auntie."" Ila can't get any affection or notice from Rajeev and finds another's perfume on his shirts. Because we don't see Auntie she doesn't register as an actual relief from Ila's isolation. So the stranger's notes appreciating her cooking and sharing his observations and feelings — and attending to hers — are enough to excite Ila, even to give her hope that she may find an alternative more fulfilling relationship. At both ends of the meal's transmission the two fantasize a relationship. This meal provides multiple nourishment. It's enough to prompt Saajan to forgo early retirement and Ila to leave her husband. A key motif is the faint register of an individual in a mass. This is most clear in the montage that follows Ila's food-cans through the daily delivery, one bundle barely discerned amid the mass. Her fertile green case stands out in the drab crowd. So, too, the noisy teeming crowd — in First-Class, yet — on Saajan's commute to/from work. In the last photo at Sheikh's wedding his sole representative Saajan is almost framed out as the camera shifts to include the bride's extending family. But the film stays open-ended. If we prefer the pre-couple's romantic hopes we can infer that Saajan, back from his retirement spot and traveling with the food-deliverers, will get to Ila before her daughter returns from school and the three will depart together. But if our experience rather tends toward the tragic expectation, they won't meet. Her alienation deepened by her mother's relief at her lately disgusting husband's death, and by learning Saajan has moved away, Ila may well commit suicide. The shot of her removing her jewellery replays her visualization of the news story of the mother who jumped with her child to death. As Ila thinks the letter she may or may not send Saajan (p.s., How?) her morbid emotions might drive her off before her daughter returns from school. Hence her wistful look as the girl left. This ending would recall the near-misses that fatally thwart the romance of Romeo and Juliet. The comic subplot of Shaikh and his beloved, who ran away from home to be with him, could support either reading. These lovers' perseverance ends in family acceptance and success. So it could parallel the romantic union of Ila and Saaja. Equally, though, it could be cited as a dramatic counterpoint to the older lovers' tragedy.If we're not given one certain ending the director is suggesting that the ending doesn't matter. Whether or not the lovers meet and settle in together, both have grown from the experience. Warmed by the idea of having a girlfriend, Saajan has opened out to Shaikh and to his neighbours' children.

8.0,Delicious movie experience,"When a neglected housewife figures out that her lunchbox is not being delivered to her husband she sends the man eating it a note which starts a communication through which they connect and even feel love.The movie may seem to slow for some. But this is actually what adds to it's charm. While it seems like a routine where they read notes from each other, each note adds more to their connection. We see them opening more to each other and starting to feel more hope and happiness in their lives.It doesn't have a happy ending. Or maybe it does to some point, just not a typical happy ending which we know from mainstream movies. The main characters never meet. When then time comes for it Saajan Fernandez feels too old for the woman who wrote to him (this actually doesn't seem correct as the actors are not that far apart in age, but the reality is not what he was feeling). And when she tries to come to his work to meet him he has already left. Yet there is still some happiness in it since she leaves her husband and goes to the place where she expects to be happy. And he remains in the neighborhood and seems to have found a new outlook for life which is shown in him connecting better to the children there. Who knows, maybe one day a wrong train will take the two again to a right station and they meet. And if not we know they influenced each other lives in a very positive way.Great acting. And there are many scenes that show it to us. How for example when finding out about a woman jumping from a high building with her daughter Saajan is worried it is Ila and checks right away on his lunchbox. Shaikh is also a great addition to the movie and we see through his relationship with Saajan how things are changing.A nice movie that is a pleasure to watch and to think after.",delicious movie experience,when neglected housewife figures out that her lunchbox is not being delivered her husband she sends man eating it note which starts communication through which they connect even feel love movie may seem slow some but this is actually what adds its charm while it seems like routine where they read notes each other each note adds more their connection we see them opening more each other starting feel more hope happiness their lives it doesnt have happy ending or maybe it does some point just not typical happy ending which we know mainstream movies main characters never meet when then time comes it saajan fernandez feels too old woman who wrote him this actually doesnt seem correct as actors are not that far apart age but reality is not what he was feeling when she tries come his work meet him he has already left yet there is still some happiness it since she leaves her husband goes place where she expects be happy he remains neighborhood seems have found new outlook life which is shown him connecting better children there who knows maybe one day wrong train will take two again right station they meet if not we know they influenced each other lives very positive way great acting there are many scenes that show it us how example when finding out about woman jumping high building with her daughter saajan is worried it is ila checks right away his lunchbox shaikh is also great addition movie we see through his relationship with saajan how things are changing nice movie that is pleasure watch think after,0.512382807668522,0.295378478664193,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Delicious Love Story,"In an age when instant messaging, email, and various social media have made communication easier and quicker, debutant writer-director Ritesh Batra relies on scribbled notes tucked in tiffin boxes to deliver a charming, old-fashioned love story in The Lunchbox. There's a simple line in this sumptuous film that captures its essence beautifully: ""Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination."" It's a line that might help interpret the film's open ending, but one that also nicely sums up its unique premise.I'm going with ten ratings for The Lunchbox. The greatest love stories are the ones that make you root for the protagonists to come together, despite their destinies. This film illustrates how love transforms the unlikeliest of people; it breaks down Saajan's walls and gives Ila the courage to fly. Treat yourself to The Lunchbox – it'll leave you with a craving to seek your own little happiness. Best film I've seen in a long time.

9.0,a movie to watch... must watch...,"Once Rabindranath Tagore says about 'short stories'... ""Simple events of life happy or sad,/ Some sad strings from the train of forgetfulness,/ Not fraught with heavy descriptions,/ Not crowded with events,/ No advice, no philosophy/ Only the feeling that the story is not yet over/ Although there is no more to read..."" 'The Lunchbox' is a perfect example of a unique 'short story'. A little love story with some little events and pain... but at the end there is a new beginning. The story is about a lonely old widower and a young neglected house wife. They connected through a lunch box and some letters, and share some emotional thought and experience of there daily life with each other. They are totally stranger to each other, but love has found out it's own way to enter. There is a basic question about ""Love""... 'Is it possible to fall in love between two strangers'? ""The Lunchbox"" defines it brilliantly... 'Love has no definition and it never follows any rules. So there is a possibility to fall in love with somebody whom we never meet. People loves to fall in 'Love' again and again, it may be someone we know or don't know or whom we already loved with'. Irfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are acted very well through out the movie. Direction of Ritesh Batra is just too much perfect. After interval, the movie is a little bit slow, may be it's a situational demand. Overall it's an wonderful experience.Lastly, the best part of the movie is 'The Ending'.

It really is superb writing throughout the whole film.The casting is inspirational. Irrfan Khan plays the lead to perfection, as does Nimrat Kaur. At times it is hard to take your eyes of them as their expressions are saying more than the words.A worthy mention also has to go to Nawazuddin Siddiqui who plays his part brilliantly and provides a beautiful counter balance to Irrfan Khan portrayal of Saajan Fernandes.And lets not forget Bharati Achrekar who plays Auntie. She doesn't appear on screen once and yet without her the film would just not be the same. The dialogues between Ila and Auntie, and the passing of ingredients between the two, are the kind of lovely touch that makes this not just a good film, but a great film.Ritesh Batra, the writer and director of the film deserves all the praise that has been heaped on him.

9.0,"A delicious, classic urban romance about food, humanity, and relationships","This is one of the most beautiful films I've seen over the past decade from India and elsewhere. Telling the story of an accidental virtual encounter through the delivery of food, The Lunchbox is one of the kindest films one can imagine, with the deepest understanding of the human soul, of human relationships, and of humanity in general. The Lunchbox gives us a fascinating glimpse into the delicious beauty of the Indian cuisine, and the way the virtual relationship is etched out along the way is brilliant. Aside from its deep, poetic tone, the film's sense of everyday realism never takes away from its entertainment value as it remains a consistently intriguing and involving film with hardly a dull moment. The credit must go to writer and director Ritesh Batra, who makes his first directorial effort with this film, and does it with heart, soul and profundity, with amazing results. Few movies have this engaging quality about them.The acting is natural and appealing by one and all. Nimrat Kaur gets a dream role. She is a natural, earthy and solemn beauty, and she matches it with an equally natural, authentic performance, infusing her part with a tender energy of expectancy. Irrfan is at his subdued best, giving a typically real and impressive performance, and so is the wonderful Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who gives his role and the film a great touch of innocent charm. In addition to the brilliant writing and acting, the film boasts of exceptional production values; everything, from the cinematography to the brilliant background score, gives the film its heartwarming energy and makes it a visual treat and a great cinematic experience. The Lunchbox is a stupendous film which celebrates the Indian culture and offers viewers all around the world an exciting glance into its wonderful diversity.

One dialogue still lingers in your mind long after the film has finished ""Sometimes the wrong train takes u to the right destination"". It's so so good to see good ol' letters being exchanged in an era of e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp n mobile phones. Somewhere it touches the very core n essence of that golden era which I had never been born in but now surely have the experience to cherish it via such gems which come once in a long, long while. The best part is that all melodrama has been avoided except for the cameo by Lilette Dubey. All the emotions have been expressed in a very subtle manner in contrast to over-the-top melodrama which has been the staple diet of Bollywood films n how they play with our emotions by being tearjerkers. This film pricks your conscience n compels u to think. It makes u root for the protagonists even as they march onto their respective destinies.

,That Human Touch,"""Man's feeling of alienation has been intensified in the midst of a bureaucratised, impersonal mass society. He is now trebly alienated: a stranger to God, to nature, and to the gigantic social apparatus that supplies his material wants. In a society that requires of man only that he perform competently his own particular social function, man becomes identified with this function, and the rest of his being is allowed to subsist as best it can - usually to be dropped below the surface of consciousness and forgotten."" - William Barrett Ritesh Batra writes and directs ""The Lunchbox"". The film stars Irrfan Khan as Saajan Fernandes, a lonely accountant who works in urban India. Saajan receives a daily meal prepared by the ""dabbawalas"", a network of men and women who transport home-cooked meals to city workers. Saajan's meals are prepared by Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage.On its most superficial level, ""The Lunchbox"" works well as a romantic crowd-pleaser. Saajan and Ila, who never physically meet, use their lunch-boxes to ferry secretly written letters between themselves. As both Saajan and Ila are lonely, depressed and locked in thankless routines, each unfurled letter brings with it excitement, entertainment and the promise of romance. Along the lines of a romantic drama, Batra's film is engrossing, subtle and largely devoid of clichés.On another level, ""The Lunchbox"" works as a kind of anthropological study of urban India. This is a world in which every character is trapped in their own private lunch-boxes, the film's homes, streets, trains, buses and offices all tightly packed and colourfully impersonal. Ila and Saajan's jobs are themselves alienating, their customers invisible and the fruits of their daily toils seemingly evaporating before their eyes. To the duo, something as concrete as human touch seems distant and alien.Whilst Batra captures well the beauty of India, its places, communities, cuisines and people, he also taps into something darker. The last vestiges of traditional gender roles remain, men and women wrestle with existential questions, and urban life is portrayed as something sad and vaguely oppressive, hints of suicide, malaise and poverty fluttering faintly along the film's outer margins. Unsurprisingly, our heroes dream of the kingdom of Bhutan, where Gross National Happiness indices hold precedence (allegedly) over Gross Domestic Product.8.5/10 – See ""Syndromes and a Century"" and ""The Giant Mechanical Man"".",that human touch,mans feeling alienation has been intensified midst bureaucratised impersonal mass society he is now trebly alienated stranger god nature gigantic social apparatus that supplies his material wants society that requires man only that he perform competently his own particular social function man becomes identified with this function rest his being is allowed subsist as best it can usually be dropped below surface consciousness forgotten william barrett ritesh batra writes directs lunchbox film stars irrfan khan as saajan fernandes lonely accountant who works urban india saajan receives daily meal prepared by dabbawalas network men women who transport home cooked meals city workers saajans meals are prepared by ila nimrat kaur young woman trapped loveless marriage its most superficial level lunchbox works well as romantic crowd pleaser saajan ila who never physically meet use their lunch boxes ferry secretly written letters between themselves as both saajan ila are lonely depressed locked thankless routines each unfurled letter brings with it excitement entertainment promise romance along lines romantic drama batras film is engrossing subtle largely devoid clich s another level lunchbox works as kind anthropological study urban india this is world which every character is trapped their own private lunch boxes films homes streets trains buses offices all tightly packed colourfully impersonal ila saajans jobs are themselves alienating their customers invisible fruits their daily toils seemingly evaporating before their eyes duo something as concrete as human touch seems distant alien whilst batra captures well beauty india its places communities cuisines people he also taps into something darker last vestiges traditional gender roles remain men women wrestle with existential questions urban life is portrayed as something sad vaguely oppressive hints suicide malaise poverty fluttering faintly along films outer margins unsurprisingly our heroes dream kingdom bhutan where gross national happiness indices hold precedence allegedly over gross domestic product 8 5 10 see syndromes century giant mechanical man,0.3854910714285715,0.03482142857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Romance done right,"Everyday at midday, something quite unusual happens in Mumbai, India: dozens of bike riders fan out to deliver homemade lunches to workers all across the city. These lunches are literally homemade, produced principally by the wives of these working men, though various restaurants participate in the deliveries as well. One day, the lunch that Ila (Nimrat Kaur) has intended for her husband is mistakenly delivered to someone she's never met, a widower named Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), a man soon to be retired from his job as a government clerk after 35 years, who lives a life of solitude and loneliness with nothing but memories of his late wife for companionship. Out of this simple situation, Ritesh Batra, writer and director of ""The Lunchbox,"" has fashioned an endearing and observant tale of two total strangers who forge the unlikeliest of long-distance relationships. Through the notes that they pass back and forth to one another along with the lunches, Ila and Saajan open up their hearts in ways that Ila finds herself unable to do with her husband and Saajan has been unable to do since the passing of his wife. For though married with a child, Ila is clearly as lonely and unfulfilled in her life as Fernandes is in his.Protected by the cloak of anonymity, Ila and Saajan carry on an old- fashioned pen-pal romance in an era in which the rest of us have moved onto chat rooms and instant messages. Then, of course, comes the inevitable momentshould they meet in person, potentially deepening their relationship - or possibly ruining forever the very rare and special thing they already have? Marked by delicacy and imagination, ""The Lunchbox"" reminds us all of how to make a quality movie romance.

8.0,Delightful,"From the very first moments it is clear that this is one of those near-perfect films that are an absolute joy to watch. Of course, with a film celebrating the wonders of Indian cuisine, it's hard to go wrong. But this is much more than a film about food. It's about hope, disappointments, fear, and kindness. In other words: about life. Essentially, this film shows two people getting fond of each other, but at the same time realizing that it's impossible to get really attached. The brilliant thing about the script is that the man and the woman never really meet each other. They correspond through short letters, hidden in the lunchbox containing the food the woman prepares for her husband, who never gets it because it is delivered to the wrong person. The start of the film is wonderful. We see the woman, Ila, preparing the food, the lunchbox getting transported through the crowded city by one of the many deliverymen, and the lunch being eaten by the office worker. There is hardly any dialogue, only beautiful cinematography. A very nice scene is the one where the camera follows the delivery boy, putting a lunchbox on every desk, and stops moving at the moment Ila's lunch is being delivered. It only becomes clear that something is not right when Ila's husband arrives home, and turns out to be a completely different person from the one who has eaten the lunch. The story unfolds through the letters, in which Ila and office worker Saajan tell each other their daily thoughts, events and emotions. At the same time, there are several side stories emphasizing the emotional development of the lead characters. Apart from the script and the cinematography, the acting is the third great feature of this film. Irrfan Khan, already known by Western audiences from his parts in Slumdog Millionaire and Life of Pi, is very good as the bitter office worker who slowly opens his heart and acknowledges his own feelings. But Nimrat Kaur is just as good as the 'desperate housewife' Ila. They both excel in subtle looks and gestures. And of course there is Mumbai as the third lead character. The crowded trains, the Ambassador-taxis, the children playing cricket in the street, the sudden rain showers - it's all there. This film makes you wonder why so few Indian movies make it to the Western screens. As a matter of fact, we get to see more British films set in India (Slumdog Millionaire, Trishna, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) than the real Indian thing.

10.0,"Funny, sad and totally delicious from start to finish.","Foodie movies are nothing new. Some of the most admired art-house films of the last forty years or so have food at their centre both in a literal sense and as a metaphor but few, if any, are as mouth-wateringly tasteful as Ritesh Batra's ""The Lunchbox"", a gorgeous romantic comedy-drama that will have you salivating from its opening moments. This one hails from India, a country not only famous for its cuisine but for its cinema which is now finally getting the recognition it deserves here in the West.A love story but not in the ususal sense, (it reminded me a little of Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation""), it's about the relationship, (platonic, unconsummated), that develops between a lonely middle-aged man on the cusp of retirement, (a superb performance from the late Irrfan Khan), and a younger, unhappily married woman, (beautifully played by Nimrat Kaur), when, by accident, a lunchbox is delivered to the wrong address. (Props like this are often at the centre of romantic misunderstandings). This couple never meet but correspond with each other on a daily basis and, in their own way, fall in love.The humour is gentle, the drama is virtually imperceptible; this is a film that could easily have come from Ozu or De Sica. It's a satire that not only uses food as a metaphor for feelings, romantic or otherwise, but also pokes gentle fun at India's pen-pushing office environment, (and there's a totally terrific scene-stealing performance from Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan's potential replacement), and even manages to get a dig in at the country's over-crowded railway system. I loved every frame of this movie which is about as perfect as motion-pictures can get.",funny sad totally delicious start finish,foodie movies are nothing new some most admired art house films last forty years or so have food at their centre both literal sense as metaphor but few if any are as mouth wateringly tasteful as ritesh batras lunchbox gorgeous romantic comedy drama that will have you salivating its opening moments this one hails india country not only famous its cuisine but its cinema which is now finally getting recognition it deserves here west love story but not ususal sense it reminded me little sofia coppolas lost translation its about relationship platonic unconsummated that develops between lonely middle aged man cusp retirement superb performance late irrfan khan younger unhappily married woman beautifully played by nimrat kaur when by accident lunchbox is delivered wrong address props like this are often at centre romantic misunderstandings this couple never meet but correspond with each other daily basis their own way fall love humour is gentle drama is virtually imperceptible this is film that could easily have come ozu or de sica its satire that not only uses food as metaphor feelings romantic or otherwise but also pokes gentle fun at indias pen pushing office environment theres totally terrific scene stealing performance nawazuddin siddiqui as khans potential replacement even manages get dig at countrys over crowded railway system i loved every frame this movie which is about as perfect as motion pictures can get,0.643065268065268,0.18992812742812742,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,"""sometimes the wrong train will get you to the right station.""","Now this here is a film unlike anything I've seen in a long time. It uses a unique method of storytelling and feels fresh on every level. I'm not even sure how I came across this film, but I'm glad I did. It's a film about hope, love, and mourning. It perfectly balances deep drama with sweet romance.Irrfan Khan gives a magnificent performance, as does Nimrat Kaur. Kaur plays a stay at home mother who cooks the lunch for her husband, only it never reaches him. Instead the lunchbox finds its way to Khan's desk and they end up connecting after Khan is thrilled with how delicious the meal is. It was interesting to see two people connecting over handwritten notes with the digital and social media age we live in now. The two of them share their life stories and have chemistry unlike any other couple that never has actually met.What I loved about this film was it's not the typical predictable love story. It takes a few turns but in all it gives us lessons for life. Think about it, the main three characters Saajan, Ila, and Shaikh all believe in different things and have different viewpoints on religions. But yet they all give each other a chance. Especially in todays age that's an important lesson to learn. This was an incredible movie that I cant recommend more to people.+Khan's performance +Unique love story +Important lessons+Unpredictable +Gives us hope 9.2/10",sometimes wrong train will get you right station,now this here is film unlike anything ive seen long time it uses unique method storytelling feels fresh every level im not even sure how i came across this film but im glad i did its film about hope love mourning it perfectly balances deep drama with sweet romance irrfan khan gives magnificent performance as does nimrat kaur kaur plays stay at home mother who cooks lunch her husband only it never reaches him instead lunchbox finds its way khans desk they end up connecting after khan is thrilled with how delicious meal is it was interesting see two people connecting over handwritten notes with digital social media age we live now two them share their life stories have chemistry unlike any other couple that never has actually met what i loved about this film was its not typical predictable love story it takes few turns but all it gives us lessons life think about it main three characters saajan ila shaikh all believe different things have different viewpoints religions but yet they all give each other chance especially todays age thats important lesson learn this was incredible movie that i cant recommend more people khans performance unique love story important lessons unpredictable gives us hope 9 2 10,0.6453842940685046,0.26944064707222604,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.02, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9.0,Slow-paced character drama that is a treat to watch,"There were so many ways this movie could have gone wrong: It could have had a formulaic conclusion It could have been all about the foodIt could have dwelt on the organizational prowess of the dabbawalas (Bombay's famed lunch delivery servicemen)But it did none of the above, and it's a fantastic gem that lingers in your imagination long after you've seen it. Ila is an Indian wife and mother trying desperately to regain her husband's affection by going to great lengths to prepare his daily lunch, which is delivered to his office. However, Ila soon realizes that the lunch is going to someone entirely different: Saajan, an office worker who is about to retire and be replaced by a young overeager newbie (Shaikh). Saajan loves his lunches, and begins corresponding with Ila via notes left in the lunchbox. Meanwhile, Saajan's initial loathing for Shaikh develops into tolerance and eventually friendship. Like all great movies, this one excels in its story, its characters, and the prowess of the actors who portray them. We are so drawn to Ila, her anxiety to capture her husband's attentions, and her inner torment as she suspects his infidelity. Saajan is very off-putting at first, but as we learn more about his past, we see him more sympathetically. Their exchange of notes is so full of deep insight and philosophical reflection on the human condition. Shaikh as well turns out to be both more and less than what we had initially expected. Watching Irfan Khan play Saajan was a treat. The camera stays on him for minutes on end as he opens the lunchbox, unpacks its contents, sniffs each dish, samples from this and that, all at a very leisurely pace. And he is able to convey his appreciation for the food without exaggeration, without overacting, but with subtle signs of growing interest which are so true to life. You can just smell the curries as he tentatively takes a whiff of this and that dish. He definitely deserves an award for this role. Also the way he grows out of his initial antipathy towards Shaikh is just marvelous.As a side benefit, this movie gives an excellent view into the lives of middle-class Indian families: where they live, what they eat, how they get to and from work. The film is brooding, melancholy, although it also has an uplifting and optimistic strain woven through its fabric. It does require patience from the viewer, but that patience is amply rewarded.

8.0,"Subtle, simple and refreshingly fresh","The first glimpse of the movie , promises you that it is't a 'just another regular bollywood movie', its refreshingly Fresh and New. The beauty of the entire film lies in the subtlety, whether be it the story, the the actors, characters their mannerisms(when their lips quiver on getting excited, their long and deep searching eyes, the half smiles on the edges, when Ila first time presumes her husband to have an extra-marital affair). Again all of these things are very much there without they saying it explicitly so. Very rarely you come across a movie that moves at a comfortable pace, not trying to either rush or stagnate itself at any point. The TG for this movie is definitely not people across all age groups as the producers claim, but it's specially for those who are happy or contented without searching for that something extra in their everyday lives. It doesn't talk about any extra ordinary accomplishments of individuals, nor does it talk about destiny, life or happiness. It just talks about very simple human behavior, when it comes to falling in love. The end may or may not disappoint you...its very subjective(personally I was a lil), but yea you can tailor your apt end based on whether you are a optimist or a pessimist.",subtle simple refreshingly fresh,first glimpse movie promises you that it ist just another regular bollywood movie its refreshingly fresh new beauty entire film lies subtlety whether be it story actors characters their mannerisms when their lips quiver getting excited their long deep searching eyes half smiles edges when ila first time presumes her husband have extra marital affair again all these things are very much there without they saying it explicitly so very rarely you come across movie that moves at comfortable pace not trying either rush or stagnate itself at any point tg this movie is definitely not people across all age groups as producers claim but its specially those who are happy or contented without searching that something extra their everyday lives it doesnt talk about any extra ordinary accomplishments individuals nor does it talk about destiny life or happiness it just talks about very simple human behavior when it comes falling love end may or may not disappoint you its very subjective personally i was lil but yea you can tailor your apt end based whether you are optimist or pessimist,0.4481502905696453,0.15543569333891913,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,A surprisingly brilliant experience,"When you go into a movie, one of whose somewhat reliable review claimed it to be the best movie to have come out of India in the last 10 years, you are bound to have certain expectations and in retrospect a mind ready for a brutal disappointment at the end and yet there comes a time when something does not just live up to the expectations, but far exceeds them in almost every way. Lunchbox works at so many levels that it might get unpleasant at times for a casual viewer due to the roller-coaster screenplay where a seemingly comical exchange of dialogues suddenly takes a drop-dead serious turn and you have still not stopped laughing. But all throughout the movie everything appearing comical is in a way dark humor surrounding the landscape of the plot.The movie explores loneliness in a way radically different from what we are used to in Indian cinema. I was so much reminded of Wong Kar Wai's In Mood for Love throughout the movie. Although the movie doesn't work on the same plot, but the essence has a lot in common. A lonely retiree who has reached the brink of his active adult life with no one to count on in his fading days and a young housewife caught in the bustle of fast life in the 21st century where an early child seems to have created a huge void in the household. The movie sets off with a very gloomy undertone in the rain drenched by-lanes of Mumbai. Ritesh Batra brings out the melancholy and solitude in the life of these two people through the Mumbai dabbawalla network and it's so natural and so simplistic that it works out very well.He has not built the movie into a conventional love story, but like I said, it reminded me so much of 'In the Mood for Love'. And the screenplay and narrative leaves a lot at the viewer's prerogative. The relationship between Irfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur is somewhat like what Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson had in 'Lost in Translation'. There are so many open ended threads in the story and there is no attempt made at justifying or unnecessarily elaborating them. It redifines love in a way we don't see in Hindi cinema usually and then lets the viewers take their own pick how they want to leave with the story.The editing is very crisp and very tight. Honestly, the movie as a whole was a huge surprise and the experience just gets better.The performances makeup and locations are perfectly suited for the story. The movie brings out Mumbai on the screen in a way that perfectly suits it. Apparently heirless Irfan Khan's huge lonely house in high bustle of Bandra, or the young couple's small budget flat where although you can shout out and talk to the neighbour above, yet strange loneliness thrives and drives a housewife to discuss her family problems with a complete stranger though lunch boxes. The longing for good old past on part of both loners is very well showcased. The movie works very well. Performance wise Irfan Khan is brilliant like always. An exceptional follow-up to Pan Singh Tomar. He plays out a 60 year old so well, that Naseeruddin Shan might've already called up his agent to drop a couple hundred thousands off his asking price. Nimrat Kaur does full justice to her role as the lonely housewife. Nawazzundin Sidiqui plays out a role different from what we have now got used to off late. But it's the story and the way that it has been executed that makes it all the more brilliant.It's good to know that there are people like Ritesh Batra who are doing some remarkable work in the otherwise mediocre Hindi cinema of today. What was even more surprising was to find Karan Johar as one of the producers. This one act of his has suddenly improved his stature in my books. It was disappointing to know that this movie was turned down in favor of 'The Good Road' as official Indian entry for Oscars. Definitely a stupid decision, as I do not see any reason why Lunchbox wouldn't have gone one to win the award.A must watch for anyone who has given up on Hindi cinema.",surprisingly brilliant experience,when you go into movie one whose somewhat reliable review claimed it be best movie have come out india last 10 years you are bound have certain expectations retrospect mind ready brutal disappointment at end yet there comes time when something does not just live up expectations but far exceeds them almost every way lunchbox works at so many levels that it might get unpleasant at times casual viewer due roller coaster screenplay where seemingly comical exchange dialogues suddenly takes drop dead serious turn you have still not stopped laughing but all throughout movie everything appearing comical is way dark humor surrounding landscape plot movie explores loneliness way radically different what we are used indian cinema i was so much reminded wong kar wais mood love throughout movie although movie doesnt work same plot but essence has lot common lonely retiree who has reached brink his active adult life with no one count his fading days young housewife caught bustle fast life 21st century where early child seems have created huge void household movie sets off with very gloomy undertone rain drenched by lanes mumbai ritesh batra brings out melancholy solitude life these two people through mumbai dabbawalla network its so natural so simplistic that it works out very well he has not built movie into conventional love story but like i said it reminded me so much mood love screenplay narrative leaves lot at viewers prerogative relationship between irfan khan nimrat kaur is somewhat like what bill murray scarlet johansson had lost translation there are so many open ended threads story there is no attempt made at justifying or unnecessarily elaborating them it redifines love way we dont see hindi cinema usually then lets viewers take their own pick how they want leave with story editing is very crisp very tight honestly movie as whole was huge surprise experience just gets better performances makeup locations are perfectly suited story movie brings out mumbai screen way that perfectly suits it apparently heirless irfan khans huge lonely house high bustle bandra or young couples small budget flat where although you can shout out talk neighbour above yet strange loneliness thrives drives housewife discuss her family problems with complete stranger though lunch boxes longing good old past part both loners is very well showcased movie works very well performance wise irfan khan is brilliant like always exceptional follow up pan singh tomar he plays out 60 year old so well that naseeruddin shan mightve already called up his agent drop couple hundred thousands off his asking price nimrat kaur does full justice her role as lonely housewife nawazzundin sidiqui plays out role different what we have now got used off late but its story way that it has been executed that makes it all more brilliant its good know that there are people like ritesh batra who are doing some remarkable work otherwise mediocre hindi cinema today what was even more surprising was find karan johar as one producers this one act his has suddenly improved his stature my books it was disappointing know that this movie was turned down favor good road as official indian entry oscars definitely stupid decision as i do not see any reason why lunchbox wouldnt have gone one win award must watch anyone who has given up hindi cinema,0.5560617283950617,0.16255659772326436,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,"Great story line, effortless performances, definitely worth a watch!","To be able to write an involving story on something considered impossible is the hallmark of a good writer. 'The Lunchbox' is based on such a story surrounding the dabbawalas of Mumbai. One mistake that brews a terrific relationship between two strangers, so delicately portrayed through the exchange of letters. There are only three actors in this film and each has delivered a stellar performance. None of them have many dialogues, but their expressions and motions depict their character in such an excellent manner, you wished there were even fewer lines! Irrfan proves with every new film that he in fact is the best 'Khan' of Bollywood and Nawazuddin can just not disappoint. He's used his GoW success to break into films such as this one and done justice to each role. Nimrat Kaur's simplicity throughout the film looks so effortless and yet so unbelievable for the Bollywood of today, which is ever so increasingly synonymous of excessive glamour and fashion. Cinematography is average, but again, this isn't a 'visual' movie, it's more of a story. Direction looks great as Ritesh has been able to get the best out of his cast. Well, you'd have to try real hard to have Irrfan and Nawaz amidst your cast and yet churn a flop, but the director does deserve some credit. In my opinion, this is the second best film of the year after Madras Cafe. I haven't seen Bhaag Milkha Bhaag though, so that might change things for me. Either way, this is in no way a bore or a drag as the film keeps you hooked onto the amazing story line and individual performances.
