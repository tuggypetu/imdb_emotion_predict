10.0,A Masterpiece,"Mother India sits right at the top and shares the seat with just a handful of other movies as one of the best films ever made in Indian Film History. Deservedly, it also garnered an Oscar Nomination for Best Foreign Film - a first for Bollywood. Need I say more? Let me try...Five years after her wedding, Radha, a regular village girl finds she has been abandoned by her husband (who leaves her in despair) and left to cope with his never-ending debt to Shuki Lal, the village ""Munshi"". To feed her children, Radha toils like a farm-animal and is able to save just enough food to eventually bring up her children. The injustice to and torture of their mother is interpreted in opposite ways by her children: while the elder Ramu is humble and just, the younger Birju who seethes with hatred for Sukhi Lal turns outlaw. While Radha tries to bring back Birju with love, Birju plans to finish Sukhi Lal's debt once and for all.Mehboob Khan had made some good movies in his career, including a milestone first all-colour (technicolor) Bollywood feature. But nothing could have hinted at the brilliance to come in his waning years. Defying a very many stereotypes, his was the first major Hindi film with a female protagonist, a cowardly abandoning husband (how RajKumar, men of men, agreed for that role is another story), no definitive hero-heroine pairs, etc. He tells the 172-minute story in flash-back as a memory of an old Radha inaugurating irrigation canals in her village. Taking his titular heroine through happiness, desolation, compulsion and resignation, he transformed box-office darling Nargis into an actress nothing short of a legend. We see her go from an innocent bride to an anguished mother to a revered ""Mother"" of the village.Nargis herself is most remembered for this career-defining and image-breaking portrayal (soon after which she married Sunil Dutt, who portrayed her bitter son Birju*). Sunil Dutt was a very under-rated actor, for the simple reason that all his great performances were never title characters, and were over-shadowed by more famous co-actors. His Birju is played with such realism and conviction that even today many comedians mimicking Sunil Dutt are actually mimicking Birju.The director's production team does work beyond their era and workstyle to create the look of the people and place over time. From famine to flood for the backdrop, youth to old-age for Radha and from bright to dirty earthen to faded colours, the team wins complete involvement of the audience by filling our visual and audio sense with realism just next to reality. The director chose to spend more of his limited budget on these aspects, and in turn had to sacrifice on the equipment he could use to capture the sights and sounds that were being realised: the movie was made on 35mm and mono-sound.Surprisingly, something I have noted as not being mentioned anywhere in literature connected to this movie is how without obviously being so, Mehboob created the most patriotic of Indian movies. The only give-away is in his choice of title Mother India. Depicting his motherland as a repressed and abandoned woman, and her children as peace-loving Gandhi-Ramu or rebellious Bose-Birju, Mehboob layers his movie with such fierce passion, it is impossible not to be overwhelmed by it.",masterpiece,mother india sits right at top shares seat with just handful other movies as one best films ever made indian film history deservedly it also garnered oscar nomination best foreign film first bollywood need i say more let me try five years after her wedding radha regular village girl finds she has been abandoned by her husband who leaves her despair left cope with his never ending debt shuki lal village munshi feed her children radha toils like farm animal is able save just enough food eventually bring up her children injustice torture their mother is interpreted opposite ways by her children while elder ramu is humble just younger birju who seethes with hatred sukhi lal turns outlaw while radha tries bring back birju with love birju plans finish sukhi lals debt once all mehboob khan had made some good movies his career including milestone first all colour technicolor bollywood feature but nothing could have hinted at brilliance come his waning years defying very many stereotypes his was first major hindi film with female protagonist cowardly abandoning husband how rajkumar men men agreed that role is another story no definitive hero heroine pairs etc he tells 172 minute story flash back as memory old radha inaugurating irrigation canals her village taking his titular heroine through happiness desolation compulsion resignation he transformed box office darling nargis into actress nothing short legend we see her go innocent bride anguished mother revered mother village nargis herself is most remembered this career defining image breaking portrayal soon after which she married sunil dutt who portrayed her bitter son birju sunil dutt was very under rated actor simple reason that all his great performances were never title characters were over shadowed by more famous co actors his birju is played with such realism conviction that even today many comedians mimicking sunil dutt are actually mimicking birju directors production team does work beyond their era workstyle create look people place over time famine flood backdrop youth old age radha bright dirty earthen faded colours team wins complete involvement audience by filling our visual audio sense with realism just next reality director chose spend more his limited budget these aspects turn had sacrifice equipment he could use capture sights sounds that were being realised movie was made 35mm mono sound surprisingly something i have noted as not being mentioned anywhere literature connected this movie is how without obviously being so mehboob created most patriotic indian movies only give away is his choice title mother india depicting his motherland as repressed abandoned woman her children as peace loving gandhi ramu or rebellious bose birju mehboob layers his movie with such fierce passion it is impossible not be overwhelmed by it,0.401798345332828,0.22431239737274217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"

7.0,"Mehboob makes Nargis ""Mother India""","In present day India, elderly mother Nargis (as Radha) is reluctant to attend the ceremony opening a new water canal for her village. Eventually agreeing, the old woman recalls her lifeÂ… We begin with Ms. Nargis' marriage to Raaj Kumar (as Shamu). The very attractive young couple are blissfully in love. Farmers by trade, they have three children. But, all is not well. The couple have borrowed from greedy money-lender Kanhaiyalal (as Sukhilala). They do not seem to be aware of the fact, but Mr. Kanhaiyalal has cheated them out of land and future profits...Dealing with the money-lender meant Nargis and her family work harder and harder, for less and less. Adding to the tragedy is a faming accident. Then, the children are threatened with starvation. At one point, Nargis considers prostituting herself to Kanhaiyalal, who desires the woman as well as her money. She resorts to begging, and saves son Sajid Khan (as Birju) with a few grams of food. ""Master Sajid"" is the son you should be watching, by the way. And, you won't have any trouble finding him - young Khan takes over the screen for a good portion of the movie...Khan grows up to be Sunil Dutt (as the adult Birju). Rajendra Kumar is ""Ramu"" the more stable son. Mr. Dutt continues to be the ""bad boy"" of the village. You'll notice ""Birju"" the young man is very reminiscent of ""Birju"" the boy. As a boy, he didn't like the money-lender. As a man, Mr. Dutt holds Kanhaiyalal responsible for his family's misfortunes. Dutt decides to take matters into his own hands. Nargis loves and protects her son, but wants to honor the community's decisions regarding the old loan and ""interest"" agreed upon. This leads to a conflict between ""Mother India"" and son...This classic film was an huge critical and commercial success; it almost won the ""Academy Award"" for best foreign language film of 1957. ""Mother India"" isn't easy to watch, however, even if you like foreign films. It startles with traditional musical interludes, makes unaccustomed cultural connections, and runs almost three hours. If bravely enduring a second viewing, you could get engrossed in Nargis. There is fascinating symbolism and story-telling herein. Near the end, Nargis makes a decision regarding her son which is thought-provoking - does it contradict her earlier emotions and stated beliefs? ******* Mother India (2/14/57) Mehboob Khan ~ Nargis, Sunil Dutt, Sajid Khan, Rajendra Kumar",mehboob makes nargis mother india,present day india elderly mother nargis as radha is reluctant attend ceremony opening new water canal her village eventually agreeing old woman recalls her life we begin with ms nargis marriage raaj kumar as shamu very attractive young couple are blissfully love farmers by trade they have three children but all is not well couple have borrowed greedy money lender kanhaiyalal as sukhilala they do not seem be aware fact but mr kanhaiyalal has cheated them out land future profits dealing with money lender meant nargis her family work harder harder less less adding tragedy is faming accident then children are threatened with starvation at one point nargis considers prostituting herself kanhaiyalal who desires woman as well as her money she resorts begging saves son sajid khan as birju with few grams food master sajid is son you should be watching by way you wont have any trouble finding him young khan takes over screen good portion movie khan grows up be sunil dutt as adult birju rajendra kumar is ramu more stable son mr dutt continues be bad boy village youll notice birju young man is very reminiscent birju boy as boy he didnt like money lender as man mr dutt holds kanhaiyalal responsible his familys misfortunes dutt decides take matters into his own hands nargis loves protects her son but wants honor communitys decisions regarding old loan interest agreed upon this leads conflict between mother india son this classic film was huge critical commercial success it almost won academy award best foreign language film 1957 mother india isnt easy watch however even if you like foreign films it startles with traditional musical interludes makes unaccustomed cultural connections runs almost three hours if bravely enduring second viewing you could get engrossed nargis there is fascinating symbolism story telling herein near end nargis makes decision regarding her son which is thought provoking does it contradict her earlier emotions stated beliefs mother india 2 14 57 mehboob khan nargis sunil dutt sajid khan rajendra kumar,0.3733225108225109,0.16197691197691197,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,A Great Indian Epic in the Making !,"Mehboob Khan's Mother India reserves a special place among all time great and memorable Mega Hit films. Nargis has consummately performed a versatile role of a mature Indian mother who would not allow her own son to rob the honor of their village at any cost. The climactic last scene of the epic, where Radha shoots her son in the back, while Birju was all set to kidnap the cruel money lender's daughter is a tragedy sequence that can be commensurately compared with the ending of another emotionally charged film - Shakti, where Dilip Kumar shoots in the back of his son ""Amitabh"".However, Birju's angry performance in this movie steals the show at many a times; for instance, when he argues with his mother and brother about the greedy Bania moneylender who had fleeced their family from all earthly possessions through the odiously manipulative annual interest rate charged by him, although they have toiled day and night to return the debt.It is a great melodramatic picture, containing magnificent performance by Nargis and Sunil Dutt, while manifesting the impoverished economic conditions and abysmal living standards of a typical Indian rural family who were driven in utter disgust, shame and tragedy due to the volatile temper of one of their family members. However, seething poverty was not the sole reason which perturbed Birju (Sunil Dutt) to become an outlaw and murder Sukhi Lala (the rapacious money lender), but the very ominous and cruel person hidden in the money lender, who, in a backward rural social setup took full benefit/advantage of the poor, illiterate and weak elements of village social order.Besides, the strong and moving story line, Faredoon has captured mesmerizing stills providing an excellent background setting of the full horizon picture down to the ground level with spreading murky clouds at dusk against the backdrop of silhouetted actors.It is definitely a must see movie having marvelous and stupendous cinematography, as well.",great indian epic making,mehboob khans mother india reserves special place among all time great memorable mega hit films nargis has consummately performed versatile role mature indian mother who would not allow her own son rob honor their village at any cost climactic last scene epic where radha shoots her son back while birju was all set kidnap cruel money lenders daughter is tragedy sequence that can be commensurately compared with ending another emotionally charged film shakti where dilip kumar shoots back his son amitabh however birjus angry performance this movie steals show at many times instance when he argues with his mother brother about greedy bania moneylender who had fleeced their family all earthly possessions through odiously manipulative annual interest rate charged by him although they have toiled day night return debt it is great melodramatic picture containing magnificent performance by nargis sunil dutt while manifesting impoverished economic conditions abysmal living standards typical indian rural family who were driven utter disgust shame tragedy due volatile temper one their family members however seething poverty was not sole reason which perturbed birju sunil dutt become outlaw murder sukhi lala rapacious money lender but very ominous cruel person hidden money lender who backward rural social setup took full benefit advantage poor illiterate weak elements village social order besides strong moving story line faredoon has captured mesmerizing stills providing excellent background setting full horizon picture down ground level with spreading murky clouds at dusk against backdrop silhouetted actors it is definitely must see movie having marvelous stupendous cinematography as well,0.5394246031746033,0.16545634920634916,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,"Ambitious, uneven, but overall excellent Bollywood melodrama","Nargis stars as a suffering woman, Radha, experiencing tragedy after tragedy, surviving it all. The first half of the film doesn't promise anything overly special. A poor community falls under the weight of a moneylender, Sukhilala. When Radha marries, her mother-in-law mortgages her farm to pay for the wedding and Radha's jewlery. Since the mother-in-law has no education whatsoever, Sukhilala, probably the only educated man in the village, is able to take advantage of her. When she challenges Sukhilala's claim, she can't do much to disprove their deal. This part of the story is pretty clichÃ©, rather predictable and very questionable. Sukhilala is a fairly standard villain, very cartoonish and simplistic. The audience is programmed to hiss at his every appearance. The conflict is compelling, but I was hoping for something more complex. It is nice, I suppose, to see the system challenged, but the fact that the system is challenged does not necessarily mean that the film challenges the system in an insightful manner. In reality, the film's solutions to the problems are all melodramatics.Luckily, something else is brewing in the film at this point. Radha has two sons, Ramu and Birju. The story starts to focus in on Birju, who is very obnoxious. His mother loves him dearly, spoils him, and he becomes simply evil. I should say at this point that the little kid who plays him as a child, Master Sajid, is very, very annoying, not to mention a terrible little actor. As an adult, Birju is a devil. Sukhilala still runs the place, and now Birju is big enough to do something about it. Thankfully, Birju is not made a hero. Well, perhaps an anti-hero, but at least we're spared him becoming an Indian Robin Hood as I expected. Complexities begin to develop in the way Sukhilala is depicted, and, while he's still the villain, the audience is no longer programmed to despise him on site. Radha has to both protect her son and stand up for what is right. The climax is so extremely impressive that I was almost convinced that the film was great.Yet the film is not what I would call great as a whole. There were dozens of scenes that I loved, but, as the film goes on for three hours, there was plenty to dislike, as well. The fat and gristle detract. Did I mention there are great songs? Great indeed! I love Hindi music myself. The cinematography is also often exceptional. 8/10.",ambitious uneven but overall excellent bollywood melodrama,nargis stars as suffering woman radha experiencing tragedy after tragedy surviving it all first half film doesnt promise anything overly special poor community falls under weight moneylender sukhilala when radha marries her mother law mortgages her farm pay wedding radhas jewlery since mother law has no education whatsoever sukhilala probably only educated man village is able take advantage her when she challenges sukhilalas claim she cant do much disprove their deal this part story is pretty clich rather predictable very questionable sukhilala is fairly standard villain very cartoonish simplistic audience is programmed hiss at his every appearance conflict is compelling but i was hoping something more complex it is nice i suppose see system challenged but fact that system is challenged does not necessarily mean that film challenges system insightful manner reality films solutions problems are all melodramatics luckily something else is brewing film at this point radha has two sons ramu birju story starts focus birju who is very obnoxious his mother loves him dearly spoils him he becomes simply evil i should say at this point that little kid who plays him as child master sajid is very very annoying not mention terrible little actor as adult birju is devil sukhilala still runs place now birju is big enough do something about it thankfully birju is not made hero well perhaps anti hero but at least were spared him becoming indian robin hood as i expected complexities begin develop way sukhilala is depicted while hes still villain audience is no longer programmed despise him site radha has both protect her son stand up what is right climax is so extremely impressive that i was almost convinced that film was great yet film is not what i would call great as whole there were dozens scenes that i loved but as film goes three hours there was plenty dislike as well fat gristle detract did i mention there are great songs great indeed i love hindi music myself cinematography is also often exceptional 8 10,0.5902820910973086,0.12407479296066252,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.45}"

Birju played by Dutt is the more flamboyant one who gets in trouble with the village Lala's daughter and runs away and becomes a dacoit. The end is the most unexpected part of the movie.Made on a large canvas, this movie runs like an epic. This Mehboob Khan's effort came very close to winning the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film. During the shooting of this film Dutt saved Nargis from a fire and soon after that they were married.Naushad's music is another highlight of the film with some great songs like ""Duniya Mein Hum Aaye Hain"", ""Nagri-Nagri Dware-Dware"", ""Holi Aayi Re Kanhai"", ""Tan Rang Lo Ji"" etc.All in all, this is possibly one of the best Hindi films ever made.",great movie must see,what more can you ask movie rich story excellent acting great songs technically superb story is about radha played by nargis who works hard bring up her two children played by sunil dutt rajender kumar after her husband goes away birju played by dutt is more flamboyant one who gets trouble with village lalas daughter runs away becomes dacoit end is most unexpected part movie made large canvas this movie runs like epic this mehboob khans effort came very close winning oscar best foreign film during shooting this film dutt saved nargis fire soon after that they were married naushads music is another highlight film with some great songs like duniya mein hum aaye hain nagri nagri dware dware holi aayi re kanhai tan rang lo ji etc all all this is possibly one best hindi films ever made,0.5497835497835499,0.4101190476190476,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6.0,"Triumph of a strong woman's dignity and honor in a village in the face of poverty, hopeless usury, illiteracy, and heartbreaking misfortune; worth seeing, but too long","This was a movie about a strong woman of honor, Radha (Nargis) and her family, a usurious man, and the poor village they live in. The lender breaks villagers' backs by charging interest at such a high rate that they give something like 3/4 of their laborious harvest to the lender just to cover interest, keeping the debt in perpetuity. Almost nobody around can read, so the terms of the original contract are never clear. Though the situation keeps the woman's family downtrodden financially, she staunchly preserves her pride and dignity.One of her sons, Birju (Sunil Dutt), is portrayed as always being a ""problem"" right from childhood, and while I could understand his rage against the moneylender, I found his vengeance hard to believe, especially the self-destruction that pitted him against his own family members. I like the ending and really laud Radha, who realized that one's dignity and honor is priceless and shouldn't be bartered away.I found the film to be too long (it lasted around 3 hours); the story could have been just as compelling if it were an hour shorter. I would recommend the film and would rate it 6 on a scale of 10.

7.0,"The Indian ""Gone with the Wind""...in its running time only maybe.","Let me start of by saying that I can definitely appreciate a good and honest Indian drama but that I'm not really into the more typical Bollywood kind of melodrama's, such as this movie is obviously being. In my opinion you just can't have a real good and powerful drama when your movie is so colorful looking and features happy songs and dancing. I can still definitely watch this movie and also still appreciate it for most part but I just can't really see how this movie can be regarded as an emotionally strong one and one of the greatest- and best known Indian movies.It's an heavy handed movie, that is being quite long with its running time of nearly 3 hours. It's hard to keep any kind of movie interesting to watch for 3 hours, so this is also something that the movie suffers from. I wouldn't necessarily call the movie slow or boring but its still being unnecessary long.The story is still what keeps the movie going and in itself there is very little wrong with it, though it's just a bit too stretched out all. Some elements should had been either cut out or the movie perhaps would had worked out better if the entire story got divided amongst two or perhaps even three separate movies. It's all being quite melodramatic all and it's also quite clichÃ© and predictable but it still keep things going at all time.A thing that worked out distracting, next to its songs and dance routines, that all seemed and sounded alike, was the fact that some exterior shoots obviously got shot indoors. The movie is some fake looking studio work out times, with fake looking backgrounds and all of those sort of things.And to be honest, the directing of this movie was absolutely dreadful at times. Sometimes certain scene's don't flow at all and the movie seems to take some awkward cuts and sudden leaps in time. The movie can get real amateur like looking to be honest at times, when it comes down to its directing.No, it's not an horrible movie by any means but I still can't really seem to understand why it's being regarded so highly, not only just by Bollywood-fans but by all sorts of movie viewers, from all over the world, while its in fact being an heavily flawed movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",indian gone with wind its running time only maybe,let me start by saying that i can definitely appreciate good honest indian drama but that im not really into more typical bollywood kind melodramas such as this movie is obviously being my opinion you just cant have real good powerful drama when your movie is so colorful looking features happy songs dancing i can still definitely watch this movie also still appreciate it most part but i just cant really see how this movie can be regarded as emotionally strong one one greatest best known indian movies its heavy handed movie that is being quite long with its running time nearly 3 hours its hard keep any kind movie interesting watch 3 hours so this is also something that movie suffers i wouldnt necessarily call movie slow or boring but its still being unnecessary long story is still what keeps movie going itself there is very little wrong with it though its just bit too stretched out all some elements should had been either cut out or movie perhaps would had worked out better if entire story got divided amongst two or perhaps even three separate movies its all being quite melodramatic all its also quite clich predictable but it still keep things going at all time thing that worked out distracting next its songs dance routines that all seemed sounded alike was fact that some exterior shoots obviously got shot indoors movie is some fake looking studio work out times with fake looking backgrounds all those sort things be honest directing this movie was absolutely dreadful at times sometimes certain scenes dont flow at all movie seems take some awkward cuts sudden leaps time movie can get real amateur like looking be honest at times when it comes down its directing no its not horrible movie by any means but i still cant really seem understand why its being regarded so highly not only just by bollywood fans but by all sorts movie viewers all over world while its fact being heavily flawed movie 7 10,0.6330614344503231,0.07342555849500292,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"

,"For the average Western viewer, a grueling experience.","Turner Classic Movies just played this nearly three-hour Indian epic and I decided to give it a try, despite TCM host Robert Osborne's caveat that its length might seem a daunting viewing challenge, but one that would prove rewarding by its eventual conclusion. Alas! I failed to make it past the midway point. My capacity for submitting to movie masochism had reached the full-to-satiation level. In fact it had long since overflowed, much like the farms after a terrific monsoon during one of the film's earlier episodes.The video transfer of the original Gevacolor negative (apparently an unstable single-strip process), with prints by Technicolor, looked pretty good on Turner's presentation, with some ravishing shots during the opening wedding sequence and the occasional insert of glowing sunsets, etc. But, oh! the tedium of the endless travails of the central protagonists, bedevilled by the almost cartoonish evil of Sukhilala (played by an energetic actor named Kanhaiyalal), a villain so heartless he makes Simon Legree look like the endlessly compassionate Mother Teresa of Calcutta.The actress Nargis, playing Radha, the matriarch around whom this mostly sad tale revolves, is a standout in a cast most of whom seem to have been encouraged to overact to an almost absurd histrionic intensity. With some contrasting subtlety, she more than holds her own and appears to have been subjected to some extraordinarily difficult torments in order to realistically depict her character's many agonies.But this early example of what has become known as the Bollywood school of international cinema is definitely an acquired taste. If you like screen exotica, liberally spiced with production numbers sung in Hindi that frequently seem to exceed the length of an entire Hollywood film from the Golden Age of Movie Musicals, then this just may be your dish of curry. But for this viewer it seems less a ""classic"" and more a prime example of how Indian audiences have been traditionally willing to submit to films that are routinely as long as those blockbusters that bombarded our roadshow houses back in the late Fifties through the 1960s. I can still watch one of those English-language spectacles with a degree of satisfaction, but I confess, this epic from the Indian subcontinent was more than I could digest.",average western viewer grueling experience,turner classic movies just played this nearly three hour indian epic i decided give it try despite tcm host robert osbornes caveat that its length might seem daunting viewing challenge but one that would prove rewarding by its eventual conclusion alas i failed make it past midway point my capacity submitting movie masochism had reached full satiation level fact it had long since overflowed much like farms after terrific monsoon during one films earlier episodes video transfer original gevacolor negative apparently unstable single strip process with prints by technicolor looked pretty good turners presentation with some ravishing shots during opening wedding sequence occasional insert glowing sunsets etc but oh tedium endless travails central protagonists bedevilled by almost cartoonish evil sukhilala played by energetic actor named kanhaiyalal villain so heartless he makes simon legree look like endlessly compassionate mother teresa calcutta actress nargis playing radha matriarch around whom this mostly sad tale revolves is standout cast most whom seem have been encouraged overact almost absurd histrionic intensity with some contrasting subtlety she more than holds her own appears have been subjected some extraordinarily difficult torments order realistically depict her characters many agonies but this early example what has become known as bollywood school international cinema is definitely acquired taste if you like screen exotica liberally spiced with production numbers sung hindi that frequently seem exceed length entire hollywood film golden age movie musicals then this just may be your dish curry but this viewer it seems less classic more prime example how indian audiences have been traditionally willing submit films that are routinely as long as those blockbusters that bombarded our roadshow houses back late fifties through 1960s i can still watch one those english language spectacles with degree satisfaction but i confess this epic indian subcontinent was more than i could digest,0.49723032069970846,0.04939261418853255,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,Flawed pearl,"I hate bollywood. But this isn't bollywood. This is epic, moving important filmmaking. The story is heartbreaking, the imagery is fabulous, even in Technicolor, and the music is, for once, really rather good. The songs do actually seem to signal major changes in the plot, rather than being tacked-on, globetrotting, multicostume sex-substitutes. Sadly for me, the DVD version I saw had subtitles for everything apart from the song lyrics, but the physical acting was so strong that it didn't matter.

A strong story line depicting the values and tribulations of rural India,this movie is backed up by some very powerful performances.All from Nargis,Suniel Dutt,Rajendra Kumar to Kanahiya lal are superb. The story revolves around Nargis and shows the trials and tribulations of her life. There are quite a few memorable sequences in the film. Starting from the scene when Nargis's one child has died due to malnutrition and the other two live ones are extremely hungry. In the moment of extreme despair when she decides to go to the village Baniya,her facial expression showing a mixture of pure contempt and extreme dejection are superb. A word must be said about the director of the movie,Mehboob Khan,right through out the movie one can see,his vision and creativity shining brightly. Every scene it seems has been hand crafted and all the sequences are closely linked to each other. The music too of the film is immensely pleasing to the ears. The songs give the aroma of the richness of the Indian village and are a treat to watch too. Above all the movie is about hope and values.

8.0,Mother India,"Any foreign film, in this case Indian, that features in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, is obviously one I will see. Basically 'mother' of the village Radha (Nargis) opens the canal, and goes into a flashback to the past where she was newly married to husband Shamu (Raaj Kumar), with the wedding paid for by her mother in law, with money lent by Sukhilala (Kanhaiyalal). This money lending begins a spiral of poverty and tragedy, including forced payment, and Shamu having his arms crushed by a boulder, forcing him to leave the village and never return. After this, Radha's mother in law dies, while she continues to work in the fields, and gives birth to another child, and she refuses more help from Sukhilala. A storm goes through the village, killing Radha's youngest child, and destroying most of the villagers homes, but everyone stays to rebuild. It then moves to a few years later, where Radha's two surviving children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar) have grown up to be young men. Ramu is fine, but Birju is a bad tempered son taking all his frustrations on village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter. Ramu has a much softer temper, and manages to get married and become a father, but also manages to get his family in the cycle of poverty. Birju however gets to the point where his temper is becoming dangerous, attacking Sukhilala, his daughter and other family members, and he wants revenge when it is the daughter's wedding day. Radha promises Birju would never come to harm, despite knowing how dangerous he has become, but after he kills Sukhilala and the daughter, she has no choice but to shoot him. This is where the film returns to the present day, seeing Radha see the newly opened canal river run red like blood. Also starring Kumkum as Champa. The performances by Nargis as the devoted mother and Dutt as the violent son are very well done, there may not be much realism in the situations portrayed, but with some likable songs and the spectacle, this is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!",mother india,any foreign film this case indian that features book 1001 movies you must see before you die is obviously one i will see basically mother village radha nargis opens canal goes into flashback past where she was newly married husband shamu raaj kumar with wedding paid by her mother law with money lent by sukhilala kanhaiyalal this money lending begins spiral poverty tragedy including forced payment shamu having his arms crushed by boulder forcing him leave village never return after this radhas mother law dies while she continues work fields gives birth another child she refuses more help sukhilala storm goes through village killing radhas youngest child destroying most villagers homes but everyone stays rebuild it then moves few years later where radhas two surviving children birju sunil dutt ramu rajendra kumar have grown up be young men ramu is fine but birju is bad tempered son taking all his frustrations village girls especially sukhilalas daughter ramu has much softer temper manages get married become father but also manages get his family cycle poverty birju however gets point where his temper is becoming dangerous attacking sukhilala his daughter other family members he wants revenge when it is daughters wedding day radha promises birju would never come harm despite knowing how dangerous he has become but after he kills sukhilala daughter she has no choice but shoot him this is where film returns present day seeing radha see newly opened canal river run red like blood also starring kumkum as champa performances by nargis as devoted mother dutt as violent son are very well done there may not be much realism situations portrayed but with some likable songs spectacle this is worthwhile drama it was nominated oscar best foreign language film very good,0.3886730945821855,0.06630394857667585,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"

9.0,"Three parts Art, one part Corn","One of the pinnacles of world cinema, after all these years Mother India still has the power to put you through an emotional mangle showing the relentless battle against poverty of all kinds. But if Nargis hadn't been the star what then? It was her performance in here that was so spellbinding, usually sublime occasionally melodramatic but always riveting. I don't think anyone else could have made Mehboob's expert quasi-Soviet propagandising so palatable either. It was a seminal film, a nowhere near perfect roller-coaster that emotionally engages the viewer immediately to the bittersweet end.In flashback the story is family take a loan from a moneylender to pay for a wedding and stay in debt for decades simply repaying the interest and not even touching the principal. The literally grinding poverty is passed down to the children who do their best but gradually question the original deal. As the good times and the tragedies go by it's all performed in a glorious colour, with some glorious photography full of national or emotional symbolism and some seemingly effortless glorious songs from Naushad & Badayuni. Although before tonight I last saw it decades ago it still looked good in black & white. Even if it's Nargis's film there's still some fine acting from Raaj Kumar (whether living or from the beyond), Rajendra Kumar and the manic Sunil Dutt.As the point behind the film is not entirely lost on me in that the bitterness of the hopeless past was to be replaced with the optimism of the future India, proud of its tradition but full of the vim needed to be a world power may I sorrowfully point out: British rule certainly did the Indian peasant no favours, but the Indian capitalist class simply continues with that policy against worker and peasant alike. Godless Profit will destroy Tradition every time; also going to Mars means more to the present Indian government than feeding the starving. Mehboob preferred indigenous usurers and parasites taking apparent control of their collective destiny; I'd be interested in seeing his 1940 film Aurat which supposedly was the original of Mother India, made when it was still British India. ""If Life is poison we must drink it"" Lata sings as admonition to the peasants to work till they drop and are finally happy - but Life is seldom poison to the carefree few who own the land and means of production. And many iconic images and framings reinforce the view that we're all in it together even when as ever we're not. On the other hand when Nargis later became a politician she was right to criticise the film director Satyajit Ray and his muddy Pather Panchali as one-sided â€“ there not only has to be an invisible Sun, there always is â€“ love, hope and health are also there together with blood, sweat and tears.At 130 minutes in when Nargis says ""Won't you come to see your grandson?"" it's just about the last tearjerking straw, an unparallelled poignant moment out of so much in here that's memorable for one reason or another. Personally that one astounding line is worth the waiting for. The whole epic doesn't seem too long to me (and Bir Ju's story in full could've added hours to it), but beauty is in the eyes â€“ and ears â€“ of the beholder; a wonderful tale, keep right on to the end of the road.",three parts art one part corn,one pinnacles world cinema after all these years mother india still has power put you through emotional mangle showing relentless battle against poverty all kinds but if nargis hadnt been star what then it was her performance here that was so spellbinding usually sublime occasionally melodramatic but always riveting i dont think anyone else could have made mehboobs expert quasi soviet propagandising so palatable either it was seminal film nowhere near perfect roller coaster that emotionally engages viewer immediately bittersweet end flashback story is family take loan moneylender pay wedding stay debt decades simply repaying interest not even touching principal literally grinding poverty is passed down children who do their best but gradually question original deal as good times tragedies go by its all performed glorious colour with some glorious photography full national or emotional symbolism some seemingly effortless glorious songs naushad badayuni although before tonight i last saw it decades ago it still looked good black white even if its nargiss film theres still some fine acting raaj kumar whether living or beyond rajendra kumar manic sunil dutt as point behind film is not entirely lost me that bitterness hopeless past was be replaced with optimism future india proud its tradition but full vim needed be world power may i sorrowfully point out british rule certainly did indian peasant no favours but indian capitalist class simply continues with that policy against worker peasant alike godless profit will destroy tradition every time also going mars means more present indian government than feeding starving mehboob preferred indigenous usurers parasites taking apparent control their collective destiny id be interested seeing his 1940 film aurat which supposedly was original mother india made when it was still british india if life is poison we must drink it lata sings as admonition peasants work till they drop are finally happy but life is seldom poison carefree few who own land means production many iconic images framings reinforce view that were all it together even when as ever were not other hand when nargis later became politician she was right criticise film director satyajit ray his muddy pather panchali as one sided there not only has be invisible sun there always is love hope health are also there together with blood sweat tears at 130 minutes when nargis says wont you come see your grandson its just about last tearjerking straw unparallelled poignant moment out so much here thats memorable one reason or another personally that one astounding line is worth waiting whole epic doesnt seem too long me bir jus story full couldve added hours it but beauty is eyes ears beholder wonderful tale keep right end road,0.46687830687830684,0.2215443121693121,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Excellent introduction to the spice and colour of Indian cinema....,"If, like me, you're fairly new to Indian cinema and think, as I did, that it's all singing and dancing Bollywood, here is a brilliant mix of what we might expect and an epic tale that we in the West can really appreciate and enjoy.I'd only been to the monochrome world of Indian director Satyajit Ray before and frankly, I didn't seem to appreciate those as much as many do. In time, I trust that I will. Mother India, which I bought blind, seemed to be like approaching, say opera, by going to see one that was commercially accessible but maybe not what the purest of critics might approve of. That is was also Oscar nominated in the World cinema category is also testament of how popular and well thought of Mehboob Khan's Indian masterpiece was.I personally feel that the often quoted ""Indian Gone with the Wind"" is both somewhat false and misleading. True, its scope and length as well as the beautifully lavish Technicolor (must have been very expensive to make at the time) bear comparison. The central character is no Hindu Vivien Leigh either and even more amiss is that it's not set against a background of War.The war, indeed, centres around land, land on which to sustain a crop, enough to feed one and one's family. Greedy landowners are the Generals here who cruelly tax their tenants ever harder. Mother Nature herself is also a strict and tempestuous taskmaster as famine and disease strike.The undoubted stars are the cinematography and the Mother of the title. There is a huge sweep of panoramic camera as harvesting scenes, rivalling that of Russian propaganda films and bright sharp colours fill every frame.Nargis, as peasant woman, played by actress Radha, tells us the epic story of her life in flashback, charting how, as a young bride, she arrived at a farm mortgaged to an unscrupulous moneylender. Her husband is then injured in an accident and abandons her and their children, Radha perseveres to bring up her sons and cultivate the land.As is often, so far as I can tell, the case with Indian drama, the family and its issues are paramount and great lengths are taken to explore all moral angles and Mother Earth is no different.Yes, it does swell into high emotion and near melodrama but that's Indian cinema for you, but equally pathos and despair are equally and dramatically handled. The sound, though, is unfortunately, pretty ropey, breaking up with each sibilant word and with a background of quiet crackles.One reviewer complained of poor subtitling - on my DVD (confirmed Amazon purchase) they are fine and include the lyrics to the songs, but maybe mine is a later release. The songs add to the narrative, not the other way around and much is dialogue. The singing is usually actually very lyrical and beautiful, so that it's welcomed, which isn't what I had expected to be the case.",excellent introduction spice colour indian cinema,if like me youre fairly new indian cinema think as i did that its all singing dancing bollywood here is brilliant mix what we might expect epic tale that we west can really appreciate enjoy id only been monochrome world indian director satyajit ray before frankly i didnt seem appreciate those as much as many do time i trust that i will mother india which i bought blind seemed be like approaching say opera by going see one that was commercially accessible but maybe not what purest critics might approve that is was also oscar nominated world cinema category is also testament how popular well thought mehboob khans indian masterpiece was i personally feel that often quoted indian gone with wind is both somewhat false misleading true its scope length as well as beautifully lavish technicolor must have been very expensive make at time bear comparison central character is no hindu vivien leigh either even more amiss is that its not set against background war war indeed centres around land land which sustain crop enough feed one ones family greedy landowners are generals here who cruelly tax their tenants ever harder mother nature herself is also strict tempestuous taskmaster as famine disease strike undoubted stars are cinematography mother title there is huge sweep panoramic camera as harvesting scenes rivalling that russian propaganda films bright sharp colours fill every frame nargis as peasant woman played by actress radha tells us epic story her life flashback charting how as young bride she arrived at farm mortgaged unscrupulous moneylender her husband is then injured accident abandons her their children radha perseveres bring up her sons cultivate land as is often so far as i can tell case with indian drama family its issues are paramount great lengths are taken explore all moral angles mother earth is no different yes it does swell into high emotion near melodrama but thats indian cinema you but equally pathos despair are equally dramatically handled sound though is unfortunately pretty ropey breaking up with each sibilant word with background quiet crackles one reviewer complained poor subtitling my dvd confirmed amazon purchase they are fine include lyrics songs but maybe mine is later release songs add narrative not other way around much is dialogue singing is usually actually very lyrical beautiful so that its welcomed which isnt what i had expected be case,0.5216577540106951,0.1406966726084373,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.27}"
