7.0,"Solid and bleak cop thriller. Yes, we have seen it all before, but this one is definitely not a B-movie.","Solid, bleak and tough thriller. Why the low rating? I guess because it aint got a happy end. And Liam Neeson is playing a bad guy who has got vulnerabilities (Alzheimer). That doesnt gel well with many action movie fans, who mostly prefer to see a glorious upbeat ending.Any bad? Liam Neeson is still a great actor, but he starts to look really old, but despite his age he still pulls it of to convince me that he is a cool, calm and collected hired gun (with a ""good heart""). Really good acting performance!The good: This is still a decent cop thriller. A former (great) James Bond director is directing it. And for petes sake, none other than the brilliant actor Guy Pearce is starring in it.More good: there is enough tough action. The story keeps going. It's bleak. And real. And I didnt get bored for a second. This is simply another well made Liam Neeson action movie, with even some really good supporting actors.Recommended for the fans of this ""old tough man"" genre.

5.0,An improvement for Neeson,"Memory is certainly an improvement over ""The Marksman"" and ""Blacklight,"" as it does have more committed performances from Liam Neeson and Guy Pearce. Their resonant work makes this a breezily watchable experience.There is also an attempt to take on its government corruption themes with a little more intelligence than lesser thrillers have shown in the past.Unfortunately, none of this stops this film from being a largely dull, uninspired rehash of generic action movie plot points that have been done better in dozens of other, better movies.The action sequences are almost completely bereft of thrills, just going for shot/reverse shot during shootouts and shoddy choreography during fights.Each character is reduced to what they do for a living, not really having much of a personality or set of convictions beyond that.Lastly, the ""unreliable memory of the protagonist"" concept is barely used in the story. It could have been used to create a mystery to the events that unfold and what is actually real, but it isn't. All the story's questions are provided with quick and easy answers, and it all results in a very disappointing story with no emotional or intellectual impact.I ended up leaving the theater feeling nothing, because the movie just isn't bad enough nor good enough for anything to be felt or remembered.",improvement neeson,memory is certainly improvement over marksman blacklight as it does have more committed performances liam neeson guy pearce their resonant work makes this breezily watchable experience there is also attempt take its government corruption themes with little more intelligence than lesser thrillers have shown past unfortunately none this stops this film being largely dull uninspired rehash generic action movie plot points that have been done better dozens other better movies action sequences are almost completely bereft thrills just going shot reverse shot during shootouts shoddy choreography during fights each character is reduced what they do living not really having much personality or set convictions beyond that lastly unreliable memory protagonist concept is barely used story it could have been used create mystery events that unfold what is actually real but it isnt all storys questions are provided with quick easy answers it all results very disappointing story with no emotional or intellectual impact i ended up leaving theater feeling nothing because movie just isnt bad enough nor good enough anything be felt or remembered,0.4444717261904762,0.029587053571428577,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.34}"
5.0,Liam Neeson strikes again....,"5.5/10This was one of those movies that could've gone straight to home release and been more enjoyable. However, it goes to theatres and becomes a bit of a disappointment. The acting was mediocre, the story has a moment of strength then collapses, and it's just the same old plot with a slightly different twist.The acting by Liam Neeson and Guy Pearce was good. I found that Neeson was stronger this time around compared to some of his other latest roles, and Pearce fit the role of FBI agent quite well. However, some of the major supporting just didn't seem to care at times. They lacked passion in the role or felt a little awkward.The concept of the film was interesting. Guy is an assassin and taking on one last job until it interferes with his personal code. Then he turns around and begins killing those who've wronged him on the mission, but not without the difficulty of memory loss.On paper it seems like a cool movie with cool characters and a relatively strong story that would be enjoyable. Until you watch it and the parts that tell the story are rushed and the parts that are fillers drag on and take more of the runtime. And honestly, the runtime already feels long at and hour and fifty-four minutes.Overall, I was once again disappointed with a Liam Neeson film. The story lacks good visual representation and strong characters. I'd recommend waiting for this film to come out on a streaming service.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps in your decision-making process of the film. Until next time....

7.0,This was rather enjoyable...,"Well, I have to say that Liam Neeson keeps pumping out good movies these past many recent years. So I have to say that when I sat down to watch ""Memory"" from writer Dario Scardapane and director Martin Campbell, I was harboring some expectations.And ""Memory"" delivers. Yes, this is another coin in the piggybank movie from Liam Neeson. The storyline was nicely written, and it was more than just your average action thriller, because ""Memory"" gives you something to think about with its storyline, and also gives you some great characters.The cast ensemble in ""Memory"" was good. Liam Neeson was just brilliant in this movie and this particular role, and I will say that it was refreshing to see him in a role such as this. The movie also have Guy Pearce, Taj Atwal, Harold Torres, Monica Bellucci and Ray Stevenson on the cast list among others. The entire cast pulled together and performed quite well all throughout the entire movie.""Memory"" is a very engaging action thriller, especially because writer Dario Scardapane immediately sweeps you up and takes you on a thrill-ride with lots of ups and down, and throws enough curveballs at you to keep you in the dark.If you enjoy action thrillers and Liam Neeson, then ""Memory"" is a must-watch movie. I was genuinely entertained by this one. And I dare actually say that it is without a doubt one of the better movies with Liam Neeson, and that says a lot, because he has been putting out a lot of good movies over the past couple of years.I can and will warmly recommend you sit down to watch ""Memory"".My rating of ""Memory"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",this was rather enjoyable,well i have say that liam neeson keeps pumping out good movies these past many recent years so i have say that when i sat down watch memory writer dario scardapane director martin campbell i was harboring some expectations memory delivers yes this is another coin piggybank movie liam neeson storyline was nicely written it was more than just your average action thriller because memory gives you something think about with its storyline also gives you some great characters cast ensemble memory was good liam neeson was just brilliant this movie this particular role i will say that it was refreshing see him role such as this movie also have guy pearce taj atwal harold torres monica bellucci ray stevenson cast list among others entire cast pulled together performed quite well all throughout entire movie memory is very engaging action thriller especially because writer dario scardapane immediately sweeps you up takes you thrill ride with lots ups down throws enough curveballs at you keep you dark if you enjoy action thrillers liam neeson then memory is must watch movie i was genuinely entertained by this one i dare actually say that it is without doubt one better movies with liam neeson that says lot because he has been putting out lot good movies over past couple years i can will warmly recommend you sit down watch memory my rating memory lands seven out ten stars,0.4870588235294117,0.23588235294117652,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"

It's more exciting that way and when you find a little gem the surprise makes it all the better. I was very surprised by how good this one is.The acting was good, the story was interesting and while there isn't a ton of action, the action we get is quick and brutal.

4.0,fails the 20 min test,"The late Roger Ebert had two tests for reviewing films. The first and better-known is to notice whether you are compelled to keep checking your watch toward the middle of a film. Not a good sign. The second test is whether, after the first 20 mins of a film, you have any interest in all in the story, or the characters? Twenty minutes into this film I was more interested in where those positive reviews came from (???) than the actual movie. At 70, Neeson is not only showing his age but the pitch of his voice is off, and the viewer has to strain to hear him. This is a common problem among seniors. I should know. I am one.

7.0,"What I do have, are a very particular set of skills, skills that I, darn, I forgot.","Nothing revolutionary with this film, in fact, it's pretty much formulaic, predictable, and cliched of every action film Neeson has already done - hence the name Memory?, but poorly produced and lazily written, that it ends up as a B-film.

8.0,Neeson's acting chops are on display in full force,"Just like Charles Bronson did, if Liam Neeson keeps making the Revenge flicks , I'll keep watching them !!I knew this flick was going to be good as I saw the previews while attending other movies in the theater , I was not disappointed.This film centers around some dark and twisted topics with loose moral fiber in spades . Neeson's latest movie chalked full of extreme gun violence and has a very talented supporting cast . This impressive ensemble, following Guy Pearce as FBI agent Vincent Serra, Monica Belushi as despicable CEO Davana Sealman, a shady detective played by Ray Stevenson, and more criminal investigators played by Taj Atwal and Harold Torres, somewhat rounding things out.MEMORY follows Alex Lewis (Liam Neeson), an expert assassin with a reputation for discreet precision. Caught in a moral quagmire, Alex refuses to complete a job that violates his code and must quickly hunt down and kill the people who hired him before they and FBI agent Vincent Serra (Guy Pearce) find him first. Alex is built for revenge but, with a memory that is beginning to falter, he is forced to question his every action, blurring the line between right and wrong.This is one of Neeson's better efforts and yields a gripping , albeit dark and violent yet compelling tale. This is a riveting thriller. ""Memory"" feels like a resurgence inside a late-career genre that he had to some (not me personally) seemingly worn out his welcome. Neeson's acting chops are on display in full force as he deals for the mental woes of his memory loss suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's , he does a very fine job in this dark and brooding film.

,He's back and better than ever. Even revenge never had it better.,"""Justice comes down to him."" From The MarksmanVigilante revenge is riddled through American thriller films, and nobody does it better than Liam Neeson. In an interview, he believes audiences love seeing the big old guy kicking butt for the rest of us stuck home from covid, retirement, or whatever.In Martin Campbell's Memory (the 78-year-old Casino Royale director like Neeson still has his mojo), he plays Alex Lewis, a contract killer telling his sponsors he's done, but they refuse to accept his offer. Because his current contract involves murdering a 13-year-old girl, Beatriz (Mia Sanchez), he's not going to do it, period! Per usual, Neeson's hardcore vigilante has his limits: Involving children is a non-no, and it's an immediate softener for the audience. Plus, such a code allows the essential Neeson to emerge-a good guy underneath his ""special skills.""This refinement of past assignments, this surfacing of a standard that brooks no trafficking in young people, is a moral advance for an immoral assassin. The audience immediately sides with the hit man and shows no sympathy for the rich people doing the reprehensible trafficking. Memory's loaded with sympathy for Alex, especially when he connects with FBI agent Vincent, played by Guy Pearce (a nice touch as we remember him in that classic thriller, Memento). Both are tough men on the opposite sides of the law, who have a sympathetic side that ingratiates without sapping the tough guy the audience has always savored.The strongest leitmotif is that of memory, or the lack thereof, so that the early-onset Alzheimer's plays a technical part of the plot and a thematic reminder that combating trafficking is going to involve memory, not just of the computer kind. One memory Alex never loses is the murder of young Beatriz, for whose violent end Alex was not responsible.Along the way, this layered thriller comments on the limits of justice and the questionable answer of vigilantism. While the film leans toward the latter, so too does the stock Neeson character, whose sympathy we have when we see how free the bad boys and girls go.They still need to be wary of old men with dementia-it's those hidden skills, Baby.

7.0,NEESON DOES THE FRACTURED MIND THING...!,"The latest Liam Neeson vehicle has a good pedigree to it, a remake of 2003's Belgium film The Memory of a Killer (which I saw in the theater & remember it being very good) & directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale/Vertical Limit). Neeson is a contract killer working south of the border who is given a job to off a blackmailer & a young hooker back Stateside who're involved in a bigger web of underage trafficking. Investigating the case is a federal agent, Guy Pearce who brings the troubled young girl into protective custody. When Neeson refuses to off the prostitute, his mentor from Mexico does the job instead marking Neeson in the process by the people who hired him in the first place, personified by a scheming business woman played by Monica Bellucci (wasted here, frankly!) who is protecting her philandering son. All of this is par for the course apart from Neeson's character suffering from a form of mental degeneration, something his brother, now in hospice, suffers from, signaling Neeson's fate as he offs every bad guy he can aim at, or remember to aim at, right until the very end. If not for the superior original, which I remember being very dark & rainy, but whose plot I'm a bit foggy on (sorry!), Campbell manages to make a moderately entertaining piece of mimicry but maybe it's me but either some of the actors weren't up to the task or the storyline became as overwrought as Neeson's condition but this one just kept me interested...just.

7.0,A solid 6.5? I agree,"This has a 5? Now color me surprised.For a ""Liam Neeson film"", this is beyond competent and the script was quite satisfying, with layers and introduced-concepts working together to weave tapestry of an actual story someone wanted to tell. You might want to know that this is a remake of a film that was based on a novel.. one that was published around 1985. So you can set your expectations to the kind of developments it may have, but know that it has been used twice now. Still, while you won't see anything you haven't experienced (if you are an avid movie-goer), it is still executed properly (even for today's standards) with turn of events that are quite welcome.. even for an old guy like me.Additionally, Liam is put to good use, and he actually acts in it. And unlike previous entries, the flick doesn't center around him, and the narrative is their focus. Decent set-pieces, cast, and even a few action scenes that don't overstay their welcome. A few additional plotlines not used, but more is better than less.I probably wouldn't watch it again, but a one-time watch (considering how low my expectations were), I had a good time.",solid 6 5 i agree,this has 5 now color me surprised liam neeson film this is beyond competent script was quite satisfying with layers introduced concepts working together weave tapestry actual story someone wanted tell you might want know that this is remake film that was based novel one that was published around 1985 so you can set your expectations kind developments it may have but know that it has been used twice now still while you wont see anything you havent experienced if you are avid movie goer it is still executed properly even todays standards with turn events that are quite welcome even old guy like me additionally liam is put good use he actually acts it unlike previous entries flick doesnt center around him narrative is their focus decent set pieces cast even few action scenes that dont overstay their welcome few additional plotlines not used but more is better than less i probably wouldnt watch it again but one time watch considering how low my expectations were i had good time,0.46266666666666667,0.2513333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1.0,Does he owe everyone favours?,"As I've said in an earlier review, Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor, but he is seriously doing major damage to his legacy. He's too old to play these kind of roles...all they do is emphasise how old and unsuited he is for the role. There's no real age limit on acting...but there is an age limit on the roles you could/should play. Ever since he did 'Taken', it's been overkill on the 'One Man Army' type of films. Honestly, if you've seen one, you've seen them all!People probably won't remember all the great films he's done in the past...they're just gonna remember all the horrible films he did just before he retires/dies. There are hundreds of films that could utilise him - a great actor of a certain age range. Look at Sir Anthony Hopkins, or Sir Ian McKellen...they continue to act, but in roles that they are suited to.Just like another reviewer, I gave this a short time to catch me. But after 25 minutes, I felt NOTHING! I didn't have any interest in the plot, the characters, or anything else connected to the film. It was just so bland. And the reason for this is - HE'S TOO OLD FOR THIS KIND OF ROLE!I'm not saying I never want to see another LN film...of course I'm not...I just never want to see him in an action film, where he is the lead!Imagine Morgan Freeman in the new 'Black Panther' movie as an elder in the tribe - makes sense, right?

8.0,"A slight improvement over ""Blacklight.""","One reason for the upgrade in my rating system was the plot gimmick. My nonagenarian father is gradually going through Alzheimer's, so I can empathize with what Alex Lewis (Liam Neeson's character) is going through. Both in regard to his own mental health and that of his already-vegetative brother!Then, there's the plot premise: child prostitution and sex-slave trafficking. One would think that a professional hit man would be too cold-hearted to have a token set of scruples about that disgusting piece of organized crime. But, it turns out that Alex and his brother were abused children themselves! With Alex's first murder being his own abusive father.So, Alex decides to use what time and lucidity he has left to get justice for the 13-year-old girl who was murdered before she could change her mind about not testifying.I won't spoil the rest of the plot. Suffice it to say that it has a lot of violence, a lot of swearing, and a lot of suggestive video footage to make movie-goers suitably horrified by what the so-called proper authorities are supposed to be looking at.

10.0,"Entertaining and unique, though another viewing may be required.","Having just returned from cinemas after watching this film, I can tell you it's a complex yet engaging action thriller with a twisted plot and explosive action. Liam Neeson delivers one more terrific performance, and there are scenes where he simply leaves you speechless.The film has plenty of action and twists to keep you hooked, though sometimes it gets a little dialogue-heavy. It is redeemed by the gripping storytelling nonetheless. The trick here is that the story appears pretty simple and maybe even outdated when you read the synopsis, but it gets more and more different when you watch it. Especially towards the third act, which is bound to divide the audiences. Before that, the heavy dose of brutal action and suspense keeps the fun coming.By the time I was done with the film, I felt I needed another viewing to clear a few plot points. Being based on a novel, it is dark and brooding for the most part with a visible lack of humor or heavy emotional investment. But that seems to be the intention, and that's why it succeeds instead of totally backfiring. If you like Liam Neeson's action movies, you're getting one again, except this time it is also replete with complex twists and is more thought-inducing than most action thrillers out there. I would love to see the film again, though not in cinemas. Recommended, though you're already warned the film will leave you thinking in many parts and you might not find any respite until the very end.

5.0,You're better off forgetting this movie was released,"I don't know how many times I can express my love for Liam Neeson - the words, ""I love Liam Neeson"" have probably left my mouth more often than the times I have expressed love toward my own parents. Nowadays, however, my self-proclaimed adoration toward the star feels less like genuine admiration and more like a desperate attempt to convince myself I am still a fan of his. Because, even after the simultaneous physical and mental pain I have endured while watching his recent films, including ""The Marksman,"" ""Blacklight,"" ""The Ice Road,"" and ""Honest Thief,"" I still find myself at the theatre opening weekend every time a new Neeson movie is released, knowing the movie will not be good, but hoping against hope that it might be. Spoiler alert: ""Memory"" isn't good.It's astonishing to me that the caliber of filmmakers, actors, and actresses on display in ""Memory"" have turned over a product that seems more like a money-laundering scheme than a real film. Is this the same Martin Campbell that directed ""Casino Royale"" and ""Goldeneye,"" two of the best action movies of all time? The same Martin Campbell that also recently made ""The Foreigner"" and ""The Protege,"" two movies that - while not perfect - still managed to be slick and stylish with a handful of excellent action sequences? Doesn't this movie star three of the best actors working today: Liam Neeson, Guy Pearce, and Monica Bellucci? With all this talent in front of and behind the camera, where did ""Memory"" go wrong?With the intriguing premise of having Neeson play a hitman who is battling Alzheimer's just as much as he is battling flesh and blood humans, ""Memory"" commits a cardinal sin of doing absolutely nothing interesting with this unique concept. You'd think such a plot would be ripe for opportunity, and it is. Campbell and crew instead just decide to do nothing with it. A film portraying an assassin with memory loss is reduced to the most generic depictions of the affliction - Liam fails to recall where he left his car keys; Liam wakes up not remembering where he is, and then questions someone, asking them if he was in a specific place all night; Liam draws a blank on where he left a specific item. A crippling, dehumanizing disease such as Alzheimer's is reduced to bargain-bin generalities that are as predictable as they are boring; even an ounce of creativity would've been appreciated.Because of this shocking lack of innovation, the story ""Memory"" decides to tell just isn't that interesting. IMDb describes the plot as: ""An assassin-for-hire finds that he's become a target after he refuses to complete a job for a dangerous criminal organization."" Sure, it's something we've seen done before, but I'll give ""Memory"" credit where credit is due, as there are a few twists along the way that I didn't expect. However, the hook of having the main character be someone who suffers from memory loss is practically tossed out the window to instead make room for storytelling that is on par with direct-to-DVD geezer-teasers. If you love watching scene after scene of people sitting in rooms having horrendously boring conversations about catching criminals, and not watching said people actually take action toward catching said criminals, then you're going to love this movie because it has been tailor made for you. With only a spattering of action sequences, ""Memory"" devolves into a talkie that is only somewhat well-acted, and somewhat well-written. Liam and Guy bring their A-game, as always - you'd be hard pressed to find either of them give a noticeably bad performance. Everyone else? Borderline embarrassing. Wooden dialogue, stilted acting, and just flat-out bad performances plague this movie; at almost every turn I found myself cringing in my seat, my body heat rising from the second hand embarrassment. Not convinced? I'll give you ten dollars if you see this movie and don't have a seizure from how hilariously awful the pigeon poop line is.But alas, if you're going to see ""Memory,"" you are certainly a fan of Liam Neeson action films, and want to go watch him do what he does best. Does this movie deliver in terms of action? Somewhat. The opening action scene is cool, but it's not really action-heavy or even that visually interesting - it just kind of happens while being neither uninteresting or entertaining. And this theme continues throughout virtually every depiction of violence in this movie. Sure, it's always cool to watch a hitman kill people, but I'd also like to see some creativity at play, some tension being built, some suspense bubbling beneath the surface; you don't get that here. Action comes and then quickly goes almost as fast as it arrived, with little fanfare, almost as if the filmmakers found it tedious to shoot. There is one genuinely entertaining action sequence that takes place in a parking garage that includes fists being thrown and guns being fired - that said, I noticed that, in addition to it looking bland from a visual perspective, the editing was jarring in a few places, cutting suddenly from angle to angle without narrative cohesion.And speaking of how this movie looks, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the visual flair that ""Memory"" employs, or in this case, the lack thereof. This film looks incredibly dull, with no flair or style to speak of; if you would've told me this was filmed to be sent directly to streaming, I'd believe you. This was the most shocking aspect of the movie to me, as Martin Campbell typically delivers a stylish picture. However, whether from disinterest or a lack of adequate quality control, ""Memory"" is about as interesting visually as a newspaper that you've already read: You know what you're getting into when you sit down to look at it - there are no surprises.Complaints aside, I didn't hate this movie. The little action it did have captivated my attention when it was on screen, and it's always fun to see Liam being Liam on the big screen. Slight twists and turns had me genuinely shocked, holding my engagement just enough for me to actively see how the story ended. All of that said, at its core, ""Memory"" is a boring, poorly made film. Virtually every aspect, from the visuals to the storytelling, is generic to the extreme, with little to no genre innovation. The unique premise is not utilized at all, and the action is so sparse that you'll most likely forget you're watching an action film. If you happen to see this movie on streaming one night, I imagine you won't feel like you've wasted time, but I can say with certainty that ""Memory"" is not a film you need to see at the cinema.",youre better off forgetting this movie was released,i dont know how many times i can express my love liam neeson words i love liam neeson have probably left my mouth more often than times i

6.0,"Watchable, and has its moments...","After Liam's last film, Blacklight, I was ready to give up on him but this film seems to be alright. It's not as powerful or as entertaining as his blockbusters like Taken or even his action packed low budget Ice Road, but it is at least watchable.What you will get out of this film is some good action sequences involving his uh... karate chops, quick hands, and bash bash bad guys go down. There are also well choreographed gun fights.However, the film is not very well executed. The beginning seemed really confusing as they tried hard to shuffle all the characters in, many times without sufficiently explaining what was going on and we have to piece it together in our mind based like a jigsaw puzzle. Um, no that's the wrong genre. Films like this should be straight shots and easy to follow.The other issue is the climax scene came 3/4 of the way through the film, leaving a boring 25% trailer ending that was very pointless, boring, and in all honestly, preachy.

7.0,VIEWS ON FILM review of Memory,"2022's Memory was put into theaters in April of this year. It represents that rare Liam Neeson release that's not in the doldrums of winter. If you're a Neeson fan (and I mostly am), then you won't mind anything that goes down in Memory. Heck, you'll ""remember"" it when it's over (har har).Memory runs almost two hours and Neeson as usual, has a special set of skills (duh). His character also has early onset dementia (hence the title). In February's Blacklight, Liam had OCD. Hey, why not keep that status quo rolling.So OK, Memory is coincidental and well, Guy Pearce co-stars in it (do you recall Memento? Too soon?). Memory also has Martin Campbell at the helm. Campbell likes things dark, ominous, loud, and visceral. Every bone crunch by Neeson and every heightened, bloodied shootout is courtesy of Mr. Campbell (I mean he did direct Edge of Darkness).Memory is the ultimate antihero flick and that includes not only Neeson but the law enforcement cohorts he comes into contact with. It doesn't matter whether it's the bad guys or a conscience-filled hitman or the FBI. Everybody dispatches somebody in Memory and they do it with almost a smidgen of comedic shock value.Distributed by Open Road Films and using police car insignia-s, fire truck insignia-s, and regular signage to let us know that it takes place in a certain city (we get it, El Paso, Texas is where things went down), Memory is about a professional assassin named Alex Lewis (Neeson). When Lewis refuses to do a job where he has to kill a teenager owned by human traffickers, he becomes a finish off target himself.Memory is no masterpiece but it has a little more lex talionis and coil going on than your typical Neeson action-er. It's a ""reminder"" that AARP Bryan Mills can still churn out this stuff well into his 70's.",views film review memory,2022s memory was put into theaters april this year it represents that rare liam neeson release thats not doldrums winter if youre neeson fan i mostly am then you wont mind anything that goes down memory heck youll remember it when its over har har memory runs almost two hours neeson as usual has special set skills duh his character also has early onset dementia hence title februarys blacklight liam had ocd hey why not keep that status quo rolling so ok memory is coincidental well guy pearce co stars it do you recall memento too soon memory also has martin campbell at helm campbell likes things dark ominous loud visceral every bone crunch by neeson every heightened bloodied shootout is courtesy mr campbell i mean he did direct edge darkness memory is ultimate antihero flick that includes not only neeson but law enforcement cohorts he comes into contact with it doesnt matter whether its bad guys or conscience filled hitman or fbi everybody dispatches somebody memory they do it with almost smidgen comedic shock value distributed by open road films using police car insignia s fire truck insignia s regular signage let us know that it takes place certain city we get it el paso texas is where things went down memory is about professional assassin named alex lewis neeson when lewis refuses do job where he has kill teenager owned by human traffickers he becomes finish off target himself memory is no masterpiece but it has little more lex talionis coil going than your typical neeson action er its reminder that aarp bryan mills can still churn out this stuff well into his 70s,0.5000663332394101,0.034371184371184374,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.48}"
