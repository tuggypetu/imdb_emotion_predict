8.0,Good for kids,"Well, I didn't like it. Or, at the least what I mean is that I just saw a movie with tons of plot-holes, childish themes, and so on. However, you better believe my kids loved it. My son actually hooted and hollered when Sharkboy started fighting the plugs. He grabbed my shirt and motioned for me to watch, even though I already was. I think I just witnessed my son discovering his first hero.My daughter laughed and laughed. She loved Lavagirl. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. And my daughter is old enough to understand the themes of pursuing your goals and remaining strong in the face of discouragement. So I think she walked away very pleased with the film. She said she wants to be Lavagirl for Halloween.If you're 16+ this movie is a loser. You won't like it, and that explains all the low scores you're seeing here. This movie just isn't for adults. But if you are a parent looking to entertain your kids, this movie works. And if you are reading this near the end of 2005 or later, you should probably know that renting this as a video will be a fine way to keep your kids occupied.-Tony",good kids,well i didnt like it or at least what i mean is that i just saw movie with tons plot holes childish themes so however you better believe my kids loved it my son actually hooted hollered when sharkboy started fighting plugs he grabbed my shirt motioned me watch even though i already was i think i just witnessed my son discovering his first hero my daughter laughed laughed she loved lavagirl she thought it was hilarious when lavagirl zapped sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier my daughter is old enough understand themes pursuing your goals remaining strong face discouragement so i think she walked away very pleased with film she said she wants be lavagirl halloween if youre 16 this movie is loser you wont like it that explains all low scores youre seeing here this movie just isnt adults but if you are parent looking entertain your kids this movie works if you are reading this near end 2005 or later you should probably know that renting this as video will be fine way keep your kids occupied tony,0.48353174603174615,0.2779761904761905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.08}"

7.0,Adults beware...Leave it to the kids!,"I hadn't planned on wasting my time reviewing this mess, but there are some subtleties that crept into my consciousness after the second forced viewing which may enhance a prospective viewer's experience.First of all, this movie obviously was designed for younger kids. That fact alone has a detrimental effect on a review done by an adult (as can be seen by previous reviews). However, it should be noted that a movie for the target audience will most likely be attended by their parents or guardians, and should be at least bearable for them also. This movie falls short in that regard.My son, who is 5, absolutely raves about this movie, and will no doubt wear out the DVD in the next few weeks. But my younger brother, who is 17, walked out five minutes into it. Kids under 12 will probably be best entertained by Sharkboy & Lavagirl. It is a very colourful movie with a lot of motion and many bizarre graphics. There is nothing offensive in this movie by the way. Even the ""fight"" scenes are mild and clean.Now, the main subtlety on my mind is that Sharkboy (who was the best actor in this colourful, but mindless drivel) has obvious hidden talent. This movie, however, was not the right venue to expose that talent. Sharkboy moves well in action scenes and would be more aptly suited to a martial arts style role. Also, Sharkboy has a wide range of facial expressions (although the ones emphasised by this movie consisted mainly of scowls and frowns). With continued training, suitable roles, and of course (and most importantly) proper direction, Sharkboy could go far with his acting career. Also, he is a decent looking lad, which seems to be a requirement for an acting career these days. I'm certainly hoping we'll be seeing more of Sharkboy in the future.Another noted item: If you have the 2D version, it seems to be far superior to the 3D. My son thought the glasses were fun the first time, but after that he didn't want anything to do with them and now only watches the 2D version. Possibly this 3D effect is better if viewed in a theatre.I'm giving out a rating of 7 for this title, simply because it certainly has the ability to entertain the kids...which was its purpose I'm sure. I would definitely recommend Sharkboy & Lavagirl if you have younger children. For adults it has no value whatsoever.",adults beware leave it kids,i hadnt planned wasting my time reviewing this mess but there are some subtleties that crept into my consciousness after second forced viewing which may enhance prospective viewers experience first all this movie obviously was designed younger kids that fact alone has detrimental effect review done by adult as can be seen by previous reviews however it should be noted that movie target audience will most likely be attended by their parents or guardians should be at least bearable them also this movie falls short that regard my son who is 5 absolutely raves about this movie will no doubt wear out dvd next few weeks but my younger brother who is 17 walked out five minutes into it kids under 12 will probably be best entertained by sharkboy lavagirl it is very colourful movie with lot motion many bizarre graphics there is nothing offensive this movie by way even fight scenes are mild clean now main subtlety my mind is that sharkboy who was best actor this colourful but mindless drivel has obvious hidden talent this movie however was not right venue expose that talent sharkboy moves well action scenes would be more aptly suited martial arts style role also sharkboy has wide range facial expressions although ones emphasised by this movie consisted mainly scowls frowns with continued training suitable roles course most importantly proper direction sharkboy could go far with his acting career also he is decent looking lad which seems be requirement acting career these days im certainly hoping well be seeing more sharkboy future another noted item if you have 2d version it seems be far superior 3d my son thought glasses were fun first time but after that he didnt want anything do with them now only watches 2d version possibly this 3d effect is better if viewed theatre im giving out rating 7 this title simply because it certainly has ability entertain kids which was its purpose im sure i would definitely recommend sharkboy lavagirl if you have younger children adults it has no value whatsoever,0.42937900306321364,0.16188387635756057,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,THIS WAS MY AND MANY OTHERS' CHILDHOOD,Hello everyone. I'm sure everyone doesn't care about this movie anymore. Since I'm writing this review in 2019. I just have to say my thoughts about it though. I am 17 now. And saw this movie in 2007 when I was 5 two years after the movie came out. And I need to share an experience my friends and I had recently. We were all at a trivia for our school when suddenly we saw a question that reminded us of this movie. We had all seen it since it was a childhood film of ours and we absolutely loved it. So after that trivia night. We went straight to my house. Found it on on demand. And watched the whole thing. Sure. The movie has poor CGI and it has fart jokes. But half the fun of watching the movie is making fun of it as you watch. It's a children's movie. Made in 2005. What do you expect? But it doesn't matter. Cause I can almost guarantee that your children will be inspired by the creativity of this movie. And will want to dress up as the characters for Halloween. This movie is amazing because it brings kids together. And really stirs up their creative side. And if a group of 15-17 year olds can laugh and have a good time watching this movie. Your kids definitely will. Thank you for reading.,this was my many others childhood,hello everyone im sure everyone doesnt care about this movie anymore since im writing this review 2019 i just have say my thoughts about it though i am 17 now saw this movie 2007 when i was 5 two years after movie came out i need share experience my friends i had recently we were all at trivia our school when suddenly we saw question that reminded us this movie we had all seen it since it was childhood film ours we absolutely loved it so after that trivia night we went straight my house found it demand watched whole thing sure movie has poor cgi it has fart jokes but half fun watching movie is making fun it as you watch its childrens movie made 2005 what do you expect but it doesnt matter cause i can almost guarantee that your children will be inspired by creativity this movie will want dress up as characters halloween this movie is amazing because it brings kids together really stirs up their creative side if group 15 17 year olds can laugh have good time watching this movie your kids definitely will thank you reading,0.505246913580247,0.2740740740740741,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.29}"

7.0,Charming Children's Tale,"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D was probably better to be seen in the theater rather than on the small screen. It also helps to be not over the age of 9.Still bearing that in mind and trying to view the film with a child's eye it's a charming story about a young kid whose make believe fantasy superhero friends come to life and take him to where one of them is from. How'd you like to live on planet drool, as if some us might not live there already. That's where Lavagirl is from and the planet is in danger where kids are being held captive on an eternally moving roller-coaster. When one is on such a machine one hasn't the time to think or even daydream and in this world imagination is the enemy of the ruler, George Lopez who in a Wizard of Oz like turn is also the 3rd grade teacher in real life.Cayden Boyd is the day dreaming Max who even keeps a journal of the adventures of his two friends. Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley are Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Lautner has certainly grown up and out in the past five years and now has some considerable box office pull with the Twilight films. David Arquette and Kristin Davis are Boyd's bickering parents who don't quite seem to have the time for their kid any longer.Sharkboy and Lavagirl is a nice family film for those who have an eye for fantasy of The Wizard Of Oz kind.",charming childrens tale,adventures sharkboy lavagirl 3 d was probably better be seen theater rather than small screen it also helps be not over age 9 still bearing that mind trying view film with childs eye its charming story about young kid whose make believe fantasy superhero friends come life take him where one them is howd you like live planet drool as if some us might not live there already thats where lavagirl is planet is danger where kids are being held captive eternally moving roller coaster when one is such machine one hasnt time think or even daydream this world imagination is enemy ruler george lopez who wizard oz like turn is also 3rd grade teacher real life cayden boyd is day dreaming max who even keeps journal adventures his two friends taylor lautner taylor dooley are sharkboy lavagirl lautner has certainly grown up out past five years now has some considerable box office pull with twilight films david arquette kristin davis are boyds bickering parents who dont quite seem have time their kid any longer sharkboy lavagirl is nice family film those who have eye fantasy wizard oz kind,0.5544642857142856,0.2176542207792208,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Postmodern Masterpiece,"The Adventures of Sharkboy & LavagirlThis film is absolutely not for children. But is a postmodern masterpiece. It is a surrealistic nightmare on par with Eraserhead, as a young boy uses dreams to escape from the ennui of average suburban life. The purposely amateurish CGI work is an obvious satire of the blatant overuse of computer generated imagery in modern films. Additionally, the 3D work is a subtle undermining of the corporate film industry's reliance on this gimmicky technique. It is a psychedelic and stylistic tour de force, by far Rodriguez's best film. The script is a powerful exercise in stream-of-consciousness writing.

7.0,Everything that is or ever was began with a dream,"Max is a 10-year-old schoolboy whose life is not going well. His parents' marriage is not a happy one, and he is not popular at school, often being teased by his classmates for his dreamy, imaginative nature. He escapes into an imaginary dream world named Planet Drool (yes, really). The two main inhabitants of this planet are two superhero-type characters, Sharkboy (who was raised by a family of sharks after his marine biologist father disappeared) and Lavagirl, who has the ability to produce fire and lava. The film follows Max's strange adventures when he is mysteriously transported into his dream world, where he meets Sharkboy and Lavagirl and characters who bear a strange resemblance to his teacher Mr. Electricidad, Linus the class bully and Mr Electricidad's daughter Marissa, another classmate.The film was not popular with the critics, much of the criticism being directed at the allegedly poor 3-D effects and the storyline. It does not seem to be very popular with reviewers on this board either; it is rare that I review a film with a rating as low as 3.5. Well, I myself cannot comment on the 3-D, as I saw it in a 2-D television version. As for the storyline, I felt that too many of the critics were forgetting that this is a children's film and trying to judge it by adult standards.Certainly, judged by the logic of the everyday, rational world the story does not make a great deal of sense. But that is not the logic by which the film should be judged. Its logic is that of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"", that is to say the logic of the dream. As Lavagirl says ""Everything that is or ever was began with a dream"". Much of the story was, in fact, thought up by the children of the writer-director Robert Rodriguez. This is, however, an ""Alice in Wonderland"" updated for the computer age of the 21st century. Mr Electricidad's alter ego on Planet Drool is the planet's electrician Mr. Electric, and much of the film's imagery is drawn from the world of technology, such as a robot or ""plughounds"", dog-like creatures made out of electrical cables. There are, however, more conventional fairy-tale elements, such as the Ice Princess (based on Marissa), who possesses a Crystal Heart which can freeze time.Trying to judge a film like this one is difficult for me, because I have no children of my own. I have to try and think myself back into my own childhood and ask ""Would I have enjoyed a film like this in those days?"" And the answer is ""Yes, I would"", even though ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" is very different to anything that was actually about in the sixties and seventies when I was young. Yes, the story may be eccentric, even at time silly. But that is just what many kids like. 7/10",everything that is or ever was began with dream,max is 10 year old schoolboy whose life is not going well his parents marriage is not happy one he is not popular at school often being teased by his classmates his dreamy imaginative nature he escapes into imaginary dream world named planet drool yes really two main inhabitants this planet are two superhero type characters sharkboy who was raised by family sharks after his marine biologist father disappeared lavagirl who has ability produce fire lava film follows maxs strange adventures when he is mysteriously transported into his dream world where he meets sharkboy lavagirl characters who bear strange resemblance his teacher mr electricidad linus class bully mr electricidads daughter marissa another classmate film was not popular with critics much criticism being directed at allegedly poor 3 d effects storyline it does not seem be very popular with reviewers this board either it is rare that i review film with rating as low as 3 5 well i myself cannot comment 3 d as i saw it 2 d television version as storyline i felt that too many critics were forgetting that this is childrens film trying judge it by adult standards certainly judged by logic everyday rational world story does not make great deal sense but that is not logic by which film should be judged its logic is that alice wonderland or wizard oz that is say logic dream as lavagirl says everything that is or ever was began with dream much story was fact thought up by children writer director robert rodriguez this is however alice wonderland updated computer age 21st century mr electricidads alter ego planet drool is planets electrician mr electric much films imagery is drawn world technology such as robot or plughounds dog like creatures made out electrical cables there are however more conventional fairy tale elements such as ice princess based marissa who possesses crystal heart which can freeze time trying judge film like this one is difficult me because i have no children my own i have try think myself back into my own childhood ask would i have enjoyed film like this those days answer is yes i would even though adventures sharkboy lavagirl is very different anything that was actually about sixties seventies when i was young yes story may be eccentric even at time silly but that is just what many kids like 7 10,0.5359711779448622,0.1136340852130326,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8.0,Huh...,"...I liked it.Yep: I thought it was good. I thought it was better than most contemporary children's movies. Why? 1) Sharkboy and Lavagirl have depth. No, seriously, as superheroes go, they take the angst of the Spiderman movies and adapt it well for a younger crowd.2) It's theme of imagination makes a perfect fall-back. So it seems the movie goes in a stupid direction, huh? Unfortunately I remember my childlike imagination going in that direction as well when I was that age. In fact, almost all of the stuff shown, right down to the ending, fit perfectly the type of random stuff I'd come up with when I was a kid. I related to it perfectly, and I'm usually the type of person who gets angry when a movie doesn't match the type of daydreaming imagination I had when I was little and spent all of my time walking around and around the playground, thinking of random child superheroes to have adventures with.3) At first the virtual reality world is, of course, too cartoony for real-world characters. However, what ends up amazing is how well they interact in such a fake world. It's seamless, and after a while I forgot how fake it was. Much more beloved and much more highly rated films have CGI/special effects worlds that it doesn't even look like the characters are moving in. This one has them walking along in them as if they're really there.4) Rodriguez may not make the most artistic or original movies, but he knows what he's doing when streaming together a line of images. Invisible editing and conscientious directing kept the story flowing pretty much as smoothly as the milk in the cookie land. It was nice to see.5) I didn't get to watch it in 3-D, but it felt like it was in 3-D anyways. GREAT cinematography.So yeah. Good movie. Better than Spy Kids.What probably sets people off are the ending scenes (barely, BARELY worked) and the first few scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl. They're very discombobulating and the acting isn't exactly the best. Finally, Linus/Minus isn't the best child actor I've ever seen, and his character wasn't as developed as it could have been. These are the reasons people have a hard time getting caught in the rest of the movie.I can't make other people like it, but I sure do.--PolarisDiB",huh,i liked it yep i thought it was good i thought it was better than most contemporary childrens movies why 1 sharkboy lavagirl have depth no seriously as superheroes go they take angst spiderman movies adapt it well younger crowd 2 its theme imagination makes perfect fall back so it seems movie goes stupid direction huh unfortunately i remember my childlike imagination going that direction as well when i was that age fact almost all stuff shown right down ending fit perfectly type random stuff id come up with when i was kid i related it perfectly im usually type person who gets angry when movie doesnt match type daydreaming imagination i had when i was little spent all my time walking around around playground thinking random child superheroes have adventures with 3 at first virtual reality world is course too cartoony real world characters however what ends up amazing is how well they interact such fake world its seamless after while i forgot how fake it was much more beloved much more highly rated films have cgi special effects worlds that it doesnt even look like characters are moving this one has them walking along them as if theyre really there 4 rodriguez may not make most artistic or original movies but he knows what hes doing when streaming together line images invisible editing conscientious directing kept story flowing pretty much as smoothly as milk cookie land it was nice see 5 i didnt get watch it 3 d but it felt like it was 3 d anyways great cinematography so yeah good movie better than spy kids what probably sets people off are ending scenes barely barely worked first few scenes with sharkboy lavagirl theyre very discombobulating acting isnt exactly best finally linus minus isnt best child actor ive ever seen his character wasnt as developed as it could have been these are reasons people have hard time getting caught rest movie i cant make other people like it but i sure do polarisdib,0.5331857421331108,0.1971017822333612,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"

4.0,"""But when Max snoozes, he wins.""","A colorful and occasionally imaginative film, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (In 3-D!!!) is an overall disappointment, a movie that had good intentions at the beginning, but devolved into a cheesy ""message for our youth."" The movie revolves around Max (Cayden Boyd), the picked-on grade school student who would rather create his own world rather than live in the real one. Of course he's picked on by class bully Linus (Jacob Davich), of course his parents are always fighting (David Arquette and Kristin Davis), and of course Max lives life as a miserable school student who has very little going for him. Writer/director Robert Rodriguez formulated the entire movie, from story to special effects, based on inspirations provided by his children. There are reasons that most movies, even the bad ones, are not made by children. The movie is well meaning, but relies on too many familiar story devices: class bullies, mean teachers, quiet kids who save the day. We've seen this movie before, but the colorful, Super Mario-Mushroom Kingdom-like worlds that inhabit the movie does add some to the entertainment value. Max is taken to his dream world, known as Planet Drool, by Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), the two superheroes of the world. Each superhero contains some depth, not as much as the superheroes in The Incredibles, but the nice little subplot of each character trying to find their place in the world was a nice touch. For instance, after one difficult scene to watch, we now know Sharkboy cannot rap well at all. Otherwise, the characters are each have one note. George Lopez hams it up, most likely intentionally to offer a cheese element to this movie, but I found his characters to be annoying. The movie's plot lacks any imagination, and the world of Planet Drool does feature some creativity, but not enough to save an otherwise pedestrian family feature. This movie is Rodriguez's second foray into the 3-D genre, and though I did not use the 3-D glasses while viewing the movie, the scenes accenting the technology are pretty obvious to the casual observer and distract from the overall viewing experience. I really enjoyed the visual style Robert Rodriguez employed in Sin City, and that movie may have even been enhanced with a few 3-D moments, but Sharkboy and Lava girl was a move in the opposite direction for the maverick director.",but when max snoozes he wins,colorful occasionally imaginative film adventures sharkboy lavagirl 3 d is overall disappointment movie that had good intentions at beginning but devolved into cheesy message our youth movie revolves around max cayden boyd picked grade school student who would rather create his own world rather than live real one course hes picked by class bully linus jacob davich course his parents are always fighting david arquette kristin davis course max lives life as miserable school student who has very little going him writer director robert rodriguez formulated entire movie story special effects based inspirations provided by his children there are reasons that most movies even bad ones are not made by children movie is well meaning but relies too many familiar story devices class bullies mean teachers quiet kids who save day weve seen this movie before but colorful super mario mushroom kingdom like worlds that inhabit movie does add some entertainment value max is taken his dream world known as planet drool by sharkboy taylor lautner lavagirl taylor dooley two superheroes world each superhero contains some depth not as much as superheroes incredibles but nice little subplot each character trying find their place world was nice touch instance after one difficult scene watch we now know sharkboy cannot rap well at all otherwise characters are each have one note george lopez hams it up most likely intentionally offer cheese element this movie but i found his characters be annoying movies plot lacks any imagination world planet drool does feature some creativity but not enough save otherwise pedestrian family feature this movie is rodriguezs second foray into 3 d genre though i did not use 3 d glasses while viewing movie scenes accenting technology are pretty obvious casual observer distract overall viewing experience i really enjoyed visual style robert rodriguez employed sin city that movie may have even been enhanced with few 3 d moments but sharkboy lava girl was move opposite direction maverick director,0.5491815476190476,0.05770224567099567,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"The grandfather of all movies, even surpasses The Emoji Movie.","I came into the movie with very low expectations. The 3.5 rating on IMDB and all other negative stigma revolving around this title left an impression at first. But, let me tell you, DO NOT listen to those people. I came into the movie, and within the first 5 SECONDS I was already gripped into this story that hasn't even begun yet. As I progressed through the movie, I only got more and more baffled by all of the negative reviews and comments people were leaving. EVERYTHING about this movie is perfect. Everything was done with the utmost care and all the characters are deftly woven into deep, relatable characters that you really care about and want to succeed. The music is fully orchestrated and truly epic, a soundtrack to truly fit the eminence of everything else in the movie. The CGI in the movie is done extremely well, with certain camera tricks and acting makes it look real. I must say all the computer engineers did a great job on their part, precise to the smallest polygon or pixel. The story is an absolute roller-coaster, one emotion to the next, each scene more breathtaking than the last. In short, everything about this movie was perfection in every aspect.In conclusion, do not trust the low IQ nonintellectual degenerates that call this movie ""trash"" or ""only kids stuff"", this is a movie, like many others, which is only for intellectuals and requires a very high IQ to truly understand the depth of what is playing on your television screen. Go see Sharkboy and Lavagirl now, that is, if you're intellect is high enough.",grandfather all movies even surpasses emoji movie,i came into movie with very low expectations 3 5 rating imdb all other negative stigma revolving around this title left impression at first but let me tell you do not listen those people i came into movie within first 5 seconds i was already gripped into this story that hasnt even begun yet as i progressed through movie i only got more more baffled by all negative reviews comments people were leaving everything about this movie is perfect everything was done with utmost care all characters are deftly woven into deep relatable characters that you really care about want succeed music is fully orchestrated truly epic soundtrack truly fit eminence everything else movie cgi movie is done extremely well with certain camera tricks acting makes it look real i must say all computer engineers did great job their part precise smallest polygon or pixel story is absolute roller coaster one emotion next each scene more breathtaking than last short everything about this movie was perfection every aspect conclusion do not trust low iq nonintellectual degenerates that call this movie trash or only kids stuff this is movie like many others which is only intellectuals requires very high iq truly understand depth what is playing your television screen go see sharkboy lavagirl now that is if youre intellect is high enough,0.5217646258503401,0.20377959183673472,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1.0,It's Not Another Spy Kids,"Ten-year-old Max (Cayden Boyd) is having problems at his new school, where he is picked on by classmates and teachers alike after telling them about his superhero friends Shark Boy and Lava Girl (Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley). Everyone thinks he's making them up until one day, they show up to whisk him off to Planet Drool to help them fight the evil Mr. Electric (George Lopez) and Minus.The plot sounds like a film that only kids will like. However, it has Rodriguez behind the camera and he did a good job with the first two Spy Kids movies. Unfortunately, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D is no where near as good as his previous work. Besides for Rodriguez, I didn't really have high hopes for the film Spy Kids 3D was awful and the trailers made this film seem like a joke. While watching the film, I thought it really was a joke. It was really cheesy and it was quite bereft of entertainment. I was hoping the film would start picking up from the weak start. Unfortunately, it didn't.The acting is horrible which is surprising since the kids in Spy Kids were pretty good actors. Taylor Lautner, who plays Sharkboy, does the worst job and he gives a really wooden performance. Taylor Dooley, who plays Lavagirl, isn't much better and her performance is pretty weak. George Lopez just makes a fool of himself and he gives an over the top performance. David Arquette and Kristen Davis both give decent performances but they don't really appear in the film. The lead, who is played by Cayden Boyd, also gives a wooden performance. I know they are just kids but their efforts felt a little weak.I am really disappointed with Robert Rodriguez. The direction was really weak and the editing seem to have been done by a child. He spent too much time on the style instead of the story. Sadly, the film isn't even that stylish and it just looks like a mess. The story is pretty cheesy and lame. I know it was written by a kid but it was still pretty weak. Since the story is weak, the film is very dull. The sad thing is that the movie is only 85 minutes long but it feels so much longer since there is very little here to actually enjoy. The special effects are also pretty bad and they left me with a headache. In the end, this family film is better left on the shelf.

5.0,Most perplexing viewing experience of my life.,"I can't remember the last time a movie confused and tormented my filmgoing soul as much as this movie did. Everything inside of me, everything in me that loves Shawshank Redemption and Vertigo and Raging Bull and all these great great great classic movies tells me that Sharkboy and Lavagirl was awful. And it was. Drastically awful. And I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Let me try and explain it this way - I have written ongoing lists of the greatest films ever made, and the worst films ever made, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl is the only movie I've ever seen that has gotten a placement in both lists for me.Sharkboy is about a young child named Max who dreams up wonderful fantasies and adolescent superhero type adventures. Eventually he travels into this dream world aided by the aforementioned Sharkboy and Lavagirl as they fight to keep the dream world a happy go lucky place from the evil Mr. Electric. So there's the story. Simple, childish, and a bit reminiscent of Neverending Story. I knew this plot before my 6 year old cousin made me watch the film and I sighed. What a waste of two hours this would be. Then something strange happened. I got a chill. Then Lavagirl and Sharkboy appeared and took Max into their spaceship, and I got more chills. Throughout the course of the movie, especially in the end, I was enthralled and received more goosebumps than when I watched Braveheart, much to the embarrassment of my dumbfounded girlfriend.I have no idea how to explain my reaction to the film. I was pleasantly surprised, obviously, and I had a lot of fun watching the movie (I'm excluding the terrible 3-D version of the film, which is a pointless distract-or and takes away a lot of the magic). Then why am I only giving this movie 5 stars out of 10 (a middling mark to avoid giving it a 10 or a 1)? For the same reason why the movie is both on my list of most hated and most loved - it's a bad movie. To say it's a guilty pleasure to me would be underestimating guilt and pleasure. The script is silly, the special effects are slapdash, the editing is at times incoherent, the acting is atrocious, and there are moments where even my 6 year old cousin grimaced at the lame dialogue. But damned if this movie isn't a lot of fun.So I can't really recommend the movie to anyone over the age of 10. I still can't believe that I, a 17 year old classic film lover, enjoyed this movie as much as I did. But I can definitely tell that it's a movie younger kids, especially boys (for I'm pretty sure every boy this age has dreams and fantasies just like the ones in the film) will love. I harkin this bizarre feeling I have for Sharkboy to when you find an old cartoon you used to love as a young child and watch it again. Even though you're reciting the lines and the songs like you did when you were young, you know deep down that if it wasn't a childhood favourite and gave you so much nostalgia, you'd hate it just as much as everyone else. This is what this movie was like for me. It was the childhood flick I never got to see. Maybe that warrants a recommendation. Maybe still not. I really don't know - you'll have to see it for yourself and find out.Or maybe not.",most perplexing viewing experience my life,i cant remember last time movie confused tormented my filmgoing soul as much as this movie did everything inside me everything me that loves shawshank redemption vertigo raging bull all these great great great classic movies tells me that sharkboy lavagirl was awful it was drastically awful i enjoyed almost every minute it let me try explain it this way i have written ongoing lists greatest films ever made worst films ever made sharkboy lavagirl is only movie ive ever seen that has gotten placement both lists me sharkboy is about young child named max who dreams up wonderful fantasies adolescent superhero type adventures eventually he travels into this dream world aided by aforementioned sharkboy lavagirl as they fight keep dream world happy go lucky place evil mr electric so theres story simple childish bit reminiscent neverending story i knew this plot before my 6 year old cousin made me watch film i sighed what waste two hours this would be then something strange happened i got chill then lavagirl sharkboy appeared took max into their spaceship i got more chills throughout course movie especially end i was enthralled received more goosebumps than when i watched braveheart much embarrassment my dumbfounded girlfriend i have no idea how explain my reaction film i was pleasantly surprised obviously i had lot fun watching movie im excluding terrible 3 d version film which is pointless distract or takes away lot magic then why am i only giving this movie 5 stars out 10 middling mark avoid giving it 10 or 1 same reason why movie is both my list most hated most loved its bad movie say its guilty pleasure me would be underestimating guilt pleasure script is silly special effects are slapdash editing is at times incoherent acting is atrocious there are moments where even my 6 year old cousin grimaced at lame dialogue but damned if this movie isnt lot fun so i cant really recommend movie anyone over age 10 i still cant believe that i 17 year old classic film lover enjoyed this movie as much as i did but i can definitely tell that its movie younger kids especially boys im pretty sure every boy this age has dreams fantasies just like ones film will love i harkin this bizarre feeling i have sharkboy when you find old cartoon you used love as young child watch it again even though youre reciting lines songs like you did when you were young you know deep down that if it wasnt childhood favourite gave you so much nostalgia youd hate it just as much as everyone else this is what this movie was like me it was childhood flick i never got see maybe that warrants recommendation maybe still not i really dont know youll have see it yourself find out or maybe not,0.5543650793650795,0.061057486057486066,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.21}"
5.0,Both of us say...Dream on,"This is sort of a double review cause me and my girlfriend watched this together and we both have ""thoughts"" about it.My 9yo cousin gave us this movie just cause he liked it...he even got us a couple pairs of 3d glasses to watch it with.Both of us thought the movie was kid junk, but really isn't that what it was supposed to be? There were some fun spots though.TRAVIS: Most of the characters I hated. (Too bad Mr. Electric didn't do away with some of em before he was defeated.) They were weak and poorly acted...esp. Max. But I liked Sharkboy for the most part. He had that cocky attitude that sort of appeals to me. And, although not original, some of his one-liners were cool.ANNETTE: Travis is a bit harsh (as usual), but I'll agree with him about weak and poorly acted characters. I couldn't even identify with Lavagirl, although I thought she was quite attractive. Sharkboy was a really cute guy though. Mr. Electric/Teacher was nothing short of annoying.TRAVIS: Story was really lame, but it's probably good enough for younger kids. It pretty much bored me tho. Some of the 3d was okay and I noticed it looked a heck of a lot better on our LCD TV than the old one.ANNETTE: Yes. The story was very weak. But it was colourful, and as Travis noted, should appeal to a younger audience. 3d was fun, but not the best I've seen. We watched this on a 27-inch LCD screen with quite nice results.ANNETTE: I thought the scene where Lavagirl zaps Sharkboy out of jealousy was the cutest part of this movie. And the way Sharkboy copied the tone of the Jurassic Park character's false calm in his ""yell...scream"" comment when they were on the ""train-of-thought"" was sort of humorous.TRAVIS: Yeah Annette. You would like that zapping scene! My favourite scene was when Sharkboy says ""ouch"" with that sh*t-eating grin on his face when Lavagirl kisses him.Well, anyhow, as you can see, we didn't totally abhor this movie. Although I think we both agree the only decent acting was by Sharkboy. For the most part this movie was boring. But that's most likely because we are too old for it. If you've got younger kids, it will probably entertain them adequately. Avg. rating=5.TRAVIS: I rated this a 4 cause it seemed to be cranked out without much thought. With some extra work it could have been a lot better. The only reason it gets as high as a 4 is cause I liked Sharkboy.ANNETTE: I rated this a 6 because it seemed to appeal to the audience intended. But I also agree that with more time and attention there certainly could have been a lot of improvement. Perhaps if Rodriguez decides to make a sequel, he will obtain a better story with better actors and surprise us all.",both us say dream,this is sort double review cause me my girlfriend watched this together we both have thoughts about it my 9yo cousin gave us this movie just cause he liked it he even got us couple pairs 3d glasses watch it with both us thought movie was kid junk but really isnt that what it was supposed be there were some fun spots though travis most characters i hated too bad mr electric didnt do away with some em before he was defeated they were weak poorly acted esp max but i liked sharkboy most part he had that cocky attitude that sort appeals me although not original some his one liners were cool annette travis is bit harsh as usual but ill agree with him about weak poorly acted characters i couldnt even identify with lavagirl although i thought she was quite attractive sharkboy was really cute guy though mr electric teacher was nothing short annoying travis story was really lame but its probably good enough younger kids it pretty much bored me tho some 3d was okay i noticed it looked heck lot better our lcd tv than old one annette yes story was very weak but it was colourful as travis noted should appeal younger audience 3d was fun but not best ive seen we watched this 27 inch lcd screen with quite nice results annette i thought scene where lavagirl zaps sharkboy out jealousy was cutest part this movie way sharkboy copied tone jurassic park characters false calm his yell scream comment when they were train thought was sort humorous travis yeah annette you would like that zapping scene my favourite scene was when sharkboy says ouch with that sh t eating grin his face when lavagirl kisses him well anyhow as you can see we didnt totally abhor this movie although i think we both agree only decent acting was by sharkboy most part this movie was boring but thats most likely because we are too old it if youve got younger kids it will probably entertain them adequately avg rating 5 travis i rated this 4 cause it seemed be cranked out without much thought with some extra work it could have been lot better only reason it gets as high as 4 is cause i liked sharkboy annette i rated this 6 because it seemed appeal audience intended but i also agree that with more time attention there certainly could have been lot improvement perhaps if rodriguez decides make sequel he will obtain better story with better actors surprise us all,0.5760753317720531,0.0688407494145199,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
