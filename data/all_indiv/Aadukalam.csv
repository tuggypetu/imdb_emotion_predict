10.0,Thanush owns this all the way,"Let me try to break down my scoring criteria.....1) Casting is nothing short of perfection. Not a character out of place and every character is perfectly suited for the movie. No one tries to stand out or any over the top heroism or villain.2) Dialog is exactly how it needs to be. Again not a word out of place. No ""punch"" dialogues as such.3) Songs - Too good. No silly duets in some eye candy place. Songs are placed at the exact moments it needs to be in the movie.4) Theme - Not often we see such themes on movies and its very hard to make a movie that is interesting and gripping out of such themes. Very well done.5) Last but not the least - Thanush had made a killer of a performance here. Doesn't try to overact or try to be a ""mass"" hero. He fits in exactly how the movie needs him to be. My respect for him as a actor has grown many folds after I watched this movie.Im 100% satisfied with this movie. Top class stuff in every department.",thanush owns this all way,let me try break down my scoring criteria 1 casting is nothing short perfection not character out place every character is perfectly suited movie no one tries stand out or any over top heroism or villain 2 dialog is exactly how it needs be again not word out place no punch dialogues as such 3 songs too good no silly duets some eye candy place songs are placed at exact moments it needs be movie 4 theme not often we see such themes movies its very hard make movie that is interesting gripping out such themes very well done 5 last but not least thanush had made killer performance here doesnt try overact or try be mass hero he fits exactly how movie needs him be my respect him as actor has grown many folds after i watched this movie im 100 satisfied with this movie top class stuff every department,0.5083964646464646,0.2461489898989899,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,One of the best movies of Tamil cinema,"Once we know, Tamil cinema is filled with actors and directors, who concentrate on movies, which concentrated on unbelievable fight scenes and songs in unusual circumstances. But i can see that it is slowly moving into the other side of the cinema, which touches the heart of normal people and in the mean time giving what they need. The movie must have been a complete drama or power packed actions, but the director he brilliantly made this movie in neither of the genre but mixes several genre like action, drama, romance, thriller etc in a single movie but concentrating more on the thrill in the drama, which is very rare in world movies. The songs are beautiful and he used it at right times. Brilliant performance by dhanush, haven't seen him doing a believable performance in many of his movies. In this movie, he was perfect in most of the scenes with his dialogues. But the best part is the movie is not just concentrated on a single character of the movie(99% of Tamil movies will have a story centers around a single character) but it focuses on multiple characters. The other actors performed equally and some better than dhanush. the movie deserves many awards and for sure it is a path breaking movie in Tamil cinema.",one best movies tamil cinema,once we know tamil cinema is filled with actors directors who concentrate movies which concentrated unbelievable fight scenes songs unusual circumstances but i can see that it is slowly moving into other side cinema which touches heart normal people mean time giving what they need movie must have been complete drama or power packed actions but director he brilliantly made this movie neither genre but mixes several genre like action drama romance thriller etc single movie but concentrating more thrill drama which is very rare world movies songs are beautiful he used it at right times brilliant performance by dhanush havent seen him doing believable performance many his movies this movie he was perfect most scenes with his dialogues but best part is movie is not just concentrated single character movie 99 tamil movies will have story centers around single character but it focuses multiple characters other actors performed equally some better than dhanush movie deserves many awards sure it is path breaking movie tamil cinema,0.5420954941116232,0.3048041474654378,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8.0,Blend of entertainment and artistic,"I am stun after watching the movie. The first half of the movie is a very well made entertainer set on a different backdrop (rooster fights). The second half of the movie is totally new for Tamil cinema industry. It deals with the dark side of a man who once used to be good and a governess. Humiliated by his wrong decisions and greediness, how a good man turns self centered and egotistic is what Aadukalam deals with.Dhanush as an actor is at his best after Pudupettai. He has done a lot of hard work for this movie. Topsee the female lead has shown good performance for a new comer. Vetrimaran, this man is really clever and he knows how to make a splendid entertainer which will be considered a good movie even after many years. The characterization of the movie is so fine, that they stay in our hearts for a longtime. Some very important events that happen in the movie are not filmed as part of the movie, but the way they are been conveyed it to the audience, it is wonderful, for example the Pettaikaran getting beaten by the policemen and when Karupus's (Dhanush) mother dies.With regards to the graphics used in the movie, it is very well made and has come out natural that does not make you feel that its graphics but there is a notice in the upfront very beginning of the movie, that the rooster fights shown in this movie are graphics. The interval sequence, WOW it is an edge of the seat thriller. I nearly wondered what could be there in a movie after such a wonderful interval sequence. But there is really something thoughtful even after the interval. Finally the climax of the movie, which made me think for at least two weeks, whether I have seen a similar climax in any other movies so far. My answer was NO, I haven't come across this kind of climax. But to make clear the climax is not so huge or entertaining it is very soft, subtle and accepted, which makes the film more appealing.There is everything in the movie rage, egocentric, humor, love, warmth, and passion.

8.0,"A sheer brilliance of Vetrimaaran in a classic drama of traditional pride, ego, friendship, betrayal, jealousy and sacrifice.","Aadukalam (2011) : Brief Review -A sheer brilliance of Vetrimaaran in a classic drama of traditional pride, ego, friendship, betrayal, jealousy and sacrifice. Aadukalam may feel over the top for non-india audience because it uses the regional topic like cockfight as the main vitamin of the body. But Indian audience who are aware of such traditions especially Tamil audience will find convincing and far more connective. In a village in South India, rearing roosters, maintaining them and using them for fights are a way of life and a matter of honor and lifeline to many people and Aadukalam revolves around this thing. Aadulalam is not an extraordinary story to look from neutral point of view but the way Vetrimaan has directed it and made us believe in whenever he shows is simply remarkable. Like i said, a sheer brilliance of Vettimaaran. Why? Because just look how he has shot those scenes of cockfights and how gripping, tensed and engaging he made all the situations. It was far more superior than human fights we see in films. Keeping the suspense intact even with inhuman elements is a rare thing and that's what Vetrimaaran has done and that too without using artificial elements like sci-fi stuff we see in Hollywood films. Dhanush and Jayapalan's chemistry is fantastic in both positive and negative ways. One more speciality of Aadukalam comes with Jayapalan's character because till the intermission point we are fooled that the negative character is the main villian but in the second half this positive and respected character of Jayapalan turns into negative which is the best trick played by the writer. The Supporting cast, cinematography, dialogues, music everything is well balanced in this terrific film. In a nutshell, Aadukalam is a big nice break from typical films with great use of regional traditions and pride.

6.0,Different halves!,"Well, this movie is very new to the audience. I would say that technically the movie was great except for the editing and bgm during the rooster fight sequence. Dhanush's acting was marvelous. Casting was apt. The movie was nice up till the interval other than the scene in which Dhanush cuts his hand to prove his love, and the song followed by that! I think that wasn't much realistic. Second half is actually the beginning where Director Vetrimaran got mixed up with the steadiness of characterization and logic which is proved when both Karuppu and Durai doesn't listen Pettaikaran during the rooster fight but in the second half they(karuppu & Durai)simply follow whatever Pettaikaran tells. And nowadays Tamil heroines are always in love with a person who doesn't have a job, who has no idea about his future or even don't think about it. It's now has become a cliché. Come on directors, girls aren't like that,they're wise too. This movie is not even close to this team's previous work polladhavan.

7.0,"Good, but should have remained far from the National Award scene.","alright, the reason that compelled me to review Adukalam(2010) is the fact that it won 6 national awards this season. Whilst the movie speaks for itself in the departments of entertainment and dialog, one glance at the list of previous winners is sufficient to put a frown on your face.Vetrimaran, the director and Dhanush, the actor are good at what they do but DO NOT deserve nationwide recognition, oh, and definitely not for this movie. But i guess, there is another way to look at this result - Indian movies in the year 2010 (specifically) were only as good as Aadukalam or lesser...?? Is that the answer ? Hmmm, by all means possible...but not very likely.Anyway, I am, in a sense happy that a Tamil actor, director and film have been recognized as being competitive, but on the other hand, i feel sad that the appreciation has gone overboard. Now, about the movie - it deals with the novel subject of rooster fights and related issues in Madurai. Once again Tamil's madness for Madurai is out in the open - what with typical accents, suggestive language, behavior, etc etc. Phew ! Enough of the temple town and its people ! But what catches the viewer is the interesting human sub-plot that is well woven into the rooster battle. It flows with ease and poise, surprising us and delighting us at the same time. Dhanush's expressions are honest and true which in turn makes Tapsee's seem all the more fake. Nice ensemble of capable actors. GV Prakash's music may not be too bad but seems a tad inspired (uh..the real word should be copied) from Raaja and Rahman, the latter being his uncle.Personally, i thought Leader (2010) should have won for original screenplay, but nonetheless Aadukalam's screenplay deserves mention. We have seen many unbearable ""Entertainers"" and ""Adhiradi Movies"", we have cried in agony and bankruptcy afterward. We have seen movies that insult our intelligence and twist the laws of human existence, we have seen some of the most irritating actors and actresses to have ever come on film, and we have survived.

7.0,Inspiration,"Movie reminds me about the ""Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight"" written by anthropologist Clifford Geertz. ""Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight"" is an essay included in the book The Interpretation of Cultures by anthropologist Clifford Geertz. Considered the most seminal work of Geertz, the essay addresses the meaning of cockfighting in Balinese culture. Cockfights were generally illegal in Indonesia when Geertz was doing his fieldwork there in the 1950s. The first cockfight that he and his wife viewed was broken up by the police. The experience of hiding from the police in the courtyard of a local couple allowed Geertz to break the tension between himself and the villagers, and perform all of the interviews and observation which make up The Interpretation of Cultures. The essay describes how cocks are taken to stand in for powerful men in the villages, and notes that even the double-entendre sense of the word ""cock"" exists in the Balinese language as much as in English.[1] The last half of the essay describes the rituals of betting and concludes that the cockfight is the Balinese comment on themselves, as it embodies the network of social relationships in kin and village that govern traditional Balinese life. The title of the essay is explained as a concept of British philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), who defines ""deep play"" as a game with stakes so high that no rational person would engage in it.
