4,What a letdown,"It's a letdown. The fun and charming bits of Harry Potter were left out of this film. I like J.K. Rowling's work immensely, so that's hard to say.Plot-wise, things are a mess. Newt and his luggage full of magical creatures are a side plot to the important things going on. The real story is that an auror in New York is searching for a powerful and dangerous magical force that manifests within a teenager. His plan: turn the destructive energy the teenager carries into a weapon, I assume. Enter Newt Scamander, who is trying to transport a thunderbird(?) to Arizona for release back into the wild. Some of Newt's other creatures escape in New York, and he has to round them up, all while becoming entangled with the auror and his teenage target.The plot sounds sort of okay, but it's not well integrated. The characters don't add up to much of anything, either. The sidekick baker is fairly likable, though, along with his brewing romance with Queenie. Newt's a bit thin as a character. Eddie Redmayne's dialog also tended to come out mumbled, which made him hard to understand at times. Throw in a few acronyms and oddball words like MACUSA, and that makes for more confusion.Altogether, the film needed more work to tighten the story lines and make Fantastic Beasts a story focused on Newt and his menagerie, instead of what we ended up with.",what letdown,its letdown fun charming bits harry potter were left out this film i like j k rowlings work immensely so thats hard say plot wise things are mess newt his luggage full magical creatures are side plot important things going real story is that auror new york is searching powerful dangerous magical force that manifests within teenager his plan turn destructive energy teenager carries into weapon i assume enter newt scamander who is trying transport thunderbird arizona release back into wild some newts other creatures escape new york he has round them up all while becoming entangled with auror his teenage target plot sounds sort okay but its not well integrated characters dont add up much anything either sidekick baker is fairly likable though along with his brewing romance with queenie newts bit thin as character eddie redmaynes dialog also tended come out mumbled which made him hard understand at times throw few acronyms oddball words like macusa that makes more confusion altogether film needed more work tighten story lines make fantastic beasts story focused newt his menagerie instead what we ended up with,0.5528882575757574,0.1402935606060606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.44}"
6,It was better the second time around...,"I watched the movie back in 2016, when it was just released, and believe you me I wasn't impressed. But then again, I never were heavily into the ""Harry Potter"" universe that Rowling has created.But I sat down in 2022 to watch ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" again, deciding to start over and actually catch up on the two sequel movies that I hadn't seen either. So of course I started from the beginning to get up to speed.Now, I didn't particularly enjoy the 2016 movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" from writer J. K. Rowling and director David Yates. But I guess 6 years softened me up a bit, as I found a bit more enjoyment in the movie the second time around. Hold your horses, because I am not won-over, nor would I consider myself a fan.The storyline in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is adequate. I mean, it is not a movie that requires the audience to invest their heart and soul, so you can essentially just lean back and munch on your snacks while you watch the movie. I found the storyline to be boring the first time around, and now in 2022 I found it a bit more interesting. It still wasn't a riveting storyline that had me on the edge of my seat though.Visually then ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is great. It was so back in 2016, and it is still in 2022. So if for nothing else, then you certainly are in for quite a visual CGI treat if you sit down to watch ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"".Something that is impressive in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", is the cast list. They certainly had managed to put together rather extensive cast ensemble with lots of talented actors and actresses. While I didn't really care much for the character Newt, then actor Eddie Redmayne actually put on a convincing and good performance as Newt. The movie also have the likes of Dan Fogler, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Gemma Chan, Ron Perlman, and Johnny Depp on the cast list.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" certainly is a movie that would have an appeal to the fans of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, of that I am quite certain.My rating of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",it was better second time around,i watched movie back 2016 when it was just released believe you me i wasnt impressed but then again i never were heavily into harry potter universe that rowling has created but i sat down 2022 watch fantastic beasts where find them again deciding start over actually catch up two sequel movies that i hadnt seen either so course i started beginning get up speed now i didnt particularly enjoy 2016 movie fantastic beasts where find them writer j k rowling director david yates but i guess 6 years softened me up bit as i found bit more enjoyment movie second time around hold your horses because i am not won over nor would i consider myself fan storyline fantastic beasts where find them is adequate i mean it is not movie that requires audience invest their heart soul so you can essentially just lean back munch your snacks while you watch movie i found storyline be boring first time around now 2022 i found it bit more interesting it still wasnt riveting storyline that had me edge my seat though visually then fantastic beasts where find them is great it was so back 2016 it is still 2022 so if nothing else then you certainly are quite visual cgi treat if you sit down watch fantastic beasts where find them something that is impressive fantastic beasts where find them is cast list they certainly had managed put together rather extensive cast ensemble with lots talented actors actresses while i didnt really care much character newt then actor eddie redmayne actually put convincing good performance as newt movie also have likes dan fogler colin farrell samantha morton jon voight gemma chan ron perlman johnny depp cast list fantastic beasts where find them certainly is movie that would have appeal fans harry potter franchise that i am quite certain my rating fantastic beasts where find them lands six out ten stars,0.5089109347442681,0.24037477954144618,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.23}"
3,"No charm, no character, no story...just CGI","FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM is the latest instalment in the cash cow HARRY POTTER franchise and a total disappointment as a movie. I didn't expect much when I saw that artificial director David Yates, responsible for the shallowest movies in the Harry Potter film series as well as the awful LEGEND OF TARZAN, was at the helm, but Rowling's first-ever script promised something; it turns out she's a far worse scriptwriter than she is a novelist.This plays out as a prequel to Potter, with Eddie Redmayne - adopting a single gormless expression of wonder from beginning to end - on the hunt for various escaping magical creatures in 1920s New York. There's no plot at all, just endless chase scenes involving poorly animated CGI beasties, so the supporting cast have nothing to do expect add perfunctory romance/comedy/drama, none of which works. The CGI is blatant and used to drive the narrative, which it can't do, so by the time of the umpteenth magical battle you simply don't care. And they're making another four of these?

4,No story & too much CGI,"I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria).There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn't even ""up to today's standards"".My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn't feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can't just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What's next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks. We already have that, it's called Kaiju.",no story too much cgi,i have say that i am really disappointed movie as whole harry potter movies are easily one best most rewatchable movie franchises so far this movie is sadly nothing like original hp movies only thing that is has common are special effects apparitions there was no real dialogue between characters just silly one liners occasional humorous remark i am also very angered by fact that they just introduced new concept obscurials hp franchise that would literally change everything if obscurials exist why hasnt harry potter become one after all he fits criteria there was also way too much cgi movie it became real nuisance after while especially because it wasnt even up todays standards my final critique concerns overall flair movie it just didnt feel like it belongs magnum opus that is hp movie franchise righteously so why did they film it nyc hp franchise is most british thing since james bond doctor who i never really realized it before but now that i watched this movie it became very clear me you cant just change location like this expect audience embrace it sorry whats next fantastic beasts japan no thanks we already have that its called kaiju,0.55992389331099,0.04538192989805892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7,I liked it,"I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again.

3,Just average. Not fantastic,"J.K Rowling, not content with having milked 'Harry Potter' for all it was worth (quite a lot as it turned out) has now decided to expand her 'wizarding world' with this sort of spin-off series.Sadly this first instalment isn't that fantastic, in fact it's lots of special effects holding together a paper thin plot that seems largely to involve poor Eddie Redmayne running here, there and everywhere trying to catch whichever creature has escaped from his suitcase next.There are moments, yes, when this film actually lives up to its billing, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes, but this was a load of old nothing really.",just average not fantastic,j k rowling not content with having milked harry potter all it was worth quite lot as it turned out has now decided expand her wizarding world with this sort spin off series sadly this first instalment isnt that fantastic fact its lots special effects holding together paper thin plot that seems largely involve poor eddie redmayne running here there everywhere trying catch whichever creature has escaped his suitcase next there are moments yes when this film actually lives up its billing ill be interested see where franchise goes but this was load old nothing really,0.5052083333333334,-0.0049107142857142926,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8,"As enchanting as the best 'Harry Potter' films, this beginning of a new chapter in J.K. Rowling's wizarding world is fun, edgy and ceaselessly fascinating","How do you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Before the last of the eight films of J.K. Rowling's staggeringly popular universe five years ago, that must have been the conundrum facing Warner Brothers executives as they stared at the end of the line of their most lucrative franchise. And yet thanks to Rowling herself as well as series stalwart David Yates, there is once again new life to be found in the world of witchcraft and wizardry that she had dreamt up in the seven books of the boy wonder. The inspiration is one of Harry's textbooks at Hogwarts, an essential text which served as a guide to magical animals written by one Newt Scamander. Rowling had written it into a companion piece in 2001, but as those who had read the 128- page book will tell you, there is a lot more that Rowling must have had to add to her first movie script even as an adaptation of that earlier book.That explains why the film's narrative feels like two parallel story lines, both of which are set in the 1920s in New York City. The first (and the one more obviously drawn from her text) concerns the magizoologist and former Hogwarts student's (Eddie Redmayne) arrival with a suitcase of magical creatures in tow. He's here to do field work for the titular book that he's writing, but no thanks to a mix- up involving a klutzy working-class 'no-maj' (meaning 'muggle' or ordinary, non-magical human) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), some of the beasts Newt keeps hidden in his suitcase – which is really a magical device enclosing a massive nature preserve – have escaped. Together with two comely female wizards, the struggling investigator Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson) and her mind-reading sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), Newt and Jacob set out to chase down these creatures before they wreak more havoc on the city.And yet their blithe adventure could not have taken place in a more complicated time – not only has the Magical Congress of the United States (or MACUSA in short) set out strict rules against the revelation of the existence of wizards and/or the wizarding world, its meticulously cautious Madam President (Carmen Ejojo) has outlawed the possession of all beasts. There is perhaps good reason though – the city is torn by a mysterious force purportedly to be that of an Obscurus, a dark and uncontrollable power manifested by wizards who have repressed (rather than being taught to control) their innate powers. Rounding out the second, and much darker, story is a missing dark wizard called Gellert Grindelward (Johnny Depp), which the opening prologue via numerous newspaper reels informs us has gone underground since his dark doings in Europe. It's no secret that Grindelward and by extension, Depp, whom we see only briefly at the end of the movie, will take up much of the acreage of the four other 'Fantastic Beasts' films that Yates and Rowling have planned. Given how this needs to set the stage for the beginning of a new franchise, there is understandably yards of exposition and a lot of introductions to do within the just-over two hours it has. It also means that, aside from its city-shaking cataclysm of a climax, this is pretty much like an origin story, such that like the first 'Harry Potter' movie, one gets the distinct sense that it is holding back for bigger and hopefully even more intriguing things down the road.Not to say that this first of a quintet isn't charming in and of itself; oh no, in fact, we are confident that Potter fans and newcomers alike will find much to love and beguile of the rich and fascinating fictional world that Rowling has created. Indeed, there is sheer delight in discovering the menagerie of creatures that Newt has hidden in his briefcase – among them a scene-stealing platypus with a penchant for stealing shiny things, a majestic avian which changes shape and size to fill any available space, and a tiny stick-like green insect that can pick locks. Before things get serious, the early scenes with Newt and his unlikely companions pop with escapist fun, not least when he and Jacob get caught in incriminating situations by law enforcement while pursuing their small, furry and oh-so-cute kleptomaniac around bank vaults and jewelry stores. It is also here that we get to savour more fully the effortlessly endearing Redmayne and Fogler, one quirkily adorable as the shy and slightly awkward boy-man and the other an unassuming bumbler whose wide-eyed wonder upon the world previously hidden from his eyes channels our very own.Like how she did with Harry, Ron and Hermoine, Rowling gets a strong character dynamic going around the four cohorts, including a budding attraction between Newt and his Auror-turned-ally Tina as well as a gentle romance between Jacob and Queenie. It is these characters that anchor the busy plotting in the second hour with heartfelt emotion. Even so, the beautifully ornate production design shines through every frame, whether a seedy underground jazz club with all manner of peculiar (if slightly grotesque) creatures to Manhattan's old City Hall subway station where the climax unfolds. The special effects are equally stellar, particularly the transition from our world to that inside the suitcase and a breathtaking scene where the Obscurus wrecks destruction across several of New York's skyscrapers before plunging into the City Hall station. And of course, the close-ups of the various beasts are just as visually stunning, some scary, some cuddly, some ethereal and some just downright goofy. Even without the appeal of adorable young children, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is pure enchantment, perfectly setting the stage for a whole new chapter of the wizarding world we've come to embrace through the 'Harry Potter' films. To call it fantastic may be slightly hyperbolic, but you'll be glad to know it doesn't fall too far short.",as enchanting as best harry potter films this beginning new chapter j k rowlings wizarding

4,No Heart or Imagination,"It's always tough for a reboot or a reimagining of a franchise to win over the hearts of all viewers. The Harry Potter films were this generation's Star Wars. It was always going to be an uphill battle for Fantastic Beasts and in my opinion, the film never even got off the ground. With no heart, weak visual effects, and surprisingly little imagination, Fantastic Beasts and How to Get Bored turns out the most disappointing film going experience of this year.I'm going to try and not compare the film too much to its predecessors, because that's ultimately unfair. This was a new thing. There are only a few little references here and there to characters we knew. After all, this film takes place 70 years before Harry entered Hogwarts. With that said, I'm not sure what the appeal here is without an attachment to the series. Sure, J.K. Rowling comes back and makes her screen writing debut, but the script felt so basic and unimaginative. Aside from some nicely time physical humor, this was a sloppily paced missed opportunity.Our new wizard team comprised of talented actors Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Dan Fogler, and Alison Sudol. I'm not sure if it was because the youth and innocence is no longer there (like with the original team at Hogwarts), but I didn't care at all for the team. Fogler, who plays Kowalski, has some great (and I mean great) comedic moments, but I didn't find anything compelling or charismatic about this particular group. Unfortunately, Redmayne gets lost in his obscure quirkiness (as does Ezra Miller for that matter), and Colin Farrell's Graves' character was criminally underused.Speaking of Farrell, I have no idea why he would want to take on such a role. The third act reveals that Farrell is actually the dangerous wizard, Grindelwald undercover. Of course, none other than Johnny Depp himself was officially cast as Grindelwald a few weeks ago for the upcoming films. Why in the world get such a talented actor in Farrell if you're just going to switch him to another famous actor the next second? It just seemed like a waste to me.I hope other people found enjoyment in this film, because I certainly did not. But hey, I still have faith that a sequel could be good. 5 movies? I'm not so sure about, but I wouldn't mind seeing another one of these films. Coming from a big Potter film fan, this was a massive disappointment.+Kowalski provided some entertainment-Farrell wasted-No real heart-The new team is uninteresting and lacks charisma-Surprisingly mediocre CGI4.0/10",no heart or imagination,its always tough reboot or reimagining franchise win over hearts all viewers harry potter films were this generations star wars it was always going be uphill battle fantastic beasts my opinion film never even got off ground with no heart weak visual effects surprisingly little imagination fantastic beasts how get bored turns out most disappointing film going experience this year im going try not compare film too much its predecessors because thats ultimately unfair this was new thing there are only few little references here there characters we knew after all this film takes place 70 years before harry entered hogwarts with that said im not sure what appeal here is without attachment series sure j k rowling comes back makes her screen writing debut but script felt so basic unimaginative aside some nicely time physical humor this was sloppily paced missed opportunity our new wizard team comprised talented actors eddie redmayne katherine waterson dan fogler alison sudol im not sure if it was because youth innocence is no longer there like with original team at hogwarts but i didnt care at all team fogler who plays kowalski has some great i mean great comedic moments but i didnt find anything compelling or charismatic about this particular group unfortunately redmayne gets lost his obscure quirkiness as does ezra miller that matter colin farrells graves character was criminally underused speaking farrell i have no idea why he would want take such role third act reveals that farrell is actually dangerous wizard grindelwald undercover course none other than johnny depp himself was officially cast as grindelwald few weeks ago upcoming films why world get such talented actor farrell if youre just going switch him another famous actor next second it just seemed like waste me i hope other people found enjoyment this film because i certainly did not but hey i still have faith that sequel could be good 5 movies im not so sure about but i wouldnt mind seeing another one these films coming big potter film fan this was massive disappointment kowalski provided some entertainment farrell wasted no real heart new team is uninteresting lacks charisma surprisingly mediocre cgi4 0 10,0.562063935090251,0.041175223412065504,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8,Magical introduction to the new era wizarding world,"Having grown up with the Harry Potter books, and as someone who found a lot to like with all the films (though admittedly some were better than others), expectations were high for 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. Especially also with such good word of mouth.Those high expectations were met, and more. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' serves as an introduction to the new era of the wizarding world, and not succeeds brilliantly doing that but also works as a magical slice of entertainment in its own. A long film it is, but a vast majority of the time it doesn't feel like it, so engrossing is the world that the film creates.Not all's perfect. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' takes a bit of time to get going, with a slow and overlong introduction that tended to also be confusingly written. Jon Voight is wasted as a character with not much personality or development and with a subplot that practically is forgotten about, both by the viewer and by the film. It is too early to tell how well Grindelwald will fare as a villain, but first impressions weren't that promising with Johnny Depp's performance not really igniting my fire, for somebody who specialises in oddball roles he just seemed too lightweight for such an evil character. This said, the future films I'm sure will turn this around if they keep going forward rather than backward.'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' lives up to its name visually. The look of the film is spellbinding, from the wonderful use of colour, with perfectly contrasting shades of light and dark, to cinematography that is never garish and too simple or murky and convoluted, a standout of the latter being that long shot of Credence and Graves in the alley. The standout is easily for the interiors of the suitcase, our looks of awe matching the characters'. Even better are the special effects for the creatures, all of which are technical marvels. This said they are more than that, they are also creatures with their own distinct identity and purpose, as great as Demiguise, Occamy and Thunderbird the standout is the adorable Niffler who also provides some of the biggest and best laughs.James Newton Howard's music score has the right amount of the haunting, the whimsical, the ethereal and the rousing, always dynamic with the action and what's going on in the film. The script has some grim social-commentary and suspense, which gives the film its darkness, while also bringing some perfectly pitched humour (mostly from Jacob and the Niffler), poignant emotion and sense of wonder, while balancing these different tones in a way that never makes one think ""it's trying to be too many things"" or ""it doesn't know what it wants to be"". The references to details from Harry Potter will make die-hard fans squeal with delight, they certainly gave me a sense of nostalgia. There is a lot going on in the story, but all in a way that is told with charm, exuberant and offbeat wit, enchanting imagination and nail-biting suspense. Loved the little details as well, such as the wand-shining house elfs, the bake-offs, the office-cleaning and the magically translucent umbrellas.David Yates was more than ideal as director, having the firm ground from having directed the last four Harry Potter films. There are no complaints to be had visually and technically, and, other than the slow start, could find little to fault with the way the story was told. The characters are well drawn and their personalities well established, with the only real glaring exception being with Voight's character. Found myself really caring for the heroes and the creatures, and got a real sense of threat from the villains (excepting Grindelwald).Acting was top notch, apart from Depp (and Voight doesn't really have much to work with to make any distinction), with Eddie Redmayne on superbly eccentric and endearingly quirky form. He is ideally matched by an affecting Alison Sudol, a charming Katherine Waterson and a highly amusing and amiable Dan Folger. On villain duty is Colin Farrell playing his dastardly role with smarmy relish and a chilling and heart-breakingly repressed Ezra Miller, though the latter is more ambiguous as a character whereas the former is full-on villainous. Samantha Morton also impresses.On the whole, a magical introduction to the new era wizarding world, and mostly it is fantastic. 8/10 Bethany Cox",magical introduction new era wizarding world,having grown up with harry potter books as someone who found lot like with all films though admittedly some were better than others expectations were high fantastic beasts where find them especially also with such good word mouth those high expectations were met more fantastic beasts where find them serves as introduction new era wizarding world not succeeds brilliantly doing that but also works as magical slice entertainment its own long film it is but vast majority time it doesnt feel like it so engrossing is world that film creates not alls perfect fantastic beasts where find them takes bit time get going with slow overlong introduction that tended also be confusingly written jon voight is wasted as character with not much personality or development with subplot that practically is forgotten about both by viewer by film it is too early tell how well grindelwald will fare as villain but first impressions werent that promising with johnny depps performance not really igniting my fire somebody who specialises oddball roles he just seemed too lightweight such evil character this said future films im sure will turn this around if they keep going forward rather than backward fantastic beasts where find them lives up its name visually look film is spellbinding wonderful use colour with perfectly contrasting shades light dark cinematography that is never garish too simple or murky convoluted standout latter being that long shot credence graves alley standout is easily interiors suitcase our looks awe matching characters even better are special effects creatures all which are technical marvels this said they are more than that they are also creatures with their own distinct identity purpose as great as demiguise occamy thunderbird standout is adorable niffler who also provides some biggest best laughs james newton howards music score has right amount haunting whimsical ethereal rousing always dynamic with action whats going film script has some grim social commentary suspense which gives film its darkness while also bringing some perfectly pitched humour mostly jacob niffler poignant emotion sense wonder while balancing these different tones way that never makes one think its trying be too many things or it doesnt know what it wants be references details harry potter will make die hard fans squeal with delight they certainly gave me sense nostalgia there is lot going story but all way that is told with charm exuberant offbeat wit enchanting imagination nail biting suspense loved little details as well such as wand shining house elfs bake offs office cleaning magically translucent umbrellas david yates was more than ideal as director having firm ground having directed last four harry potter films there are no complaints be had visually technically other than slow start could find little fault with way story was told characters are well drawn their personalities well established with only real glaring exception being with voights character found myself really caring heroes creatures got real sense threat villains excepting grindelwald acting was top notch apart depp voight doesnt really have much work with make any distinction with eddie redmayne superbly eccentric endearingly quirky form he is ideally matched by affecting alison sudol charming katherine waterson highly amusing amiable dan folger villain duty is colin farrell playing his dastardly role with smarmy relish chilling heart breakingly repressed ezra miller though latter is more ambiguous as character whereas former is full villainous samantha morton also impresses whole magical introduction new era wizarding world mostly it is fantastic 8 10 bethany cox,0.5591739888274541,0.21100231451716597,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1,Newt's Ark,"David Yates has done it again - what a terrible movie. Boring from beginning to end. J.K. Rowling just wasn't able to write a script that could live up to the Harry Potter books and universe. Fantastic? Not so much. Beasts? Sure, lots of them, but uninteresting. Where to find them? All inside a magical bag. There's absolutely no character development: we get to know very little about Newt Scamander, his personal quest, his thoughts or what drives him; Tina is just bland; and Kowalski is a comic relief that just wasn't necessary. Throughout the movie, you never understand why Newt has a ""Noah complex"" or why he was driven to build his own Ark of magical creatures; there's no tension, no drama involved - muggles don't know about those creatures, so they can't hate them or understand how dangerous they might be, and wizards just don't seem to care enough about them. Why exactly was Newt expelled from Hogwarts? What exactly was his relation to Leta Lestrange? We just don't know. Graves was an interesting character, but very poorly developed. Sure, he is revealed to be something more and we couldn't know too much, but we never get to understand the context in which he professes his ideology. For a movie that revolves around magic, there's actually not that much magic being used during the movie. Maybe next time they should try a movie with less special effects and a little bit more acting. The Harry Potter books were always about the narrative - well written, enticing, thrilling, focused on big existential issues, such as death, the quest for immortality, friendship. This movie was about the visual power of cinema, and that just isn't enough. Besides, a whole generation grew up with Harry Potter, a generation that actually ""grew up"", so a PG movie won't work.",newts ark,david yates has done it again what terrible movie boring beginning end j k rowling just wasnt able write script that could live up harry potter books universe fantastic not so much beasts sure lots them but uninteresting where find them all inside magical bag theres absolutely no character development we get know very little about newt scamander his personal quest his thoughts or what drives him tina is just bland kowalski is comic relief that just wasnt necessary throughout movie you never understand why newt has noah complex or why he was driven build his own ark magical creatures theres no tension no drama involved muggles dont know about those creatures so they cant hate them or understand how dangerous they might be wizards just dont seem care enough about them why exactly was newt expelled hogwarts what exactly was his relation leta lestrange we just dont know graves was interesting character but very poorly developed sure he is revealed be something more we couldnt know too much but we never get understand context which he professes his ideology movie that revolves around magic theres actually not that much magic being used during movie maybe next time they should try movie with less special effects little bit more acting harry potter books were always about narrative well written enticing thrilling focused big existential issues such as death quest immortality friendship this movie was about visual power cinema that just isnt enough besides whole generation grew up with harry potter generation that actually grew up so pg movie wont work,0.5633536360280548,0.08439356186449211,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.55}"

6,Mediocre Movies and How to Avoid Them,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an American/British co-production from last year (2016) that runs for slightly over 2 hours plus roughly 10 minutes of credits. If you read the names of writer J.K. Rowling and director David Yates, you have possibly guessed correctly already that this movie takes place in the Harry Potter universe, namely roughly 70 years earlier, during the days between the two great wars of the 20th century. Fittingly, the visual style of the film reminded me of Boardwalk Empire on more than one occasion. So I guess they did a good job with making things look the way they were back then. But of course, in the center of it all is no gritty crime drama, but it is all about the fantasy. The world of magic is a taboo at that point and a secret society tries their best to keep it that way and to keep people away from finding out about the infinite supernatural possibilities that are out there waiting to be explored.This is where title character Newt Scamander comes into play. He is a young wizard traveling from Britain to the United States and we follow his journey involving new friends and creatures during these 120 minutes. He is played by Eddie Redmayne, the actor who won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking not too long ago, and I must say I like him quite a bit. This is also why I am fairly disappointed how things turned out here. Despite playing the central character, Redmayne never really was given the opportunity by the script to show us his range. Some supporting players had better material than he did. Speaking about supporting characters, I was surprised how the biggest supporting characters were played by relatively unknown actors here, but hey, Rowling made Radcliffe and Watson famous, so maybe she wanted to do something similar here, even if the actors I am talking about are of course grown-ups already. I am not sure. Perhaps it would have been the better opportunity to choose established and famous actors for these roles like they did with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman back then to mention just a few. Still I believe that these relatively unknown actors did a decent job for the most part. The core problems here are elsewhere. The one main problem is that the film keeps losing itself in visual effects on many occasions. And no matter how good they may be, they can never make up for lengths in the story and insufficient character development. This is also the aspect which eventually got me giving this film a thumbs-down and a negative recommendation.I do believe that this film is worse than all the Harry Potter films. Good actors are wasted for characters that are really not well-written at all and also do not make a lot of sense. Yes this especially refers to Colin Farrell here. By the way, after Gilliam's Parnassus movie (because of Heath Ledger's death), this is already the second time he plays the same character like Johnny Depp in a film. And here we have also already the possibly biggest surprise of this film we have here. They managed to keep Depp's inclusion (even if he is gone seconds later again) a secret. Depp, however, will have to do something really great in the upcoming movies if he wants to get this franchise on course. Yep franchise. Of course they are cashing in further with the Potter universe and there will be up to 5 films about Newt Scamander and his companions in the next years. Judging from the quality of this one here, I think one could have been enough. Oh well, there is certainly some irony to the fact that this one here won an Oscar, an achievement that none of the Potter movies have in their uncountable number of awards. Then again, I don't want to be any more disrespectful. The costumes were good I guess and it can be noted that a film can have great costumes and still come short overall with regards to everything else. Or lets say most other aspects. Of course the effects are strong, in quantity and quality, but like I said: To me it looks like they were used very much to make people forget about the lack of sufficient character developments and convincing story-telling. The introduction to the world and new city in the first hour was decent (so was the botched execution scene) and had the film kept that level, I'd certainly have reacted more positively to it all. But it did not. ""Style over substance"" is a fitting description and I suggest you watch something else instead. I must also say that this hardly felt like a Potter film to me. Apart from occasional references like Dobby, the film felt like a standalone movie, but maybe that's also because the story will go on for a long time still. Not a good standalone movie though. I truly truly hope the second film will be better.Correction: I liked it more on rewatch, so I will give this one an additional two stars and raise it from previously 4 to 6.",mediocre movies how avoid them,fantastic beasts where find them is american british co production last year 2016 that runs slightly over 2 hours plus roughly 10 minutes credits if you read names writer j k rowling director david yates you have possibly guessed correctly already that this movie takes place harry potter universe namely roughly 70 years earlier during days between two great wars 20th century fittingly visual style film reminded me boardwalk empire more than one occasion so i guess they did good job with making things look way they were back then but course center it all is no gritty crime drama but it is all about fantasy world magic is taboo at that point secret society tries their best keep it that way keep people away finding out about infinite supernatural possibilities that are out there waiting be explored this is where title character newt scamander comes into play he is young wizard traveling britain united states we follow his journey involving new friends creatures during these 120 minutes he is played by eddie redmayne actor who won oscar playing stephen hawking not too long ago i must say i like him quite bit this is also why i am fairly disappointed how things turned out here despite playing central character redmayne never really was given opportunity by script show us his range some supporting players had better material than he did speaking about supporting characters i was surprised how biggest supporting characters were played by relatively unknown actors here but hey rowling made radcliffe watson famous so maybe she wanted do something similar here even if actors i am talking about are course grown ups already i am not sure perhaps it would have been better opportunity choose established famous actors these roles like they did with maggie smith alan rickman back then mention just few still i believe that these relatively unknown actors did decent job most part core problems here are elsewhere one main problem is that film keeps losing itself visual effects many occasions no matter how good they may be they can never make up lengths story insufficient character development this is also aspect which eventually got me giving this film thumbs down negative recommendation i do believe that this film is worse than all harry potter films good actors are wasted characters that are really not well written at all also do not make lot sense yes this especially refers colin farrell here by way after gilliams parnassus movie because heath ledgers death this is already second time he plays same character like johnny depp film here we have also already possibly biggest surprise this film we have here they managed keep depps inclusion even if he is gone seconds later again secret depp however will have do something really great upcoming movies if he wants get this franchise course yep franchise course they are cashing further with potter universe there will be up 5 films about newt scamander his companions next years judging quality this one here i think one could have been enough oh well there is certainly some irony fact that this one here won oscar achievement that none potter movies have their uncountable number awards then again i dont want be any more disrespectful costumes were good i guess it can be noted that film can have great costumes still come short overall with regards everything else or lets say most other aspects course effects are strong quantity quality but like i said me it looks like they were used very much make people forget about lack sufficient character developments convincing story telling introduction world new city first hour was decent so was botched execution scene had film kept that level id certainly have reacted more positively it all but it did not style over substance is fitting description i suggest you watch something else instead i must also say that this hardly felt like potter film me apart occasional references like dobby film felt like standalone movie but maybe thats also because story will go long time still not good standalone movie though i truly truly hope second film will be better correction i liked it more rewatch so i will give this one additional two stars raise it previously 4 6,0.45109512948222624,0.137989417989418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8,Charming and endearing!,"I admit walking into the theater, I was very excited but also a little apprehensive. I should not have worried at all though, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was incredibly enjoyable! Rowling's magical world is as alluring and fun as ever! For me, the best thing about this movie is exactly that. Exploring this world.In the Harry Potter saga, with the exception of Deathly Hallows, most of the action was confined in Hogwarts. When we were taken out of the school, the main characters, being underage, were not allowed to do magic. The novelty in this movie is that we get to follow a fully fledged adult wizard in an entirely new environment and observe the dynamics and workings of the magical society.Said wizard is Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist that traveled the world in order to find and document rare creatures, which he carries in his magical suitcase. When this suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to muggle Jacob, some of Newt's creatures escape and cause problems in New York.Eddie Redmayne shines in this movie. He plays a very clearly British, endearing and slightly awkward Newt, but the character's kindness is obvious by the loving and friendly way that he treats his magical creatures. Dan Fogler does a great job as Jacob Kowalski, the muggle who is suddenly thrown into a world of wonder that existed beside him all along. He is the one the audience can best relate to, since he mirrors our sense of marvel. Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sudol also do a good job as the two vastly different magical sisters, who aid Newt in his adventure. If I had a small gripe, it would be that the excellent Colin Farell was in my opinion under used.All in all, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a solid and visually stunning movie that manages to achieve three things.First, although it takes place in the Harry Potter universe, it stands apart and has its very own story, which can be enjoyed separately from that of the famous young wizard. Second, it drops quite a few hints and names, which not only tie in nicely with the stories that we know, but also serve to set up the next installments, which are rumored to document Dumbledore's past and connection with Grindelwald. Finally, the movie features a bustling 1926 New York, which coupled with the intriguing character dynamics, offers a brand new insight into Rowling magical world and leaves us poor muggles asking for more.After following Harry's adventures, many of us were left wanting to see much more of the story and luckily for us, it seems Rowling has that much more to offer.

8,Harry Potter's Universe Without Potter is Just as Good,"The magical community in Britain has been fleshed out rather well through the seven Harry Potter books and the eight films that followed, but America's magic users have been pretty much overlooked.Until now.The year is 1926. In the midst of the dark wizard Grindelwald wreaking havoc in Europe, an unassuming man travels to New York City with a case full of, well, fantastic beasts ( a case which goes full TARDIS, as well). There's also an unknown magical threat tearing up streets and striking fear in the hearts of the nomaj (non-magical, US term for muggle) community. The Magical Congress of the United States is searching for the culprit, and who do they blame? The unassuming man, Newt Scamander, a role that Eddie Redmayne fits into perfectly.With the help of Tina Goldstein, a disgraced Auror, and Jacob Kowalski, a nomaj who gets caught up in Scamander's creature exploits, they must clear Scamander's name and find out who is behind the attacks in New York and stop them.This film has a lot going for it, but it really holds up as an installment of the Harry Potter franchise in the way that it showcases the allure of the universe without the old story of The Boy Who Lived. It is also buoyed by great visual effects and witty banter throughout.This will prove to be just the first of possibly many films in the Harry Potter universe (and yes, Johnny Depp does show up as Grindelwald), and if this film is any indicator of the wonder this universe instills, I can't wait for more.",harry potters universe without potter is just as good,magical community britain has been fleshed out rather well through seven harry potter books eight films that followed but americas magic users have been pretty much overlooked until now year is 1926 midst dark wizard grindelwald wreaking havoc europe unassuming man travels new york city with case full well fantastic beasts case which goes full tardis as well theres also unknown magical threat tearing up streets striking fear hearts nomaj non magical us term muggle community magical congress united states is searching culprit who do they blame unassuming man newt scamander role that eddie redmayne fits into perfectly with help tina goldstein disgraced auror jacob kowalski nomaj who gets caught up scamanders creature exploits they must clear scamanders name find out who is behind attacks new york stop them this film has lot going it but it really holds up as installment harry potter franchise way that it showcases allure universe without old story boy who lived it is also buoyed by great visual effects witty banter throughout this will prove be just first possibly many films harry potter universe yes johnny depp does show up as grindelwald if this film is any indicator wonder this universe instills i cant wait more,0.6398428731762065,0.32676767676767676,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1,Are you kidding me?,"Since when movies like this one took over? No plot, no characters development, no substance, cheap jokes here and there and CGI filling up space. Just another film that tries to squeeze bucks out of franchise without genuine effort.Nothing happens throughout the whole movie, literally. For the most of it, Eddie Redmayne searches for his beasts and tries to imprison them in his suitcase. We are supposed to be amazed by them, but we have seen alike a long time ago in previous HP, Avatar or even LOTR movies, so they alone simply don't cut it. Then there is a brief fight with ""the bad slash confused guys"" and that's it.I had a hard time to find out who is the main villain almost the entire movie, and I definitely didn't discover his motives. The revelation of the villain was stupid and embarrassing and everybody except for hardcore HP fans doesn't have a chance to know what the hell is going on with him. Showing this dark matter damaging streets like each 15 minutes didn't help and got quickly boring, because it didn't pose any actual threat to our heroes, and its only purpose was to fill the holes with CGI and banging sound anyway (I guess).I felt no connection to any of the characters whatsoever. Redmayne acts like a crazy nerdo who has feelings only for his monsters, Katherine Waterston is uninteresting bureaucratic mouse and her sister behaves like a slut. The baker was OK, but each one of them was acting unnaturally. This is completely different from HP, where I could feel for Harry (or others for that matter) struggling with his substitute family, adaptation to a foreign environment, love, hate and at last burden of great responsibility, and even though Daniel Radcliffe hasn't shown that great performance at least in the first movies, I could relate to him and understand him.Fantastic Beasts has not brought anything new, we have seen all the wizard stuff before - all the ""automated"" tools working by themselves, habitable suitcase instead of a tent, creation of this defensive bubble etc. New York didn't help either, gone is the magical atmosphere from UK and Hogwarts. The magic as such is treated just too casually here.I hadn't expected much, but still was disappointed.

9,Sometimes a Bit Hard to Know The Foundation of Good and Evil,"I really enjoyed watching this film. It is visually astounding with some amazing creatures which inhabit a world that is familiar to us, New York of the 1920's. Eddie Redmain comes to the big city from London to find a weird creature. It is quite destructive and his task is difficult because laws have been passed against magic. There are several factions in the city, the strength of whom is difficult to pinpoint. We have no trouble realizing who the heroes are, but the infighting within the administration is not totally clear (although I'm probably too inept to get it the first time). There is a delicate balance between the edgy, dire blackness of Harry Potter and its humor. Some of the creatures are hilarious, but when push comes to shove, there is nothing funny about what is happening. Lives are being lost and religious fanatics are seizing power. Life in the city is crippled by poverty and despair. I understand there are several films yet to be made that bank on the unanswered questions in this one. I am hoping to watch this again to get more of an understanding of it. Oh! The special effects are beyond belief.",sometimes bit hard know foundation good evil,i really enjoyed watching this film it is visually astounding with some amazing creatures which inhabit world that is familiar us new york 1920s eddie redmain comes big city london find weird creature it is quite destructive his task is difficult because laws have been passed against magic there are several factions city strength whom is difficult pinpoint we have no trouble realizing who heroes are but infighting within administration is not totally clear although im probably too inept get it first time there is delicate balance between edgy dire blackness harry potter its humor some creatures are hilarious but when push comes shove there is nothing funny about what is happening lives are being lost religious fanatics are seizing power life city is crippled by poverty despair i understand there are several films yet be made that bank unanswered questions this one i am hoping watch this again get more understanding it oh special effects are beyond belief,0.6105299021965688,0.04543851210517877,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"
6,Fantastic meh and where to yawn and meh,"Meh. Just meh. This film looks like a 50 dollar steak but tastes like a turkey sandwich you forgot about in the refrigerator for a day. It isn't bad but doesn't make you want anymore. And I think that is why they had to shoehorn Johnny Depp in at the end of this, because otherwise no one would care enough to watch a sequel. The dude playing the wizard looking for his pets is meh. The story felt like filler. I honestly have no idea why people consider this film anything other than mediocre. I guess die-hard Harry Potter fans are so desperate for more Harry Potter stuff on the big screen that they are willing to pretend this film is something special when it really isn't.",fantastic meh where yawn meh,meh just meh this film looks like 50 dollar steak but tastes like turkey sandwich you forgot about refrigerator day it isnt bad but doesnt make you want anymore i think that is why they had shoehorn johnny depp at end this because otherwise no one would care enough watch sequel dude playing wizard looking his pets is meh story felt like filler i honestly have no idea why people consider this film anything other than mediocre i guess die hard harry potter fans are so desperate more harry potter stuff big screen that they are willing pretend this film is something special when it really isnt,0.6157509157509158,0.006959706959706986,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.19}"
3,Ignore the positive reviews....this movie sucks....hard,"I will keep this brief....No significant story to speak of...the film just drones on and on with the ""gotta catch the creatures that escaped from the suitcase"" crap. That is basically it.Poor/inadequate character development. There are just ""characters"" in the movie....we know little to nothing about them or their motivations....and care little to nothing about what happens to any of them.The essence of the film is ""look at the weird and charming CGI creatures we created"". I cannot believe that after all the years of CGI...the producers of this movie still believed that effects alone can make a movie....but apparently they do. The CGI is not new or refreshing in any way that I could see...just CGI.I am sure this movie will get some audience in the first few days, just by tapping into the ""Harry Potter"" world. But it won't last. Word will get out, and the (currently ridiculously inflated) IMDb ratings will drop like a stone.Take my word on this. This is a boring and bland failure of a movie. I slept through about a third of it, and those moments of unconsciousness were the best part.",ignore positive reviews this movie sucks hard,i will keep this brief no significant story speak film just drones with gotta catch creatures that escaped suitcase crap that is basically it poor inadequate character development there are just characters movie we know little nothing about them or their motivations care little nothing about what happens any them essence film is look at weird charming cgi creatures we created i cannot believe that after all years cgi producers this movie still believed that effects alone can make movie but apparently they do cgi is not new or refreshing any way that i could see just cgi i am sure this movie will get some audience first few days just by tapping into harry potter world but it wont last word will get out currently ridiculously inflated imdb ratings will drop like stone take my word this this is boring bland failure movie i slept through about third it those moments unconsciousness were best part,0.5675925925925928,-0.07132260101010102,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5,More style than substance,"1926, New York. Newt Scamander, an English wizard, has just arrived in the city, complete with a suitcase full of magic, including a rather mysterious creature. He soon discovers that wizards and witches are not looked upon favourably and is soon in trouble with the authorities, due to them clamping down on wizards and witches. When his magical case is switched with that of an everyday, non- magical citizen, adventures ensue.A prequel to Harry Potter, and I'm not a Harry Potter fan. This said, the movie initially seemed to have a decent, intriguing plot, so I had hopes for something good, well, better, more substantial, than Harry Potter.Alas, it was not to be. The movie soon falls back on the Harry Potter formula of style-over-substance disguised by a host of sci fi / fantasy themes, terms and effects. Ends up just being special effects for special effects' sake.",more style than substance,1926 new york newt scamander english wizard has just arrived city complete with suitcase full magic including rather mysterious creature he soon discovers that wizards witches are not looked upon favourably is soon trouble with authorities due them clamping down wizards witches when his magical case is switched with that everyday non magical citizen adventures ensue prequel harry potter im not harry potter fan this said movie initially seemed have decent intriguing plot so i had hopes something good well better more substantial than harry potter alas it was not be movie soon falls back harry potter formula style over substance disguised by host sci fi fantasy themes terms effects ends up just being special effects special effects sake,0.5294764414329631,0.19072871572871572,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,the expanding world of Harry Potter,"J. K. Rowling added a new dimension to the Harry Potter universe with a story about the author of one of Harry's textbooks. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" depicts eccentric wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) in New York City in 1926. A mishap gives Newt a few unplanned adventures amid the supernatural occurrences plaguing the city. And there are a few references that should catch people's attention. Overall, from what I could tell, the movie makes a point about discrimination and witch-hunting (and the laws against wizards marrying non-wizards is probably an allusion to the infamous anti-miscegenation laws).But most importantly, it's a fun movie. As in the original series, each of the characters has something to contribute. David Yates, who directed a couple of the Harry Potter movies, does a good job here.",expanding world harry potter,j k rowling added new dimension harry potter universe with story about author one harrys textbooks fantastic beasts where find them depicts eccentric wizard newt scamander eddie redmayne new york city 1926 mishap gives newt few unplanned adventures amid supernatural occurrences plaguing city there are few references that should catch peoples attention overall what i could tell movie makes point about discrimination witch hunting laws against wizards marrying non wizards is probably allusion infamous anti miscegenation laws but most importantly its fun movie as original series each characters has something contribute david yates who directed couple harry potter movies does good job here,0.5089826839826841,0.15817099567099566,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9,A Harry Potter based film without Harry Potter? No problem.,"Originality is nearly non-existent in the movie industry now a days since sequels, spin-offs, prequels, and Remakes dominate. But I do usually see them because the originals are good. Checking this out in theaters for me didn't require any trailers, because its based on the Harry Potter universe. What's not to like about that?This film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.For the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.The visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the ""fantastic"" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.After the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.",harry potter based film without harry potter no problem,originality is nearly non existent movie industry now days since sequels spin offs prequels remakes dominate but i do usually see them because originals are good checking this out theaters me didnt require any trailers because its based harry potter universe whats not like about that this film is set same universe as harry potter except 1926 new york it is centered wizard newt scamander who brings magical suitcase containing magical creatures new york but when creatures come loose its up him his friends get them back avoid getting exposed non magical people movie mostly has good pace is fun it also introduces interesting ideas universe which really got me intrigued however it can be confusing hard get into at first when i watched it it took me 10 15 minutes understand it but those little nitpicks dont take away good writing this film has characters this film they are pretty enjoyable cast main character newt im just going be honest is moron seriously why would anyone think that bringing suitcase magical creatures that isnt 100 secure city non magical people is wonderful idea however he is fun character with goofy personality if great follow also joining adventure is auror tina her sister queenie who are likable contribute adventure but my favorite character is jacob who is no maj non magical person who gets involved adventure helps newt i liked how he has goofy personality is very funny fantastic beasts movie are also really funny cute as well i only mentioned those because rest cast involves spoilers but characters are overall pleasant additions harry potter universe visual effects this movie are better than shown other 8 harry potter movies budget is 180 million it shows design animals are brilliant just avoid fantastic pun with unique abilities they all stand out rather than simply having dragons other magic film is unique like suitcase i like how this film used many more these ideas bring life doesnt make it stand out as much action scenes or use gimmicks unlike other harry potter films so overall brilliant visual effects add this film after harry potter films i didnt expect this spin off be this good but i was wrong movie is overall holiday treat with fun story characters interesting ideas awesome effects it is recommendation me indeed after this well see if next spin off coming theaters near us rouge one star wars story can top this,0.6003768222518222,0.2928236693861694,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10,Yayor J K Rowling,"21 November 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For those of you who are missing the adventures of Harry Potter and his wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts plugs that gap with alacrity. With a cast headed by the supremely talented Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander, this film immerses us once more into a place where the world of wizard and No-Maj (American for Muggle) collide. We are again treated to an insight of the machinations of J K Rowling's brain, and I for one am always happy that she shares it with our world. You absolutely do not have to watch any of the Harry Potter films to understand any of the references to Muggles, Hogwarts and the like, this film is story on its own and we are introduced to a whole new collection of characters.......and magical beasts, some of which are cute and some downright weird. Excellent visual effects, and a screenplay which includes more than a few lighthearted moments. Another smash from the wizarding world and I eagerly await the next instalment.",yayor j k rowling,21 november 2016 film choice at plaza dorchester tonight fantastic beasts where find them those you who are missing adventures harry potter his wizarding world fantastic beasts plugs that gap with alacrity with cast headed by supremely talented eddie redmayne as newt scamander this film immerses us once more into place where world wizard no maj american muggle collide we are again treated insight machinations j k rowlings brain i one am always happy that she shares it with our world you absolutely do not have watch any harry potter films understand any references muggles hogwarts like this film is story its own we are introduced whole new collection characters magical beasts some which are cute some downright weird excellent visual effects screenplay which includes more than few lighthearted moments another smash wizarding world i eagerly await next instalment,0.6107655502392344,0.2755980861244019,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.43}"
