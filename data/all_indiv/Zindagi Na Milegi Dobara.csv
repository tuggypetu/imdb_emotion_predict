7.0,Life is only once,"Zoya Akhtar's Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, through the lives of three friends, presents the world of contemporary Indian youth, who are successful, affluent yuppies. They just enjoy life because financially they have the means to do it. In mood and execution the film is very modern, light, yet it entails complex relationships in family and between friends. Essentially, in this regard, it has an uncanny resemblance to Dil Chahta Hai, though it's an altogether different film. The movie is non-sentimental and realistic, but it is emotional, and surprisingly enough, quite poetic. The dialogue by Farhan Akhtar is for the most part excellent.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is captivating, interesting and entertaining, and it captures the beauty of Spain with great mastery. At times this presentation is too perfect, but then it's a movie so that's what audiences want to see. It is beautifully shot, with an excellent cinematography working in its favour. The background score is very good, and the songs are very fun and catchy. All these aspects create a lyrical tone that is very uplifting to watch. Some scenes are just amazingly captured. The one when the guys get out of the water after diving, is pure magic. So is the one which shows them skydiving.The film is definitely not flawless, at least from my point of view. The main moral of the story, that life is only once and one should live it to the fullest, is successfully conveyed, generally speaking, but then at times it becomes over-repetitive and saccharine. Towards the second half, it looks like it tries hard to be inspiring and feels too larger-than-life, which it out of place in a film trying to portray realism. The ending is one such instance. Similarly, the friendship between the three leads, which is generally done well, often lacks the natural, understated camaraderie it requires (not because they fight, but in spite of it).Hrithik Roshan finally works as part of an ensemble cast where he doesn't have to carry a film all alone. He plays an imperfect man who grows as a character, and he does it ably. Farhan Akhtar is for the first time convincing and he's natural and enjoyable in a meaty role. Abhay Deol, as the flamboyant, playful guy who's unsure of whether he does or does not want to marry yet, is likable but still a bit of a disappointment. Deol is according to me the best actor of the three, based on what I've seen before, but in this film his character often lets him down--a sad case of weak writing--as it lacks true complexity.I never thought I'd say that, but Katrina Kaif is surprisingly effective and natural, and her part is actually very well written. Laila is lovely, kind, radial and, probably more importantly, is of mixed ethnicity, which makes her line delivery and accent justifiable and credible in this film. This may be the benefit, as it eases the work for Kaif, who, instead of focusing on her accent and Hindi line delivery (which was anyway poor), can for one concentrate on the character. She is never great, but she is good. Kalki is better in a smaller part. Speaking of small parts, Naseeruddin Shah and Deepti Naval, in just two brief scenes each, shine.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara does partially bring forth another step in Hindi cinema's growth and departure from popular convention. It is thoroughly enjoyable, it has both style and substance, and though in my opinion it is nowhere an extraordinary film and is far from being really great, it is still a worthy and appreciable effort about living life to the fullest and cherishing every moment of it.

9.0,Excellent film. Watch it.,"I have seen the film this morning and all the efforts put in are worth the movie. As expected, this is a good movie about grown up men and their emotional problems, which is naturally expected from the team that gave us Dil Chahta Hai and Rock On.A group of three friends (Hrithik, Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar) embark on a road trip in Spain as a part of a bachelor party for Abhay Deol, who is getting married to Kalki, and confused. Hritik and Farhan have their own personal issues too.The movie is a joy ride with subtle comedy. Farhan Akhtar's comic timing is impeccable. The comedy that was written just out of a ladies hand bag is too good.The wafer thin story line is beautifully put on screen with a superb screenplay. The performances are nothing less than your expectations with Hritik in the ensemble. Deepti Naval and Naseeruddin Shah add up to the list of artists.The movie portrays very heavy topics like marriage, love and Work. Yet, due to the sublime comedy you are never bored. I guess that is a mark of excellent script.Here is one line I want to pick up from this movie. Kalki says this line to Abhay Deol, her fianc√©. ""You enjoy your bachelor trip. Aakhir shaadi ke baad you wouldn't feel like going around with your friends any more."" And you should see the expressions on the faces of the three guys...And yes, La Tomatina festival, Spainish beaches, and Katrina Kaif were a treat to watch.",excellent film watch it,i have seen film this morning all efforts put are worth movie as expected this is good movie about grown up men their emotional problems which is naturally expected team that gave us dil chahta hai rock group three friends hrithik abhay deol farhan akhtar embark road trip spain as part bachelor party abhay deol who is getting married kalki confused hritik farhan have their own personal issues too movie is joy ride with subtle comedy farhan akhtars comic timing is impeccable comedy that was written just out ladies hand bag is too good wafer thin story line is beautifully put screen with superb screenplay performances are nothing less than your expectations with hritik ensemble deepti naval naseeruddin shah add up list artists movie portrays very heavy topics like marriage love work yet due sublime comedy you are never bored i guess that is mark excellent script here is one line i want pick up this movie kalki says this line abhay deol her fianc you enjoy your bachelor trip aakhir shaadi ke baad you wouldnt feel like going around with your friends any more you should see expressions faces three guys yes la tomatina festival spainish beaches katrina kaif were treat watch,0.5958333333333333,0.3063461538461538,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Be Yourself...!,"No Farhan Akhtar movie has disappointed me - whether he stars in it or directs it. I am not claiming that he makes great movies - I am merely agreeing that his films are funny, intelligent and definitely entertaining.The Hrithik-Farhan-Abhay trio have done a fabulous job. Incidentally, Katrina too is associated with a movie that makes more sense than all her prior films put-together. There are many instances in the movie where it appears that the actors are being themselves rather than actually acting - which is also the underlying theme of the movie. Be yourself and follow your heart, wherever you go, whatever you do. Credit should be given to director Zoya Akhtar. This movie proves that her previous, Luck By Chance (2009) was not just luck. Cinematography and art direction have also been handled well. It was very refreshing to see Indian actors in casual street clothes holidaying in Spain. However, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy are getting way too repetitive with their tunes, many songs give us a feeling that we have heard them before. This is a summer movie that will give you what you seek - humor and entertainment. Wouldn't it be really fun if we could go on a nice little vacation and figure out what we want to do in life ? Wish life could be that simple.",be yourself,no farhan akhtar movie has disappointed me whether he stars it or directs it i am not claiming that he makes great movies i am merely agreeing that his films are funny intelligent definitely entertaining hrithik farhan abhay trio have done fabulous job incidentally katrina too is associated with movie that makes more sense than all her prior films put together there are many instances movie where it appears that actors are being themselves rather than actually acting which is also underlying theme movie be yourself follow your heart wherever you go whatever you do credit should be given director zoya akhtar this movie proves that her previous luck by chance 2009 was not just luck cinematography art direction have also been handled well it was very refreshing see indian actors casual street clothes holidaying spain however shankar ehsaan loy are getting way too repetitive with their tunes many songs give us feeling that we have heard them before this is summer movie that will give you what you seek humor entertainment wouldnt it be really fun if we could go nice little vacation figure out what we want do life wish life could be that simple,0.5447845804988661,0.17837301587301585,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Perfect summer movie about the journey of Life,"""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"" (ZNMD) is a complex, honest, and thoroughly refreshing story about friendship, about love, about choices, about ... well ... the journey of Life (lit. 'zindagi'). Writer-Director Zoya Akhtar takes three characters we might think we've seen before ... but deftly makes them original, fresh, and unexpectedly engaging. Her intelligent script perfectly balances the very real, even painful, personal transformation of each character with moments of joy, wit, charm, and humour.No one's Life Journey is ever quite what one plans!Our protagonists? Three best friends since childhood: Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), now an investment broker in London; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar), an advertising copywriter in Delhi; and Kabir (Abhay Deol), a construction architect in Mumbai. Ten years after college Kabir's imminent wedding impels 'The Three Musketeers -- all for one, and one for all!' -- to finally embark on the many-times-deferred adventure challenge they'd always planned.ZNMD explores whether three grown men can survive a 3-week road trip together *and* still remain friends *and* still be the same people.Think you've heard similar, before? Guess again! Ms Akhtar elevates the basic 'road movie' premise into something rare and sublime: brilliant character-driven comedy never cheap but often laugh-out-loud funny, and so true to life and people each of us actually know that it genuinely moves the heart as well as the mind and funny-bone. As each ZNMD character in turn challenges his own fear, whatever personal demon that has been holding back his life, it becomes our victory, too.See ZNMD and discover: *your* life may change, too!Such strong story and plot would be lost, without great acting.Farhan Akhtar just gets better and better, as an actor, every time out of the gate. Already one of India's best young directors, his deceptively brash but sensitive and layered acting in ZNMD is quiet excellence ... and deliciously funny.Abhay Deol is not exciting, but I like his potential. A good foil for the other two.However the real revelation in ZNMD is, most surprisingly, he whom we might have *thought* most familiar. Hrithik Roshan we see so often in heavy dramatic and/or demanding multi-part roles -- because, let's face it, he's that rare actor who CAN do them, and do them brilliantly well -- that it's easy to forget just how plain damn funny and versatile he can be. Casting one of the world's more notorious compulsive workaholics as, well, a compulsive workaholic? Absolute genius!On the distaff side ... Katrina Kaif. Wow! Where did this performance come from? She's always been beautiful, of course, but in ZNMD for the first time she shows subtlety and depth as an actress. Easily, her very best work to date.Cannot finish without special mention of the fantastic music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, long my favourite Hindi film composers. Their ZNMD soundtrack perfectly backdrops the film's emotional journey. Irresistibly hummable music spans the full range of moods and emotions, much like our three main characters: everything from amusingly lighthearted ('Senorita', sung by Mssrs Roshan, Akhtar, & Deol) to cool and modern ('Ik Junoon -- Paint It Red') to reflective ('Der Lagi Lakin') and even unabashedly romantic ('Khaabon Ke Parinday').But the rocking 'Dil Dhadakne Do' seems to capture the very Joy of Living ... and that is the ultimate spirit of Zoya Akhtar's ZNMD.Perfect summer movie! 10/10Best film I've seen yet from anywhere in the world, thus far in 2011.",perfect summer movie about journey life,zindagi na milegi dobara znmd is complex honest thoroughly refreshing story about friendship about love about choices about well journey life lit zindagi writer director zoya akhtar takes three characters we might think weve seen before but deftly makes them original fresh unexpectedly engaging her intelligent script perfectly balances very real even painful personal transformation each character with moments joy wit charm humour no ones life journey is ever quite what one plans our protagonists three best friends since childhood arjun hrithik roshan now investment broker london imraan farhan akhtar advertising copywriter delhi kabir abhay deol construction architect mumbai ten years after college kabirs imminent wedding impels three musketeers all one one all finally embark many times deferred adventure challenge theyd always planned znmd explores whether three grown men can survive 3 week road trip together still remain friends still be same people think youve heard similar before guess again ms akhtar elevates basic road movie premise into something rare sublime brilliant character driven comedy never cheap but often laugh out loud funny so true life people each us actually know that it genuinely moves heart as well as mind funny bone as each znmd character turn challenges his own fear whatever personal demon that has been holding back his life it becomes our victory too see znmd discover your life may change too such strong story plot would be lost without great acting farhan akhtar just gets better better as actor every time out gate already one indias best young directors his deceptively brash but sensitive layered acting znmd is quiet excellence deliciously funny abhay deol is not exciting but i like his potential good foil other two however real revelation znmd is most surprisingly he whom we might have thought most familiar hrithik roshan we see so often heavy dramatic or demanding multi part roles because lets face it hes that rare actor who can do them do them brilliantly well that its easy forget just how plain damn funny versatile he can be casting one worlds more notorious compulsive workaholics as well compulsive workaholic absolute genius distaff side katrina kaif wow where did this performance come shes always been beautiful course but znmd first time she shows subtlety depth as actress easily her very best work date cannot finish without special mention fantastic music by shankar ehsaan loy long my favourite hindi film composers their znmd soundtrack perfectly backdrops films emotional journey irresistibly hummable music spans full range moods emotions much like our three main characters everything amusingly lighthearted senorita sung by mssrs roshan akhtar deol cool modern ik junoon paint it red reflective der lagi lakin even unabashedly romantic khaabon ke parinday but rocking dil dhadakne do seems capture very joy living that is ultimate spirit zoya akhtars znmd perfect summer movie 10 10best film ive seen yet anywhere world thus far 2011,0.6056087662337661,0.30808170995670997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Brilliantly showcases India's growing individualism,"On the surface, this movie is a fun-filled breath of fresh air. Fantastic starcast!!! Spain has been captured absolutely beautifully, and its culture has been shown very respectfully from the Tomatino festival to the bull race. It is refreshing to see brand new locales never shown in Bollywood with a down-to-earth yet glamorous starcast. Music is terrific as well.Each character and dialog has been penned with great consideration, and I am sure they are captured from real life. One can easily relate to the camaraderie among the three friends whether it be their silly, nonsensical inside jokes, impromptu fun-filled moments, or moments of pain and joy that strengthen their bonds, reminding one of his/her own most sincere friendships. Farhan's character's poems are delightful. The movie has been directed magnificently. There are some amazing scenes, my favorite being Hrithik's becoming inundated with feelings after his deep-sea diving adventure. Performances are great by all, but Hrithik is the most impressive. Katrina also suited the role wonderfully.However, dig deeper and take a step back, and you'll see a brilliant, thought-provoking, and excellently written film. While we are familiar with the Carpe Diem theme, we have never seen it embraced so wholeheartedly and taken so literally as it has been in this movie. As India's economy and mindset continues to liberalize, we see the birth and emergence of the carefree individual. There are numerous instances and decisions that display this attitude. The one that stands out is Abhay's decision to cancel his marriage despite the fact that both he and his fianc√© like each other, he has proposed, and both families are involved. Another is Naseerudin Shah's dismissive attitude of his actions when he was young and his running away from his responsibilities for his artistic pursuits. Farhan and Hrithik have a one-night stand not knowing if they will see their partners in the future. All these incidents are not at all shown in a negative light. On the contrary, they are shown as a part of life that one should have the courage to accept so that each person can live his/her dream.ZNMD captures this mindset prevalent among the youth in India's metros and showcases it on a such a grand scale, which is surely going to accelerate this new attitude as it permeates throughout India. I believe this is going to make this a cult film to remember, which can join names like 3 Idiots, Taare Zameen Par, Udaan, and Wake Up Sid. I personally find it fascinating to see history repeating itself, with India's cultural revolution an uncanny d√©j√† vu of 1960s America, which also had its share of cult films. (Some films to check out include The Graduate and Pleasantville.)On the whole, this idea of living each day as it is your last, not caring about what others will say, do, or think and pursuing your dreams without worrying about the consequences is encouraged. Some may find this thinking too radical and irresponsible, while others will find it liberalizing and enlightening. Purists and conservatives might find this movie disturbing.",brilliantly showcases indias growing individualism,surface this movie is fun filled breath fresh air fantastic starcast spain has been captured absolutely beautifully its culture has been shown very respectfully tomatino festival bull race it is refreshing see brand new locales never shown bollywood with down earth yet glamorous starcast music is terrific as well each character dialog has been penned with great consideration i am sure they are captured real life one can easily relate camaraderie among three friends whether it be their silly nonsensical inside jokes impromptu fun filled moments or moments pain joy that strengthen their bonds reminding one his her own most sincere friendships farhans characters poems are delightful movie has been directed magnificently there are some amazing scenes my favorite being hrithiks becoming inundated with feelings after his deep sea diving adventure performances are great by all but hrithik is most impressive katrina also suited role wonderfully however dig deeper take step back youll see brilliant thought provoking excellently written film while we are familiar with carpe diem theme we have never seen it embraced so wholeheartedly taken so literally as it has been this movie as indias economy mindset continues liberalize we see birth emergence carefree individual there are numerous instances decisions that display this attitude one that stands out is abhays decision cancel his marriage despite fact that both he his fianc like each other he has proposed both families are involved another is naseerudin shahs dismissive attitude his actions when he was young his running away his responsibilities his artistic pursuits farhan hrithik have one night stand not knowing if they will see their partners future all these incidents are not at all shown negative light contrary they are shown as part life that one should have courage accept so that each person can live his her dream znmd captures this mindset prevalent among youth indias metros showcases it such grand scale which is surely going accelerate this new attitude as it permeates throughout india i believe this is going make this cult film remember which can join names like 3 idiots taare zameen par udaan wake up sid i personally find it fascinating see history repeating itself with indias cultural revolution uncanny d j vu 1960s america which also had its share cult films some films check out include graduate pleasantville whole this idea living each day as it is your last not caring about what others will say do or think pursuing your dreams without worrying about consequences is encouraged some may find this thinking too radical irresponsible while others will find it liberalizing enlightening purists conservatives might find this movie disturbing,0.6484343434343431,0.34421407052986,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is an excellent movie which you can watch ""Dobara"" - Don't miss it","When was the last time you saw a feel good movie? When was the last time you laughed at simple silly conversations, when was the last time you remembered your bachelor days (only if you are married), when was the last time a movie made you think about your life, when was the last time a movie inspired you to enjoy the simple things in life, when was the last time a movie inspires you to let go off your fears..... Well not in the near past, definitely not from Bollywood. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes you through the simple moments of life, the life that every one miss out due to their busy schedule, commitments, etc..etc... and the movie does it through the life of three friends and their extended bachelor party trip. The beauty of the movie is that it concentrates on the life of the friends and how they let go their resistance to themselves and their fears rather than showing obscenity that normally rules movies which are based on bachelor party trips. Zoya does a fantastic job in making the viewers feel every part of the movie with a beautiful blend of nature, good camera work, good script and three gifted actors. There is not a moment in the movie which feels out of place, no songs which you feel is there to enhance the marketability of the movie, everything flows smoothly, everything blends so nicely which gives you the feel good factor that you expect from the movie. All the actors were fabulous and were perfect fit for the roles. To start in alphabetic order i will start with Abhay. What to say about this actor, he brings life to his roles and he has proved it over and over in his movies. I couldn't think about any actor who could have blended so well with the character in the movie like Abhay did. There is no replacement for him. I cant enhance on his character as it will give away the plot. The scenes where all the three friends make fun of people through their silly childhood act under the leadership of Abhay can only be carried out well by Abhay.Hritik is an actor who can do wonders when he lands the right roles. When even the new entrants avoids multi starrier movies, he has taken a role where other actors share more or less the same screen space, with no insecurity and no ego. In the movie you get to see a completely different Hritik, with a script which does not glorify him, he is just a friend among the three and he brings life to the movie with his charm and charisma. Farhan was bit of a surprise to me. He has grown as an actor from ""Rock on"" and ""Karthik calling Karthik"". I always found him to be more fit for a serious character than for the joker in the pack act. He does it extremely well. Probably its because of my prejudice that it was hard for me to take him in the role, but i had to let go my resistance.Katrina portrays a character which is similar to her real life, a mix breed of Indian and Brit, a freedom loving, ""live today"" kind of girl. Her combination with Hritik is electrifying. Kalki is such a good actress. Her expressions helps you relate well to the character. There is nothing to give out as a story, its all about three friends on a trip and trying out different things that they never tried before and how those things change there lives. But the beauty is in the details and climax. I think how the movie ends could have been better but song at the end of the movie with the credit makes up for it. Overall Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara impressed me and lived up to my expectation and above. I hope you would like the movie too. But 'hey', everyone has different opinions, the general review by the critics for the last two movies i reviewed were totally against mine.

,A new idiom and metaphor,"Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai was an iconic movie and was like a breath of fresh air at the time of its release. Zoya's film is a wonderful expression and exploration of the new social dynamics in a fresh new idiom heralded by her brother's earlier work. In the last decade we have seen how some filmmakers have quickly adopted a new idiom, a meta language to depict the changing world order and the place that the modern urban Indian holds within it. Zoya does this beautifully thus elevating what could have been a very ordinary story to a level where it achieves an iconic status. The film depicts the coming of age of a trio of young urbane successful Indians who have to go through certain rites of passage to reach self realization. The element of modernism comes in via the unorthodox paths that these young men adopt to reach that vital stage of real adulthood when they are able to exchange short term temporary needs for real happiness, a kind of worldly ""moksha"" (oxymoron!)The trio undertakes a journey which becomes a metaphor for the journey of the self from boyhood to adulthood. Male bonding and real brotherhood (despite the fact that these men are just friends) is the thread that binds the story in a tightly woven fabric of delightful insights into the complexity of relationships in a modern milieu where the norms of old morality have been quietly exchanged for new ones. Love, romance, sexuality are dealt with in a way that is candid, frank and fresh. The locales that are chosen as settings for this journey are exquisite and breathtakingly beautiful, thus underlining the immense beauty of the world that lies at our feet when we are young and the world is still unexplored. So for example,we have one of the characters in a deep sea dive exploring the depths of the ocean and being reduced to tears by its beauty. The movie abounds in such life changing moments and there is not a single scene when the audience finds it difficult to relate to the protagonists or the storyline. I watched the movie on a week night in a mid-Manhattan cinema and the audience was laughing and silent at all the appropriate places. The film had hit the right spot. I congratulate Zoya and her team on the tight script, the casting, the excellent uplifting cinematography complemented by Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music and the wonderful direction of three great actors. I have always liked Abhay Deol. He is a brave actor and takes on roles that are not necessarily ""heroic"" (as in Bollywood) and always essays them well. Hrithik is seen in a new light and the sensitivity that he brings to his role is worth applauding. Farhan purports to be the ""Joker"" of the pack but is carrying a very real angst in his soul and that is done very well. For me the big surprise of the film was Katrina who comes across as having matured as an actor and looks gorgeous at the same time. There is a new wonderful trend in Indian cinema which we hope will continue unabated and is not killed by the more inane, mind numbing Bollywood brand of cinema. The only thing that will go against this film is that it will not appeal to the masses in the hinterlands where ""DABANGG"" has set a benchmark.",new idiom metaphor,farhan akhtars dil chahta hai was iconic movie was like breath fresh air at time its release zoyas film is wonderful expression exploration new social dynamics fresh new idiom heralded by her brothers earlier work last decade we have seen how some filmmakers have quickly adopted new idiom meta language depict changing world order place that modern urban indian holds within it zoya does this beautifully thus elevating what could have been very ordinary story level where it achieves iconic status film depicts coming age trio young urbane successful indians who have go through certain rites passage reach self realization element modernism comes via unorthodox paths that these young men adopt reach that vital stage real adulthood when they are able exchange short term temporary needs real happiness kind worldly moksha oxymoron trio undertakes journey which becomes metaphor journey self boyhood adulthood male bonding real brotherhood despite fact that these men are just friends is thread that binds story tightly woven fabric delightful insights into complexity relationships modern milieu where norms old morality have been quietly exchanged new ones love romance sexuality are dealt with way that is candid frank fresh locales that are chosen as settings this journey are exquisite breathtakingly beautiful thus underlining immense beauty world that lies at our feet when we are young world is still unexplored so example we have one characters deep sea dive exploring depths ocean being reduced tears by its beauty movie abounds such life changing moments there is not single scene when audience finds it difficult relate protagonists or storyline i watched movie week night mid manhattan cinema audience was laughing silent at all appropriate places film had hit right spot i congratulate zoya her team tight script casting excellent uplifting cinematography complemented by shankar ehsaan loys music wonderful direction three great actors i have always liked abhay deol he is brave actor takes roles that are not necessarily heroic as bollywood always essays them well hrithik is seen new light sensitivity that he brings his role is worth applauding farhan purports be joker pack but is carrying very real angst his soul that is done very well me big surprise film was katrina who comes across as having matured as actor looks gorgeous at same time there is new wonderful trend indian cinema which we hope will continue unabated is not killed by more inane mind numbing bollywood brand cinema only thing that will go against this film is that it will not appeal masses hinterlands where dabangg has set benchmark,0.5190191713048856,0.2904969078540507,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,fantastic... go for it..,"Review in form of an open letter to Farhan Akhtar,Dear Farhan,You simply rock. As director you have created all brilliant films, your debut film Dil Chahta Hai is a cult film, which inspired all directors of India to make fresh looking light hearted urban films. Then came Lakshya, which was not commercially that successful, but was nevertheless a good film. Don, from which I expected nothing, hated the idea as the original starring Big B is one of my most fav Big B film, was splendid and established you as master. As producer, you have attempted fantastic films too. And now as an actor, you are getting better and better day by day. You rocked in Rock On, you were fantastic in LBC and KCK and in ZNMD too you have successfully stolen the show from my favorites Hrithik Roshan and Abhay Deol who have established themselves as good actors.Your role in the film is quite meatier and helps you stealing the show. Hrithik (whom you originally wanted to cast in DCH) is again fantastic in serious-all-business-minded-guy and changed-in-love-living-life-guy both. Abhay Deol is as always dependable, his tricks in the films are hilarious. Chemistry between you three is awesome. It feels like three real friends are on road trip.I hope you make sequel to this as producer, keeping Zoya on director's seat again, as I think, she was brilliant as director. She might have lived her life with lots of male friends as it not for a single moment seems like a film directed by lady director (which was the only minus point of LBC from my point of view). Hoping to see more from her.Dialogues are fantastic and makes one laugh, smile and think for sure. Story, Screenplay and Script are marvelous. Music is in rhythm with film's flow.All positive ‚Äì No. Something minor which I found not-so-positive was Katrina's suitability for Laila's role and SEL's music. Katrina has done decent work compared to her past films, but fails to convince what her character needs to convince (and though I don't like Kariena that much, but I feel she suited for this role very much) though Hrithik being her counter part balances very well, and Hrithik and Katrina looks good together. SEL's music is not as great as their former films, though manages to please.Fav Moments in the film: Too many. Though listing some of them.1. Kabeer's all tricks 2. Imran's flirt with Laila and her friend 3. Imran's each funny comment 4. Imran ‚Äì Arjun fights 5. Bagwati 6. Each Poetry recited by Imran 7. The moments which inspires those Poetries 8. In the Air Scenes 9. Imran & Salman's meeting 10. Imran & Arjun's meeting their after 11. Kabeer's Flashback 12. Arjun crying after Underwater 'Meditation'All and over, it's not DCH, it's not Rock On. Though, it has shades of both the films, but it's quite different story to tell and as it has many pleasing moments, one must watch it.A film fan ‚Äì Hardik Raychanda",fantastic go it,review form open letter farhan akhtar dear farhan you simply rock as director you have created all brilliant films your debut film dil chahta hai is cult film which inspired all directors india make fresh looking light hearted urban films then came lakshya which was not commercially that successful but was nevertheless good film don which i expected nothing hated idea as original starring big b is one my most fav big b film was splendid established you as master as producer you have attempted fantastic films too now as actor you are getting better better day by day you rocked rock you were fantastic lbc kck znmd too you have successfully stolen show my favorites hrithik roshan abhay deol who have established themselves as good actors your role film is quite meatier helps you stealing show hrithik whom you originally wanted cast dch is again fantastic serious all business minded guy changed love living life guy both abhay deol is as always dependable his tricks films are hilarious chemistry between you three is awesome it feels like three real friends are road trip i hope you make sequel this as producer keeping zoya directors seat again as i think she was brilliant as director she might have lived her life with lots male friends as it not single moment seems like film directed by lady director which was only minus point lbc my point view hoping see more her dialogues are fantastic makes one laugh smile think sure story screenplay script are marvelous music is rhythm with films flow all positive no something minor which i found not so positive was katrinas suitability lailas role sels music katrina has done decent work compared her past films but fails convince what her character needs convince though i dont like kariena that much but i feel she suited this role very much though hrithik being her counter part balances very well hrithik katrina looks good together sels music is not as great as their former films though manages please fav moments film too many though listing some them 1 kabeers all tricks 2 imrans flirt with laila her friend 3 imrans each funny comment 4 imran arjun fights 5 bagwati 6 each poetry recited by imran 7 moments which inspires those poetries 8 air scenes 9 imran salmans meeting 10 imran arjuns meeting their after 11 kabeers flashback 12 arjun crying after underwater meditationall over its not dch its not rock though it has shades both films but its quite different story tell as it has many pleasing moments one must watch it film fan hardik raychanda,0.5576648255958603,0.291671144947007,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.23}"

A 3-week road trip with Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), his two best friends since school. The only problem is Arjun is too tied up with work. After much emotional blackmail and cajoling, the boys set off on a journey they were meant to take four years ago. A fantasy holiday they had planned to take after college, which never happened.

10.0,Mind Blowing Stuff,"Before going for this movie I was careful not to read anything about it, not watch a single trailer. This extremism mainly comes from my distrust on Indian Media which trashes movies that are comfortably awesome. Okay. If you are planning to go for it, do not read the rest of this. Come back and do it. This movie deserves an open mind. It shouldn't be that you go inside the theater with some invisible strings controlling how you perceive it. Let me tell you it is simple. It is also beautiful. And the combination makes it immense.Right from the first scene, the director makes this his own. I wonder how many directors in this industry will be able to give a complete character definition of the protagonists through a sequence depicting their luggage-packing-styles for a 3 week trip. Zoya Akhtar does exactly that. She is a genius. I'll come back to her.Lets look at the actors. Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar, Kalki Koechlin, Katrina Kaif and Hrithik Roshan. Abhay Deol is a stalwart. He has been a part of movies that have changed the face of Indian Cinema. Hrithik Roshan is another great actor. His movies have always contained a central theme of self-improvement. And for me, he is mind-blowing. Farhan Akhtar is a multi talented dude. Acting, singing, directing with equal panache. Any competitors? No. Kalki Koechlin has proved her worth in Shaitan and Dev D.The real surprise in this movie comes from Katrina Kaif. She is amazing in this movie as the NRI diving instructor with high intellect. She embodies the role with such ease that she never looks the out-of-place girl she usually does. And she is hot in a very warm way. Her physicality is projected and used by Zoya in a controlled manner which enhances her beauty.Hrithik is at his best, giving 100% to the role and carrying the transformations in his character so smoothly that at the end you feel happy for him. His journey across his life comes alive on screen through his facial expression. And eyes. The use of sunglasses by Zoya is absolutely perfect.Abhay is the usual casual fellow you could find strewn all over India. But such is his expertise, he makes that guy stand out. Where Farhan and Hrithik have characters with a certain premise, Abhay's Kabir(a) is a free-bird. And boy, how he uses the freedom! A treat to watch, his dialogue throwing style adds a very important spice to the movie. It pierces you.Kalki is good. With a limited screen-time, she fares really well. She has one shriek in the whole movie and one funny sequence while singing ""I'm a hot chick in a hard rock world"". These two scenes show us why she is different. Pretty powerful stuff. The perfect sugar coated knife.Farhan. Hats off. You just blew my expectation ceiling with an atomic bomb. Perfect, infallible comic timing. Add to that the raspy, metal-on-wood voice, the casual sense of style, the few looks of soul-searching and the full blown expression of joy after Sky Diving. What you get is in my opinion the best performance I have seen in some time. Character constructed, deconstructed, resurrected with the absolute smoothness of a tequila shot.Cinematography. The whole movie is pivoted on the use of short range focus. Pure genius. It makes the scenes look alive. Almost as if you are looking at the characters in reality.Locales. Its one thing to choose correctly and absolutely another to use it. ZNMD sells Spain like Rafael Nadal and Barcelona. The azure blue ocean, the gray and dark plateaus, the vibrant green forests, the super sexy roads and a flaming yellow sunset. Breathtaking.Songs. What lyrics. Perfectly picturised. Totally blends into the script.Background score. I can't stop if I start on this. The use of the heartbeat promotes the signature sound from the murky depths of Kal Ho Na Ho to the actual surge of nervous energy it stands for. The use of the silencing technique while slowing up the screen pace creates magic moments. And whoever played the rapturous guitar chords did a great job. Awesome.Dialogues. Great. General stuff mostly but again, the relevance and timing kills it.All these factors combined with the finesse of Zoya creates the unforgettable experience of ZNMD. The movie is about a lot of things. About relationships, about self discovery, about losing control, about life in a microscopic view. But above all, it glorifies friendship, a virtue that is priceless. It will take you through a plethora of emotions, evoked by the various situations faced by Imran, Kabir and Arjun. The situations poised are some real problems the current society is facing like career v/s life, identity crisis, family pressure and relationship maintenance. And truly, they fit the characters.The single thing that separates this movie from other hits is the creation of numerous magic moments. Directorial expertise blends with the awesome crew work to make you jump in mirth, look with awe, feel good from within, suppress a tiny tear drop, dance in your mind and applaud a timely joke. I would recommend this movie to everyone, just like Iqbal. It will give you wings. And it will give you the desire to take flight, to live your life like never before.Finally, the idea of using shayaris to verbally emote key junctions of the movie is brilliant. In Farhan's voice, it adds to the overall positive vibration of the movie and moves you. Excellent. Thank you Bollywood, for making this movie.",mind blowing stuff,before going this movie i was careful not read anything about it not watch single trailer this extremism mainly comes my distrust indian media which trashes movies that are comfortably awesome okay if you are planning go it do not read rest this come back do it this movie deserves open mind it shouldnt be that you go inside theater with some invisible strings controlling how you perceive it let me tell you it is simple it is also beautiful combination makes it immense right first scene director makes this his own i wonder how many directors this industry will be able give complete character definition protagonists through sequence depicting their luggage packing styles 3 week trip zoya akhtar does exactly that she is genius ill come back her lets look at actors abhay deol farhan akhtar kalki koechlin katrina kaif hrithik roshan abhay deol is stalwart he has been part movies that have changed face indian cinema hrithik roshan is another great actor his movies have always contained central theme self improvement me he is mind blowing farhan akhtar is multi talented dude acting singing directing with equal panache any competitors no kalki koechlin has proved her worth shaitan dev d real surprise this movie comes katrina kaif she is amazing this movie as nri diving instructor with high intellect she embodies role with such ease that she never looks out place girl she usually does she is hot very warm way her physicality is projected used by zoya controlled manner which enhances her beauty hrithik is at his best giving 100 role carrying transformations his character so smoothly that at end you feel happy him his journey across his life comes alive screen through his facial expression eyes use sunglasses by zoya is absolutely perfect abhay is usual casual fellow you could find strewn all over india but such is his expertise he makes that guy stand out where farhan hrithik have characters with certain premise abhays kabir is free bird boy how he uses freedom treat watch his dialogue throwing style adds very important spice movie it pierces you kalki is good with limited screen time she fares really well she has one shriek whole movie one funny sequence while singing im hot chick hard rock world these two scenes show us why she is different pretty powerful stuff perfect sugar coated knife farhan hats off you just blew my expectation ceiling with atomic bomb perfect infallible comic timing add that raspy metal wood voice casual sense style few looks soul searching full blown expression joy after sky diving what you get is my opinion best performance i have seen some time character constructed deconstructed resurrected with absolute smoothness tequila shot cinematography whole movie is pivoted use short range focus pure genius it makes scenes look alive almost as if you are looking at characters reality locales its one thing choose correctly absolutely another use it znmd sells spain like rafael nadal barcelona azure blue ocean gray dark plateaus vibrant green forests super sexy roads flaming yellow sunset breathtaking songs what lyrics perfectly picturised totally blends into script background score i cant stop if i start this use heartbeat promotes signature sound murky depths kal ho na ho actual surge nervous energy it stands use silencing technique while slowing up screen pace creates magic moments whoever played rapturous guitar chords did great job awesome dialogues great general stuff mostly but again relevance timing kills it all these factors combined with finesse zoya creates unforgettable experience znmd movie is about lot things about relationships about self discovery about losing control about life microscopic view but above all it glorifies friendship virtue that is priceless it will take you through plethora emotions evoked by various situations faced by imran kabir arjun situations poised are some real problems current society is facing like career v s life identity crisis family pressure relationship maintenance truly they fit characters single thing that separates this movie other hits is creation numerous magic moments directorial expertise blends with awesome crew work make you jump mirth look with awe feel good within suppress tiny tear drop dance your mind applaud timely joke i would recommend this movie everyone just like iqbal it will give you wings it will give you desire take flight live your life like never before finally idea using shayaris verbally emote key junctions movie is brilliant farhans voice it adds overall positive vibration movie moves you excellent thank you bollywood making this movie,0.5779704252134158,0.29274426508071366,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,vagabond of emotions;this road movie is a trip to remember,"""Seize the day"", is the whole and soul of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I was actually quite low on expectations with this movie. But this movie has turned out to be a vagabond of friendship, love, adventure, emotions and above all, LIFE.I always believed that Farhan Akhtar is a good showman. Right from Rock On!!, Luck By Chance and the duh Kartik Calling Kartik. But this movie has proved it that he has all the elements that are needed in an actor. He can dance, can cry (can sing of course) and now, he can make you laugh. Abhay ‚Äì Farhan ‚Äì Hrithik are the three mesquiteers.Zoya Akhtar is one more reason to watch this movie. The way she directed Luck By Chance was not all serendipitous, and she has proved it. ZNMD is all her baby. The male bonding penned and filmed by her is pleasant. The Spanish locations are exotic. Dialogues (By Farhan Akhtar) are real and spontaneous. Movie runs with its own good slow pace, which is very much needed for the road movies. Many scenes halt the heart and literally put you on an adventure mode.Movie would have been a way better if songs were good. Editing needed a bit more stitch. I have no complaints regarding the length of the movie, as I can watch this Spanish odyssey for more than two hours with a tub of pop corn and a coke.Overall, this road movie is a trip to remember.",vagabond emotions this road movie is trip remember,seize day is whole soul zindagi na milegi dobara i was actually quite low expectations with this movie but this movie has turned out be vagabond friendship love adventure emotions above all life i always believed that farhan akhtar is good showman right rock luck by chance duh kartik calling kartik but this movie has proved it that he has all elements that are needed actor he can dance can cry can sing course now he can make you laugh abhay farhan hrithik are three mesquiteers zoya akhtar is one more reason watch this movie way she directed luck by chance was not all serendipitous she has proved it znmd is all her baby male bonding penned filmed by her is pleasant spanish locations are exotic dialogues by farhan akhtar are real spontaneous movie runs with its own good slow pace which is very much needed road movies many scenes halt heart literally put you adventure mode movie would have been way better if songs were good editing needed bit more stitch i have no complaints regarding length movie as i can watch this spanish odyssey more than two hours with tub pop corn coke overall this road movie is trip remember,0.45239926739926745,0.3184249084249084,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"

,Its not a film but a OSHO-nik kind of life teaching experience which needs to be watched by all as a must to learn the essential basics of LIVING.,"As I am always partial for the films, which have the power to add something valuable and constructive in your routine lives through their expressive content, therefore I have all good things to say about ZNMD with only 3 negative points which I would like to mention first (apart from its inspired poster). One is its weak soundtrack - lacking the much required melody, which could have taken the important theme of the film to more greater heights. Secondly the film is all about the RICH PEOPLE who can roam around the world as easily as blinking the eye without worrying about any finance or VISA problems. And lastly the overall feel, look and language of the film is entirely Urban and hence it may not be able to impress the people living in Rural regions who would not be able to relate with it. Also, though its basic outline seems to be written around Farhan's earlier DIL CHAHTA HAI, but as the movie progresses it goes on to a different journey altogether which has all the essential life ingredients ranging from friendship, love, sex, hate, fun to the spiritual hidden urges of a human being. But coming to the real value of the film, it is arguably one of the most intelligent and finest movies made in the recent times in Bollywood. Yet it is to be understood that the appreciation here is meant more for its superlative life teaching content and less for its cinematic or entertainment value. Zoya Akhtar delivers a more polished and refine film as her second venture which should be essentially considered as an important spiritual lesson and not just a New Movie meant for entertainment. One reason for this remains that the film doesn't have a Great Storyline. It hasn't got anything new as far as the plot is concerned. But it does have many GOLDEN NUGGETS evenly distributed throughout the film which need to be collected by the viewers and taken home. Contrary to all expectations, the most appreciable step taken by the director in the film is that she doesn't treat any single person as a big star particularly Hrithik Roshan. The film starts off simply without any flashy introduction of its cast. The three lead heroes are all given equal mileage and importance with each one of them leaving his own mark on the viewer individually. And that's indeed a great vision followed by the writer and director. The film basically moves around a road trip and three daring adventures the boys wish to experience in their lifetime. But the condition is that they all have to do it together as a must without any escape or excuse. So if you watch it as a Bollywood movie having an interesting starcast and nice look which might have some great emotional story to tell, then you are sure going to be disappointed. Hence, my suggestion would be to watch it as an adventure movie with people having fun on the screen and realizing their inner potentials on a road trip.Along with its splendid cinematography capturing some breathtaking underwater scenes, landscapes and unseen sequences, the film might turn out to be a cherishable experience for many, fulfilling their own hidden wishes which they may have forgotten by now. Yes, it's a bit lengthy in its second half and some may find its ending also a little abrupt. But if you can really search for all those hidden spiritual messages in its various sequences, then in all possibilities you would like to see it again for anything which you may have missed sipping your drink or talking to your friends in the theater. ZMND not only delivers with its splendidly written dialogues by Farhan Akhtar himself, but also communicates with its viewers through its SPEAKING SILENCES in the scenes. For instance just try to feel Hrithik's natural expressions when he comes out of the water and cries after having an unexpected life time experience. Or just go blank with the zed black screen when the three boys touch the ground after their incredible Sky Diving adventure. And not to be forgotten the never-seen-before adventures on the celluloid, such as The Tomato crushing festival and the Bull encounter run towards the end. Performance wise, the film can be included among the better performances of everyone in the team including, Hrithik, Farhan, Abhay, Katrina, Kalki, Naseeruddin Shah, Deepti Naval and Zoya herself (as a writer- director). And the one person who is sure going to get a huge increase in his fan base has to be Farhan Akhtar, who shows a remarkable sense of comic timing and screen presence in his own home production. But if you ask who is the best among them all then I would like to name Katrina and Hrithik who really have done something against their own image and persona. Especially Hrithik, who plays a simple, well established business man in the film and his character has nothing to do with his Bollywood's Superficial Hero type of image (against all expectations). And Katrina plays it real cool and subtle showing a great amount of transformation in her lovable performance. Abhay as usual impresses with his out of the box act and proves once again that he is surely blessed with a unique sense of cinema.It is quite possible that a certain section of viewers and critics may not like the film for their various reasons. But truly speaking I loved the film may be because I myself have experienced few of these adventures in my real life and believe me they are not just adventures but in disguise are""Spiritual Experiences"" like ""A Meditation""as rightly quoted by Katrina in the film. So if you wish to have a similar kind of experiences without going on to holiday then simply go for ZNMD at the earliest.",its not film but osho nik kind life teaching experience which needs be watched by all as must learn essential basics living,as i am always partial films which have power add something valuable constructive your routine lives through their expressive content therefore i have all good things say about znmd with only 3 negative points which i would like mention first apart its inspired poster one is its weak soundtrack lacking much required melody which could have taken important theme film more greater heights secondly film is all about rich people who can roam around world as easily as blinking eye without worrying about any finance or visa problems lastly overall feel look language film is entirely urban hence it may not be able impress people living rural regions who would not be able relate with it also though its basic outline seems be written around farhans earlier dil chahta hai but as movie progresses it goes different journey altogether which has all essential life ingredients ranging friendship love sex hate fun spiritual hidden urges human being but coming real value film it is arguably one most intelligent finest movies made recent times bollywood yet it is be understood that appreciation here is meant more its superlative life teaching content less its cinematic or entertainment value zoya akhtar delivers more polished refine film as her second venture which should be essentially considered as important spiritual lesson not just new movie meant entertainment one reason this remains that film doesnt have great storyline it hasnt got anything new as far as plot is concerned but it does have many golden nuggets evenly distributed throughout film which need be collected by viewers taken home contrary all expectations most appreciable step taken by director film is that she doesnt treat any single person as big star particularly hrithik roshan film starts off simply without any flashy introduction its cast three lead heroes are all given equal mileage importance with each one them leaving his own mark viewer individually thats indeed great vision followed by writer director film basically moves around road trip three daring adventures boys wish experience their lifetime but condition is that they all have

10.0,A very welcome and needed change from the mindless blockbusters,"Thank you Zoya Akhtar for not jumping into the bandwagon to make a mindless movie comprised of gravity-defying actions and over-the-top slapstick comedies just for the sake of making a blockbuster. The movie starts with Kabir (Abhay Deol) getting all set to be married with Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Then, Kabir, along with his school- buddies Arjun (Hrithik) and Farhan (Imran) set off for a trip (after some hiccups), where they all would participate in adventure sports of choice of each one of them. The trip gradually portrays various aspects of each of the character. Along with the adventure sports, all of which are greatly shown, the humor is very subtle and nice. Performance of the lead actors is engaging. Farhan Akhtar as Imran is the more lovable one, with most of the funny one-liners, than his friends. He manages to pull off an entertaining performance. Abhay Deol, as always, is very good as the leader of the pack. He portrayed his dilemma regarding his marriage in a very convincing manner. Hrithik's character has more dark shades than the others, and it was his brilliance that made the character's transformation look enthralling. Amongst the ladies, Kalki is great as the overbearing and possessive fianc√©e. Katrina looks and also acts well whenever she plays a NRI character. Much like herself. The movie's cinematography is excellent and the music along with the songs and poetry are a treat to ears.",very welcome needed change mindless blockbusters,thank you zoya akhtar not jumping into bandwagon make mindless movie comprised gravity defying actions over top slapstick comedies just sake making blockbuster movie starts with kabir abhay deol getting all set be married with natasha kalki koechlin then kabir along with his school buddies arjun hrithik farhan imran set off trip after some hiccups where they all would participate adventure sports choice each one them trip gradually portrays various aspects each character along with adventure sports all which are greatly shown humor is very subtle nice performance lead actors is engaging farhan akhtar as imran is more lovable one with most funny one liners than his friends he manages pull off entertaining performance abhay deol as always is very good as leader pack he portrayed his dilemma regarding his marriage very convincing manner hrithiks character has more dark shades than others it was his brilliance that made characters transformation look enthralling amongst ladies kalki is great as overbearing possessive fianc e katrina looks also acts well whenever she plays nri character much like herself movies cinematography is excellent music along with songs poetry are treat ears,0.6809090909090908,0.4034848484848485,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,A Nutshell Review: Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,"This is what buddy road trip movies are made of, and surprisingly it's helmed by a female director who managed to push all the right buttons at making this work. Zoya Akhtar, whose first film Lucy By Chance I had enjoyed tremendously as it took a long and hard look into the workings of Bollywood, reunites her brother Farhan Akhtar and Hrithik Roshan, who together with Abhay Deol form the nucleus whose adventures across Spain we follow due to a pact that's set in motion should one of them was to get married, as part of an extended 3 weeks bachelor's party plan, they were to each choose an adventure sport for everyone to partake in.Which brings us to plenty of bro-mantic moments as they bond over death-defying stunts, and through the conquering of their fears as a group. Not to mention that the road trip across Spain provides for multiple exotic locations in which this film got shot in. Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti's story also contains enough depth for each character to stand out, presenting skeletons in the closet each must exorcise through their journey of discovery, though deftly avoiding melodrama. What worked is of course the chemistry between the trio of actors as they navigate their joined quest being so natural in their banter, as well as their individual character's conflicts that makes this so engaging to sit through since the challenges in their way are things easy to identify with.The culprit who had to put the plan in motion is Kabir (Deol), whose proposal to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin) forms the basis in which his friends have to join him in executing their pact. There's the happy-go-lucky copywriter Imran (Farhan Akhtar) who's also the resident joker of the group, as well as the dead serious Arjun (Roshan) the hotshot broker whose sole objective in life is to make money, lots of it. Naturally their friendship get tested early on due to the nature of being in close proximity most of the time, but once the misunderstandings got shelved and the wheels put in motion, there's hardly a wasted scene as subplots wrap themselves up very neatly in the narrative, involving one's quest to search for his long lost father, another's realization there's more to life than work if one were to stop and smell the perennial roses, and one having to confront his doubts and the compromise of one's happiness for the sake of others.There's the action-adventure level this film delivered, spending considerable time in engaging the casts in their tasks of deep sea diving, sky diving, and one signature activity best kept under wraps for its surprise factor since it ties in very closely to an important plot point. Halfway though there's also the La Tomatina festival, introduced by Laila (Katrina Kaif) their diving instructor and would be romantic interest, as an unplanned detour involving the squishing of a massive amount of tomatoes - one wonders though if the timelines of all activities do gel together so nicely since there were at least two festivals almost back to back with each other.Hrithik Roshan didn't have much luck at the box office last year with Guzzarish and Kites, but Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara will probably put his career back on track given the meatier role of the trio he got to handle. Farhan Akhtar should act more when he's not directing his own films, while Abhay Deol after this has established himself in my books as one of the character actors to look out for. With great scenic shots and an evergreen story about friendship, camaraderie and life affirming decision making, there's nothing not to like about this film that reminds us of the ties that bind. Highly recommended as it inspires one to come up with a similar pact for a road trip.",nutshell review zindagi na milegi dobara,this is what buddy road trip movies are made surprisingly its helmed by female director who managed push all right buttons at making this work zoya akhtar whose first film lucy by chance i had enjoyed tremendously as it took long hard look into workings bollywood reunites her brother farhan akhtar hrithik roshan who together with abhay deol form nucleus whose adventures across spain we follow due pact thats set motion should one them was get married as part extended 3 weeks bachelors party plan they were each choose adventure sport everyone partake which brings us plenty bro mantic moments as they bond over death defying stunts through conquering their fears as group not mention that road trip across spain provides multiple exotic locations which this film got shot zoya akhtar reema kagtis story also contains enough depth each character stand out presenting skeletons closet each must exorcise through their journey discovery though deftly avoiding melodrama what worked is course chemistry between trio actors as they navigate their joined quest being so natural their banter as well as their individual characters conflicts that makes this so engaging sit through since challenges their way are things easy identify with culprit who had put plan motion is kabir deol whose proposal natasha kalki koechlin forms basis which his friends have join him executing their pact theres happy go lucky copywriter imran farhan akhtar whos also resident joker group as well as dead serious arjun roshan hotshot broker whose sole objective life is make money lots it naturally their friendship get tested early due nature being close proximity most time but once misunderstandings got shelved wheels put motion theres hardly wasted scene as subplots wrap themselves up very neatly narrative involving ones quest search his long lost father anothers realization theres more life than work if one were stop smell perennial roses one having confront his doubts compromise ones happiness sake others theres action adventure level this film delivered spending considerable time engaging casts their tasks deep sea diving sky diving one signature activity best kept under wraps its surprise factor since it ties very closely important plot point halfway though theres also la tomatina festival introduced by laila katrina kaif their diving instructor would be romantic interest as unplanned detour involving squishing massive amount tomatoes one wonders though if timelines all activities do gel together so nicely since there were at least two festivals almost back back with each other hrithik roshan didnt have much luck at box office last year with guzzarish kites but zindagi na milegi dobara will probably put his career back track given meatier role trio he got handle farhan akhtar should act more when hes not directing his own films while abhay deol after this has established himself my books as one character actors look out with great scenic shots evergreen story about friendship camaraderie life affirming decision making theres nothing not like about this film that reminds us ties that bind highly recommended as it inspires one come up with similar pact road trip,0.4632568027210883,0.18831632653061223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"
,A glistening sun-drenched trifle...,"Director Zoya Akhtar's debut ""Luck by Chance"" was a perfect film. Without a single thing amiss, the clear-eyed unsentimental tale of a couple of strugglers in the Hindi film industry stayed with me for days. Of course, there was some irony that a child of privilege with access to Hindi cinema's biggest and brightest talents should make a film about newcomers scrambling for their lucky break: Zoya is the daughter of screenplay writer/lyricist/poet Javed Akhtar and his former wife Honey Irani. Her stepmother‚Äîknown internationally‚Äîis Shabana Azmi; her brother Farhan Akhtar‚Äîa successful director‚Äîmade another foray into acting in Zoya's film, and the slew of boldface names in cameos announced that this was no ordinary debut. But one can hardly fault her for the accident of birth; what was noteworthy was that she put her connections to excellent use and crafted a truly fine film.I couldn't wait to see her sophomore effort: ""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"", which I enjoyed much as one might a mousse au chocolat. It was tasty and fattening and very good to look at. I'm still pondering whether it has any major cinematic merit. My friends and I agreed that it was very much an NRI-friendly film: most of the action takes place in a breathtakingly beautifully-photographed Spain, with a few scenes in London. The characters speak English for the most part, along with sporadic bursts of flawless Spanish and Japanese, and the occasional lapse into Hindi. ZNMD could also be looked at as the armchair sociologist's handbook on the complex mating rituals of the rich and gorgeous. The cast, without exception, is privileged, affluent, and beautiful; their major problems in life would make a Mumbaikar or Delhi-ite burst into derisive laughter. In fact, if a dehati (villager) were to see the film, he might scratch his head in befuddlement and wonder what the hoopla was about. From his point of view, these folks had hit the jackpot, but the ingrates persisted in whining. Still, even the rich have problems which cause them enough angst to require much soulful gazing at Spanish oceans at sunset, and conscientious filmmakers owe it to them to handle them with sensitivity, good lighting, and hypoallergenic makeup.With this film, Zoya Akhtar appears to have joined the ranks of the School of Aspirational Filmmaking. Its foremost proponents are Karan Johar and 99% of the directors ever employed by Yash Raj Films. Their films‚Äîset predominantly in foreign countries‚Äîare made for the new consumerist India. Their characters are upwardly mobile non-resident Indians, and the message to every brown person seems to be: you, too, can escape India's shores and live in a 50,000 square foot mansion on a fifty-acre estate in the country of your choice, drive fast cars (or a beaut of a vintage one, as here) and romance impossibly beautiful chiffon saree-clad damsels. How is never addressed.ZNMD has a surfeit of good taste; Zoya's cast‚Äîall beautiful‚Äîlives abroad in chic monochromatic minimalist apartments, is multi-lingual, dresses impeccably, and can tell the varietal and vintage of a wine from the merest whiff of its cork. The slim story line concerns three college buddies who set out on the bachelor trip to end all bachelor trips. They had intended to take this vacation four years earlier, but two of the friends had a spat and the scars remain. Now one of the trio is getting married and the other two must give in to his emotional plea to resurrect their foreign travel plans. So off they go to Spain in all its sun-drenched glory. They run into Laila (Katrina Kaif), an athletic diving instructor, who stays on for most of the trip. This is the first film for me in which Katrina Kaif did not jar; she plays a mixed-race woman‚Äîhalf American, half Indian. She speaks English most of the time, some Spanish, and a few words of accented Hindi, but it works here, and she exudes well-being and sportiness. Perhaps from now on, anyone looking to cast her believably should make her a person of mixed ethnicity with only a smattering of Hindi. But wait‚Äîisn't that all she has played for the past dozen years? Surely, you'd think she'd want to grow as an actor and add to her skill set by learning Hindi properly, and taking some diction and acting lessons. Maybe her cynical response is I'm doing very well without any of that, so why bother? And everyone agrees she's punctual and professional¬ÖHrithik, after a long time, is not doing all the heavy lifting. He has two buddies for company, and it's a pleasant change seeing him as just one of the guys. The sun glints off his highlights as he strives to achieve optimum work-life balance, dances with game senoritas, and gets drunk with his amigos. Abhay Deol is not as well-muscled but he does some appealing work, wrestling with the dilemma of the perfect girlfriend fast morphing into a harridan fianc√©e. Farhan Akhtar's character, once again, is glib and a bit of an asshole, and tosses off bon mots with a studied insouciance. He, too, needs to broaden his range. We've seen him do this shtick in ""Rock On"" and ""Luck By Chance"", with minor changes of shading in the undeservedly little-seen ""Kartik Calling Kartik"". Kalki Koechlin is pretty and funny as she makes the most of a small role. Naseeruddin Shah is pure gold in his cameo, speaking harsh truths with sympathy. Deepti Naval, too, is lovely in her two small scenes.Zoya has her cast articulate some admirable sentiments: Carpe diem; face your fears; follow your bliss, but it all passes by in an inconsequential, golden haze. So you won't waste time or money watching this movie, but you're not likely to remember it the following week or even perhaps the following day. For Zoya Akhtar's sake, I wish this film every success, for it will enable her future films that will, hopefully, have significant things to say.",glistening sun drenched trifle,director zoya akhtars

10.0,Awesome Movie Guys!,"Films dealing with life-altering epiphanies are always shot in stunning locations. And Hindi films dealing with the same, need a stunning cast as well. A possible rationale: beautiful places relieve stress and bring things into perspective. And beautiful people experiencing divine realizations can hold your perspective on the screen, often resulting in a 'ka-ching' sound at the box office. 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' (ZNMD) is one such film. In true 'Hangover' meets Vikas-Krishna-Barcelona spirit, the film deals with a bachelor adventure marinated with stories of finding, losing and forgetting love. Kabir (Abhay Deol), an affluent construction tycoon is about to take the marital plunge. But not before he completes a much-postponed trip with school buddies, investment banker (and constantly grumpy) Arjun (Hrithik Roshan) and freestyle flirt Imraan (Farhan Akhtar).",awesome movie guys,films dealing with life altering epiphanies are always shot stunning locations hindi films dealing with same need stunning cast as well possible rationale beautiful places relieve stress bring things into perspective beautiful people experiencing divine realizations can hold your perspective screen often resulting ka ching sound at box office zindagi na milegi dobara znmd is one such film true hangover meets vikas krishna barcelona spirit film deals with bachelor adventure marinated with stories finding losing forgetting love kabir abhay deol affluent construction tycoon is about take marital plunge but not before he completes much postponed trip with school buddies investment banker constantly grumpy arjun hrithik roshan freestyle flirt imraan farhan akhtar,0.6970238095238095,0.41428571428571426,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,"Soulful, fun and gorgeous all at the same time.","In one of the defining moments of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the three friends, along with their diving instructor, have just surfaced from the depths of the seas and the feeling of having experienced life in each breath is sinking in... while the sun sets along the Spanish coastline. The richness of this moment is not only depicted in the beauty of the shot itself but also in the calm that descended upon such exuberant individuals. Through the medium of the film, Zoya Akhtar is reminding us to let our fears drown in the essence of the moment that is Now. Though a familiar ideology, it has never been presented with such tenderness, subtlety and beauty. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara doesn't preach a way of living but simply reminds us of it and does so in a manner that will make you smile in the end.Kabir (Abhay Deol) is the first of the Three Musketeers who is about to break away from bachelorhood and as per their old pact, they take a road-trip that includes each one's surprise adventure along the way. This isn't remotely close to a 'Hangover' style Bachelor party but more like a bachelor trip that takes male-bonding to a level that was once defined in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Even though Kabir may appear to be the audacious, fun loving guy, his marriage is a worrisome matter for him which he tries to conceal from his friends. Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) is the funniest of the lot and while he can be a kid sometimes, he appears restless and anxious when it comes to tracing his real father Salman, in Spain. Arjun (Hrithik Roshan) is an ambitious financial broker in London, who is unable to separate himself from his work while on vacation because he plans to retire rich at age 40. On their first adventure, diving instructor Laila (Katrina Kaif) introduces them to her idea of living freely, without worries and plans. From hereon, begins the journey of discovering true living for the trio whose adventures mean a lot more than just sports. The more they let go of themselves, the more they embrace their true selves. The moment they arrive in Spain to the tunes of Dil Jaise Dhadke Dhadakne do, we know what's in store for us. Kabir with his pranks on strangers, Imraan with his witty one-liners and spontaneous sense of humor and Arjun, whose devotion to work literally goes out of the window during the journey, provide us with chuckles and guffaws through innovative situations and interactions. Abhay Deol is well suited to his character who plays the prankster among friends and the resilient fianc√© of Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). His character faces more dilemmas throughout and he has handled those situations well. Kalki was passable in her role which the viewer wouldn't be too fond of in any case. Finally, Hrithik Roshan has a role where he can enjoy himself and the audience can enjoy watching him perform all his talents. Apart from looking like a Greek God, he dresses like a GQ model, laughs, jokes and dances as fluently as he speaks Spanish. Katrina Kaif's character may have been overshadowed by the boys but as an actress, this film should give her more confidence than ever. She gets to speak out the best dialogues, always keep that sweetest smile on her, dress casually and yet look most stunning. Farhan Akhtar is hands down, the highlight of the film's performances. With witty dialogues and a quirky sense of humor, he gets to have most of the fun. He lets himself go with his character and exposes himself to signing, dancing, fooling around, being impulsive, being childish and sometimes, being really mature. He has left good impressions before but this time, he exceeds expectations. Perhaps the secret to such good performances is Zoya's writing and screenplay that allows the actors to be themselves rather than their characters. Through Carlos Catalan's superlative cinematography, we not only witness Spain in its magnificent splendor but also the director's vision of a screenplay that speaks without dialogue. As the actors dive into the depths of the sea, drive through the Spanish countryside, fall from the airplane or paint the world red, Zoya's envisioned screenplay is adroitly depicted like a work of art. What the characters experience in those moments isn't described in words but through slow motion capture of the camera and a screenplay that lets the scene and actor's expression speak in emotions and beauty. While these characteristics of direction and cinematography form the strength of the film, it is Jaaved Akhtar's poetry, spoken through Farhaan in those inspiring moments, that forms the soul of the movie.Shankar Ehsaan Loy have given us melodious tunes which will only grow with each listen after having watched the movie. Dil Jaise Dhadke is peppy and its chorus is uplifting. Der lagi lekin is a soulful track that is brilliantly rendered by Shankar Mahadevan. Truly, accolade worthy. Ik Junoon (Paint it red) is catchy and well suited to the La Tomatina festival. Suraj ki baahon mein is a foot-tapping track that all actors eventually dance to but it is Senorita that is most fun to watch as all three of them take to the stage and Hrithik comes in his invincible form.ZNMD portrays richness and maturity of the director's skill as well as the talents of the actors. While Spain, being the silent hero of the film, will inspire travelers with its resplendent beauty that is explored through journeys, many will relate to Imraan's poetry and the adventurous achievements of the trio. Perhaps the most remarkable attribute does remain the film's ability to convey so much in its silent scenes in spectacular backdrops. Simple moments now look enriched with deeper meaning and all credit goes to Zoya Akhtar's vision of a road-trip that is definitely worth a ride. 9.123 on a scale of 1-10.",soulful fun gorgeous all at

8.0,"With a well paced narrative and brilliant acting, one must confess that this was a joyful experience","After an impressive beginning as a director with 'Luck by Chance', Zoya Akhtar is back with 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' in her second outing once again casting her brother Farhan Akhtar as Imran with Hrithik Roshan as Arjun & Abhay Deol as Kabir to make the three musketeers. They embark on a bachelor trip across Spain before Kabir gets married to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin) where each of them will take the other two to experience an unknown extreme sport opening their respective lives to possibilities that they were unsure to face before.Farhan Akthar with his surefire comic timing, relaxed personality and soul searching gazes makes this his best performance to date. He has matured as an actor proving that he can do more than just serious roles. Hrithik Roshan lets his eyes do the talking. His transition from a grumpy money making machine to a free soul is exulted beautifully. This is one of his better if not best performances and this proves that with the right director and script, he is a fantastic actor. Abhay Deol might come across as the timid one among the three and he might not be the best dancer (especially with the other two around) but he makes the best of what he has, his strong dialogue delivery. His casualness makes the trio feel human.Support comes in the form of Kalki Koechlin who was in control and crazy at the same time which was annoying to watch (in a good way) because that's what her character was all about. Katrina Kaif as the NRI deep sea diving instructor Laila, was so-so. Her dialogue delivery is still weak with wafer thin facial expressions though her rapport with the guys was passable with good chemistry with Hrithik. Ariadna Cabrol as Nuria was an extra with a name; not much to do or say. Deepti Naval as Rehna Habib was believable in her short act while Naseeruddin Shah as Salman Habib was simply a scene stealer.Cinematography keeps you in the thick of the action with plenty of in- your-face camera work. The way the extreme sports were captured didn't look staged most of the time, adding to the make-believe that the actors were in fact doing their own stunts (which I think they did, most of it at least). Locations are spectacular as expected, with Spain getting loads of screen-time to sell itself to the masses though I wasn't keen on some of the aspects shown (wasted tomatoes & animal torture). Other product placements were obvious though they didn't detract from the story. The story and screenplay was finessed well by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti even with predictable sub-plots and a long run time. The dialogues written by Farhan Akhtar with aptness to each scene were surprisingly good. The background score and songs are well placed adding weight to the visual experience. The lyrics written by Javed Akthar and narrated in Farhan Akhtar's raspy voice at vital emotional junctions in the movie were brilliant.With a well paced narrative and brilliant acting, one must confess that this was a joyful experience that not many 'feel good' Hindi movies manage to emote.",with well paced narrative brilliant acting one must confess that this was joyful experience,after impressive beginning as director with luck by chance zoya akhtar is back with zindagi na milegi dobara her second outing once again casting her brother farhan akhtar as imran with hrithik roshan as arjun abhay deol as kabir make three musketeers they embark bachelor trip across spain before kabir gets married natasha kalki koechlin where each them will take other two experience unknown extreme sport opening their respective lives possibilities that they were unsure face before farhan akthar with his surefire comic timing relaxed personality soul searching gazes makes this his best performance date he has matured as actor proving that he can do more than just serious roles hrithik roshan lets his eyes do talking his transition grumpy money making machine free soul is exulted beautifully this is one his better if not best performances this proves that with right director script he is fantastic actor abhay deol might come across as timid one among three he might not be best dancer especially with other two around but he makes best what he has his strong dialogue delivery his casualness makes trio feel human support comes form kalki koechlin who was control crazy at same time which was annoying watch good way because thats what her character was all about katrina kaif as nri deep sea diving instructor laila was so so her dialogue delivery is still weak with wafer thin facial expressions though her rapport with guys was passable with good chemistry with hrithik ariadna cabrol as nuria was extra with name not much do or say deepti naval as rehna habib was believable her short act while naseeruddin shah as salman habib was simply scene stealer cinematography keeps you thick action with plenty your face camera work way extreme sports were captured didnt look staged most time adding make believe that actors were fact doing their own stunts which i think they did most it at least locations are spectacular as expected with spain getting loads screen time sell itself masses though i wasnt keen some aspects shown wasted tomatoes animal torture other product placements were obvious though they didnt detract story story screenplay was finessed well by zoya akhtar reema kagti even with predictable sub plots long run time dialogues written by farhan akhtar with aptness each scene were surprisingly good background score songs are well placed adding weight visual experience lyrics written by javed akthar narrated farhan akhtars raspy voice at vital emotional junctions movie were brilliant with well paced narrative brilliant acting one must confess that this was joyful experience that not many feel good hindi movies manage emote,0.4905133928571429,0.1771205357142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,A road trip film with the usual clich√©s...though it's still very well made and worth seeing.,"If while you are watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara you notice that things seem very familiar, don't be surprised. After all, it's a road trip film...and many similar films have been made over the years. This isn't so much a complaint as an observation....and the film has many of the usual clich√©s you'd expect in such a movie. Yet, fortunately, it's still an enjoyable though not exactly original film.When the film begins, Kabir (Abhay Deol) has just gotten engaged and tells his fianc√©e about his plans before the wedding. Instead of a bachelor party, he wants to go on a three week trip to Spain...something the three of them have been planning for years. The most obvious problem about this trip is Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Although amazingly handsome, Arjun is a workaholic....and anal to the core (and not in a good way). This is a common archetype in this sort of film and the fact that he'd soon meet a free-spirited woman and would learn to let go of his fears and emotional constraints is no surprise at all. His story is enjoyable but the most clich√©d.Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) is the joker of the three. Yet, this is a facade...as he's struggling with daddy issues which he might be able to face while on this road trip.And, then, finally there's Kabir. There's more to his story than he's about to marry a very rich woman. When the two other friends meet her, they are surprised at how controlling and jealous she is...and it's too much so. They want to tell Kabir their concerns about his upcoming marriage...but they aren't sure how he'll take this.Not surprisingly, all these issues are magically resolved by the end of the film...which is pretty typical of such a film. But the locations are lovely, the acting quite nice and the film enjoyable. Worth seeing...but a tad overrated in my mind.",road trip film with usual clich s though its still very well made worth seeing,if while you are watching zindagi na milegi dobara you notice that things seem very familiar dont be surprised after all its road trip film many similar films have been made over years this isnt so much complaint as observation film has many usual clich s youd expect such movie yet fortunately its still enjoyable though not exactly original film when film begins kabir abhay deol has just gotten engaged tells his fianc e about his plans before wedding instead bachelor party he wants go three week trip spain something three them have been planning years most obvious problem about this trip is arjun hrithik roshan although amazingly handsome arjun is workaholic anal core not good way this is common archetype this sort film fact that hed soon meet free spirited woman would learn let go his fears emotional constraints is no surprise at all his story is enjoyable but most clich d imraan farhan akhtar is joker three yet this is facade as hes struggling with daddy issues which he might be able face while this road trip then finally theres kabir theres more his story than hes about marry very rich woman when two other friends meet her they are surprised at how controlling jealous she is its too much so they want tell kabir their concerns about his upcoming marriage but they arent sure how hell take this not surprisingly all these issues are magically resolved by end film which is pretty typical such film but locations are lovely acting quite nice film enjoyable worth seeing but tad overrated my mind,0.5759043927648579,0.20339147286821707,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.27}"
