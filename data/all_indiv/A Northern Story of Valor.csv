9,a real classic if there was ever one.,"One of my all time favourites and a truly magnificent movie. Great casting,sets,costumes,cinematography,music & innovative direction by Hariharan. MT Vasudevan Nair has worked wonders with the script & dialogues. It can be said that he successfully re-wrote history by turning ""chadiyan chandu"" of kerala folklore into a modern day hero. The portayal of Chandu by Mammootty was so complete that its his face that comes to mind whenever one reads about this historical character in story books or academic texts. Captain Raju too, arguably played the role of his life as ""Aringodar"". The kalari payat scenes have been beautifully picturised and appear very realistic. And ofcourse the two songs by Yesudas have become perennial favourites. I don't think there's anything about this movie that can termed even remotely negative. The copyright holders should urgently think of releasing this film on DVD. It would be a great tribute to one of the best movies ever made in India.",real classic if there was ever one,one my all time favourites truly magnificent movie great casting sets costumes cinematography music innovative direction by hariharan mt vasudevan nair has worked wonders with script dialogues it can be said that he successfully re wrote history by turning chadiyan chandu kerala folklore into modern day hero portayal chandu by mammootty was so complete that its his face that comes mind whenever one reads about this historical character story books or academic texts captain raju too arguably played role his life as aringodar kalari payat scenes have been beautifully picturised appear very realistic ofcourse two songs by yesudas have become perennial favourites i dont think theres anything about this movie that can termed even remotely negative copyright holders should urgently think releasing this film dvd it would be great tribute one best movies ever made india,0.5380952380952382,0.4404761904761905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.25}"

9,As good as it gets,"I tried finding a DVD copy of this film but was unsuccessful. i highly suggest that the producers of this movie decide to remaster the video and audio for future generations. the copy of it that I saw was a very grainy print on VHS, which unfortunately is how most people watch the movie for the first time. its strange how fast the technical quality of movie prints in India have been improving in recent years. Malayalam cinema is always a few years behind obviously, but i wish that current technology were available in the late 1980s in Kerala. This is not the sort of movie that can be re-made. i am all but certain that the spirit would be ruined. The last thing i want to see is some scrawny lad doing hong kong kung fu in the kalari. there is no perfect movie, but this comes close. when a story manages to upturn legend, bond us with a silent hero, and entertain us along the way, it has done its job and then some. i wish there were more like this.",as good as it gets,i tried finding dvd copy this film but was unsuccessful i highly suggest that producers this movie decide remaster video audio future generations copy it that i saw was very grainy print vhs which unfortunately is how most people watch movie first time its strange how fast technical quality movie prints india have been improving recent years malayalam cinema is always few years behind obviously but i wish that current technology were available late 1980s kerala this is not sort movie that can be re made i am all but certain that spirit would be ruined last thing i want see is some scrawny lad doing hong kong kung fu kalari there is no perfect movie but this comes close when story manages upturn legend bond us with silent hero entertain us along way it has done its job then some i wish there were more like this,0.4289285714285713,0.05337662337662337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.43, 'Fear': 0.3}"

9,An Absolute Masterpiece Crafting of Historical Epic. Traditional Cinema at its Finest.,"Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha / A Northern Story Of Valor (1988) :An Absolute Masterpiece Crafting of Historical Epic. Traditional Cinema at its Finest. No matter how much people and critics shout about parallel cinema, new wave cinema, experimental cinema and path-breaking cinema, this traditional cinema will always be the bestest. There is no other magic like this. I don't understand Malyalam language but first two minutes into the film, and i was hooked. A melodious song appears in the start telling a past story and while reading the subtitles I was into it. Right this moment i knew that there's is no escape for me for next two and half hours. What a great piece of writing it is. The film offers an alternative version of the fight between two legendary Chekavars from Chanthu's perspective. It is a reinterpretation of Chandu's life and depicts him as an unlucky and misunderstood but ultimately honourable man rather than the traitorous character as known in folklore. I don't know the history so i'd better stay away from arguments of historical accuracy but whatever i have seen in 160 minutes has simply won my heart. I always believe that such great historical tales only needs to be told in correct manners and then there's no stopping to it. Look at Maya Bazaar and Mughal E Azam. Who hates these films? And who can ever forget these films? Today i am adding 3rd one in my list and that's Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha. People can go mad about commerical potboilers like Magadheera and Bahubali but for me they are nowhere close these masterpiece films. Four unforgettable things about this film are- Mammootty's performance, terrific writing of conflicts, Immortal Music and Hariharan's Direction. Hands down, no words. This is a textbook on historical genre. Watch it to learn and understand why traditional cinema will always have its head above anything else. In short, One of the Greatest Film of the 80s Decade.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest.",absolute masterpiece crafting historical epic traditional cinema at its finest,oru vadakkan veeragatha northern story valor 1988 absolute masterpiece crafting historical epic traditional cinema at its finest no matter how much people critics shout about parallel cinema new wave cinema experimental cinema path breaking cinema this traditional cinema will always be bestest there is no other magic like this i dont understand malyalam language but first two minutes into film i was hooked melodious song appears start telling past story while reading subtitles i was into it right this moment i knew that theres is no escape me next two half hours what great piece writing it is film offers alternative version fight between two legendary chekavars chanthus perspective it is reinterpretation chandus life depicts him as unlucky misunderstood but ultimately honourable man rather than traitorous character as known folklore i dont know history so id better stay away arguments historical accuracy but whatever i have seen 160 minutes has simply won my heart i always believe that such great historical tales only needs be told correct manners then theres no stopping it look at maya bazaar mughal e azam who hates these films who can ever forget these films today i am adding 3rd one my list thats oru vadakkan veeragatha people can go mad about commerical potboilers like magadheera bahubali but me they are nowhere close these masterpiece films four unforgettable things about this film are mammoottys performance terrific writing conflicts immortal music hariharans direction hands down no words this is textbook historical genre watch it learn understand why traditional cinema will always have its head above anything else short one greatest film 80s decade rating 9 10 by,0.484421743568085,0.14481355365501708,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9,A real classic if there was one!,"Terrific movie & one of my all time favourites. Everything about this movie is in superlatives. Great sets, casting, cinematography, music etc. M.T.Vasudevan Nair has worked wonders with the script & dialogues, and direction by Hariharan is innovative. Mammootty's portrayal of the central character ""Chandu"" was so realistic that whenever one reads or talks about this historical character from the Northern ballads,it's Mammootty who springs to mind. Captain Raju too did a great job as the much misunderstood martial arts Guru ""Aringodar"". In fact, there were fantastic performances all around -Balan K.Nair, Suresh Gopi, Madhavi, each one of them ""lived"" their characters. Another lasting factor of this film are the two songs by Yesudas which have become perennial favourites. I hope the copyright holders of this movie will urgently start working on its DVD version.
