1,"Overrate, Absurd","I am a regular movie buff of south indian and typical indian movies. I just literally had to watch this movie because of It's over hyped reviews. The actor who plays adi was wonderful in the movie. But I think Dia character is slightly indecisive, vulnerable, unsure of everything which is really annoying. My words to director - Man, you are in the wrong genre, you made for psychological thriller. You hoaxed the audience in the name of romantic drama. Next correct your vision.

I can confidently say I haven't witness this kind of a love story before. And by the end of the movie, it will leave you in splits and pieces.Actors Pruthvi Ambaar, Deekshith Shetty, and Kushi have done a tremendous job in this movie. Director KS Ashok have delivered a great movie in his first attempt. Ajaneesh Loknath's music is also a great add on.I specially and personally loved the performance of Pruthvi Ambaar, for the way he has delivered his role. I sat in the theatre for 5 minutes after the movie was over, and didn't speak a word for a long time. Came out and saw Pruthvi standing there, I hugged him and congratulated and wished him well.In the whole, I want this movie to win. And I honestly hope it will.

1,Rating is misleading,"The movie starts off well , but after the first 40 mins it somewhere forgets where it wants to go. Hence the director /writer has just given unrealistic twists n turns to the movie to make it more watchable. The ratings here and the reviews on this is highly misleading. Please don't watch it for a ""love story "" sake. Because it's not a love story. It has brought back the old genre of Kannada movies where the protagonists used to be Shruthi which was just purely done to be tear jerker / just to make the audience feel disturbed and cry .there is no head n tail to story and unrealistic. I wudn watch it in theatre or amazon prime if I had read an honest review. I think the main problem was the director ultimately din know how to end the story hence he did wat he did in the movie. Made the character arc of all the lead characters pointless. Please don't watch this highly unrealistic depressing movie.",rating is misleading,movie starts off well but after first 40 mins it somewhere forgets where it wants go hence director writer has just given unrealistic twists n turns movie make it more watchable ratings here reviews this is highly misleading please dont watch it love story sake because its not love story it has brought back old genre kannada movies where protagonists used be shruthi which was just purely done be tear jerker just make audience feel disturbed cry there is no head n tail story unrealistic i wudn watch it theatre or amazon prime if i had read honest review i think main problem was director ultimately din know how end story hence he did wat he did movie made character arc all lead characters pointless please dont watch this highly unrealistic depressing movie,0.5886274509803922,0.005350140056022399,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
