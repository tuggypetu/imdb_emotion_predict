1.0,I Feel Cheated,"There are different expressions and feelings one has when he comes out of a theater after watching a film. At times I am thinking, at times smiling, at times in awe of what I just saw and at times thanking myself for not being one of the characters. When I came out of the houseful theater on the first day second show of Tees Maar Khan (TMK), the only emotion I had was anger. Sheer anger. I felt cheated and betrayed and disappointed. This is going to be the worst review I will ever write for a movie.Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om did not go too well with me either and I am not too agreed with the Farah Khan way of filmmaking but TMK still managed to shock me. Farah is a fantastic choreographer but as a director, she just killed a cine-goer inside me. The best thing about this two and a half hour was the promo of 'No One Killed Jessica'. I am so looking forward to that.Apparently an official remake of After the Fox, TMK is a story (if it can be called a story) of a con artist pretending to be a film director to put his hands on 10 tons of precious antiques. During this process you come across Three Gay partners of TMK: I don't know why they act gay but they do. Probably it was supposed to be funny. Two Gay cops chasing TMK: they don't act gay; they are gays and they even hint at marrying each other. Three Gay villagers: they become friends with Katrina Kaif and she calls them girls. Twin Criminal brothers: and they are not just twins, they are conjoined twins. Not to forget, they wear gay clothes and act gay too.With all this overdose of gay jokes, there are idiotic police officers trying to nail TMK down and they crack unbelievably horrible jokes. There is TMK's mother who is slightly better than the rest when it comes to being funny. The film starts with a lousy animated title song of a baby in the mother's womb and he has his eye brow pierced even then. In the time when special effects have gone to a new level, TMK brings a basic animation which makes you wonder where the film is headed to.Songs come out of nowhere and are forcefully fitted in to the scenes. The overly hyped Sheila comes and goes in the first fifteen minutes. A scene finishes and TMK decides to call his friend Salman Khan of Dabangg for a song and dance. Are you serious? The choreography, however, is good. 'Wallah Re Wallah' and 'Bade Dil Wala' were enjoyable.The film has Akshay Khanna as Aatish Kapoor in the worst possible supporting actor role. He plays a film actor who wants to win Oscar just like Anil Kapoor did for Slumdog. Interestingly, Anil never won an Oscar for that film. Aatish also comes up with his own version of Jai Ho called 'Day Ho'. Yes, Day as in DAY TIME. He thinks it's funny and dances on this song with great zeal. He is probably mocking Saif Ali Khan because he is also seen in a Saif like bandana.Katrina Kaif has lost a lot of weight and looks good with her navel show throughout the film. She is one actress who follows the director's brief to the tee because she knows she is not talented enough to improvise. Here too, she seems to be following the director's brief and overacts as much as possible. Actually, she overacts more than it's humanly possible for any actress.Actress, I said, because Akshay Kumar is also there. What was he thinking? I have no idea. To start with, 50% of the times he also acts gay and delivers his dialog with lady-like hand movement and voice. Mostly when he is playing the movie director. It seems to be deliberate a take on Karan Johar though. Here is an actor who was touching the pinnacle of his career a year back with highest grossing and enjoyable films but since Singh is King he has come up with one dud after another.The less said about Farah the better it is. My main culprit, however, is Shirish Kunder. Mr. Kunder is trying to pull up a one-man-show here. He is the writer, editor, lyricist and even the producer of TMK. As an editor, he has a credible history but as a writer his previous work is 'Jaan-e-man' which he also directed. That Akshay starrer was also a pretty lousy show. I would strongly suggest Mr. Kunder to remain in his limits i.e. editing.TMK is likely to have a 50 crore opening weekend which has so far been achieved only by Dabangg. It will be a shame if it grosses more than Dabangg did because Dabangg was a very highly entertaining effort. TMK will for sure recover its cost and make profits for the producers (which is unfair) but I don't expect it to do well with audience in the second week onwards.I go to the cinema with the expectations to at least get value for my money and time. In that regard, TEES MAAR KHAN is not a movie. It's a CRIME and the people behind it need to be punished in such a way that it becomes example for others attempting to create such a shame.",i feel cheated,there are different expressions feelings one has when he comes out theater after watching film at times i am thinking at times smiling at times awe what i just saw at times thanking myself not being one characters when i came out houseful theater first day second show tees maar khan tmk only emotion i had was anger sheer anger i felt cheated betrayed disappointed this is going be worst review i will ever write movie main hoon na om shanti om did not go too well with me either i am not too agreed with farah khan way filmmaking but tmk still managed shock me farah is fantastic choreographer but as director she just killed cine goer inside me best thing about this two half hour was promo no one killed jessica i am so looking forward that apparently official remake after fox tmk is story if it can be called story con artist pretending be film director put his hands 10 tons precious antiques during this process you come across three gay partners tmk i dont know why they act gay but they do probably it was supposed be funny two gay cops chasing tmk they dont act gay they are gays they even hint at marrying each other three gay villagers they become friends with katrina kaif she calls them girls twin criminal brothers they are not just twins they are conjoined twins not forget they wear gay clothes act gay too with all this overdose gay jokes there are idiotic police officers trying nail tmk down they crack unbelievably horrible jokes there is tmks mother who is slightly better than rest when it comes being funny film starts with lousy animated title song baby mothers womb he has his eye brow pierced even then time when special effects have gone new level tmk brings basic animation which makes you wonder where film is headed songs come out nowhere are forcefully fitted scenes overly hyped sheila comes goes first fifteen minutes scene finishes tmk decides call his friend salman khan dabangg song dance are you serious choreography however is good wallah re wallah bade dil wala were enjoyable film has akshay khanna as aatish kapoor worst possible supporting actor role he plays film actor who wants win oscar just like anil kapoor did slumdog interestingly anil never won oscar that film aatish also comes up with his own version jai ho called day ho yes day as day time he thinks its funny dances this song with great zeal he is probably mocking saif ali khan because he is also seen saif like bandana katrina kaif has lost lot weight looks good with her navel show throughout film she is one actress who follows directors brief tee because she knows she is not talented enough improvise here too she seems be following directors brief overacts as much as possible actually she overacts more than its humanly possible any actress actress i said because akshay kumar is also there what was he thinking i have no idea start with 50 times he also acts gay delivers his dialog with lady like hand movement voice mostly when he is playing movie director it seems be deliberate take karan johar though here is actor who was touching pinnacle his career year back with highest grossing enjoyable films but since singh is king he has come up with one dud after another less said about farah better it is my main culprit however is shirish kunder mr kunder is trying pull up one man show here he is writer editor lyricist even producer tmk as editor he has credible history but as writer his previous work is jaan e man which he also directed that akshay starrer was also pretty lousy show i would strongly suggest mr kunder remain his limits i e editing tmk is likely have 50 crore opening weekend which has so far been achieved only by dabangg it will be shame if it grosses more than dabangg did because dabangg was very highly entertaining effort tmk will sure recover its cost make profits producers which is unfair but i dont expect it do well with audience second week onwards i go cinema with expectations at least get value my money time that regard tees maar khan is not movie its crime people behind it need be punished such way that it becomes example others attempting create such shame,0.5610245310245313,0.09681903064256003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.24}"

1.0,What the FK is going on?,"Farah Khan (FK) seems to have lost her bearings with this one. Being fun loving and irreverent is one thing, but making a movie full of PJs is really pushing it! Akshay Kumar's brand of comedy seems completely out of sync with Farah's brand of humor and the result is a disaster only made tolerable if you are salivating over Katrina Kaif grooving to 'Sheila Ki Jawani' or seeing Akshay and Salman dance together. The script is pretty nonsensical and a stretch even by outrageous plot standards (a conman making a fake movie and convincing a big Bollywood star that it will win an Oscar? Seriously, give me a break!!) and the jokes are pretty weak all through.

1.0,Worst Movie of 2010,"TMK is the worst movie of 2010. The story is awful and direction of Farah Khan is even more awful. I wish Farah had put more effort in script rather than songs. Apart from Akshay Kumar nothing is this movie is good. Some of his cheeky dialogues will make you laugh but again its not worth to watch the movie.Movie has copied several scenes from various movies and Farah has tried to put all Masala in the movie for which she is famous for. But unfortunately story don't have the weight to carry this movie. Senseless jokes are not going to make a movie entertaining.Don't watch the movie. That's my verdict. Forget about previous movies of Farah Khan, they were good because of SRK and the direction tips she were getting from Karan Johar. This movie seems good only during the songs.Worst movie of 2010.",worst movie 2010,tmk is worst movie 2010 story is awful direction farah khan is even more awful i wish farah had put more effort script rather than songs apart akshay kumar nothing is this movie is good some his cheeky dialogues will make you laugh but again its not worth watch movie movie has copied several scenes various movies farah has tried put all masala movie which she is famous but unfortunately story dont have weight carry this movie senseless jokes are not going make movie entertaining dont watch movie thats my verdict forget about previous movies farah khan they were good because srk direction tips she were getting karan johar this movie seems good only during songs worst movie 2010,0.6508771929824559,-0.07456140350877194,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.52, 'Fear': 0.14}"

3.0,Inane and Pedestrian!,"TEES MAAR KHAN Bollywood is replete with examples of fetishes of film makers who closely associate these fetishes with the success of their films. The earliest example is that of film maker J Omprakash who always wanted his movie titles to begin with A; and in recent times we have the example of Karan Johar, who has a similar fetish with the letter K. Farah Khan, who began her career as a choreographer and quickly moved into the shoes of another Khan choreographer (Saroj Khan) quickly won a lot of acclaim for her work and then decided to expand her role to include film direction. Having got the box-office ringing with her first two ventures, MAIN HOON NA and OM SHANTI OM (both of which had Shah Rukh Khan playing the lead), she perhaps concluded that since both the films had three words, three is a lucky number for her. So soon after the success of the first two movies, she gave birth to triplets and her husband, an electronics engineer, Shirish Kunder and she floated a production house called Three's Company! She also perhaps knew that the presence of Shah Rukh Khan in the first two movies was a big factor for the success of those movies, but because she was not having him in her next movie (I will not go into the reasons for that here), she felt that the word KHAN appearing in the title would help. When she was finding it difficult to combine the word KHAN with her fetish for ""TEEN"" to get the title of her new movie, I presume a well-wisher perhaps told her that using a multiplication factor of ten would triple the chances of the movie's success; thus the word ""TEES"" came into the title. The choice of the third word was relatively easy, since the phrase TEES MAAR KHAN connoted a braggart and which was in tune with the character of the script itself. The next exercise was to find an inspiration for this tale and happily for her, that was also a three worded Peter Sellers starrer: AFTER THE FOX. Also, perhaps other well wishers suggested to her that she must have as many Ks as was possible in the film crew and therefore had her husband Kunder work for the background music, write(?) the story, co-produce and write some of the lyrics. The star cast also had a number of Ks: AKshay Kumar, AKshaye Khanna, Katrina Kaif, Sachin KhedeKar and special artistes like Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor! Now about the movie itself. Claiming to be a parody, it turns out to be a rather inane effort. Several scenes of the movie looked utterly pedestrian both in conception and execution and the only saving grace is the performance of Akshaye Khanna in the role of an Oscar hungry actor. Of course, the review will not be complete without the mention of the much touted Sheela Ki Jawaani number by Katrina Kaif; but Katrina with her innocent looks doesn't ooze with oomph despite the raunchy lyrics and the dance movements. I would rate Munni Badnaam from Dabangg (also choreographed by Farah) as a better song although the joke which I heard when I was coming out from the theatre was: Agar Sheela Ki Jawaani Pehle Aati, to Munni Badnaam Na Hoti!",inane pedestrian,tees maar khan bollywood is replete with examples fetishes film makers who closely associate these fetishes with success their films earliest example is that film maker j omprakash who always wanted his movie titles begin with recent times we have example karan johar who has similar fetish with letter k farah khan who began her career as choreographer quickly moved into shoes another khan choreographer saroj khan quickly won lot acclaim her work then decided expand her role include film direction having got box office ringing with her first two ventures main hoon na om shanti om both which had shah rukh khan playing lead she perhaps concluded that since both films had three words three is lucky number her so soon after success first two movies she gave birth triplets her husband electronics engineer shirish kunder she floated production house called threes company she also perhaps knew that presence shah rukh khan first two movies was big factor success those movies but because she was not having him her next movie i will not go into reasons that here she felt that word khan appearing title would help when she was finding it difficult combine word khan with her fetish teen get title her new movie i presume well wisher perhaps told her that using multiplication factor ten would triple chances movies success thus word tees came into title choice third word was relatively easy since phrase tees maar khan connoted braggart which was tune with character script itself next exercise was find inspiration this tale happily her that was also three worded peter sellers starrer after fox also perhaps other well wishers suggested her that she must have as many ks as was possible film crew therefore had her husband kunder work background music write story co produce write some lyrics star cast also had number ks akshay kumar akshaye khanna katrina kaif sachin khedekar special artistes like salman khan anil kapoor now about movie itself claiming be parody it turns out be rather inane effort several scenes movie looked utterly pedestrian both conception execution only saving grace is performance akshaye khanna role oscar hungry actor course review will not be complete without mention much touted sheela ki jawaani number by katrina kaif but katrina with her innocent looks doesnt ooze with oomph despite raunchy lyrics dance movements i would rate munni badnaam dabangg also choreographed by farah as better song although joke which i heard when i was coming out theatre was agar sheela ki jawaani pehle aati munni badnaam na hoti,0.41288497217068637,0.1576716141001855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"

3.0,Underwhelming experience,"Watching Tees Maar Khan was an underwhelming experience. I went in to this movie with mixed expectations. I had high expectations based on Farah Khan's previous efforts - ""Main Hoon Naa"" and ""Om Shanti Om"". At the same time I was not fascinated with Shirish Kunder's ""Jaan-E-Mann"".Tees Maar Khan sets a new low in story telling, narration, poorly conceived characters, direction....the list goes on. The movie revolves around Akshay Kumar playing the title role of a conman who steals antiques by tricking the police. While this seems like enough meat for the story to make a 2-hour movie, however watching the movie proved otherwise. To start with there are not enough sub-plots or situations that highlight the mastery of a con-artist. Perfect example of a movie that highlights this need is ""Catch me if you can"", where there are multiple sub-plots that highlight the skill of the con-artist. There are not enough twists and turns in the story to keep the viewer interested. In general the narrative does not stick to a focused plot; there are miscellaneous gags, unwanted songs, meaningless sub-plots which only add to the misery of the viewer. All the above can be ignored if this is a movie that is not to be taken seriously. There are examples of movies that thrive on frivolity where twisted humor takes center stage and captures attention of the viewer (Austin Powers, Main Hoon Naa are good examples). But this movie is not funny either. There are a few good one liners and hysterical situations that do tickle the funny bone. But even more irritating are the umpteen attempts in the guise of painful dialogues and gags that are intended for humor, but do not really evoke laughter. Trying to laugh at some of the sequences in this movie is like an aborted sneeze which I want to get out of my system, but cannot.To exacerbate this pathetic movie, there are half baked, loosely defined characters that are acted out by clueless actors. Akshay Kumar tries hard, but has very few opportunities to excel.

1.0,Extremely Awful,"Watching Tees Maar Khan was an underwhelming experience. I went in to this movie with mixed expectations. I had high expectations based on Farah Khan's previous efforts - ""Main Hoon Naa"" and ""Om Shanti Om"". At the same time I was not fascinated with Shirish Kunder's ""Jaan-E-Mann"" but this movie is even worse.I was so stupid that i thought this Comedy would be better than the other comedies that were out this year, but i was so wrong once again. Bollywood movies are so much disappointing me, like never before. what is happening. i am so stupid i expected a good movie from the great Farah Khan. the music already wasn't much impressive, considering Vishal Shekar's other 3 movies.

4.0,"Incoherent, garbage bag of hamming entertainment","TEES MAAR KHANEntertainment is a tricky affair. On one hand, film makers present their conviction in an idea or story that can be moving or heart warming whereas some choose the shorter path to success by giving the audience a mindless mess of comedy that can only be short-lived. Careers have been established with the former ideology but disaster has struck when in the name of entertainment, what was served to audiences was a garbage truck full of forced humour, mindless plots, overacting and trashy dialogues. That has happened far too often lately. In retrospect, 'Main Hoon Na' was at least sincere with its story and performances. The actors, music and comedy combined to produce a refreshing entertainer. 'Om Shanti Om', at least the first half, was funny, musical and refreshing as well. However, while riding on the success and fame of two somewhat convincing successes, one does not gain the right to take the audience on a ride. Farah Khan has done just that and brought the audience down to her own level with 'Tees Maar Khan'. A supposed con-artist named 'Tees Maar Khan', along with his aides – Dollar, Soda & Burger is out to execute their greatest job so far: Looting the royal treasure from a running train with the help of villagers who have been beguiled into believing that it's all part of a movie being filmed. Get the point? Right from the beginning, nothing seems convincing at all. Akshay Kumar lauding his character with a multitude of dialogues indicating that 'capturing him is pointless' has no effect. DON says something similar but with lasting effect. It's because of something called 'direction' which is missing from this movie. The greatest Con- artist who fools Indian Police and the Interpol is so unconvincing that one would wish he would take up another job. Akshay Kumar overacts his way through a character that has no life, background or foreground. Numerous flops in the last 2 years still has him playing the repetitive roles in brainless flicks. Hopefully, 'Patiala House' can change things for him. Akshaye Khanna. What can one say for him. The Oscar hungry character of Atish Kapoor is funny at first but when he hams through every incoherent scene, it becomes an overkill of the once wonderful actor from 'Dil Chahta Hai' who was unforgettable as Sid. Some of the supporting cast that includes Arya Babbar, Sachin Khedekar, Murali Sharma and Apara Mehta have done better justice to their roles than even the lead actors. The only reason why people will knowingly spend money on this movie is because they were lured by Sheila Ki Jawani. That song is worthy of its hype. Rather, Katrina Kaif is worthy of her position in Bollywood right now. Her moves, classy attitude and to-die-for looks in the 'item number' will thoroughly entertain and Farah Khan has done her primary job of choreography quite well. We only wish for Katrina's versatility to be challenged as she was in 'Raajneeti'. Vishal & Shekhar will only ride on the success of Sheila and nothing else. Compared to Farah's previous two, this film's score is a dud. Even Salman Khan's cameo cannot save the mediocrity of Wallah re Wallah. The editor in the film must surely be the security guy outside Dhuliya bank since he was asleep all the time. The dialogue writer churned out only a handful of witty one liners before they too were lost in between the hamming, overacting, repetition and senseless situations. The key to successful comedies of late, has been in dialogues as one cannot really create funny scenes without a screenplay in existence. Cinematography was very average and this film lacks the big budget feel if at all it had one. In case it did, UTV will have to rethink Farah Khan's calibre as a director they can invest in. Farah Khan literally showcases her stupidity on multiple occasions. Take the airplane scene for instance where it all seems so over-the-top. The prolonging of the train's arrival in Dhuliya prepares you for the worst. The headless horse rider sequence was among the most incoherent of all, while the in-film director Tees Maar Khan's clueless behavior on the film's set must be an enactment of Farah Khan in reality. Finally when the train is stopped and the heist ensues, it all seems tragic as there was nothing funny, glorious or memorable about the basic premise of the 3 hour ordeal. The actors too, look weary of the proceedings in the end and one cannot help but dread Farah's intention of making a sequel to this time-wasting garbage of nonsense. 5.23 on a scale of 1-10.",incoherent garbage bag hamming entertainment,tees maar khanentertainment is tricky affair one hand film makers present their conviction idea or story that can be moving or heart warming whereas some choose shorter path success by giving audience mindless mess comedy that can only be short lived careers have been established with former ideology but disaster has struck when name entertainment what was served audiences was garbage truck full forced humour mindless plots overacting trashy dialogues that has happened far too often lately retrospect main hoon na was at least sincere with its story performances actors music comedy combined produce refreshing entertainer om shanti om at least first half was funny musical refreshing as well however while riding success fame two somewhat convincing successes one does not gain right take audience ride farah khan has done just that brought audience down her own level with tees maar khan supposed con artist named tees maar khan along with his aides dollar soda burger is out execute their greatest job so far looting royal treasure running train with help villagers who have been beguiled into believing that its all part movie being filmed get point right beginning nothing seems convincing at all akshay kumar lauding his character with multitude dialogues indicating that capturing him is pointless has no effect don says something similar but with lasting effect its because something called direction which is missing this movie greatest con artist who fools indian police interpol is so unconvincing that one would wish he would take up another job akshay kumar overacts his way through character that has no life background or foreground numerous flops last 2 years still has him playing repetitive roles brainless flicks hopefully patiala house can change things him akshaye khanna what can one say him oscar hungry character atish kapoor is funny at first but when he hams through every incoherent scene it becomes overkill once wonderful actor dil chahta hai who was unforgettable as sid some supporting cast that includes arya babbar sachin khedekar murali sharma apara mehta have done better justice their roles than even lead actors only reason why people will knowingly spend money this movie is because they were lured by sheila ki jawani that song is worthy its hype rather katrina kaif is worthy her position bollywood right now her moves classy attitude die looks item number will thoroughly entertain farah khan has done her primary job choreography quite well we only wish katrinas versatility be challenged as she was raajneeti vishal shekhar will only ride success sheila nothing else compared farahs previous two this films score is dud even salman khans cameo cannot save mediocrity wallah re wallah editor film must surely be security guy outside dhuliya bank since he was asleep all time dialogue writer churned out only handful witty one liners before they too were lost between hamming overacting repetition senseless situations key successful comedies late has been dialogues as one cannot really create funny scenes without screenplay existence cinematography was very average this film lacks big budget feel if at all it had one case it did utv will have rethink farah khans calibre as director they can invest farah khan literally showcases her stupidity multiple occasions take airplane scene instance where it all seems so over top prolonging trains arrival dhuliya prepares you worst headless horse rider sequence was among most incoherent all while film director tees maar khans clueless behavior films set must be enactment farah khan reality finally when train is stopped heist ensues it all seems tragic as there was nothing funny glorious or memorable about basic premise 3 hour ordeal actors too look weary proceedings end one cannot help but dread farahs intention making sequel this time wasting garbage nonsense 5 23 scale 1 10,0.574436507936508,0.12039484126984128,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"
1.0,Farah Khan Has Lost It.,"Having heard over the past two years that this film was ""on"" and then ""off"" and then ""on"" and then ""off"" and then finally ""on"" again, it made me feel like that someone was switching the lights on and off countless times. Then I heard that SRK and Farah Khan had fallen out with each other and that Akshay Kumar was in along with Katrina Keif.Written by Farah Khan's husband, Shirish Kunder, the theme of the movie is based on an old Peter Sellers movie, ""After the Fox."" A thief gets his chance to plan to rob a train and he does this by hiring a actor and a movie shoot in a village nearby.Starring Akshay Kumar, Katrina Keif, Anil Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna and Arya Babbar, the movie is directed by Farah Khan, written and Produced by Shrish Kunder and Ronnie Screwala. Vishal Shekhar provide the music score.Farah Khan has had a previous ""flop"" on her hands - ""Janemaan,"" though it was not directed by her but by Shirish Kunder. That movie did not star Shah Rukh Khan either but the other two, ""Mein Hoon Na"" and ""Om Shanti Om"" did and proved to be successful for her, though the latter did have some problems.Katrina Keif, though has lost a lot of weight and ensured that her style of dancing could be compared that of Malaika Arora Khan in ""Sheila Ki Jawani"" compared to ""Munni Badnaam Hui."" Serious roles, such as the one in ""New York,"" suit her better then the one she plays in this one.Akshay Kumar, perhaps needs to consider doing serious roles than this. Certain types of comic roles do suit him and he does execute them very well. But unfortunately, this cannot be said here.The music! Well the only thing that can be said is that at least one song - ""Sheila Ki Jawani"" is a memorable number, though it has come under a lot of criticism since the release of the movie. One other member of the industry that Farah Khan had always had but didn't this time was the music director, Anu Malik.The plot fails to lift off, the comic lines and the dialogues could have been written well and its with this that I conclude that this was a movie that was riddled with disaster from the moment it was announced.",farah khan has lost it,having heard over past two years that this film was then off then then off then finally again it made me feel like that someone was switching lights off countless times then i heard that srk farah khan had fallen out with each other that akshay kumar was along with katrina keif written by farah khans husband shirish kunder theme movie is based old peter sellers movie after fox thief gets his chance plan rob train he does this by hiring actor movie shoot village nearby starring akshay kumar katrina keif anil kapoor akshaye khanna arya babbar movie is directed by farah khan written produced by shrish kunder ronnie screwala vishal shekhar provide music score farah khan has had previous flop her hands janemaan though it was not directed by her but by shirish kunder that movie did not star shah rukh khan either but other two mein hoon na om shanti om did proved be successful her though latter did have some problems katrina keif though has lost lot weight ensured that her style dancing could be compared that malaika arora khan sheila ki jawani compared munni badnaam hui serious roles such as one new york suit her better then one she plays this one akshay kumar perhaps needs consider doing serious roles than this certain types comic roles do suit him he does execute them very well but unfortunately this cannot be said here music well only thing that can be said is that at least one song sheila ki jawani is memorable number though it has come under lot criticism since release movie one other member industry that farah khan had always had but didnt this time was music director anu malik plot fails lift off comic lines dialogues could have been written well its with this that i conclude that this was movie that was riddled with disaster moment it was announced,0.5229572510822511,0.0059298340548340584,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.46, 'Fear': 0.38}"

1.0,Would never suggest this movie to my foes,"Don't worry I don't intend to dish out spoilers, giving away the synopsis or plot or even a hint on the story line. The movie opens with Sanjay Dutt narrating the hind sight into the protagonist's current state of affairs. I was wondering why Sanjay Dutt's voice was chosen, my roommate was kind enough to educate me on this choice. To start with Sanjay Dutt's voice is kind of synonymous with the comical negative character (read gangster, thief ...), attributed to the fame of Munna of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The start to the movie though does not leave a bad taste in the mouth, is not what a comedy flick should begin with.The movie lacks a theme or story line that would inherently support the intended comedy. For most part of the movie it seemed that the actors are trying in desperation to make the audience laugh. For example, a meeting of top cops of Mumbai chaired by the commissioner discusses the possibility (or a lack) of ancient treasures getting stolen. Gibberish is introduced in the form of a participant interrupting the speaker every few seconds. These puns cry for a few laughs at best, and in time become annoying.Akshay Kumar seems to have made a resolve to sink deeper with every new comedy flick; TMK adds value to that resolve. With such frivolous plot, the burden of carrying the movie rested solely on the shoulders of the actors, and they have done a fine job of letting that slip. Katrina Kaif with little or no role in the plot was intentionally brought in for her dancing prowess. I would suggest she take more dance classes before venturing this path again. Moving on to Akshaye Kanna, I'm not sure as to the link between his role and comical intent of the movie. His claim of donning a guest role in this movie is weak, he is present on screen through most of second half. This movie probably will do more damage to his acting career than fix it. The background scores and the songs are definitely not worth mentioning, half the numbers are remixes thus taking away the need for remix artists and DJs. None of the songs are worth humming, even the sticky ""Sheila ki Jawani"" with its bad hinglish lyrics. The movie sports an occasional burst of a kid shouting ""Tees Maar Khan"", ruining the few laughs for your money.TMK is bad rip from a 1966 movie ""After the fox"", which was a fun movie with character. TMK's story line is like evoking laughter by beating below the belt. The script fails to build the lead actor's character and hence does not muster any sort of harmony from the audience; it fails to evoke any kind of sympathy for the lead role as the story line jumps from comical to scary and to serious. The transitions, being abrupt keep the audience guessing the genre of the movie through its length.Half way through the movie the story line, actors, guest actors completely lose direction and wander in different direction. Some sequences either have no bearing on the movie or lack the chaining required in storytelling. The director seems to have lost the purpose when it crosses the half way mark. Many of the obvious realities have been over looked or abandoned to make room for mindless comedy which by the ways fails to make people laugh.A few takeaways from the movie, There are many ways to make the audience laugh; this probably is the worst way. Now that the benchmark for the worst, other would only need to just do incrementally better. This movie is a must watch to expand your scales for rating movies. I have expended time and money in watching this movie, I urge you to watch this movie to make me look less gullible.",would never suggest this movie my foes,dont worry i dont intend dish out spoilers giving away synopsis or plot or even hint story line movie opens with sanjay dutt narrating hind sight into protagonists current state affairs i was wondering why sanjay dutts voice was chosen my roommate was kind enough educate me this choice start with sanjay dutts voice is kind synonymous with comical negative character read gangster thief attributed fame munna munna bhai m b b s start movie though does not leave bad taste mouth is not what comedy flick should begin with movie lacks theme or story line that would inherently support intended comedy most part movie it seemed that actors are trying desperation make audience laugh example meeting top cops mumbai chaired by commissioner discusses possibility or lack ancient treasures getting stolen gibberish is introduced form participant interrupting speaker every few seconds these puns cry few laughs at best time become annoying akshay kumar seems have made resolve sink deeper with every new comedy flick tmk adds value that resolve with such frivolous plot burden carrying movie rested solely shoulders actors they have done fine job letting that slip katrina kaif with little or no role plot was intentionally brought her dancing prowess i would suggest she take more dance classes before venturing this path again moving akshaye kanna im not sure as link between his role comical intent movie his claim donning guest role this movie is weak he is present screen through most second half this movie probably will do more damage his acting career than fix it background scores songs are definitely not worth mentioning half numbers are remixes thus taking away need remix artists djs none songs are worth humming even sticky sheila ki jawani with its bad hinglish lyrics movie sports occasional burst kid shouting tees maar khan ruining few laughs your money tmk is bad rip 1966 movie after fox which was fun movie with character tmks story line is like evoking laughter by beating below belt script fails build lead actors character hence does not muster any sort harmony audience it fails evoke any kind sympathy lead role as story line jumps comical scary serious transitions being abrupt keep audience guessing genre movie through its length half way through movie story line actors guest actors completely lose direction wander different direction some sequences either have no bearing movie or lack chaining required storytelling director seems have lost purpose when it crosses half way mark many obvious realities have been over looked or abandoned make room mindless comedy which by ways fails make people laugh few takeaways movie there are many ways make audience laugh this probably is worst way now that benchmark worst other would only need just do incrementally better this movie is must watch expand your scales rating movies i have expended time money watching this movie i urge you watch this movie make me look less gullible,0.47489236628580894,-0.002067809239940373,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.35}"
3.0,"Boring, Insufferable, Avoidable","Ever since Dabangg rocked the screens, Bollywood has been racing to come up with the next pure Masala entertainer. Tees Maar Khan promised all this and then some. Alas, the wait just got longer...Before I start on TMK, let me assure you I am a big mas ala movie freak – Wanted, Dabangg, Houseful, Singh is King, you name it I loved them all. Gosh I even liked Chandni Chowk to China! And didn't have too many problems with No Problem either... Tees Maar Khan however is not half as good as even the last two films mentioned. Which is why unabashedly promoting this film by linking it with Dabangg records makes me sad. And angry. More so, as it comes from a director whose last two films (Om Shanti Om and Main Hoon Na) were superb.The problem with Tees Maar Khan is... well, everything! Let me start with the storyline. A master thief who is smarter than everyone get his life's biggest challenge, of robbing a moving train. Not just some small treasure, but the whole train. So he makes a plan by getting a movie star and charading a movie shoot at a village next to the railway line, so that the villagers will stop the train and provide the manpower to take away the loot. Original? Well so it would seem in case you haven't watched the 1966 Peter Sellers' After The Fox. Which, by the way, was among Sellers' forgettable ventures, and is not even pure Hollywood – rather an Italian film. Anyways, our film makers picked up this DVD one fine day and decided to Bollywoodize it, with some item numbers and a mas ala touch. Could have been a cracker, but for that you need a great screenplay and rock solid direction, both of which are sorely missing out here. While watching the film, it seems the director went directly from the basic story-script to the dialogue writer asking for some memorable witty punchlines . You see, we're making a mas ala movie here, and Wanted worked, maybe only because of the dialogues... or is it? So ""Ek Bar Maine commitment kar Di..."" becomes something like ""Tees Maar Khan Ki Zabaan aur..."" uff whatever! Then there is the heavily promoted line of ""Tawaif Ki Lut ti Izzat Bachana aur Tees Maar Khan Ko Pakadna..."" which could really have been a nice memorable line. If only it did not come every 5 minutes in the movie. Now for the acting part. Or whatever passes for it. If you thought SRK hams, wait till you see Akki in this one. It is so over the top that a few minutes into the film you feel whether Farah Khan directed the movie, or was she busy tending to her triplets at home. Never expected Katrina to 'act' so it is not a let down at all. But Akshaye Khanna was fine. Not a great performance, which we expect of him, but given everyone else around this definitely deserved an Oscar!!! ;-) However, both he and Kat do not have much footage, and neither do the others. Why not? Read on...Okay so whats good? Need I tell anyone that Shiela Ki Jawani is one cool item song? Or that Wallah re Wallah has Salman dancing in pure Munni Badnaam Hui style. But what is even better is that if you are going to the theatre for these two, then you might as well come out in the first 45 minutes, once these songs are over. Yes, the director does not make us wait too long. And do watch out for the Sallu-Kat chemistry in the second song. Another saving grace is the editing. The poor screenplay and pathetic performances largely are subdued by crisp and fast editing which make you not realise the absurd crap you're watching. At least not till the last half hour of the movie when the editor probably fell asleep. Cant blame him, except for the fact that this guy is also credited with the story and screenplay too (Yeah they probably didn't realise too many people would have seen a 1966 Italian film dubbed into English) Considering the film is barely above 2 hours, cut out another half hour of songs, credits, etc you are left with an hour of complete nonsense partly saved by the editor. Although this chopping off large portions of footage probably consisted of everyone in the cast except for Akki's scene. Which mean unbridled loud acting – even by his standards. The inspiration of keeping the film short probably came from Dabangg. Good thought, but crisp editing is like a Tadka. Out here the Daal is missing. And rotten.",boring insufferable avoidable,ever since dabangg rocked screens bollywood has been racing come up with next pure masala entertainer tees maar khan promised all this then some alas wait just got longer before i start tmk let me assure you i am big mas ala movie freak wanted dabangg houseful singh is king you name it i loved them all gosh i even liked chandni chowk china didnt have too many problems with no problem either tees maar khan however is not half as good as even last two films mentioned which is why unabashedly promoting this film by linking it with dabangg records makes me sad angry more so as it comes director whose last two films om shanti om main hoon na were superb problem with tees maar khan is well everything let me start with storyline master thief who is smarter than everyone get his lifes biggest challenge robbing moving train not just some small treasure but whole train so he makes plan by getting movie star charading movie shoot at village next railway line so that villagers will stop train provide manpower take away loot original well so it would seem case you havent watched 1966 peter sellers after fox which by way was among sellers forgettable ventures is not even pure hollywood rather italian film anyways our film makers picked up this dvd one fine day decided bollywoodize it with some item numbers mas ala touch could have been cracker but that you need great screenplay rock solid direction both which are sorely missing out here while watching film it seems director went directly basic story script dialogue writer asking some memorable witty punchlines you see were making mas ala movie here wanted worked maybe only because dialogues or is it so ek bar maine commitment kar di becomes something like tees maar khan ki zabaan aur uff whatever then there is heavily promoted line tawaif ki lut ti izzat bachana aur tees maar khan ko pakadna which could really have been nice memorable line if only it did not come every 5 minutes movie now acting part or whatever passes it if you thought srk hams wait till you see akki this one it is so over top that few minutes into film you feel whether farah khan directed movie or was she busy tending her triplets at home never expected katrina act so it is not let down at all but akshaye khanna was fine not great performance which we expect him but given everyone else around this definitely deserved oscar however both he kat do not have much footage neither do others why not read okay so whats good need i tell anyone that shiela ki jawani is one cool item song or that wallah re wallah has salman dancing pure munni badnaam hui style but what is even better is that if you are going theatre these two then you might as well come out first 45 minutes once these songs are over yes director does not make us wait too long do watch out sallu kat chemistry second song another saving grace is editing poor screenplay pathetic performances largely are subdued by crisp fast editing which make you not realise absurd crap youre watching at least not till last half hour movie when editor probably fell asleep cant blame him except fact that this guy is also credited with story screenplay too yeah they probably didnt realise too many people would have seen 1966 italian film dubbed into english considering film is barely above 2 hours cut out another half hour songs credits etc you are left with hour complete nonsense partly saved by editor although this chopping off large portions footage probably consisted everyone cast except akkis scene which mean unbridled loud acting even by his standards inspiration keeping film short probably came dabangg good thought but crisp editing is like tadka out here daal is missing rotten,0.46448164682539667,0.08597966269841267,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
2.0,Crap,"What a pathetic attempt at movie making?I knew before hand what to expect of a Farah Khan product. But this one surpasses my expectation. And not in a good way.Nothing about the movie is funny or sensible. The spoofs and the humor do not click. This movie is just plain pathetic low budget flick.The good part about this movie being low budget is that the marketing and song attraction will definitely generate enough footfalls to recover the distributor's , producer's and investor's moneyThe problem with this pathetic movie is that it gets way to predictable and boring. You are never excited to know what's in the next frame or next scene. In fact, you cannot wait for the movie to get over with.I believe that's the worst failure of any movie. If you're neither excited about the 'What's next' nor are you 'enjoying the moment' - that's when the movie fails.The songs are good - but again - what a waste!The only thing that is worth watching are: a) Sheela ki lachakti kamar b) Akshaye Khanna is sort of funny c) The first fake shoot scene of a bank robbery with a Vitiligo man pretending to be a GoraI wish these directors would stop dumping such non-nonsensical farce on the Indian audience. But in order for that to happen we should stop visiting the cinema halls and stop patronizing movies from these non-sense production houses.",crap,what pathetic attempt at movie making i knew before hand what expect farah khan product but this one surpasses my expectation not good way nothing about movie is funny or sensible spoofs humor do not click this movie is just plain pathetic low budget flick good part about this movie being low budget is that marketing song attraction will definitely generate enough footfalls recover distributors producers investors moneythe problem with this pathetic movie is that it gets way predictable boring you are never excited know whats next frame or next scene fact you cannot wait movie get over with i believe thats worst failure any movie if youre neither excited about whats next nor are you enjoying moment thats when movie fails songs are good but again what waste only thing that is worth watching are sheela ki lachakti kamar b akshaye khanna is sort funny c first fake shoot scene bank robbery with vitiligo man pretending be gorai wish these directors would stop dumping such non nonsensical farce indian audience but order that happen we should stop visiting cinema halls stop patronizing movies these non sense production houses,0.568452380952381,-0.16698288690476193,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,The worst movie ever?,"I read a review somewhere warning people not to watch TMK even if they got free tickets and as I would realize later, the review was spot on.I saw about an hour of the movie and then walked out as it was intolerable. The so called gags are not funny at all. There is oodles of overacting by all actors and full use of clichés. Having seen Main Hoon Na and OMO, I know that Farah Khan likes to make brainless masala movies, but TMK is beyond brainless. The entourage of Burger etc. that follow Akshay Kumar, the stuck to each other brothers who speak at the same time, the gay CBI officers - it is NOT funny.What does one want from TMK - slapstick comedy - None ; humor - NONE ; great acting - NONE. I don't think Akshae Khanna will take much time to pull out his newly weaved hair when he sees this movie in a multiplex.Watch this movie only for 2 reasons: 1. You want to compare it with the worst movie you have ever seen 2. To watch Shiela ki Jawani on a big screen",worst movie ever,i read review somewhere warning people not watch tmk even if they got free tickets as i would realize later review was spot i saw about hour movie then walked out as it was intolerable so called gags are not funny at all there is oodles overacting by all actors full use clich s having seen main hoon na omo i know that farah khan likes make brainless masala movies but tmk is beyond brainless entourage burger etc that follow akshay kumar stuck each other brothers who speak at same time gay cbi officers it is not funny what does one want tmk slapstick comedy none humor none great acting none i dont think akshae khanna will take much time pull out his newly weaved hair when he sees this movie multiplex watch this movie only 2 reasons 1 you want compare it with worst movie you have ever seen 2 watch shiela ki jawani big screen,0.5453654188948307,0.00557040998217469,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"

2.0,Do not bother to see this movie,"Catch a repeat of another Farha Khan movie instead. The director has let herself down big time with this one. The plot is utter nonsense (if ever was one), gags are outdated and overdone. Dialogues are no better than a B-grade movie. In fact you sometime get better trash from the b-graders. There are couple of ads stashed in too. The whole thing is quite fast paced, a blurry hazy 2.15 hr run of absurdity. Production quality low. It is very evident that the makers did not spend much money on the movie or time on the script - so save yours. The 2 stars I gave, one for Katrina, for her 'jawani'. Another for Salman - for his 60sec Dabang cameo inside a song.",do not bother see this movie,catch repeat another farha khan movie instead director has let herself down big time with this one plot is utter nonsense if ever was one gags are outdated overdone dialogues are no better than b grade movie fact you sometime get better trash b graders there are couple ads stashed too whole thing is quite fast paced blurry hazy 2 15 hr run absurdity production quality low it is very evident that makers did not spend much money movie or time script so save yours 2 stars i gave one katrina her jawani another salman his 60sec dabang cameo inside song,0.4406565656565657,0.05631313131313131,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2.0,a movie disaster called TMK,"I don't understand what the hell was there in the mind of Farah Khan and Akki when they gave a thought for making TMK. It's a total wastage of time and if you really want to enjoy the movie, you must keep your brain at home and should not think WTF is going on the screen. I believe Akki must understand now that the monotonous style of comedy has been common and audience has shown the feedback on the movies 'Khatta Meetha' and 'Action Replayy'. Undoubtedly Akki is one of the most talented actors and he must not do the foolish activities. As far as Katrina is concerned, She was there in the movie for no reason but only to show the ""Jawani"" of ""Sheela"". I give this movie a poor 2 out of 10.",movie disaster called tmk,i dont understand what hell was there mind farah khan akki when they gave thought making tmk its total wastage time if you really want enjoy movie you must keep your brain at home should not think wtf is going screen i believe akki must understand now that monotonous style comedy has been common audience has shown feedback movies khatta meetha action replayy undoubtedly akki is one most talented actors he must not do foolish activities as far as katrina is concerned she was there movie no reason but only show jawani sheela i give this movie poor 2 out 10,0.6409090909090909,0.07272727272727274,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.42, 'Fear': 0.37}"

People please don't waste your money in this c**p, I walked out after 15 minutes as my brain couldn't take the stupidity any more. Acting = fail, script = fail, directing = fail. I think a monkey could have written and directed a better movie than this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY (don't even bother downloading it). I mean I don't even want to write 10 lines (as I am forced by IMDb) regarding this stupid movie. This is why people don't respect bollywood movies. Katrina Kaif acted like a cheap prostitute from Amsterdam (if you know what I mean!), definitely not family friendly. I want to donate someone money to farha khan, so that she can learn how to write and direct properly. I am ashamed of liking her previous work. It felt like she went to toilet break when the acting was taking place.

1.0,Money n Time Waster,Farah Khan in first place is a choreographer and does not know how to make a movie. She does not fit in a place of director. This movie can be considered like a lay man making a movie for the first time in life and jumbles it all up.TMK is a total disaster in Indian Cinema. This movie combines all Indian Movie scenes copied in one film which makes it a total mixture or call it Mix Bhel. This movie has a bit of good acting from Akshay Kumar rest of the cast does over acting in the film. The story line is nowhere seen in the whole script and it makes your head feel terrible when you exit the cinema hall. For the part songs 'Sheela Ki Jawani' & the title track are at least audible but the rest are more annoying. Overall I think i cant even rate this movie but for sake of a rating I would give it a 1 out of 10. So watch it at your risk.,money n time waster,farah khan first place is choreographer does not know how make movie she does not fit place director this movie can be considered like lay man making movie first time life jumbles it all up tmk is total disaster indian cinema this movie combines all indian movie scenes copied one film which makes it total mixture or call it mix bhel this movie has bit good acting akshay kumar rest cast does over acting film story line is nowhere seen whole script it makes your head feel terrible when you exit cinema hall part songs sheela ki jawani title track are at least audible but rest are more annoying overall i think i cant even rate this movie but sake rating i would give it 1 out 10 so watch it at your risk,0.4547619047619048,-0.028571428571428577,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.42}"
