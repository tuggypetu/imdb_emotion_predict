3.0,A Botched Farewell,"Well, that was not very good.This is a movie that feels like it was written by committee with anything resembling a central idea having been diluted to nothing. I could be okay with that if the film, Cary Fukunaga's No Time to Die, Daniel Craig's last outing as the secret agent James Bond, operated on some basic entertaining level, but the committee-like script destroys any sense of structure to the story, creating stops and starts that never feel right while the story itself keeps feeling like its beginning at different points. The emotional connection is contrived and weak which undermines the supposedly emotional ending of the film. This is...a giant mess and one of the worst Bond films. Not the worst, but it's pretty close.The desire to have all of the Craig films be some giant interconnected puzzle was always a half-hearted effort that started in the previous film, Spectre, and the continuation of the effort here is borderline embarrassing. After an opening showing a young French girl escaping an assassin when he takes pity on her and pulls her out of a frozen lake (taken from a line of dialogue in the previous film), we get Bond (Craig) and Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), the girl from the last movie, enjoying time together in Italy. They are in love, and the movie spends very little time trying to convince us before Madeleine is telling Bond that they will never be happy together as long as Bond is still obsessing over Vesper Lynd. I mean...what? If we're going to treat these five movies as one long story, then we have to consider the idea that Bond's dismissal of Lynd's death at the end of Casino Royale was final, and...um...that his letting go of his rage at her death at the end of Quantum of Solace was also final. She hadn't been mentioned in Skyfall (which felt like it happened years, maybe even more than a decade, after Quantum ended) and only mentioned in a single line of dialogue in Spectre by someone else. This is the beginning of an effort to have Craig's Bond say goodbye to the franchise as a whole, and it quite simply does not work.At Lynd's grave, Bond is attacked by Spectre, and he blames Madeleine. When they get away, he puts her on a train and promises to never see her again before we get our title sequence and a jump ahead by five years. Why this jump of five years? To give Bond a child is why. He doesn't know about it yet, though. In the meantime he's retired, and his 007 moniker has been passed on by M (Ralph Fiennes) to Nomi (Lashana Lynch). When a mysterious figure organizes a raid on a top-secret British biolab and steals a DNA-targeting weapon and defected Russian scientist (David Dencik), the uncooperative CIA and MI6 are both on the trail that starts in Santiago, Cuba. The American agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) invites Bond along on the mission, and the movie missteps heavily.With this being the Bond farewell tour, he's saying goodbye to every major figure in the franchise including Leiter. So, with whom does Bond spend most of his Cuba time with? Paloma (Ana de Armas), a new secret agent who looks great in a slinky dress, kicks some butt, and then vanishes from the movie completely. This mission should have been done with Leiter, so they could have had one final hurrah before Leiter dies. Instead, it's with a throwaway character who doesn't matter. The other problem with this scene is that it's the closing of the chapter on SPECTRE as an organization with all of members showing up to a birthday bash for Ernst Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who is in a maximum security prison in London and observing the events through a bionic eye that he can see through...somehow. I dunno. It doesn't matter. This movie is stupid. The larger problem is that since SPECTRE is not actually the antagonist of this film, dedicating a large set piece to them after a large set piece that sets them up as the villain. This movie is just ambling from one sequence to the next without any real clear narrative drive.Leiter is betrayed, Bond loses the scientist, and Bond goes back home to London to visit MI6 and M as a visitor. It's here where we learn that M is behind the entire project of the DNA weapon that the movie feels like it's actually beginning, more than an hour into the film. Bond must get in to talk to Blofeld to figure out what may be happening, who may be behind it all, and yet Blofeld will only talk to his therapist, Madeleine. So, our hero and his lady meet once again and they're distant and borderline antagonistic towards each other. Yeah, this is a great love story.Madeleine, though, has been roped into the plot of Safin (Rami Malek) by using a perfume laced with the DNA nanobots designed to kill Blofeld, which Bond touches, and then infects Blofeld with in their meeting. Again...Blofeld is not the antagonist to this movie, and we get an extended sequence, almost halfway through this interminable 170 minutes, where he ends up dying while giving up the littlest bit of information that Madeleine and Safin are connected, information that Madeleine has almost told Bond herself before. This is just another entry in the farewell tour occupying screen time, and it barely makes any sense.Madeleine flees to her mother's old house in Scandinavia with Bond in pursuit where he meets his daughter whom Madeleine insists is not his. After a quick profession of deep love between the two, they're found out and must flee. The effort is protracted and ultimately pointless when Safin captures both Madeleine and the girl, fleeing to his island base.I think it's easy to see the weird mix that's going on here in terms of tone, in addition to all the structural and thematic issues at play. The movie is taking some of the more ridiculous elements of the franchise (bionic eyes, super cars, island hideouts) and telling them in the most mundane manner to match with the more sober assessment of Bond's ending. It's such an odd combination that when Bond uses his EMP watch to blow up the bionic eye in the head of the bad guy he's choking and he lets out a bon mot, it's just some of the most bizarre stuff in the movie. I think it's pretty obvious that Barbara Broccoli has a huge soft spot for the Moore era films, and she ultimately has to push it in whether it fits or not. Or maybe it's a Fukunaga thing, I don't know. And that points to the problem of lack of authorial intent here. The movie's all over the place.Paloma was written in, not by the film's lead screenwriter, but by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (presumably at Craig's insistence) in order to add more kickass female whether it fit or not. It ultimately doesn't because it interrupts the overall point of the whole sequence, Bond saying goodbye to Felix. Nomi feels like a sop to some slice of the audience that wants a female James Bond, but she's ultimately pointless, contributing shockingly little to the movement of the plot or advancement of any thematic ideas despite being in about half the film. Her big moment is when she kicks a physically unimposing man into a vat of acid and has a quip that plays on the movie's title. He doesn't matter by that point in the film, and if he had simply disappeared no one would have complained. Instead, though, they give his death to Nomi. The whole subplot with SPECTRE, including Blofeld, is the sort of thing that gets resolved in a movie's first act to quickly establish the danger of the new bad guy, and instead it takes up half the film.And then there's Safin. Malek isn't really bad as Safin, but he's largely unremarkable. I remember reading an interview with Fukunaga that said that he and Malek worked really hard to make him as bland as possible, I mean, they worked really hard to make sure he had an accent that couldn't be tied to any country. Really, it amounts to Malek whispering through pretty much all of his lines, and they're almost all pretentious nonsense. He's introduced at about the halfway mark and doesn't actually get real screentime until the final act is spooling up. His big sit down with Bond is filled with stuff about how they're two sides of the same coin, and yet no effort has been made to actually establish that in any way. It's supposedly, I have to guess here, because they both kill people, the laziest of ways to try and draw this contrast. The only time in the franchise this worked was with The Man with the Golden Gun, and the antagonist actually was an alternate version of Bond, another one on one killer. It's also so late in the film to bring up this kind of idea considering the mess of stuff that's come before that it can't really stick any landing, especially when it has nothing to do with anything that's come before.This movie is a disaster. There's no one responsible for the narrative, and what ends up happening is that, much like in the Lethal Weapon sequels, the script becomes about pleasing different stakeholders rather than telling an interesting story. The big finale is built on this idea of emotional connection that the movie only half-heartedly tries to accomplish and fails at that. A random death for Bond would have probably worked better.There are moments here are there that work, though. There's a cool little bit in the finale when Bond turns around quickly to shoot someone behind him that mimics that gun barrel bit from the openings. The action is generally well done, it just happens randomly and without any real impact. Ana de Armas is fun as Paloma despite the general pointlessness of her character. Jamaica looks pretty. Hans Zimmer's score is pretty vigorous. That's honestly about it, though.I liked Craig's tenure as Bond, but this is honestly a Bond adventure I never need to see again.",botched farewell,well that was not very good this is movie that feels

4.0,Who's the audience for this movie?,"Producers will blame the poor box office of ""No Time to Die"" on COVID but that's not why it's bombing. The movie is failing because there is no audience for it. It certainly wasn't made for fans of the Bond films (like me). The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn't that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn't a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn't have even noticed the jokes. It's also about twenty minutes too long. ""No Time to Die"" bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig's not-so-hot tenure as James Bond.",whos audience this movie,producers will blame poor box office no time die covid but thats not why its bombing movie is failing because there is no audience it it certainly wasnt made fans bond films like me movie looks great with terrific location photography title is cool bond girls lea seydoux ana de armas are wildly dreamy other than that this movie has little offer story isnt that interesting villain is weak if there wasnt lady theater amc westbury ny laughing once while i wouldnt have even noticed jokes its also about twenty minutes too long no time die bites hand that feeds it it is hands down worst movie daniel craigs not so hot tenure as james bond,0.6078798185941043,-0.005626417233560095,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.44}"
4.0,"Over-extended, mopey chad","When I go to see a Bond movie I'm looking for lush music, exotic locations, evil geniuses, fast cars and/or boats and a few gadgets that aren't invisible cars. I want Bond to be swedging with villains and interacting with hot babes on a regular basis. What I don't want is Bond rabbiting on about his feelings for nearly three hours. Now, you may think I am a philistine who can't appreciate believable drama with my thrills. But the thing is that all this naval gazing which is supposed to make the character so 'real' is still co-existing with totally unrealistic action and sci-fi super-weapons. It's a case of wanting your cake and eating it too. Over-the-top action and plots don't combine at all well with constant whining. The counter argument would be if when Ken Loach made his kitchen sink drama 'Up the Junction' he had decided to include exploding helicopters and robots. If that had happened, the critics would be up in arms, saying that, while they admired the gritty presentation of working class people's lives, they were disappointed with Loach's decision to include a robot laser battle at the conclusion. Well, those self-same critics are the ones who are applauding the idea that Bond can infiltrate an evil genius's secret base, while taking time out to mope around and feel a bit sad while doing it. I'm not having it. If you can't have cyborgs in a Ken Loach drama then you sure as hell can't have a Bond with mental health issues.Despite reservations in the kitchen sink Bond angle, I have been more-or-less on board with the Daniel Craig era films up to this point, at least to a certain extent. While I do seriously doubt I would ever re-watch any of them again before Octopussy, I did nevertheless appreciate Craig playing the part like a cold killer with a personality disorder. But the attempts to humanize him by making him fall in love always seemed very forced and with this final film, they have definitely jumped the shark. This probably has to go down as the worst Bond in the entire franchise. At a near 3 hours, it is ludicrously over-long, with barely a memorable character. The early stages are admittedly fairly promising, with a good pre-credits section but as the movie progresses it loses steam rapidly. The reason that the Bond films have lasted so long is that they are essentially formula films and there is nothing wrong with that. But the Craig era has essentially thrown the formula book out the window and while it was an interesting experiment in some ways, you do have to wonder if there is anywhere the franchise can go after this.",over extended mopey chad,when i go see bond movie im looking lush music exotic locations evil geniuses fast cars or boats few gadgets that arent invisible cars i want bond be swedging with villains interacting with hot babes regular basis what i dont want is bond rabbiting about his feelings nearly three hours now you may think i am philistine who cant appreciate believable drama with my thrills but thing is that all this naval gazing which is supposed make character so real is still co existing with totally unrealistic action sci fi super weapons its case wanting your cake eating it too over top action plots dont combine at all well with constant whining counter argument would be if when ken loach made his kitchen sink drama up junction he had decided include exploding helicopters robots if that had happened critics would be up arms saying that while they admired gritty presentation working class peoples lives they were disappointed with loachs decision include robot laser battle at conclusion well those self same critics are ones who are applauding idea that bond can infiltrate evil geniuss secret base while taking time out mope around feel bit sad while doing it im not having it if you cant have cyborgs ken loach drama then you sure as hell cant have bond with mental health issues despite reservations kitchen sink bond angle i have been more or less board with daniel craig era films up this point at least certain extent while i do seriously doubt i would ever re watch any them again before octopussy i did nevertheless appreciate craig playing part like cold killer with personality disorder but attempts humanize him by making him fall love always seemed very forced with this final film they have definitely jumped shark this probably has go down as worst bond entire franchise at near 3 hours it is ludicrously over long with barely memorable character early stages are admittedly fairly promising with good pre credits section but as movie progresses it loses steam rapidly reason that bond films have lasted so long is that they are essentially formula films there is nothing wrong with that but craig era has essentially thrown formula book out window while it was interesting experiment some ways you do have wonder if there is anywhere franchise can go after this,0.5483892551892552,-0.04795873015873015,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.48}"
4.0,Made by people who dont understand James Bond,"I am a hardcore Daniel Craig bond fan. For me ""Casino Royale"" is the best Bond movie ever made and I have seen multiple times. The only good part in this entire movie is the 10-15 mins Ana de Armas appears, completely lights up the screen, rest of the actresses are nothing to write about.They force a god awful love story in a franchise which is about a secret agent and his missions. Unfortunately there is zero chemistry between the lead pair unlike the sheer magic between Vesper and Bond in Casino Royale. You cried when he cries for her in Venice but here you can't understand why is Bond indulging in stupidity for this lady. I felt more for Felix.And the lesser said about the token black 007, the better. If you have no intention of building a wholesome character stop adding characters just for the sake of diversity.And the dialogues, cringeworthy sermons running for minutes which make no sense or connection.

6.0,"And after all that, it's just average","And so, after endless delays and endless fanfare, we finally have Daniel Craig's final Bond outing. And after all that, the end result is merely average. I enjoyed it, to a degree, but I can tell it's not one that will particularly stand up to repeat viewing. It's overlong, way overlong, with a very slim plot and a story that feels copied from earlier instalments almost scene-for-scene at times. The action is too much about the stunts and CGI and not enough about the suspense or danger, and the whole thing simply goes through the motions.

3.0,"The part before the intro is good, the rest is a disaster.","After waiting for two years, finally the newest James Bond is released in theatres, and it is a mess of a film. The first 20 minutes are good, the action is adrenalinic, there are good stunts, and the tension builds up. After the Billie Eilish song, the movie crumbles completely.The story is too convoluted and they went full science fiction, introducing a highly unbelievable mass murder weapon that does not make any sense. There are way too many characters. Why did they introduce a second 007 that does not add anything to the story? She doesn't contribute in any way to the main objective accomplishment, and the movie wouldn't be any different without her. She is basically an empty shell that is used as a filler. For sure not up to the legacy that this number has. If this is the successor of James Bond, MI6 is already doomed. Paloma, played by Ana De Armas, is a newly trained and definitely too anxious agent for the job. She appears for like 15 minutes where she kicks asses. Visually appealing scene but then, we do not get to see her anymore, so what was even the point? Q was always the genius of the group, plenty of crazy inventions up to his sleeves. In this movie they decided to give him more screen time, which is a wonderful idea, but unfortunately the actor did not manage to give any kind of depth to the character. The evil side is not better. Safir is so cliché and predictable. He cannot transmit any sense of menace. He seems more a spoiled kid that wants to destroy the world for egoistic reasons, a trope seen too many times. Rami Malek is such a talented actor, but in this case he was just disappointing. I want to believe that part of the fault is on the script, which in general was weak and poorly written. Ash, the right hand of Lyutsifer, is just another stupid character that was too easy to beat. Honestly James here played on easy mode, because bad guys are all extremely dumb.The very first action sequence at the beginning is amazing. I saw a lot of dedication and stunts were very well coordinated. Extremely entertaining and compelling. Then, the movie became some kind of John Wick spinoff, full of explosions and shootouts. James Bond is a spy, he is supposed to investigate, infiltrate subtly in the criminal organization and dismantle it from the inside. But because in previous movies he basically blew his identity up, and everyone in and outside Spectre knows who he is, what is even the point of going stealthy? So let's blow up entire places and shoot mindlessly. Bond is just a one man army now.The movie is almost three hours long and it is so watered down by useless dialogues that overexpose the plot. There are too many romantic scenes between the couple Bond-Madeleine. At some point, I was wondering if I was watching a spy story, or a rom com. Of course, like most mainstream movies nowadays, there is a lot of forced comedy that is not even funny. I mean, there are a few decent jokes, but nothing worth noticing. ""No Time to Die"" is definitely a huge downgrade to the whole franchise.

1.0,The time to die is before watching this movie,"I'm going to rant about this movie. The best this movie gets is okay. And that's after a half an hour when the story finally starts. And even then it's old and gives us nothing really new. The idea of a Bond family is good. But like everything in this movie, they screw up their good ideas. Bond shooting Safin in cold blood was great and satisfying after he should have done that in Spectre to Blofeld. Even though the island was going to blow up, but still cool to see it. And when he rolled the car over on the CIA guy.The opening? Then the other opening? So long. I actually thought it was a dream scene for a while. And Safin is clearly the same age as Madeleine. And the mask? These scenes were painfully long. For the most part the movie doesn't drag like the first half an hour. Except for the Russian guys intro? What? Having Bond retired was dumb. Having him get rid of Madeleine was dumb. And were we supposed to think that wasn't his daughter for one second?Safin. The worst bad guy. I have no idea what his deal was. And his bio/nano technology was so stupid. It wasn't explained very well and it didn't feel very threatening. Like at the end when he hits Bond's face was visually so stupid. He was so annoying and not threatening.The other 007 wasn't funny like she was supposed to be. And that whole back and forth was dumb. And her setting up her own one liner aka the title? What was that all about? The actress was fine. It was too self aware as a Bond movie and having little references to itself. Like when he shoots at the tunnel to reflect the opening. Or when he awkwardly has to say Bond, James Bond at MI6. There were others but I can't remember them all.Blofeld's cyborg eye thing was how he was talking to the outside world? They didn't check that? And this technology exist?Bond's death? Like he had to die for that reason? He couldn't touch his girlfriend who he hadn't seen in 5 years or the daughter he just found out about so he didn't want to live anymore? He took himself out of their life when he could have had a normal relationship with them? This was not worthy of killing Bond. He didn't want to see if they could find a cure or whatever? That was so stupid. It's way easier to kill off somebody then to make them get through the bad stuff. You have to get creative. Killing them off is easy. Notice how they did it to three main characters? Not that it added anything, it's just dramatic.And they relied way too much on bad CG for the action. I have no problem with CG. I only have a problem with bad CG. And this was very noticable. Distractingly. And another thing I normally don't notice but did a lot in this was when the good guys get shot at by a machine gun from two feet away and every bullet misses them. It happened a lot in this.Cary Joji Fukunaga needs to get his head out of his ass. He thinks he's way better than he actually is. If he wasn't so pretentious he would have realized that every frame he shot wasn't precious and could be cut. And he had all this extra time to tighten up his movie but he thought he got it perfect.This really reminded me of Dark Knight Rises. It takes place years after the last one. The main character comes out of retirement, then gets ""blown up,"" and there's a Russian who is the only one who knows how to use this technology.Ana de Armas was the best part. Only in it for a bit unfortunately. I wasn't sure if she'd be able to handle the action because she's so cute and dainty. But she does! She's good with the guns and the hand to hand fights. She has a killer kick!Farewell to Daniel Craig. He did very well, just like all the Bond's. He'll always stand out because he was in the Bond reboot. Remember when people hated him because he was blonde? Well get ready because whoever gets the job next is going to get the same amount of crap until the movie comes out and then he'll be the best one ever. But Craig and this storyline deserved a much better ending.I really fear for the future of this fantastic franchise. I hope they don't listen to the internet because it's not real and they don't know what they want. I don't know if they were setting up the ""new"" 007 to take over, the daughter, I have no idea. I guess we learned one thing from the Bond reboot: it's not a good idea. Ultimately giving Bond a 5 movie arc didn't pay off. Or they just did a bad job. He's not an arc character. He's a series character. He can learn things along the way.I don't want a Spider-Man situation where we get reintroduced every few years to the beginning of the character. I really hope they just do what Dr. No did and Bond's been doing it for a while. Maybe this series will be like The Dark Knight series where these ones just exist unto their own. They seemed to take their cues from that series anyway so it only makes sense.But like always, I can't wait to see what happens next.",time die is before watching this movie,im going rant about this movie best this movie gets is okay thats after half hour when story finally starts even then its old gives us nothing really new idea bond family is good but like everything this movie they screw up their good ideas bond shooting safin cold blood was great satisfying after he should have done that spectre blofeld even though island was going blow up but still cool see it when he rolled car over cia guy opening then other opening so long i actually thought it was dream scene while safin is clearly same age as madeleine mask these scenes were painfully long most part movie doesnt drag like first half hour except russian guys intro what having bond retired was dumb having him get rid madeleine was dumb were we supposed think that wasnt his daughter one second safin worst bad guy i have no idea what his deal was his bio nano technology was so stupid it wasnt explained very well it didnt feel very threatening like at end when he hits bonds face was visually so stupid he was so annoying not threatening other 007 wasnt funny like she was supposed be that whole back forth was dumb her setting up her own one liner aka title what was that all about actress was fine it was too self aware as bond movie having little references itself like when he shoots at tunnel reflect opening or when he awkwardly has say bond james bond at mi6 there were others but i cant remember them all blofelds cyborg eye thing was how he was talking outside world they didnt check that this technology exist bonds death like he had die that reason he couldnt touch his girlfriend who he hadnt seen 5 years or daughter he just found out about so he didnt want live anymore he took himself out their life when he could have had normal relationship with them this was not worthy killing bond he didnt want see if they could find cure or whatever that was so stupid its way easier kill off somebody then make them get through bad stuff you have get creative killing them off is easy notice how they did it three main characters not that it added anything its just dramatic they relied way too much bad cg action i have no problem with cg i only have problem with bad cg this was very noticable distractingly another thing i normally dont notice but did lot this was when good guys get shot at by machine gun two feet away every bullet misses them it happened lot this cary joji fukunaga needs get his head out his ass he thinks hes way better than he actually is if he wasnt so pretentious he would have realized that every frame he shot wasnt precious could be cut he had all this extra time tighten up his movie but he thought he got it perfect this really reminded me dark knight rises it takes place years after last one main character comes out retirement then gets blown up theres russian who is only one who knows how use this technology ana de armas was best part only it bit unfortunately i wasnt sure if shed be able handle action because shes so cute dainty but she does shes good with guns hand hand fights she has killer kick farewell daniel craig he did very well just like all bonds hell always stand out because he was bond reboot remember when people hated him because he was blonde well get ready because whoever gets job next is going get same amount crap until movie comes out then hell be best one ever but craig this storyline deserved much better ending i really fear future this fantastic franchise i hope they dont listen internet because its not real they dont know what they want i dont know if they were setting up new 007 take over daughter i have no idea i guess we learned one thing bond reboot its not good idea ultimately giving bond 5 movie arc didnt pay off or they just did bad job hes not arc character hes series character he can learn things along way i dont want spider man situation where we get reintroduced every few years beginning character i really hope they just do what dr no did bonds been doing it while maybe this series will be like dark knight series where these ones just exist unto their own they seemed take their cues that series anyway so it only makes sense but like always i cant wait see what happens next,0.5251017456114544,0.04996690203000885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.42}"
1.0,The Worst Bond Movie!,"This is by far the worst James Bond movie ever made. On the surface it might seem good to some people, but, in terms of the future for the franchise, I don't think they could have made anything worse than this.They actually killed off James Bond at the end of the movie. You can't do that. It has never happened before, for a good reason. James Bond is never supposed to actually die. We as an audience like seeing him in dangerous situations, but, he always was able to turn things around and ultimately win. That is why we loved him. By definitively killing the character here, it will never be the same again when they now try and bring him back.This was the worst creative decision that they could have ever made, it is like making a fun Christmas movie and then giving Santa terminal cancer at the end. It might shock the audience, but, that does not mean that it is good story telling.Here is what I predict. The film has good reviews right now, but, I think that over time people are gradually going to start turning on it. By killing the James Bond character they have crossed a line that was never supposed to crossed, and I really don't see a way back from this.",worst bond movie,this is by far worst james bond movie ever made surface it might seem good some people but terms future franchise i dont think they could have made anything worse than this they actually killed off james bond at end movie you cant do that it has never happened before good reason james bond is never supposed actually die we as audience like seeing him dangerous situations but he always was able turn things around ultimately win that is why we loved him by definitively killing character here it will never be same again when they now try bring him back this was worst creative decision that they could have ever made it is like making fun christmas movie then giving santa terminal cancer at end it might shock audience but that does not mean that it is good story telling here is what i predict film has good reviews right now but i think that over time people are gradually going start turning it by killing james bond character they have crossed line that was never supposed crossed i really dont see way back this,0.5290922619047619,0.0892485119047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
5.0,There should be no time to watch anything like this.,"I have been a Bond fan since I was ten years old. My first James Bond movie was probably ""Goldeneye"", which I love to this day and consider it as my favorite film of the franchise. Daniel Craig era has never been one that I love. ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" were both fantastic, but ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Spectre"" not very good at all.To put it mildly, ""No Time to Die"" was my most anticipated movie of this year. It marks the final apperance of Daniel Craig as Bond and is the longest James Bond movie up to date. I saw this movie yesterday and heard it was controversial for the fans. After seeing ""No Time to Die"", this is certainly going to be a very divisive film.Talking about myself: I really wanted to love this film, and at times I did. There are parts of ""No Time to Die"", which I think are wonderful, but there are also parts of it, which could have been executed far better.Let's start with the good aspects first, shall we?. The production values of this movie are fantastic. The cinematography is gorgeous and Billie Ellish's theme fits the story, while having haunting lyrics and music. The acting is pretty good all around. Daniel Craig is the most chatty he has ever been as Bond, but he's still very likable in the role. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are great as usual. Lea Seydoux is so much better here than she was in ""Spectre"". Jeffrey Wright and Christoph Waltz are fun for what there are in. Rami Malek is creepy enough as Safin, but he is definitely not the best villain of the franchise. Ana De Armas though gives an amazing performance. She felt such a breath of fresh air in this movie, while kicking ass for only 10 minutes..... The first hour of ""No Time to Die"" is compelling enough. The action scenes in Italy and Cuba, though the chase in the woods and the climax on Saffin's island are solid too, especially stand out.. There are moments, where the humor does land and throwbacks to other Bond films like ""For Your Eyes Only"", where James Bond pushes a car on the henchman, were clever. The story definitely leaves an emotional impact on the audience with the choice of music and themes of family-turns out Bond and Madeline have a daughter Mathilde, which is not a bad idea, just convinient for the story :)But let's get into my negatives, because this movie was disappointing for me. There are parts, like I said, which are fantastic, and that's what makes a couple choices of the story so frustrating for me.. The movie is agreed unbalanced and feels too long at times. There were times, where I thought the narrative got a bit too melodramatic with the relationship problems between Swan and Bond. The deaths of Felix, but especially Blofeld's death feel crammed into the story having no impact on anyone, just like the character of Nomi, who is underdeveloped at best (even though the actress is very good).. The humor is not always spot on and does get a bit cringe-worthy at times. One can tell that they were trying to make great ending to Daniel Craig's Bond by giving him the most dialogue and one-liners, but Craig's James Bond feels out of character for a good portion of the film.. The biggest issue for me was indeed the last third of the film. First, the villain's plan to destroy the world feels forced and out of nowhere. I can understand why he killed all agents of Spectre, but brutally murdering an Europe full of people made no sense to me.Second problem regards the fact that Bond dies in this movie. There are several issues with this ending. 1) Even though it fits the movie, I think it was Craig himself, who said that this movie was about family, this movie could have ended with Daniel Craig's 007, after being poisoned and escaping the island watching his family from a safe distance or like Calvin Dyson said having Q to develop an antidote for Bond. James Bond faking his own death to protect his loved ones makes more sense to me than his death. 2) This ending does not feel earned. Yes, it's a shock, but one that felt extremly rushed. I agree with Calvin Dyson that there is no need for urgency to shoot those missiles, yes the ships are coming, but that was not a very clever way to create urgency at all. This ending in my humble opinion just misses the point that it's trying to make about Bond and his family. I respect Craig and the writing team for making that bold decision, but the ending felt (after thinking about it) that it wasn't Bond, who was done with everything, it was Daniel, who just wanted to insure the audience that this was his last Bond film. The ending also raises questions of how are they going to continue the Bond franchise. Are they going to do a reboot of a reboot? That would be quite silly in my mind.Overall, there should be no time to watch anything like this, because it left a very depressive feeling, which a James Bond film shouldn't leave. ""No Time to Die"" could have been a smart, fun Bond movie, but instead it was okay at best.5/10 HK.",there should be no time watch anything like this,i have been bond fan since i was ten years old my first james bond movie was probably goldeneye which i love this day consider it as my favorite film franchise daniel craig era has never been one that i love casino royale skyfall were both fantastic but quantum solace spectre not very good at all put it mildly no time die was my most anticipated movie this year it marks final apperance daniel craig as bond is longest james bond movie up date i saw this movie yesterday heard it was controversial fans after seeing no time die this is certainly going be very divisive film talking about myself i really wanted love this film at times i did there are parts no time die which i think are wonderful but there are also parts it which could have been executed far better lets start with good aspects first shall we production values this movie are fantastic cinematography is gorgeous billie ellishs theme fits story while having haunting lyrics music acting is pretty good all around daniel craig is most chatty he has ever been as bond but hes still very likable role ralph fiennes naomie harris ben whishaw are great as usual lea seydoux is so much better here than she was spectre jeffrey wright christoph waltz are fun what there are rami malek is creepy enough as safin but he is definitely not best villain franchise ana de armas though gives amazing performance she felt such breath fresh air this movie while kicking ass only 10 minutes first hour no time die is compelling enough action scenes italy cuba though chase woods climax saffins island are solid too especially stand out there are moments where humor does land throwbacks other bond films like your eyes only where james bond pushes car henchman were clever story definitely leaves emotional impact audience with choice music themes family turns out bond madeline have daughter mathilde which is not bad idea just convinient story but lets get into my negatives because this movie was disappointing me there are parts like i said which are fantastic thats what makes couple choices story so frustrating me movie is agreed unbalanced feels too long at times there were times where i thought narrative got bit too melodramatic with relationship problems between swan bond deaths felix but especially blofelds death feel crammed into story having no impact anyone just like character nomi who is underdeveloped at best even though actress is very good humor is not always spot does get bit cringe worthy at times one can tell that they were trying make great ending daniel craigs bond by giving him most dialogue one liners but craigs james bond feels out character good portion film biggest issue me was indeed last third film first villains plan destroy world feels forced out nowhere i can understand why he killed all agents spectre but brutally murdering europe full people made no sense me second problem regards fact that bond dies this movie there are several issues with this ending 1 even though it fits movie i think it was craig himself who said that this movie was about family this movie could have ended with daniel craigs 007 after being poisoned escaping island watching his family safe distance or like calvin dyson said having q develop antidote bond james bond faking his own death protect his loved ones makes more sense me than his death 2 this ending does not feel earned yes its shock but one that felt extremly rushed i agree with calvin dyson that there is no need urgency shoot those missiles yes ships are coming but that was not very clever way create urgency at all this ending my humble opinion just misses point that its trying make about bond his family i respect craig writing team making that bold decision but ending felt after thinking about it that it wasnt bond who was done with everything it was daniel who just wanted insure audience that this was his last bond film ending also raises questions how are they going continue bond franchise are they going do reboot reboot that would be quite silly my mind overall there should be no time watch anything like this because it left very depressive feeling which james bond film shouldnt leave no time die could have been smart fun bond movie but instead it was okay at best 5 10 hk,0.5355702630702631,0.21274891774891777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"

1.0,The Eon team have lost their way.,"Bond films have always been made to a specific formula. Here it is.A suave but ruthless British secret service agent, sent on the trail of some megalomaniacal arch villain intent on world domination usually found in a secret elaborate lair situated in some exotic location.He must have a Walther PPK tucked under his Saville Row dinner jacket as he plays Baccaret at an upmarket casino over a few vodka martini's (shaken NOT stirred of course)We want exciting high speed chases..we don't really give a toss whether it's a car chase, a speed boat chase, a motorcycle chase or a ski chase..just get 'em in and make 'em fast.We want impressive gadgets for him to play with along the way and the more buttons, switches and surprise weapons they can pack into his latest car the better.We want our Bond to be provided with a bevvy of hot beautiful women to shag (at least two a day) We want opening credit sequences with these soon to bedded beauties bouncing all over the screen in silhouette form. We want our Bond to be sticking his licenced to thrill weapon into anything with boobs and we want him to callously get up and blow them off with an off colour remark or two before they've even had chance to catch their breath!One last thing (and we cannot stress this one enough) we want James Bond to be alive at the end of it, ready to do his bit for Queen and country all over again in the next instalment.THATS ALL WE WANT. So why the hell are they not giving it us?No Time to Die changes so much of the tried and tested formula. Let's face it, they've been chipping away at it for so long now (primarily to please the woke, PC, SJW lunatics) that they had practically whittled it down to nothing before this turkey even went into production.GET THIS EON! We do not want a soppy and insipid love sick Bond. We do not want soap operas, melodramas, emotional tear jerkers or a message picture. We don't want domestic complications and we definitely don't want major cannon alterations whereby a long established arch villain is revealed to be Bonds long lost brother (I mean come on!!! Who the hell signed off on that cowpat of an idea?) We just want an exciting, action packed, edge of your seat spy caper, with big explosions, kick as$ fist fights, tongue in cheek humour, larger than life baddies and some good old fashioned male chauvinism thrown in for good measure. CAN YOU DO THAT?It's clear from the ending of NTTD that the only way forward for the character of Bond now is a full reboot. Make it a good one and go back to the source material and the original movies to find your bearings again. Whatever you do, don't gimmick up the franchise by pandering to the woke PC diversity whingers.As it stands today.

6.0,Craig's last Bond film is also his weakest,"The first 20-25 minutes are superb (from the music to the location to the acting to the action), but then the titles fall (cool titles, bland song), and the movie never quite reaches those heights again. For such a long, bloated running time it's too talky and surprisingly short on action; in fact, there are only two other notable set-pieces, the car chase in the woods and Ana de Armas brightening up the screen as an overeager, bubbly yet skilled and deadly agent. Most of the rest of the action is uninspired, and in the climactic sequence (just a regular attack-on-the-enemy-fortress we've seen hundreds of times) often dim and murky (Tomorrow Never Dies did this sort of thing much better, and so did some of the Roger Moore Bonds). The plot is formulaic (biological weapon....again), and its treatment of several key players from previous installments disappointing. The ending is pretty silly - it leaves a mess behind that the (inevitable) next chapter will either have to work a whale of a story to get around or (more likely) will ignore altogether. Craig does succeed at embodying a very human Bond, yet I can't help but think that he never really got the chance to do a FUN James Bond living the high life: in Casino he is earning his stripes, in Quantum he is seeking vengeance, in Skyfall he is already tired and resigned, in No Time his circle comes to an end.

6.0,We Have All The Time To Get Bond Wrong!,"As a Bond aficionado since 1992 I was so disappointed with this film.I have waited six years since the last James Bond film (Spectre (2015)) which in itself was a bit of a let down but was out of the film makers hands in some respects.This film has high production values don't get me wrong but it does get Bond wrong in a few ways that left me quite angry from watching a film for the first time since 2001: A Space Odyssey!Gone are the days of a feel good 126 minute Bond with great action sequences, girls etc. Now we have an overly long film weighing in at 163 minutes. Even the curtain raiser, the pre-credits sequence is overly long. I miss the four minutes or so complete with a breathtaking stunt sequence.Daniel Craig as Bond makes his fifth and final appearance in the role.

6.0,"Tiresome, Tedious & Boring, Such A Disappointment","No Time To DieI would love to say this movie was another Skyfall or Spectre but it just was not, it really was a great disappointment.Overly long at 2 hours and 23 mins, it needed a serious edit, it was saggy and baggy and really quite tedious, it lacked style, panache and humour, I will now detail the problems as I see it:There was a 17 year age gap between James Bond and Madeleine Swann, his love interest, this didn't work.The touchy-feely script was miserable and tedious. I have pinpointed the moment a reasonable movie thus far sunk into turkeyville, it was the moment Mathilde was introduced in Norway, look out for this and you will see what I mean.The scene with the ""evil genetic scientist"" was repeated no less than three times.The plot was simplistic and yet it was never explained why Safin wanted to eradicate sections of populace.Vast swathes of the movie were shot in a grey blue murky tinge it was awful!I counted three jokes and a few sarcastic asides, when humour is a key element of our hero.James Bond and children does not go and we all know why.Styling and gizmos were present but dumbed down when this is a key element of Bond!The replacement 007 couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, hammy and stiff as a stick!At best this is a weak 6 outta 10, but nearly everyone I spoke to was putting on a brave face without highlighting a single good bit, but I thought the American agent in the black dressed, ""trained for 3 weeks"" was really great.",tiresome tedious boring such disappointment,no time diei would love say this movie was another skyfall or spectre but it just was not it really was great disappointment overly long at 2 hours 23 mins it needed serious edit it was saggy baggy really quite tedious it lacked style panache humour i will now detail problems as i see it there was 17 year age gap between james bond madeleine swann his love interest this didnt work touchy feely script was miserable tedious i have pinpointed moment reasonable movie thus far sunk into turkeyville it was moment mathilde was introduced norway look out this you will see what i mean scene with evil genetic scientist was repeated no less than three times plot was simplistic yet it was never explained why safin wanted eradicate sections populace vast swathes movie were shot grey blue murky tinge it was awful i counted three jokes few sarcastic asides when humour is key element our hero james bond children does not go we all know why styling gizmos were present but dumbed down when this is key element bond replacement 007 couldnt act her way out paper bag hammy stiff as stick at best this is weak 6 outta 10 but nearly everyone i spoke was putting brave face without highlighting single good bit but i thought american agent black dressed trained 3 weeks was really great,0.5900557445200303,-0.08441515495086929,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,Thank goodness it's over,"The action scenes are very good, you can't take that away, especially as the new female agents (literally) kick a*s. That's all.It's as if you got every previous Bond film and put them into an electric mixer. You'd end up with something that was recognisable as 'a Bond film', but any sense of an individual narrative would be lost. And there's too much stuff about the past.Bond comes out of retirement to prevent the release of a deadly 'nanobot' DNA-targeting virus by the most boring - by a long way - villain of the series. It takes them nearly three hours to regurgitate one of the less interesting Bond plots. And nanobots? That's what pensioners call nanites, it's terribly dated terminology.'M' and everybody back at base follow Bond on remote link, like Obama watching the live Bin Laden feed. That was new several years ago, too.Daniel Craig, looking like the love child of Tommy Lee Jones and Norman Wisdom, stiffens his upper lip, stiffly, which is why he can't deliver any of the supposedly funny lines, and his voice is not the voice of a Royal Navy Commander, it's the voice of a particularly miserable bookie.",thank goodness its over,action scenes are very good you cant take that away especially as new female agents literally kick s thats all its as if you got every previous bond film put them into electric mixer youd end up with something that was recognisable as bond film but any sense individual narrative would be lost theres too much stuff about past bond comes out retirement prevent release deadly nanobot dna targeting virus by most boring by long way villain series it takes them nearly three hours regurgitate one less interesting bond plots nanobots thats what pensioners call nanites its terribly dated terminology m everybody back at base follow bond remote link like obama watching live bin laden feed that was new several years ago too daniel craig looking like love child tommy lee jones norman wisdom stiffens his upper lip stiffly which is why he cant deliver any supposedly funny lines his voice is not voice royal navy commander its voice particularly miserable bookie,0.46272727272727276,-0.049709796376463056,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.44}"

5.0,Blofeld sends his regards.,"No Time to Die engages in its farewell, but still finds itself near the bottom of the heap.The opening's solid, the Billie Eilish song okay, the credits dull. Interesting plot, can relate to the COVID shot in a way. I'm surprised and disappointed Ana de Armas isn't in it more, though Lea Seydoux does a fine job. Craig's films while never among the best, aren't among the worst either. This one drops off a bit though and the PC levels set fire to what the franchise is built on and part of what makes it great. Credit that it has the ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" theme and ""We Have all the Time in the World,"" the high point of the franchise, no mention of Tracy though. Craig the usual, Waltz good as Blofeld but limited like de Armas. Negatively Malek as the bad guy doesn't give a performance and other characters including the new 007, woeful.",blofeld sends his regards,no time die engages its farewell but still finds itself near bottom heap openings solid billie eilish song okay credits dull interesting plot can relate covid shot way im surprised disappointed ana de armas isnt it more though lea seydoux does fine job craigs films while never among best arent among worst either this one drops off bit though pc levels set fire what franchise is built part what makes it great credit that it has her majestys secret service theme we have all time world high point franchise no mention tracy though craig usual waltz good as blofeld but limited like de armas negatively malek as bad guy doesnt give performance other characters including new 007 woeful,0.5156699649556793,0.048806431663574505,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.39}"
6.0,WOKE DOESN'T WORK,"I have been a longtime fan of James Bond films. One of my earliest memories of seeing a movie for the first time was GOLDFINGER when it was released. I didn't always see the new films as they were released but if I could I was there ready to be thrilled at the latest exploit. I've enjoyed each of the actors who have played Bond for various reasons. I thought the latest incarnation by Daniel Craig was superb. Until NO TIME TO DIE.The film starts in the past as a young Madeline Swann witnesses the murder of her mother by Lyutsifer Safin. In spite of the fact that she shoots him he rescues her after she falls through the ice of a nearby frozen lake.Fast forward to the present. After having captured Blofeld in the previous film Bond (Craig) and Madeline (Lea Seydoux) are in Matera. Bond leaves her in the hotel to visit the gravesite of Vesper Lynd where he is attacked by two assassins. Rushing back to the hotel he finds Madeline packed and ready to leave. Thinking she has betrayed him he leaves everything behind.Another time jump, this time 5 years in the future and Bond has retired from service, living in Jamaica. An old face pops up in the form of CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Leiter is asking for help in finding Valdo Orbuchev, an MI6 researcher. Bond declines but is later visited by Nomi (Lashana Lynch), his successor as the new 007. She explains to Bond that Orbuchev has created a bioweapon made of nanobots. These nanobots inject a virus but only intended for a singular DNA pattern. With this new knowledge, Bond agrees to help.Going to Cuba both Bond and Leiter work their way into a secret meeting of Spectre. Even though he's in prison Blofeld is in touch with this gathering remotely. He orders the nanobots mist to be sprayed on Bond but instead of Bond falling all the members of Spectre begin to drop like flies. Blofeld has had Orbuchev reprogram the nanobots to do so. In an effort to stop the bad guys Leiter is killed and Bond sets out for revenge.A meeting between Blofeld and Bond is set up in prison. Also on hand is Madeline who has been coerced to have the nanobots placed in her system to kill Blofeld. She touches Bonds hand before he sees Blofeld passing the nanobots onto him. During their meeting Blofeld let's Bond know that he was responsible for the attack at Vesper's grave, not Madeline. Angered Bond grabs him and thus passes on the nanobots killing him.There is so much more story to go on from here involving Bond discovering he and Madeline had a daughter together to finding out the plan laid down by Safin. It is rather convoluted and better experienced than read about if you are a Bond fan. But it is also part of what makes this one of the worst Bond films made.Don't get me wrong, even a bad Bond film is a good movie. But in knowing that this was going to be the final film with Craig in the lead role they've pulled out all the stops. At 163 minutes the film is way too heavy on plot and less on action. Yes, the stunt work, car chases and fight sequences are there but more time is spent discussing Bond's emotions and that is just not Bond. At least it hasn't been in the 24 films prior to this one. He's lost a wife in one film, another woman who would have married him and more and he's never felt like a character you were going to sit down and wallow in self-pity crying. This is the new woke Bond and in making him this they may have killed the franchise.But there is one more major item that may have killed the franchise even more so. If you aren't aware stop reading this column now. Seriously stop reading if you don't know the end. Reader be warned. The end of this film has Bond killed. No last minute escape, no secret rendezvous, 100% killed dead. Which makes one wonder what happens now? Will we see the old Bond in earlier adventures with a new young actor? Or will they go full woke and have Nomi as the new 007? Only time will tell.The acting is great, the stunts amazing and the photography stunning. But in the end the movie is far too long and feels more like a melodrama than an action flick. And that's what Bond films have always been. Others have noted since the release of the film that it may have gone too woke and have killed off the franchise for good. Who knows?Being a completist on the series I did buy it. I'll give it another watch. Maybe my feelings will calm a bit with a second viewing. I certainly hope so.",woke doesnt work,i have been longtime fan james bond films one my earliest memories seeing movie first time was goldfinger when it was released i didnt always see new films as they were released but if i could i was there ready be thrilled at latest exploit ive enjoyed each actors who have played bond various reasons i thought latest incarnation by daniel craig was superb until no time die film starts past as young madeline swann witnesses murder her mother by lyutsifer safin spite fact that she shoots him he rescues her after she falls through ice nearby frozen lake fast forward present after having captured blofeld previous film bond craig madeline lea seydoux are matera bond leaves her hotel visit gravesite vesper lynd where he is attacked by two assassins rushing back hotel he finds madeline packed ready leave thinking she has betrayed him he leaves everything behind another time jump this time 5 years future bond has retired service living jamaica old face pops up form cia agent felix leiter jeffrey wright leiter is asking help finding valdo orbuchev mi6 researcher bond declines but is later visited by nomi lashana lynch his successor as new 007 she explains bond that orbuchev has created bioweapon made nanobots these nanobots inject virus but only intended singular dna pattern with this new knowledge bond agrees help going cuba both bond leiter work their way into secret meeting spectre even though hes prison blofeld is touch with this gathering remotely he orders nanobots mist be sprayed bond but instead bond falling all members spectre begin drop like flies blofeld has had orbuchev reprogram nanobots do so effort stop bad guys leiter is killed bond sets out revenge meeting between blofeld bond is set up prison also hand is madeline who has been coerced have nanobots placed her system kill blofeld she touches bonds hand before he sees blofeld passing nanobots onto him during their meeting blofeld lets bond know that he was responsible attack at vespers grave not madeline angered bond grabs him thus passes nanobots killing him there is so much more story go here involving bond discovering he madeline had daughter together finding out plan laid down by safin it is rather convoluted better experienced than read about if you are bond fan but it is also part what makes this one worst bond films made dont get me wrong even bad bond film is good movie but knowing that this was going be final film with craig lead role theyve pulled out all stops at 163 minutes film is way too heavy plot less action yes stunt work car chases fight sequences are there but more time is spent discussing bonds emotions that is just not bond at least it hasnt been 24 films prior this one hes lost wife one film another woman who would have married him more hes never felt like character you were going sit down wallow self pity crying this is new woke bond making him this they may have killed franchise but there is one more major item that may have killed franchise even more so if you arent aware stop reading this column now seriously stop reading if you dont know end reader be warned end this film has bond killed no last minute escape no secret rendezvous 100 killed dead which makes one wonder what happens now will we see old bond earlier adventures with new young actor or will they go full woke have nomi as new 007 only time will tell acting is great stunts amazing photography stunning but end movie is far too long feels more like melodrama than action flick thats what bond films have always been others have noted since release film that it may have gone too woke have killed off franchise good who knows being completist series i did buy it ill give it another watch maybe my feelings will calm bit with second viewing i certainly hope so,0.4592330871742636,0.07020223240811475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.5}"
