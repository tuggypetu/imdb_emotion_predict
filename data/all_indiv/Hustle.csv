9.0,"If you're not a fan of basketball, you'll still enjoy this well put-together film.","But if you are, then you'll love this Adam Sandler and LeBron James production. It's a great and touching story, told perfectly, with outstanding performances and chemistry by Sandler and actual NBA star Juancho Hernangomez. You'll also see a bunch of other NBA players and celebrities. The directing is excellent, as is the cinematography. The almost 2 hour runtime flew by with the great pacing. This film is certainly one of the better sport-dramas I've seen, if not the best. I promise you you'll laugh and you will cry. This is a re-watch at least one more time for sure. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",if youre not fan basketball youll still enjoy this well put together film,but if you are then youll love this adam sandler lebron james production its great touching story told perfectly with outstanding performances chemistry by sandler actual nba star juancho hernangomez youll also see bunch other nba players celebrities directing is excellent as is cinematography almost 2 hour runtime flew by with great pacing this film is certainly one better sport dramas ive seen if not best i promise you youll laugh you will cry this is re watch at least one more time sure well deserved 9 10 me,0.5711951447245563,0.38760504201680673,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.18}"
9.0,Has Sandler found a new zone in his career?,"I like where Sandler's movie career is heading again....finally.""Hustle"" and ""Uncut Gems* portrait Sandler as a real dude with depth, humility and vulnerability with a funny side. Not Billy Madison crazy goofy but good chum amusing.Sandler plays a scout for the 76ers who just got promoted to assistant coach. He has a long relationship with the owner who passes away and the new owner (the son) bumps him back to scout. Wandering the streets of Spain, he comes across a heated pick-up game and a tall chap dominating. He stalks him down, presents some informal credentials and persuades him to come to the US. Now the challenge is will Sandler be able to peak the interest of any NBA team to find him a spot on their roster. And will the dude be mentally and physically tough enough to prove his worth?This was highly enjoyable and engaging and while the outcome can be guessed, many doubts were planted along the way.

,"Adam Sandler has become an accomplished actor, and this hoop drama is a winner.","""I love this game. I live this game."" Stanley Sugerman (Adam Sandler)Hustle is a commanding Netflix original that nudges the formulaic ""Hoop Dreams"" out of its comfort zone into an entertaining drama that emphasizes ambition, brotherly love (set in Philadelphia after all), and familial support, traits that could apply to any underdog struggling against immense forces.Stanley Sugerman is a has-been scout for the '76ers who discovers a Madrid street champion, Bo Cruz (Juancho Hernangomez), and promotes him in the states for the NBA, eventually using his own funds to bring him over. Although the usual cliches like a cocky antagonist Kermit Wilts (Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Anthony Edwards) and a dismissive owner Vince Merrick (Ben Foster) are there, Sandler, eschewing his usual over-the-top comic shtick, gives warmth and sincerity (he loves basketball anyway) to make the challenges believable and him a hero.Just look at the sweet meet between Stanley's family and Bo's to see how deftly director Jeremiah Zugar (from South Philly) swings from a saccharine take to a modest, loving union of people who understand the unifying nature of Bo and Stanley's ambition. After seeing Sandler in his tour de force Uncut Gems (Also Netflix), I am a Sandler fan who believes Sandler has moved almost instantaneously from comic to dramatic (well, maybe that fast if you consider his performance in Punch Drunk Love).If you're young an unimpressed with my praise, perhaps these ingredients will help you to tune it in: Multiple cameos of other NBA stars, LeBron James a producer, and gritty, electric streetball games; the use of social media to get the attention of indifferent NBA bigwigs. For me, seeing Sandler as a warm and flawed human being play beside an equally affecting Hernangomez, is worth a warm evening enjoying, as we all did with the similarly-based Rocky, seeing humans striving to be more than they are.",adam sandler has become accomplished actor this hoop drama is winner,i love this game i live this game stanley sugerman adam sandler hustle is commanding netflix original that nudges formulaic hoop dreams out its comfort zone into entertaining drama that emphasizes ambition brotherly love set philadelphia after all familial support traits that could apply any underdog struggling against immense forces stanley sugerman is has been scout 76ers who discovers madrid street champion bo cruz juancho hernangomez promotes him states nba eventually using his own funds bring him over although usual cliches like cocky antagonist kermit wilts minnesota timberwolves teammate anthony edwards dismissive owner vince merrick ben foster are there sandler eschewing his usual over top comic shtick gives warmth sincerity he loves basketball anyway make challenges believable him hero just look at sweet meet between stanleys family bos see how deftly director jeremiah zugar south philly swings saccharine take modest loving union people who understand unifying nature bo stanleys ambition after seeing sandler his tour de force uncut gems also netflix i am sandler fan who believes sandler has moved almost instantaneously comic dramatic well maybe that fast if you consider his performance punch drunk love if youre young unimpressed with my praise perhaps these ingredients will help you tune it multiple cameos other nba stars lebron james producer gritty electric streetball games use social media get attention indifferent nba bigwigs me seeing sandler as warm flawed human being play beside equally affecting hernangomez is worth warm evening enjoying as we all did with similarly based rocky seeing humans striving be more than they are,0.5388211382113822,0.13991130820399114,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.34}"

7.0,for love of the game,"Greetings again from the darkness. As a sports fan and movie fan, I approach every sports movie with trepidation and low expectations. Let's face it, most actors aren't great (or even good) athletes, and most athletes aren't great (or even good) actors. We would have no interest in a western where the cowboys can't ride horses, just as we have no interest in watching John Goodman portray a baseball legend in THE BABE (1992). I tell you this to convey my state of mind while preparing to watch this basketball movie from director Jeremiah Zagar and co-writers Will Fetters (A STAR IS BORN, 2018) and Taylor Materne. It gives me pleasure to say that even though the premise is kind of similar to Kevin Bacon's 1992 film, THE AIR UP THERE, this one should satisfy most sports and basketball fans.Adam Sandler stars as Stanley Sugermen, a long-time scout for the Philadelphia 76'ers. An opening montage gives us a taste of why he's worn out and beaten down after so many years on the road. Rushing to catch flights, too many fast-food meals, crashing in one hotel after another, and chasing down tips on the next great player ... it all adds up to frustration and too much time away from his wife Teresa (Queen Latifah) and teenage daughter (Jordan Hull). Feeling unappreciated and questioning his professional future, Stanley is ecstatic when the long-time Sixers owner played by (Oscar winner) Robert Duvall promotes Stanley to assistant coach. Unfortunately, the dream-come-true turns into a nightmare when the beloved owner dies, leaving his cocky son Vince (Ben Foster) in charge of the team. Vince has little respect for Stanley and promptly sends him back on the road.It's in Mallorca, Spain where Stanley stumbles on a nighttime game at a local outdoor court. Immediately catching his eye is an intense, lanky player in work boots. NBA player Juancho Hernangomez stars as Bo Cruz, a true previously undiscovered diamond in the rough. The dream of all scouts is to be the first to find a transcendent player, and once they hear the NBA minimum salary, Bo's mother and young daughter are on board with Stanley taking Bo to the United States. Of course, things don't go according to plan. Vince rejects Bo, and a history of anger issues comes back to haunt Bo. Stanley ignores the naysayers, trusts his instincts, and takes on the project of preparing Bo for the scouting combine. The training montage is very well done, as Sandler and Juancho are both believable and draw us in for support.Cinematographer Zak Mulligan and director Zagar deserve credit for filming the basketball sequences in a style that highlights the athletic talent without resorting to cheap editing tricks. Of course it helps that the basketball sequences are loaded with actual NBA players and playground legends. These guys look like they can play because they CAN. I'll leave the closing credit montage to highlight most of those involved, but a couple of standouts include Boban Marjonovich and Anthony Edwards, the latter playing Bo's head-game nemesis, Kermit Wilts. Also making appearances are Kenny Smith as a player agent, and the great Julius ""Dr J"" Erving, who has a couple of scenes.When most people think of Adam Sandler, his long list of sophomoric and absurd man-child movies come to mind. Certainly, he can't be blamed for giving the masses what they want. It's made him a very rich man. However, his talent in more dramatic roles should not be ignored. The recent UNCUT GEMS and THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES are examples, and going back further, his turn in PUNCH DRUNK LOVE remains one of his best. As Stanley Sugermen, Sandler injects humor into his love of basketball, tossing in a couple of 'soccer' and 'geezer' jokes. Overall, he successfully captures the essence of an everyman seeking redemption for his self and his family.Streaming on Netflix beginning June 8, 2022.",love game,greetings again darkness as sports fan movie fan i approach every sports movie with trepidation low expectations lets face it most actors arent great or even good athletes most athletes arent great or even good actors we would have no interest western where cowboys cant ride horses just as we have no interest watching john goodman portray baseball legend babe 1992 i tell you this convey my state mind while preparing watch this basketball movie director jeremiah zagar co writers will fetters star is born 2018 taylor materne it gives me pleasure say that even though premise is kind similar kevin bacons 1992 film air up there this one should satisfy most sports basketball fans adam sandler stars as stanley sugermen long time scout philadelphia 76ers opening montage gives us taste why hes worn out beaten down after so many years road rushing catch flights too many fast food meals crashing one hotel after another chasing down tips next great player it all adds up frustration too much time away his wife teresa queen latifah teenage daughter jordan hull feeling unappreciated questioning his professional future stanley is ecstatic when long time sixers owner played by oscar winner robert duvall promotes stanley assistant coach unfortunately dream come true turns into nightmare when beloved owner dies leaving his cocky son vince ben foster charge team vince has little respect stanley promptly sends him back road its mallorca spain where stanley stumbles nighttime game at local outdoor court immediately catching his eye is intense lanky player work boots nba player juancho hernangomez stars as bo cruz true previously undiscovered diamond rough dream all scouts is be first find transcendent player once they hear nba minimum salary bos mother young daughter are board with stanley taking bo united states course things dont go according plan vince rejects bo history anger issues comes back haunt bo stanley ignores naysayers trusts his instincts takes project preparing bo scouting combine training montage is very well done as sandler juancho are both believable draw us support cinematographer zak mulligan director zagar deserve credit filming basketball sequences style that highlights athletic talent without resorting cheap editing tricks course it helps that basketball sequences are loaded with actual nba players playground legends these guys look like they can play because they can ill leave closing credit montage highlight most those involved but couple standouts include boban marjonovich anthony edwards latter playing bos head game nemesis kermit wilts also making appearances are kenny smith as player agent great julius dr j erving who has couple scenes when most people think adam sandler his long list sophomoric absurd man child movies come mind certainly he cant be blamed giving masses what they want its made him very rich man however his talent more dramatic roles should not be ignored recent uncut gems meyerowitz stories are examples going back further his turn punch drunk love remains one his best as stanley sugermen sandler injects humor into his love basketball tossing couple soccer geezer jokes overall he successfully captures essence everyman seeking redemption his self his family streaming netflix beginning june 8 2022,0.48070294784580503,0.15933106575963718,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9.0,The definition of what a vision is,"SCORE: 8.8/10I absolutely loved it. This movie is the definition of what a vision is. Adam Sandler took his love for basketball and injected himself into the NBA in a way that hasn't been done before, at least since Like Mike. I was also incredibly impressed by the acting ability of some of these NBA players and legends. Some of them weren't just in for a quick cameo, but instead real supporting characters such as Kenny Smith. Anthony Edwards was a very convincing villain and the sheer amount of cameos was insane.But, as someone who went to college in Philly, this film did a beautiful job of highlighting such an amazing city, including the decision to incorporate Philly greats like Dr. J, AI, and Villanova legends Kyle Lowry and Jay Wright. And, most likely not on purpose, this movie captured the true dysfunction and poor decision making that makes up the Philadelphia 76ers. Although, I feel like Bo's aggressive side would've actually made the Philadelphia 76ers like him even more, contrary to how he was treated.Regardless, this movie made me laugh, it made me cry, and it was amazing to see what was produced by Adam Sandler and LeBron James.

It's a really well made movie that's entertaining and well casted. The soundtrack is good. It's a feel good movie about redemption and never giving up.

7.0,A predictable-yet-fun sports drama with a good Sandler performance! [+66%],"While this could very easily have been another goofy, over-the-top sports drama from the Happy Madison team, the writers Taylor Materne & Will Fetters along with director Jeremiah Zagar ensure they add the essential ingredient - heart. Yes, it helps if you have context of the game of basketball and the running of the NBA, but Hustle treats its lead characters with sufficient emotional touches that make their journey worth seeing. Once again, Sandler is great in a serious role with some occasional comical flourishes. The film doesn't try to generate comedy for the sake of it. All that's there is situational and comes naturally within the interactions.I also liked how the film took time to flesh out the leads' inner conflicts, capping off their arcs (especially Sandler's) in satisfying fashion. For the ardent NBA fanatic, there are lots of exciting cameos. For everyone else, the underdog story, even with its share of predictable elements, is still fairly enjoyable.

9.0,Incredible sports drama,"Hustle may tell a very predictable story but it remains an incredible sports drama because it tells it's story with plenty of warmth and a clear love and passion for the sport with satisfying nuance and restraint.Adam Sandler gives a perfectly understated performance, especially compared to his usual output but still has plenty of dry wit that lands consistently. Juanco Hernangomez is great with a character you desperately want to succeed and Queen Latifah brings even more heart and emotion to the proceedings.Jeremiah Zagar's direction is fantastic, giving the film a lot of energy and moments of beauty whilst still delivering the required montages and thrilling basketball sequences. The music by Dan Deacon is the only part of the film that is over the top but it still works really well.",incredible sports drama,hustle may tell very predictable story but it remains incredible sports drama because it tells its story with plenty warmth clear love passion sport with satisfying nuance restraint adam sandler gives perfectly understated performance especially compared his usual output but still has plenty dry wit that lands consistently juanco hernangomez is great with character you desperately want succeed queen latifah brings even more heart emotion proceedings jeremiah zagars direction is fantastic giving film lot energy moments beauty whilst still delivering required montages thrilling basketball sequences music by dan deacon is only part film that is over top but it still works really well,0.7043859649122807,0.29596491228070176,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,If You Love The Game Of Basketball You'll Enjoy This!,"I found myself engulfed in this movie at the theater. The story transitioned well from scene to scene. There's a lot of NBA players who show up in the movie and they did a good job acting. My only complaint is Juancho Hernangómez and his ""family"" speaking in the film. It's really hard to understand them because of their thick accents. I personally needed subtitles, but of course there were no subtitles at the movie theater. But he did a good job acting.I actually quite enjoyed this film. People who have a great knowledge of basketball will notice some ""underground"" basketball legends like The Professor and Bone Collector from the old school And1 mixtape tours.Adam Sandler yells in the film. You know you were looking forward to it. It wouldn't be an Adam Sandler film without it. LOL. But in all seriousness, there's not much yelling. Adam Sandler's other basketball movie ""Uncut Gems"" was 90% yelling. Like every character was speaking in their angry voice for 2 hours. This movie was way better than Uncut Gems.",if you love game basketball youll enjoy this,i found myself engulfed this movie at theater story transitioned well scene scene theres lot nba players who show up movie they did good job acting my only complaint is juancho hernang mez his family speaking film its really hard understand them because their thick accents i personally needed subtitles but course there were no subtitles at movie theater but he did good job acting i actually quite enjoyed this film people who have great knowledge basketball will notice some underground basketball legends like professor bone collector old school and1 mixtape tours adam sandler yells film you know you were looking forward it it wouldnt be adam sandler film without it lol but all seriousness theres not much yelling adam sandlers other basketball movie uncut gems was 90 yelling like every character was speaking their angry voice 2 hours this movie was way better than uncut gems,0.49311594202898557,0.086231884057971,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8.0,"I don't like basketball, however I loved this film!","If you would have told be a few years ago that I would be loving a basketball film with Adam Sandler starring in the lead, I would have laughed in your face!I'll be honest I absolutely hate basketball, its the only US sport that I can't get into. I love all the other sports they play over there but basketball I could never understand its popularity. (It is 100% not popular in my country which probs don't help) So I wasn't expecting much before seeing this film, it would have to be something really special to convert me!I am staggered at how brilliant this film is, it has absolutely everything going for it! Adam Sandler is redefining his career, firstly ""Uncut Gems"" and now this film. It's not to the same level of a transformation as ""Uncut Gems"" however he is absolutely great in the film and really believable in the role. I actually forgot I was watching Adam Sandler at one point and just saw an honest and truthful interpretation of a character being brought to life!The directing, cinematography, gameplay scenes and most importantly the story are all top class. Such an easy story to get behind and root for. An underdog/redemption story all in one and not just for the basketball prospect but for Sandler's character to. Mirrors each other extremely well! I loved the editing and fast paced nature of the gameplay scenes that were shot. Energetic, vibrant and heart pounding from start finish. Gave the film a different element that it 100% needed, away from just training montages out of ""Rocky""!One last area I also loved was the use of real life basketball stars which is really awesome to see. I can't think of another sport where the actually players would appear in a film. Not just appear in a film but it actually work and feel authentic!The best part for me was the ending to the story. Its a satisfying ending for the young prospect, who gets into the NBA. However it is not with the Philadelphia team that Sandler's character is with, it is with a rival team from Boston. I loved the fact that the film didn't try and give us this over the top dream ending. At the end of the day it is still a win for the player and coach that he gets into the league regardless of who he plays for!Any sports fan will like this film. Any basketball fan will adore this film. Any person who loves to see great performances will be amazed with Sandler, who has knock it out of the park yet again. Please Adam give us more of this!Lastly if it can convert a basketball hating and Sandler critic into actually really enjoying and loving the finish product, something must be great about this film!80% out of 100%",i dont like basketball however i loved this film,if you would have told be few years ago that i would be loving basketball film with adam sandler starring lead i would have laughed your face ill be honest i absolutely hate basketball its only us sport that i cant get into i love all other sports they play over there but basketball i could never understand its popularity it is 100 not popular my country which probs dont help so i wasnt expecting much before seeing this film it would have be something really special convert me i am staggered at how brilliant this film is it has absolutely everything going it adam sandler is redefining his career firstly uncut gems now this film its not same level transformation as uncut gems however he is absolutely great film really believable role i actually forgot i was watching adam sandler at one point just saw honest truthful interpretation character being brought life directing cinematography gameplay scenes most importantly story are all top class such easy story get behind root underdog redemption story all one not just basketball prospect but sandlers character mirrors each other extremely well i loved editing fast paced nature gameplay scenes that were shot energetic vibrant heart pounding start finish gave film different element that it 100 needed away just training montages out rocky one last area i also loved was use real life basketball stars which is really awesome see i cant think another sport where actually players would appear film not just appear film but it actually work feel authentic best part me was ending story its satisfying ending young prospect who gets into nba however it is not with philadelphia team that sandlers character is with it is with rival team boston i loved fact that film didnt try give us this over top dream ending at end day it is still win player coach that he gets into league regardless who he plays any sports fan will like this film any basketball fan will adore this film any person who loves see great performances will be amazed with sandler who has knock it out park yet again please adam give us more this lastly if it can convert basketball hating sandler critic into actually really enjoying loving finish product something must be great about this film 80 out 100,0.6044805194805196,0.29422077922077927,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.34}"
