9,So Far The Best Entertainer of this year,"After 3 films with Akshya Kumar as lead, Neeraj Pandey switched over to Sushant Singh Rajput and made this movie based on the life of Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni.First of all, to make a biopic is not an easy job. As what the maker finds interesting, the person on which the biopic is happening may not! He wants something to show, but the maker is not convince with that. These are some basic differences. And after all this, a movie should be a true entertainer. So, the toughest part for the maker is to decide what to show & how to show. Because the maker has to give pure justice to the person's life without hurting his fans and followers.Neeraj starts the film with the 2011 world cup final. And when Dhoni enters in the ground, Neeraj switches of to the flashback. From this point, the film picks up the speed. From the birth of Dhoni, to his schooling, to his relationship with his sister, to his caring mother & strict father, to his friendships, to his matches, to his practice, to his breakdown where he gets to know that he can't play Dulip Trophy, to his disregarding by selectors, to his job as a TC, to his hard work, to his self realization and getting into the train. Every single scene is running like a fast paced balling delivery. The 50% of the film is complete and than you realize that one hour and thirty minutes are over.In post interval, love story starts with Ind-Pak series. Some beautiful tracks and little lighter moments are there in love segments. But as compare to the first half, this is not that much in speed. But you don't feel like boring. And than Sakshi's entry, Dhoni's marriage, and back to the first scene and completes the circle with winning six in the final of 2011 world cup.Lyrics by Manoj Muntshir and Music by Amaal Malik are fantastic. Besabriyaan is my favorite along with the soulful track Kaun Tujhe. The entire album suits to the film. We have noticed in Neeraj's movie, that one background tune which has been constantly played throughout the film. In this movie too, one outstanding tune is there.Anupam Kher, Kumud Mishra, Rajesh & Bhumika are the backbone supporter of this film. Disha Patani looks pretty. Kaira Advani is suitable as Sakshi. Overall a good team in supporter.But the man, Sushant Singh Rajput is a true actor. After delivering a classic performance in last year's Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, he shines out this time too. As a lead, his dedication towards becoming Dhoni is fantastic. From gaining the weight as Dhoni to setting a hairstyle like him, he just delivered his best. His 150 days of cricket training clearly speaks out loud when he strikes the ball with a helicopter shot. He is a real actor of today's generation.Now, what to say about Neeraj! I love all his films. I've seen Baby and Special 26 more than 20 times. And I like this one too. So, whenever I'll get chance, will surely watch this again and again.On the whole, after collecting 20cr on the first day, the movie will fly high at box office. Without any promotions on TV, without any major star casts, this film is doing well, and there are two reasons- Dhoni and Neeraj Pandey. Public is smart and they know on whom they can trust. So, just go and see the film. A pure entertainer of this year. Get inspiration from Dhoni's life and his hard-work.And one more request, please cheer up the hall. As I've seen some snapchat videos where the hall is silent even on the winning stroke. I'm lucky that the hall where I went was so enthusiastic to see this film, that every single stoke of Dhoni or even Gambhir or Yuvraj got applause. Some glimpse of Sachin, Sehwag or any other cricketer also got appreciation by the audience. In my life, I've heard cheers on a six or four in the cinema-hall rather than a stadium. These things made my day. Best movie experience of this year so far.By far, my most favorite biopic film is Bhag Milkha Bhag. And after that, I guess this film.",so far best entertainer this year,after 3 films with akshya kumar as lead neeraj pandey switched over sushant singh rajput made this movie based life indian cricketer mahendra singh dhoni first all make biopic is not easy job as what maker finds interesting person which biopic is happening may not he wants something show but maker is not convince with that these are some basic differences after all this movie should be true entertainer so toughest part maker is decide what show how show because maker has give pure justice persons life without hurting his fans followers neeraj starts film with 2011 world cup final when dhoni enters ground neeraj switches flashback this point film picks up speed birth dhoni his schooling his relationship with his sister his caring mother strict father his friendships his matches his practice his breakdown where he gets know that he cant play dulip trophy his disregarding by selectors his job as tc his hard work his self realization getting into train every single scene is running like fast paced balling delivery 50 film is complete than you realize that one hour thirty minutes are over post interval love story starts with ind pak series some beautiful tracks little lighter moments are there love segments but as compare first half this is not that much speed but you dont feel like boring than sakshis entry dhonis marriage back first scene completes circle with winning six final 2011 world cup lyrics by manoj muntshir music by amaal malik are fantastic besabriyaan is my favorite along with soulful track kaun tujhe entire album suits film we have noticed neerajs movie that one background tune which has been constantly played throughout film this movie too one outstanding tune is there anupam kher kumud mishra rajesh bhumika are backbone supporter this film disha patani looks pretty kaira advani is suitable as sakshi overall good team supporter but man sushant singh rajput is true actor after delivering classic performance last years detective byomkesh bakshy he shines out this time too as lead his dedication towards becoming dhoni is fantastic gaining weight as dhoni setting hairstyle like him he just delivered his best his 150 days cricket training clearly speaks out loud when he strikes ball with helicopter shot he is real actor todays generation now what say about neeraj i love all his films ive seen baby special 26 more than 20 times i like this one too so whenever ill get chance will surely watch this again again whole after collecting 20cr first day movie will fly high at box office without any promotions tv without any major star casts this film is doing well there are two reasons dhoni neeraj pandey public is smart they know whom they can trust so just go see film pure entertainer this year get inspiration dhonis life his hard work one more request please cheer up hall as ive seen some snapchat videos where hall is silent even winning stroke im lucky that hall where i went was so enthusiastic see this film that every single stoke dhoni or even gambhir or yuvraj got applause some glimpse sachin sehwag or any other cricketer also got appreciation by audience my life ive heard cheers six or four cinema hall rather than stadium these things made my day best movie experience this year so far by far my most favorite biopic film is bhag milkha bhag after that i guess this film,0.5648344671201814,0.23714965986394557,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9,The first half proves why Neeraj Pandey is one of the Best Directors in the country.,"""Absolutely magnificent, Dhoni,finishes off in-style, A magnificent stroke into the crowd! India lift the world cup, After 28 years , The party started in the dressing room. and, Its an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent in the night of the final."" Pretty much one of the best moments of the movie. Massive goosebumps. Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story. The movie's main strength is clearly Sushant Singh Rajput who shines in every scene. He has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly. The first of the movie is stunning, brilliantly acted, poor special effects with some great dialogues and excellent direction by Neeraj Pandey. The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done. It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey's best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. WTF Neeraj Pandey but the movie moved at a steady pace nevertheless. It was like living the past. The famous India-Pakistan series where Dhoni shines. A lot of moments. It was like a Pleasant flashback. The performances in the movie are brilliant. Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni. What a performance! Not his best, I feel Kai Po Che was better. He was seamless, cool, composed, confident. Just like MSD. He breaks down in one scene. Which was brilliant. The Supporting Star Cast is brilliant.Every Actor in the supporting role. FANTASTIC!!! They are a lot of them. Everyone was brilliant. The actresses were strictly average. The music was decent. The movie is a solid 8-8.5/10. The love angles and the bad special effects in the first half are the only things which could have been improved. You'll love it if you loved cricket. You'll like it if you love good cinema.",first half proves why neeraj pandey is one best directors country,absolutely magnificent dhoni finishes off style magnificent stroke into crowd india lift world cup after 28 years party started dressing room its indian captain whos been absolutely magnificent night final pretty much one best moments movie massive goosebumps ms dhoni untold story is fantastically made movie which is like two sides same coin first half which shows why neeraj pandey is one best directors country while second half shows why neeraj pandey should never make love story movies main strength is clearly sushant singh rajput who shines every scene he has captured essence calm composed dhoni portrayed it brilliantly first movie is stunning brilliantly acted poor special effects with some great dialogues excellent direction by neeraj pandey cricketing aspect dhoni is so well done it shows that there is always team behind person who is successful ode friendship struggles responsibility compromise facing life regardless unexpected turns twists i was awe how well connected movie was moving one point another so effortlessly neeraj pandeys best hour cinema second half starts well but two love stories really bring down movie actresses are likable all wtf neeraj pandey but movie moved at steady pace nevertheless it was like living past famous india pakistan series where dhoni shines lot moments it was like pleasant flashback performances movie are brilliant sushant singh rajput as dhoni what performance not his best i feel kai po che was better he was seamless cool composed confident just like msd he breaks down one scene which was brilliant supporting star cast is brilliant every actor supporting role fantastic they are lot them everyone was brilliant actresses were strictly average music was decent movie is solid 8 8 5 10 love angles bad special effects first half are only things which could have been improved youll love it if you loved cricket youll like it if you love good cinema,0.5616043083900225,0.33790249433106573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.17}"
9,An Indisputable Effort By Sushant Singh Rajput,"MS DHONI : THE UNTOLD STORY! AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT BY SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUTFrom the beginning of the movie every one must have understood that their hearts gonna stop for a few moments! And they have not been wrong. I'm not highlighting the plot in detail as I'm pretty much interested not to unfold the story line as many of you will go to watch it.Let me talk about the best parts. First of all, Sushant's tremendous acting and dedication deserve a big thumbs up. Next Anupam Kher and Rajesh Sharma rightly have adjusted themselves to their spots. Herry Tangri (Yuvi) excellently has scaled himself with his character. Kiara Advani (Sakshi), Disha Patani(Priyanka) have given their best too. Well, now I must talk about the cinematography, here Santosh Thundiyil has done a brilliant job. Especially Dhoni's train capturing scene leaving his job and Dhoni's coming out of the dressing room scene during the World Cup (2011) Final help a lot to excel this film. Undoubtedly fantastic cinematography it has. As a director Neeraj Pandey is of course successful but somewhere it has lacked a bit of his special touch. Though it doesn't matter because you will not find a single moment that can make you bore. The story has real gravity and it successfully has followed the tag line i.e ""The man you know... The journey you don't"". Truly it has focused on his journey- his struggle, ups and downs etc. The dialogues are very inspiring and heart-touching at many places. It is around 190mins' movie. You may think it's quite long but trust me after watching it you'll think if it could be of 5 hours that would have been perfect.... Even the Dhoni-haters can't deny that.. Actually there's so much to tell about. Anyway, let's come to the background sound... Truly effective though at some points it could have been better. Except that the editing has been done quite well but truly it's the place where it has lacked a bit. At few points it seems to be less glued... sudden turn of the movements and emotions is visible. And another important part is the story line which is of course very good but few interesting points it has actually missed. It would have been much more better if there's a bit more details about few facts like Wicket Keeping, Yuvi, Dressing Room situation after the WC2011 Final. But still it's fine as I have said earlier that it has focused more on Dhoni as a man.. especially his journey... Otherwise it is actually excellent... Or better to say super-excellent! And oh yes casting is just amazing.So finally I would like to conclude like this. If you wish to watch it don't wait for the review just go for it. One thing I can assure you that you will not regret for a moment. But you may regret if you don't watch it or watch it by downloading from internet. If possible for you to spend some money please try that to give your respect to the hard works done by the cast and crew. I don't feel like giving marks to this movie as it may look disrespecting but taking it as a work of art I'm giving 9/10. Please don't listen to someone else if you feel like going then go...!!P.S - I respect you, Sushant Singh Rajput... Your career is going to get a big hike after this. 'Excellent' is just a word for you.Caution - You may find yourself in out-of-air-condition while the last scene happens, in spite of knowing the upcoming. ;) :)N.B- If a second part of it comes out, I'll not be surprised. There are lot more facts deserve to get unfolded.",indisputable effort by sushant singh rajput,ms dhoni untold story indisputable effort by sushant singh rajputfrom beginning movie every one must have understood that their hearts gonna stop few moments they have not been wrong im not highlighting plot detail as im pretty much interested not unfold story line as many you will go watch it let me talk about best parts first all sushants tremendous acting dedication deserve big thumbs up next anupam kher rajesh sharma rightly have adjusted themselves their spots herry tangri yuvi excellently has scaled himself with his character kiara advani sakshi disha patani priyanka have given their best too well now i must talk about cinematography here santosh thundiyil has done brilliant job especially dhonis train capturing scene leaving his job dhonis coming out dressing room scene during world cup 2011 final help lot excel this film undoubtedly fantastic cinematography it has as director neeraj pandey is course successful but somewhere it has lacked bit his special touch though it doesnt matter because you will not find single moment that can make you bore story has real gravity it successfully has followed tag line i e man you know journey you dont truly it has focused his journey his struggle ups downs etc dialogues are very inspiring heart touching at many places it is around 190mins movie you may think its quite long but trust me after watching it youll think if it could be 5 hours that would have been perfect even dhoni haters cant deny that actually theres so much tell about anyway lets come background sound truly effective though at some points it could have been better except that editing has been done quite well but truly its place where it has lacked bit at few points it seems be less glued sudden turn movements emotions is visible another important part is story line which is course very good but few interesting points it has actually missed it would have been much more better if theres bit more details about few facts like wicket keeping yuvi dressing room situation after wc2011 final but still its fine as i have said earlier that it has focused more dhoni as man especially his journey otherwise it is actually excellent or better say super excellent oh yes casting is just amazing so finally i would like conclude like this if you wish watch it dont wait review just go it one thing i can assure you that you will not regret moment but you may regret if you dont watch it or watch it by downloading internet if possible you spend some money please try that give your respect hard works done by cast crew i dont feel like giving marks this movie as it may look disrespecting but taking it as work art im giving 9 10 please dont listen someone else if you feel like going then go p s i respect you sushant singh rajput your career is going get big hike after this excellent is just word you caution you may find yourself out air condition while last scene happens spite knowing upcoming n b if second part it comes out ill not be surprised there are lot more facts deserve get unfolded,0.5734835164835166,0.2993296703296704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,Terrific match winning performance from Sushant Singh Rajput,"Thriller specialist Neeraj Pandey tried new genre Biopic with exceptionally brilliant manner.This one showcase the struggle of small town boy against all odds in his journey. Sushant Singh Rajput played tremendous match winning performance.He molded himself as middle class struggling young man to world conqueror. In first half, Neeraj has good grip on script but second half was slightly slow due to love stories and songs. Neeraj's favorite actor Anupam Kher was outstanding in the role of careful father. Anupam was part of each outing with Neeraj e.g. A Wednesday(Police commissioner), Special 26(P. K. Sharma) and last one Baby(Om Prakash Shukla).Disha looks cute in her role. Kaira was good in role of Sakshi. Rajesh Sharma,Kumud Mishra and Sarvadaman D.Banerjee were terrific.

7,Great First Half but is Pretty Much Directionless After That,"M.S. Dhoni had a burden of expectations on it - not just because it is based on India's most beloved captain but also it had Neeraj Pandey as Director. The movie is well made but runs into too much of unnecessary stuff, especially in the second half. It is pretty much left on its own in the later part. Sushant Singh Rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance to MSD, not just in terms of looks but also the expressions. Story (7/10): The movie focused really well on the life of MSD before he became a household name. It focused a lot on the challenges, small town boys had been facing to get an entry into Indian cricket team about 10 years back when metro boys, especially Delhi and Mumbai, had a great influence on the team composition. What I also loved was the portrayal of Dhoni's work ethic - be it the scene of Yuvraj Singh or the booze. The first half of the story shows the tremendous amount of research done on the build up of MSD and the people involved in getting him into the Indian cricket team. Unfortunately, the story is left orphaned once it crosses that chapter. Too much focus on his love life was not just unnecessary but also slowed down the movie tremendously. I would have loved to see some focus on what exactly made him CAPTAIN COOL and at least some bits of behind the scenes portrayal of what happened in the dressing room in the 2011 WC Final. But the story just skips through that, which is a big let down. Acting (10/10): Sushant Singh Rajput did a great job. He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. This would definitely go in as one of his best performances, arguably better than Byomkesh Bakshi. What I loved was the effort and the screen presence by the supporting cast - especially MSD's friend circle and also his school coach, played by Rajesh Sharma. The last time I saw such a level of presence by supporting cast was, perhaps, in Tanu Weds Manu series.Direction (6/10): This was definitely below par performance of Neeraj Pandey, considering his reputation. While a lot of research and meticulousness went into the first half of the movie, it was equally misdirected and vague in the second half. The story pretty much ended at the point when MSD makes it into the Indian cricket team. I felt Neeraj Pandey tends to play safe and is compelled to add romance element irrespective of the movie genre, just like he did in Baby and Special 26 where, again, it wasn't required at all. And this is what takes down this movie. While three hours is pretty much expected in biopic movies, he didn't utilize it to the best. Overall (7/10): It lives up to its tagline - The Untold Story - with some great research on the life of MSD in his early years but the movie just becomes directionless in the second half. But still, a good movie to watch, at least half of it.",great first half but is pretty much directionless after that,m s dhoni had burden expectations it not just because it is based indias most beloved captain but also it had neeraj pandey as director movie is well made but runs into too much unnecessary stuff especially second half it is pretty much left its own later part sushant singh rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance msd not just terms looks but also expressions story 7 10 movie focused really well life msd before he became household name it focused lot challenges small town boys had been facing get entry into indian cricket team about 10 years back when metro boys especially delhi mumbai had great influence team composition what i also loved was portrayal dhonis work ethic be it scene yuvraj singh or booze first half story shows tremendous amount research done build up msd people involved getting him into indian cricket team unfortunately story is left orphaned once it crosses that chapter too much focus his love life was not just unnecessary but also slowed down movie tremendously i would have loved see some focus what exactly made him captain cool at least some bits behind scenes portrayal what happened dressing room 2011 wc final but story just skips through that which is big let down acting 10 10 sushant singh rajput did great job he had challenging role his hard work showed way he projected msd terms looks as well as expressions this would definitely go as one his best performances arguably better than byomkesh bakshi what i loved was effort screen presence by supporting cast especially msds friend circle also his school coach played by rajesh sharma last time i saw such level presence by supporting cast was perhaps tanu weds manu series direction 6 10 this was definitely below par performance neeraj pandey considering his reputation while lot research meticulousness went into first half movie it was equally misdirected vague second half story pretty much ended at point when msd makes it into indian cricket team i felt neeraj pandey tends play safe is compelled add romance element irrespective movie genre just like he did baby special 26 where again it wasnt required at all this is what takes down this movie while three hours is pretty much expected biopic movies he didnt utilize it best overall 7 10 it lives up its tagline untold story with some great research life msd his early years but movie just becomes directionless second half but still good movie watch at least half it,0.48372493734335825,0.15393170426065161,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"

10,Your chance to meet MS Dhoni!,"As a huge fan of MS right from the time of very first substantial score that he made in 2005, there's this pretty much impossible desire to meet him, to get to know him a a personal level, even if for five minutes it may be. Having watched this film and to have through it got to know so many of the untold things about him and his life, it feels as if that wish has been fulfilled, right here at my own place. I was so sure of it being a good film that I got photos clicked of myself whilst the starting scenes ran on the TV. Just for the memories.When Sushant walks in to bat in the very beginning, the film completely over-takes my whole being and from then on it becomes a journey, a ride, an atmosphere that you live with him. I thought Emraan did tremendously as Azharuddin in 'Azhar' (2016), but Sushant was equally impressive and in fact mind-blowing at copying MS' style, his stroke-play, the walk to the wicket and the trigger movements on the way. I noticed that black spot too below the left eye, that MS has. The beginning and the ending scenes themselves are worth millions and a piece of very intelligent film-making to evoke the emotions of the public.It was very emotional, any angle you look at it from; whether from the hard-work that he'd to put in, the set-backs he's had to suffer on the way, or the achievements he went on to make. What stands above all is the the tragic death of his girlfriend in a car crash, whilst he was playing cricket in another country (there're differing reports as to when it happened. Some say it was whilst he went on a tour for the India A team).The most fun part of course was discovering how and from whom he learnt the helicopter shot, a shot that signifies the man's unorthodox character. I find it very heartening on his part to have given someone else the deserved credit for his trademark shot.Despite MS' request against it, some over the top glorification is always expected, given that films need heroes, and so too is the minor tweaking of the details and the timings of the events, but it remains overall a pretty solid film that I can watch again and again, and can't help but place it amongst my all-time favourites. So a big thumbs up to everyone involved!Also, during his career itself, the film serves as a timely reminder for those of his critics who always credit his success as captain to him being just lucky.

8,"He has been impressing on field, now his story impresses on screen","Director Mr. Neeraj Pandey work is very good. He chose the up to date way of narrating this story by designing continuous shots taking rather that choosing conventional and beaten way of long, mid and close . This new style was much needed for this sports drama film. This way you get the correct feel of on screen happenings but in starting half an hour camera work doesn't support director's vision well. It gets blurred while panning and soft while moving but after that it is almost good. Story is based on M.S.Dhoni real life so nothing to say about it. Screenplay by Director himself and Arun Jha is very good. They have never gone overboard or tried to dramatize the scenes unnecessary. There are so many cute and crisp scenes, like Dhoni talking on disconnected telephone and even this scene has a good culmination ahead. Another major plus point of this film is its unusual but sweet love scenes, like the intro of Priyanka, Dhoni first love interest, then intro of Sakshi, both scenes are too good. Sakshi talking to her roommate is also appropriate and cute, establishing and taking forward her character when Dhoni says that I knew you wouldn't come alone to meet me. This film has very strong emotional quotient too and after long time rain in emotional scenes didn't irritate me. Dialogues are very good. The way Khadagpur railway officer Mr. Ganguly, a very fine actor, describes aspects of life to Dhoni as reference of cricket is outstanding. Editing needs to be especially mentioned. Editor Mr Shree Narayan Singh has delivered a fine and seamless work. The way of blending the real footage and reel one is just amazing. Without showing all the stalwarts on screen you never feel that they are not present. All shots are so quick. Credit goes to Director too for his vision. Without taking any names in some disputed angle they ably make you understand everything. This film is full of performance surprises. Credit goes to casting director Vicky Sadana. Sushant Singh Rajput is mind blowing. You have to pay extra attention that he is not real Dhoni. He has not done this by imitating but adding fine dimension to his character so you think that if real one would be in this situation. He would have reacted in same way. Disha Patani as Priyanka is very endearing and acts well too. Kiara Advani as Sakshi is very good. She shines in an emotional scene. There are lots of great actors too. Anupam Kher (Father), Mother (good actress), Bhumika Chawla( Sister), Rajesh Sharma (Sports teacher Banerjee), Kumud Mishra (Coal mines officer), all are pitch perfect. Actors in role of his friends are also very good, like Kranti Prakash Jha as Santosh, Chittu shows his caliber in the scene when he conveys the sad news to Dhoni over phone. Actor who played Sardar ji is also perfect. Music by Amaal Mallik, goes well with film but lyrically all tracks are heavy. Manoj Muntanshir's lyric Like Mukhda 'Mal De Suraj Ke Munh Par Malai, Burbak Badal Par Kar De Chadhai', I liked it but Antra becomes preachy. I missed some simple lyrical melodious tracks, which scope was in film.",he has been impressing field now his story impresses screen,director mr neeraj pandey work is very good he chose up date way narrating this story by designing continuous shots taking rather that choosing conventional beaten way long mid close this new style was much needed this sports drama film this way you get correct feel screen happenings but starting half hour camera work doesnt support directors vision well it gets blurred while panning soft while moving but after that it is almost good story is based m s dhoni real life so nothing say about it screenplay by director himself arun jha is very good they have never gone overboard or tried dramatize scenes unnecessary there are so many cute crisp scenes like dhoni talking disconnected telephone even this scene has good culmination ahead another major plus point this film is its unusual but sweet love scenes like intro priyanka dhoni first love interest then intro sakshi both scenes are too good sakshi talking her roommate is also appropriate cute establishing taking forward her character when dhoni says that i knew you wouldnt come alone meet me this film has very strong emotional quotient too after long time rain emotional scenes didnt irritate me dialogues are very good way khadagpur railway officer mr ganguly very fine actor describes aspects life dhoni as reference cricket is outstanding editing needs be especially mentioned editor mr shree narayan singh has delivered fine seamless work way blending real footage reel one is just amazing without showing all stalwarts screen you never feel that they are not present all shots are so quick credit goes director too his vision without taking any names some disputed angle they ably make you understand everything this film is full performance surprises credit goes casting director vicky sadana sushant singh rajput is mind blowing you have pay extra attention that he is not real dhoni he has not done this by imitating but adding fine dimension his character so you think that if real one would be this situation he would have reacted same way disha patani as priyanka is very endearing acts well too kiara advani as sakshi is very good she shines emotional scene there are lots great actors too anupam kher father mother good actress bhumika chawla sister rajesh sharma sports teacher banerjee kumud mishra coal mines officer all are pitch perfect actors role his friends are also very good like kranti prakash jha as santosh chittu shows his caliber scene when he conveys sad news dhoni over phone actor who played sardar ji is also perfect music by amaal mallik goes well with film but lyrically all tracks are heavy manoj muntanshirs lyric like mukhda mal de suraj ke munh par malai burbak badal par kar de chadhai i liked it but antra becomes preachy i missed some simple lyrical melodious tracks which scope was film,0.5550617930456639,0.30743558860494347,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8,A Born Leader & A Living Legend ..... M.S. Dhoni,"It is said that leaders are not created rather they are born and such is the case with M.S.Dhoni. This real life based movie truly does justice to the hard work and commitment of Indian Cricket Captain and World Cup Winner M.S Dhoni. Neeraj Pandey has done a fabulous job to put up all the pieces in the desired sequence to create this masterpiece. Sushant Singh Rajput yet again impresses with his on screen performance and persona as everything about him is just perfect from head to toe in the movie. All the features starting from story, dialogues, cinematography, acting, music till direction is well knitted to form an impressive flick. However, the highlight remains Sushant Singh Rajput with his all the talent, skill and perfection doing full justice to the living legend of Indian cricket. It is quite visible that he has done a good research on Dhoni including his hair style, shyness, walking and famous ""Helicopter Shot"". The film outlines the struggle of M.S Dhoni from a railway ticket collector to the Captain of a World Champion team. It also highlights the issues pertaining to the changes made by him for transforming Indian Cricket team to a World Class Unit. The trend of making movies on real life events is gaining a lot of momentum in Bollywood and this one is the fresh addition to the list and probably the top of the line effort. M.S. Dhoni is already a star, living legend and a role model for cricketers all over the world and this film will surely add to his existing honor and prestige.

5,Sushant Singh Rajput Delivers His Finest Performance in an Okay Biopic!,"Sushant Singh Rajput's talent comes full circle with 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story'. As the cricket legend, Sushant gives his all in a performance, that comes across as an embodiment, rather than an impersonation. 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' explores the life of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, right from his journey from being a ticket collector, to a trophy collector and the world-cup-winning captain of the Indian Cricket Team.Director Neeraj Pandey chooses a worthy true-story as his latest project, but succeeds only partially. The film is too long at 3-hours & the Writing is never remarkable. Of course, Dhoni is a man made of pure merit, who's seen tremendous struggle, before emerging into a phenomenon. But, 'The Untold Story' has an average Screenplay, that arrests in parts.Pandey & Dilip Jha's Screenplay is alright. Despite choosing to tell the story of a real-life euphoric figure, the Writing never soars. It works in parts & works best when it sees its protagonist off the pitch. Also, the Dialogue are surprisingly weak. Definitely, a much stronger Screenplay was the need of the day! Pandey's Direction is decent. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Music by Various Artists, is melodious.Performance-Wise: Sushant is great, no two options on that! Of the rest of the cast, Anupam Kher is remarkable as Dhoni's father, delivering a genuinely heartfelt performance from start to end. Rajesh Sharma is wonderful as Banerji, who's the first to realize Dhoni's potential. Kumud Mishra excels as well. Bhumika Chawla as Dhoni's Sister is nice & its refreshing to see her on-screen after so long. Kiara Advani as Dhoni's Wife & Disha Patani as Dhoni's Girlfriend, are strictly okay.On the whole, 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' rests on Sushant Singh Rajput's genuine talent to sail through.",sushant singh rajput delivers his finest performance okay biopic,sushant singh rajputs talent comes full circle with m s dhoni untold story as cricket legend sushant gives his all performance that comes across as embodiment rather than impersonation m s dhoni untold story explores life mahendra singh dhoni right his journey being ticket collector trophy collector world cup winning captain indian cricket team director neeraj pandey chooses worthy true story as his latest project but succeeds only partially film is too long at 3 hours writing is never remarkable course dhoni is man made pure merit whos seen tremendous struggle before emerging into phenomenon but untold story has average screenplay that arrests parts pandey dilip jhas screenplay is alright despite choosing tell story real life euphoric figure writing never soars it works parts works best when it sees its protagonist off pitch also dialogue are surprisingly weak definitely much stronger screenplay was need day pandeys direction is decent cinematography editing are fair music by various artists is melodious performance wise sushant is great no two options that rest cast anupam kher is remarkable as dhonis father delivering genuinely heartfelt performance start end rajesh sharma is wonderful as banerji whos first realize dhonis potential kumud mishra excels as well bhumika chawla as dhonis sister is nice its refreshing see her screen after so long kiara advani as dhonis wife disha patani as dhonis girlfriend are strictly okay whole m s dhoni untold story rests sushant singh rajputs genuine talent sail through,0.6388775510204081,0.31238095238095237,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10,Cinematic excellence at it's absolute best!,"Doing a biopic is a tough job, especially when it is of a cricketer who is a national hero, loved like no other with a fan following no less than a big actor but hats off to Neeraj Pandey for nailing this one. The film shows us the struggles of a young and determined Dhoni's ambition to become an Indian National team cricketer. The story grips you throughout! As you learn more and more about this amazing player and captain, your respect goes up for him by 10 times because of what he went through to get there. He isn't just your average man, and the film shows exactly why that's the case. Neeraj Pandey is no doubt one of the best directors in the industry. His films are straight to the point, minus the commercial nonsense which too many of today's films contains. I loved A Wednesday, Special Chabbis and Baby so much, so I was so excited to watch this, and he hasn't disappointed. The amount of detail he has gone into is amazing. As for the performances, Sushant's performance was breathtaking! As a cricketer myself, I can appreciate the work he put into really understanding the game and learning how to bat like Dhoni. It is safe to say that his hard work paid off - he's mannerisms, the way he walks to the creases and the shots were practically perfect and at no point do you think that this isn't Dhoni himself! This is no doubt his best work, and in my opinion the best male lead performance of the year to date! As for the two leading ladies, they both looked beautiful and did justice to their role. What can you say any Anupam Kher which hasn't been said before? He excels in every Neeraj Pandey film, and he does it again as Dhoni's father. All the other support case is excellent. I really like Dhoni's friend circle in the film and how they support him throughout all his troubles. The music of the film is another highlight. Amaal Malik has done wonders and delivered one of the best albums of the year. Jab Tak, Kaun Tujhe, Besabriyaan are 3 of the best songs of the album and go perfectly with the film. Again, I'm happy there's no 'commercial' rubbish like an item song, which would have ruined the film. Yes the film is over 3 hours but it honestly doesn't feel long enough. You won't want to leave the cinema hall because you'll feel you haven't found out enough about the legend. I can't wait to watch the film again!",cinematic excellence at its absolute best,doing biopic is tough job especially when it is cricketer who is national hero loved like no other with fan following no less than big actor but hats off neeraj pandey nailing this one film shows us struggles young determined dhonis ambition become indian national team cricketer story grips you throughout as you learn more more about this amazing player captain your respect goes up him by 10 times because what he went through get there he isnt just your average man film shows exactly why thats case neeraj pandey is no doubt one best directors industry his films are straight point minus commercial nonsense which too many todays films contains i loved wednesday special chabbis baby so much so i was so excited watch this he hasnt disappointed amount detail he has gone into is amazing as performances sushants performance was breathtaking as cricketer myself i can appreciate work he put into really understanding game learning how bat like dhoni it is safe say that his hard work paid off hes mannerisms way he walks creases shots were practically perfect at no point do you think that this isnt dhoni himself this is no doubt his best work my opinion best male lead performance year date as two leading ladies they both looked beautiful did justice their role what can you say any anupam kher which hasnt been said before he excels every neeraj pandey film he does it again as dhonis father all other support case is excellent i really like dhonis friend circle film how they support him throughout all his troubles music film is another highlight amaal malik has done wonders delivered one best albums year jab tak kaun tujhe besabriyaan are 3 best songs album go perfectly with film again im happy theres no commercial rubbish like item song which would have ruined film yes film is over 3 hours but it honestly doesnt feel long enough you wont want leave cinema hall because youll feel you havent found out enough about legend i cant wait watch film again,0.5043488824101069,0.343314706835115,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.27}"

8,Why to go and see MSDhoni - The Untold Story,"DHONI - The Guy and WithinA quiet winter morning, the sun barely able to make its presence felt through the haze. A small second floor flat in a building desperately asking for a makeover after the elapsed monsoons. A few pigeons eating out of the hands of a child hanging out in the balcony. This is a typical moment in the lives of millions who inhabit the so called 'small towns' in India. Yet, this was the start of a journey, for a person called Mahi.An avid goal keeper in school, whose 'dodging the ball' skills were spotted and honed into a successful wicket keeper by his teacher. Every successful face has a story to say. Rarely do we get to know facets of people whom we idolize. M S Dhoni – The untold story, is an endeavor to try and unveil a few pages of his life and give a peek behind the face of Dhoni, into his heart and mind.Many anecdotes we may know of and recall, but then so many we don't. Interesting to witness those. Not to forget all those who played such a vital role in shaping him as an individual, prodding him on as a sportsman and helping him groom and grow. The movie gives due credit to all those.The movie tends to go back and forth a bit as if unable to choose whether to show his cricket prowess or peek into his personal life. Sushant Singh Rajput seems to have worked hard in impersonating him on field. And the ladies in his life showcased by two new faces have done a commendable job in this film. Am sure will be spotted by noted talent spotters after this. That's going out for Kiara Advani and Disha Patani. Wishing you'll the very best.Anupam Kher, Rajesh Sharma (hehehe my name sake), Bhumika Chawla and others have done a good job. A good learning for all the kids. Perseverance, dedication and the will to succeed can get you places. And can make you who you are destined to be, not merely who you might choose to be.Critical review of the movie am leaving to those who are best at it. Here are only highlighted reasons why you should see it. Just 35 years of age. Yet so much to share. That's Mahi or Dhoni for you. Go see, feel, live a slice of his life, for that's what you will manage in about 3 hours when they try and capture a lifetime of experiences. @rajrad",why go see msdhoni untold story,dhoni guy withina quiet winter morning sun barely able make its presence felt through haze small second floor flat building desperately asking makeover after elapsed monsoons few pigeons eating out hands child hanging out balcony this is typical moment lives millions who inhabit so called small towns india yet this was start journey person called mahi avid goal keeper school whose dodging ball skills were spotted honed into successful wicket keeper by his teacher every successful face has story say rarely do we get know facets people whom we idolize m s dhoni untold story is endeavor try unveil few pages his life give peek behind face dhoni into his heart mind many anecdotes we may know recall but then so many we dont interesting witness those not forget all those who played such vital role shaping him as individual prodding him as sportsman helping him groom grow movie gives due credit all those movie tends go back forth bit as if unable choose whether show his cricket prowess or peek into his personal life sushant singh rajput seems have worked hard impersonating him field ladies his life showcased by two new faces have done commendable job this film am sure will be spotted by noted talent spotters after this thats going out kiara advani disha patani wishing youll very best anupam kher rajesh sharma hehehe my name sake bhumika chawla others have done good job good learning all kids perseverance dedication will succeed can get you places can make you who you are destined be not merely who you might choose be critical review movie am leaving those who are best at it here are only highlighted reasons why you should see it just 35 years age yet so much share thats mahi or dhoni you go see feel live slice his life thats what you will manage about 3 hours when they try capture lifetime experiences,0.509011739011739,0.15579443079443084,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.48}"
