10.0,A Scary Ethan Hawke And Terrific Young Stars Make This Thriller A Blumhouse Best...,"A Scary Ethan Hawke And Terrific Young Stars Make This Thriller A Blumhouse Best....... As Universal's distribution head Jim Orr said in introducing Tuesday night's CinemaCon screening of the studio's upcoming late June release The Black Phone, studios don't normally bring a movie like this to show in its entirety at a theater-owners convention two months ahead of opening unless they know they have the goods. With this one reuniting producer Jason Blum and Blumhouse with director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill - all having worked together on 2012's Sinister - Universal does have the goods, and then some. Being marketed apparently as a horror film, with a poster dominated by a fully terrifyingly masked and horned Ethan Hawke, what this late 1970s-set movie really is about is the trauma of youth crossing from childhood into teen years, more appropriately falling into the suspense thriller category than the kind of standard horror the marketing seems to indicate. Hopefully audiences won't be put off by that approach, because this is a truly effective movie that defies easy description but should appeal to a wider crowd. It originally premiered at the 2021 Fantastic Fest and was planned for a January release but Blum and the studio felt it needed to be seen in theaters, thus the smart move to a prime summer slot and exclusive theatrical run.Based on the 2014 Joe Hill short story comparisons to Stephen King, and particularly It, will be inevitable, but The Black Phone marches to its own beat as we are introduced to its protagonist, young teen Finney Shaw (Mason Thames), an ace baseball pitcher who nevertheless finds himself subjected to constant harm by school bullies, as well as a single alcoholic father (Jeremy Davies) who is in over his head in raising Finney and his younger, foul-mouthed but quite religious sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw). Gwen's psychic dreams are given credence by local authorities (if not her own dad, who physically abuses her and orders her to stop) when she is able to pinpoint an abduction of one of the Colorado town's young teen boys. The best movies of any genre are the ones that focus on character giving us a reason to root for them. These filmmakers put the thrills and chills (and there are many) in second position to favor advancing a story that also stands in as an allegory for the terrors of growing up and losing the innocence of childhood in a very dark world, this one inhabited not just by The Grabber, but also bullies who mercilessly beat up their fearful schoolmates, unhinged parents, and other realities of life. The Black Phone may also be known someday as a star-making film, with both Thames perfectly anchoring the story as Finney, a kid whose own awkwardness and eventual determination to survive has us cheering for him, and particularly McGraw, who steals every scene she has with a seeming ease that says this movie will not be the last we hear of her. She is a true standout.",scary ethan hawke terrific young stars make this thriller blumhouse best,scary ethan hawke terrific young stars make this thriller blumhouse best as universals distribution head jim orr said introducing tuesday nights cinemacon screening studios upcoming late june release black phone studios dont normally bring movie like this show its entirety at theater owners convention two months ahead opening unless they know they have goods with this one reuniting producer jason blum blumhouse with director scott derrickson co writer c robert cargill all having worked together 2012s sinister universal does have goods then some being marketed apparently as horror film with poster dominated by fully terrifyingly masked horned ethan hawke what this late 1970s set movie really is about is trauma youth crossing childhood into teen years more appropriately falling into suspense thriller category than kind standard horror marketing seems indicate hopefully audiences wont be put off by that approach because this is truly effective movie that defies easy description but should appeal wider crowd it originally premiered at 2021 fantastic fest was planned january release but blum studio felt it needed be seen theaters thus smart move prime summer slot exclusive theatrical run based 2014 joe hill short story comparisons stephen king particularly it will be inevitable but black phone marches its own beat as we are introduced its protagonist young teen finney shaw mason thames ace baseball pitcher who nevertheless finds himself subjected constant harm by school bullies as well as single alcoholic father jeremy davies who is over his head raising finney his younger foul mouthed but quite religious sister gwen madeleine mcgraw gwens psychic dreams are given credence by local authorities if not her own dad who physically abuses her orders her stop when she is able pinpoint abduction one colorado towns young teen boys best movies any genre are ones that focus character giving us reason root them these filmmakers put thrills chills there are many second position favor advancing story that also stands as allegory terrors growing up losing innocence childhood very dark world this one inhabited not just by grabber but also bullies who mercilessly beat up their fearful schoolmates unhinged parents other realities life black phone may also be known someday as star making film with both thames perfectly anchoring story as finney kid whose own awkwardness eventual determination survive has us cheering him particularly mcgraw who steals every scene she has with seeming ease that says this movie will not be last we hear her she is true standout,0.5113559322033897,0.10278853914447132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"

It's based on a book written by Joe Hill, the son of Stephen King. Ethan plays a character called the Grabber, a serial child abductor/killer, that wears a terrifying mask-the mask was designed by famed make up artist Tom Savini. Ethan grabs kids and puts them in a soundproof basement, tortures them with games he likes to play and then kills them. Mason, a shy but smart 13 year old is his latest victim. In the basement is a black phone that Ethan tells Mason does not work-it's been disconnected. When the phone rings, Mason answers it and discovers that he is talking to Ethan's previous dead victims, who try to help Mason escape.

10.0,A Haunting Cinematic Masterpiece,"This movie was incredible. I've never been so moved but yet so scared and filled with tension. The acting from everyone was so amazing. The kids were phenomenal, and I'm talking child talent that only comes around once in an era. The whole world and atmosphere of the film was so immersive and haunting, I was moved far more than I ever would expect to be from a horror film. It had some great laughs too but also, it made me emotional at times hearing these kids pain and what they went through, but people forget that in the 70's in America kids were taken all the time. Technology just wasn't around: no cellphones, no GPS, no doorbell cameras, no DNA tracing- it was easy to take someone and never get caught. Our current society dosent know what that fear was like, and I think it's important that films like this exist to remind people that evil does exist, and it can be right around the corner. Maybe someone will watch their child a little closer.Ethan Hawke is a legend, I wouldn't have even known it was him if I didn't go in knowing he was playing The Grabber. It's a career best performance. It was so nuanced. There was so much under every line. I saw who this man was without having to actually see it. Haunting, haunting film. As I write this I want to see it again. I really think Ethan Hawke should get an Oscar nomination for this even though he plays a bad guy, it really is an incredible performance. Even the young girl who plays Gwen was outstanding, better than most leading ladies 4 times her age. Also, the girl who played Donna had this whole young Marion Cotillard thing going on and it was even just small roles like that which stood out- simple but real. The ending was a huge adrenaline rush, such great tension, and it all came together amazingly. Just an outstanding film. It comes off as a piece of art, I'd consider this a modern classic. And I hope it stays around for years to come.",haunting cinematic masterpiece,this movie was incredible ive never been so moved but yet so scared filled with tension acting everyone was so amazing kids were phenomenal im talking child talent that only comes around once era whole world atmosphere film was so immersive haunting i was moved far more than i ever would expect be horror film it had some great laughs too but also it made me emotional at times hearing these kids pain what they went through but people forget that 70s america kids were taken all time technology just wasnt around no cellphones no gps no doorbell cameras no dna tracing it was easy take someone never get caught our current society dosent know what that fear was like i think its important that films like this exist remind people that evil does exist it can be right around corner maybe someone will watch their child little closer ethan hawke is legend i wouldnt have even known it was him if i didnt go knowing he was playing grabber its career best performance it was so nuanced there was so much under every line i saw who this man was without having actually see it haunting haunting film as i write this i want see it again i really think ethan hawke should get oscar nomination this even though he plays bad guy it really is incredible performance even young girl who plays gwen was outstanding better than most leading ladies 4 times her age also girl who played donna had this whole young marion cotillard thing going it was even just small roles like that which stood out simple but real ending was huge adrenaline rush such great tension it all came together amazingly just outstanding film it comes off as piece art id consider this modern classic i hope it stays around years come,0.5714880952380952,0.25120535714285713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.27}"

8.0,The Hawke and Derrickson duo take the horror genre back once again with a grimly entertaining film.,"After what seems like forever since we had anything close to being a mainstream horror release over the past year, The long awaited delayed Black Phone is finally here. Let me start out by saying just how excited I was to see Scott Derrickson and Ethan Hawke team up once again after the massively underrated and disturbing ""Sinister"" in 2013. Derrickson has directed some absolute gems while still remaining slightly under the radar. Hawke's versatility has always proved effective when he dabbles into the horror genre. So with a duo like this you're bound for success.The Black Phone is no exception as it grabs a hold of the audience and never lets up. Ethan gives one of his most extreme performances to date and this particular villain will be remembered for quite some time for his gruesome yet comedic insanity. Almost channeling a little bit of The Joker and Freddy as well as his own signature style.The story is actually very complex and gives a certain bit of emotional impact while remaining dire and suspenseful simultaneously. While it does borrow slightly in certain aspects from other films it's still remains its own entity with clever plotting. It unravels into something you will not see coming which is always a welcome factor.The visuals and settings are absolutely excellent and put you back into a different time entirely where this sort of crime was being committed with ease throughout the country. That's another reason this film is so strikingly disturbing because 30 to 40 years ago this was a massive problem and a huge fear for so many parents. The retro Ambience is palpable.Overall just a very well executed horror film albeit with certain familiar clichés, with a performance from Ethan Hawke alone that stands out phenomenally. Definitely a great time for a summer horror film.",hawke derrickson duo take horror genre back once again with grimly entertaining film,after what seems like forever since we had anything close being mainstream horror release over past year long awaited delayed black phone is finally here let me start out by saying just how excited i was see scott derrickson ethan hawke team up once again after massively underrated disturbing sinister 2013 derrickson has directed some absolute gems while still remaining slightly under radar hawkes versatility has always proved effective when he dabbles into horror genre so with duo like this youre bound success black phone is no exception as it grabs hold audience never lets up ethan gives one his most extreme performances date this particular villain will be remembered quite some time his gruesome yet comedic insanity almost channeling little bit joker freddy as well as his own signature style story is actually very complex gives certain bit emotional impact while remaining dire suspenseful simultaneously while it does borrow slightly certain aspects other films its still remains its own entity with clever plotting it unravels into something you will not see coming which is always welcome factor visuals settings are absolutely excellent put you back into different time entirely where this sort crime was being committed with ease throughout country thats another reason this film is so strikingly disturbing because 30 40 years ago this was massive problem huge fear so many parents retro ambience is palpable overall just very well executed horror film albeit with certain familiar clich s with performance ethan hawke alone that stands out phenomenally definitely great time summer horror film,0.6235064935064936,0.10451569264069263,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.35}"
