,My favourite film of all time,"It is by now well known that there are two versions of this film that differ greatly, the original 3 hour Italian cut and the heavily re-edited 2 hour version which was the version that charmed the world in 1989. It remains a wonderful experience, but the director's cut is so much richer, deeper, satisfying,well,everything. This review is of the director's cut which may not be the greatest film in the world but is my favourite film of all time ever since I came out of the cinema in which I first saw it in back in 1994 crying my eyes out. Never has a film effected me as emotionally as this one. Cinema Paradiso is many things- a touching story of a friendship, a wonderful portrayal of a Sicilian village, a loving tribute to the cinema, amongst other things, but the longer cut is I believe the most moving and romantic love story ever. For my money, you can forget Casablanca,Dr Zhivago,Titanic,Romeo and Juliet,etc {great as some of them are}, this is the one that does it for me.Divided into three sections, it is the first section that was left almost intact in the short version. It is of course primarily concerned with the relationship between young Toto and the projectionist of his local cinema, Alfredo. It is full of delightful touches,such as Toto stealing a frame of film from behind Alfredo's back, or when Toto helps Alfredo during an exam so he can be allowed into the projection booth, or perhaps best and simplest of all of all Toto's spellbound face as he watches the footage that will be censored by the town priest. The cinema is portrayed as almost being the centre of life in the town Giancaldo in which the film is mostly set. The actual sequences set in the cinema are full of wonderful observation and even some belly laughs. There's the man who only goes to the cinema to sleep and is always awoken by kids, the couple who see each other for the first time because everyone else is cowering from Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde, the old man who says ""no, this is IMPORTANT"" when everyone else ""booos"" the news-all human life is here, with more observations and insights than in any Mike Leigh film. This section climaxes in a scene which is simply magical, when Alfredo projects a film onto the wall of a house so everyone can see it.As the film moves forward several years to show Toto as a 16 year old, the wonderful cinema scenes are still present. Who can forget the cinema usher telling off a group of young boys for playing with themselves while watching Brigitte Bardot and then sheepishly giving his own manhood a little touch? Director Guiseppe Tornatore also subtly reminds us of changing times, such as when television is first shown in the cinema. However, it is mainly concerned with Toto's {now called Salvatore} courtship of the girl he is in love with, Elena. No one who has experienced the pangs of first love can fail to respond to such scenes as Salvatore ranting on to Elena on the phone how much he loves her and realising he's actually been talking to her mother, or the beautiful first kiss and embrace in the projection booth {of course}.It is in the final section, as Salvatore, now a great film director, returns to Giancaldo as a 50ish man to attend Alfredo's funeral,where the humour all but disappears {well, life gets more serious as one gets older, does it not?} and the pace does slow-be warned. It is possibly the most emotional hour of cinema ever, and was cut to about 15 mins in the short version. Salvatore's reunion with Elena, which also displays absolutely brilliant acting from Jacques Perrin and Brigitte Fossey, is so painful a sequence, as the two characters pour their hearts out to each other. As Ennio Morricone's love theme swells up {a truly heartbreaking piece of music},it ends up being one of the most beautiful love scenes ever filmed. Salvatore's reunion with his mother and his exploration of the cobwebbed, dilapidated, cinema are also extremely moving. As for the final scene, where Salvatore opens a certain gift Alfredo left him-well,there's been too many spoilers already in this review, but suffice to say it is matchless, simply matchless. It was moving in the short cut, but is three times more meaningful in the director's cut.Cinema Paradiso has been called sentimental, but in the director's cut it is a darker, deeper kind of sentimentality. Maybe it is still ""a love letter to the cinema"", but it is also shows that obsessive love of something such as films can also result in sadness and regret. Think of what happens to Alfredo in the film, and as for Salvatore, well, his curse is that he has two loves in his life but success in one of them comes at the expense of the other. The uncut Cinema Paradiso is more then anything else about life and the effect of the decisions we make. O, and the greatest, most heartbreaking love story ever {have I already said this!}",my favourite film all time,it is by now well known that there are two versions this film that differ greatly original 3 hour italian cut heavily re edited 2 hour version which was version that charmed world 1989 it remains wonderful experience but directors cut is so much richer deeper satisfying well everything this review is directors cut which may not be greatest film world but is my favourite film all time ever since i came out cinema which i first saw it back 1994 crying my eyes out never has film effected me as emotionally as this one cinema paradiso is many things touching story friendship wonderful portrayal sicilian village loving tribute cinema amongst other things but longer cut is i believe most moving romantic love story ever my money you can forget casablanca dr zhivago titanic romeo juliet etc great as some them are this is one that does it me divided into three sections it is first section that was left almost intact short version it is course primarily concerned with relationship between young toto projectionist his local cinema alfredo it is full delightful touches such as toto stealing frame film behind alfredos back or when toto helps alfredo during exam so he can be allowed into projection booth or perhaps best simplest all all totos spellbound face as he watches footage that will be censored by town priest cinema is portrayed as almost being centre life town giancaldo which film is mostly set actual sequences set cinema are full wonderful observation even some belly laughs theres man who only goes cinema sleep is always awoken by kids couple who see each other first time because everyone else is cowering dr jekyll mr hyde old man who says no this is important when everyone else booos news all human life is here with more observations insights than any mike leigh film this section climaxes scene which is simply magical when alfredo projects film onto wall house so everyone can see it as film moves forward several years show toto as 16 year old wonderful cinema scenes are still present who can forget cinema usher telling off group young boys playing with themselves while watching brigitte bardot then sheepishly giving his own manhood little touch director guiseppe tornatore also subtly reminds us changing times such as when television is first shown cinema however it is mainly concerned with totos now called salvatore courtship girl he is love with elena no one who has experienced pangs first love can fail respond such scenes as salvatore ranting elena phone how much he loves her realising hes actually been talking her mother or beautiful first kiss embrace projection booth course it is final section as salvatore now great film director returns giancaldo as 50ish man attend alfredos funeral where humour all but disappears well life gets more serious as one gets older does it not pace does slow be warned it is possibly most emotional hour cinema ever was cut about 15 mins short version salvatores reunion with elena which also displays absolutely brilliant acting jacques perrin brigitte fossey is so painful sequence as two characters pour their hearts out each other as ennio morricones love theme swells up truly heartbreaking piece music it ends up being one most beautiful love scenes ever filmed salvatores reunion with his mother his exploration cobwebbed dilapidated cinema are also extremely moving as final scene where salvatore opens certain gift alfredo left him well theres been too many spoilers already this review but suffice say it is matchless simply matchless it was moving short cut but is three times more meaningful directors cut cinema paradiso has been called sentimental but directors cut it is darker deeper kind sentimentality maybe it is still love letter cinema but it is also shows that obsessive love something such as films can also result sadness regret think what happens alfredo film as salvatore well his curse is that he has two loves his life but success one them comes at expense other uncut cinema paradiso is more then anything else about life effect decisions we make o greatest most heartbreaking love story ever have i already said this,0.53166897827092,0.2601306056403144,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8.0,The Loves Of 'Toto' Beautifully Told,"After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer ""director's cut.""Most of the new footage involved the main's character's romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.The first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as ""Toto"" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult ""Alfredo"" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.The word ""love"" is used repeatedly in this review because that's the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.The second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and ""Elena"" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.It's very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his ""masterpiece.""",loves toto beautifully told,after seeing this special edition dvd which shows entire 174 minute film addition 121 minute one that most us had seen over years my rating this film was elevated this review is longer directors cut most new footage involved mains characters romance while he was young man story then is continued years later when that character comes back his hometown funeral runs into woman he was love with but never was able get his own it turns out be somewhat tragic love story first part film with salvatore cascio as toto young boy is love story about two people sharing their love movies kid adult alfredo phillpe noiret who runs local movie theater their love film bonds them life word love is used repeatedly this review because thats dominant theme love people had others world film something all us this website share second third parts film are above mentioned love story toto marco leonardi as adolescent then jacques perrin as adult elena agnese nano brigitte fossey first third this director s cut edition is much livelier interesting frankly than last two thirds although not boring it does drag few spots but longer version is better long run because it makes whole story much more meaningful its very nicely filmed you get real feel italian people their little town director movie giuseppe tornatore went make other great visual films two which i also like malena star maker but cinema paradiso i believe is considered his masterpiece,0.41989876443001434,0.24189596861471854,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,Classic,"This 1988 Italian film (released in the US in 1990), is back with a full 51 minutes added on. This seemed like a stupid idea...there was nothing wrong with the original. The directors cut (which was 1/2 hour longer) was considered a mess. Also, for this release, an extra 1/2 hour was added! I expected the worse. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than the 2 hour one.This story follows the life of Salvatore. He's born in a tiny Italian village and we see him as a little boy in the 1930s, an adolescent in the 40s-50s and an adult in the 80s. It basically is about his love of movies and the one true love of his life--Elena. They are in love but she comes from a rich family and he lives in poverty. How can they be together?POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!The cut movie in the US excised a lot of the Elena subplot and concentrated on Salvatore's love of movies. There's nothing wrong with that, but Elena disappears quite suddenly. This full version explains what happened between them and fleshes out the characters more. It also reveals a crucial surprise at the end.The performances are all fantastic--especially by the gorgeous young actor playing Salvatore as a teenager. Elena is also stunning. The film has beautiful cinematography and a haunting music score. The 3 hours flew by for me. I didn't want it to end! So...beautiful music, attractive stars, good acting, compelling story and some incredible romantic sequences. A must-see!!!!Bring plenty of Kleenex though--I cried a least 5 times!",classic,this 1988 italian film released us 1990 is back with full 51 minutes added this seemed like stupid idea there was nothing wrong with original directors cut which was 1 2 hour longer was considered mess also this release extra 1 2 hour was added i expected worse well i was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than 2 hour one this story follows life salvatore hes born tiny italian village we see him as little boy 1930s adolescent 40s 50s adult 80s it basically is about his love movies one true love his life elena they are love but she comes rich family he lives poverty how can they be together possible minor spoiler next paragraph cut movie us excised lot elena subplot concentrated salvatores love movies theres nothing wrong with that but elena disappears quite suddenly this full version explains what happened between them fleshes out characters more it also reveals crucial surprise at end performances are all fantastic especially by gorgeous young actor playing salvatore as teenager elena is also stunning film has beautiful cinematography haunting music score 3 hours flew by me i didnt want it end so beautiful music attractive stars good acting compelling story some incredible romantic sequences must see bring plenty kleenex though i cried least 5 times,0.5702651515151514,0.19441287878787875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10.0,Every Filmmaker's Favorite Film,"Giuseppe Tornatore's Nuovo cinema Paradiso (Cinema Paradiso) is everything good about the movies. It is a story about love. The love between a Father and Son, an Individual and his home, and the love for the movies. Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are a filmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favorite film (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for the movie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of your questions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life. The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into a whole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect. If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals will push you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about.

9.0,A beautiful film about the love of movies and life,"I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo, the small Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and the older man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It is a deceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. You never want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreaking simplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family.

10.0,One of the best and most moving films of the 80s,"As a big lover of film, I am still kicking myself for not seeing this masterpiece any sooner. To me, Cinema Paadiso is one of the best films of the 80s and also the most moving, particularly in the final hour.I have seen many visually stunning films, and Cinema Paradiso is up there as one of the most visually ravishing films I've seen. The cinematography and editing are outstanding, and the scenery still looks gorgeous with an epic feel to it. Cinema Paradiso, alongside The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West, also contains one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting scores and it is also one of my favourites of his.Cinema Paradiso is immaculately directed, has an touching, beautifully-written and honest script and a rich, compelling story that while it has an elegiac feel moves swiftly by draws you right in until the ending, which breaks my heart still after 5 times of seeing it.The characters are very well defined, particularly Alfredo, and the acting is outstanding with Salvatore Cascio, Enzo Cannavale, Marco Leonardi and especially Phillippe Noiret particularly impressive.

10.0,As Good as Movies Get,"Movies can wield a strange power over those who sit in the darkened seats of a theatre. The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life. NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie. It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors. The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians. The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production. Ennio Morricone's music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre.

10.0,Personal Favorite,"Whether you are a professional or an amateur it is always wise to avoid superlatives with regard to a movie critique ... but I cannot. 'Cinema Paradiso' is simply the finest movie I have ever seen. Like many who have posted at this site before me I have seen it many many times. It reaches within me to places other movies have never reached and I have often wondered why. Perhaps it is because of it's simplicity. It contains no expensive special effects, it has no gratuitous sex or violence, it has no ""multi-millon dollar per performance"" actors that I know of, it is arguable whether it even has a story line, and yet it soars far above the nonsense that film makers are producing these days. It's characters are portrayed by each and every actor in award winning style and the music is not only beautiful but absolutely perfect for this film.It is quite simply the story of a human life and it's tragedies and triumphs within the context of a vocation. A young boy matures and gradually learns the lessons of life, cultivates his passion for the cinema, and is rewarded with professional success; however, he remains unfulfilled for true love has escaped him only to return in the form of a gift of love which transcends time, space, and death to reveal at the closing of the film Toto's one true mistress.A staggering triumph of both the cinematic art and of story telling and yet there may be found people who do not like this movie ....

10.0,A Film for the Ages,"A village comes to life as a man dreams of a character who directed his entire life. He was a projectionist a run down movie theater which formed the center of entertainment in the community. We are introduced to Toto who lives with his mother who waits for her husband to come home from the Russian front. He is a scalawag who disobeys her and finds ways to spend time with Alfredo, the protectionist. He is in constant trouble but always comes to this man for direction, even though the guy finds him to be a pain in the butt. One night, the movie projector catches fire as does the film (nitrate film did this in the early days) and blinds the old man. Toto becomes the projectionist, even though he is but ten years old. He also becomes the eyes of his friend. He stays at the job, ignoring school, and eventually makes some modest films himself. As he does this, he sees a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. This whole film captures the essence of the city. We get to know a multitude of characters because their lives revolve around the movies being shown at the Cinema Paradiso. Toto (not his real name) returns to his home when his mother leaves a message for him that Alfredo has died. He has really cut off ties with the place and it is a painful trip back.

9.0,Film Heaven,"Youth is a kind of capital, and nostalgia only belongs to the old. When a world collapses, you always see some people crying and others smiling. It is always the young who laugh, for they look forward and see that the destruction of the old world means the birth of a new world. I don't know why, after watching ""cinema paradise"", the deepest picture in my mind is that when the cinema collapsed, the smiling faces of the young people, the thunderous applause filled the air of the small town, accompanied by the sigh of the old people. Heaven belongs to the nostalgic, because it is a simple and innocent ideal of the past. The past is a dream, that's why it's beautiful. Time will beautify all cruel things, to wear a hazy veil of pain. The old evert said to the young saverto, ""you are so young, the world is yours. And I'm old. I don't want to listen to you any more. I want to hear people talk about you. ""Such a sincere piece of heart, hidden, but all is a vision of the future.

If there is no expectation of the eternal, then love is just a dream, but, leave that little expectation, life from then on to bear such a heavy cross. The immortal cross, how could savertu not understand? The 30 dazzling years in the movie are actually 30 365 days in real life. Cut out the banal, trivial, realistic details, so that the past 30 years ago is such a beautiful story. Unfortunately, that's just the story. Children always love fairytales. They have no past and have no time to remember their short life. They expect to hear the ending that the prince and princess live happily ever after. When young, is never to think, in fact, the end is just a beginning, and the real end, is writing behind the endless trivial and trouble. The king may also die in battle one day, leaving the widowed queen alone. Their children may be demented. Somewhere in the palace garden, love is rotting. One day, when all the people are old, only the wrinkles of the eyes are still flashing a little clear light, perhaps only then, is to write the real ending time. But everyone did not like to hear such stories, young people, happy to witness the birth of a new world, but do not want to go to the old world that was full of joy. When we go to remember, perhaps, our hearts have been old. I guess I do.",film heaven,youth is kind capital nostalgia only belongs old when world collapses you always see some people crying others smiling it is always young who laugh they look forward see that destruction old world means birth new world i dont know why after watching cinema paradise deepest picture my mind is that when cinema collapsed smiling faces young people thunderous applause filled air small town accompanied by sigh old people heaven belongs nostalgic because it is simple innocent ideal past past is dream thats why its beautiful time will beautify all cruel things wear hazy veil pain old evert said young saverto you are so young world is yours im old i dont want listen you any more i want hear people talk about you such sincere piece heart hidden but all is vision future only youth is always looking forward long stream time is little optimism hope faith so saverto left with lost love broken heart never return if there is no expectation eternal then love is just dream but leave that little expectation life then bear such heavy cross immortal cross how could savertu not understand 30 dazzling years movie are actually 30 365 days real life cut out banal trivial realistic details so that past 30 years ago is such beautiful story unfortunately thats just story children always love fairytales they have no past have no time remember their short life they expect hear ending that prince princess live happily ever after when young is never think fact end is just beginning real end is writing behind endless trivial trouble king may also die battle one day leaving widowed queen alone their children may be demented somewhere palace garden love is rotting one day when all people are old only wrinkles eyes are still flashing little clear light perhaps only then is write real ending time but everyone did not like hear such stories young people happy witness birth new world but do not want go old world that was full joy when we go remember perhaps our hearts have been old i guess i do,0.49527939166097074,0.11179724880382774,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.19}"
7.0,Stunning film with great sense and sensibility ; being compellingly directed by Giuseppe Tornatore,"Colorful and moving flick dealing with a wonderful friendship between a little boy and a solitary projectionist . However , being overly nostalgic , too sentimental and overwhelmingly sweet . Attractive and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and enjoyable musical score . A filmmaker (Jacques Perrin , he subsequently became a notorious director) recalls his childhood (Salvatore Cascio , Toto , who celebrated his eighth birthday during filming) , when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist (Philippe Noiret who said all his lines in French) at Cinema Paradise . The director goes back home to his Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years and is reminded of his first love (Antonella Attili) . It is an interesting celebration of youth, friendship, and the everlasting magic of the films . Nostalgic and sensitive picture with thought-provoking drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an agreeable story between a lone man and a boy . The flick relies heavily on the relationship between an older man and a kid , subsequently teenager , but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Giuseppe's intention was that this movie should serve as an obituary for traditional movie theatres and the movie industry in general , after the movie's success he never mentioned this again. This excellent and enthralling picture ¨Cinema Paradise¨ was starred by extraordinary actors such as Philippe Noiret , Jacques Perrin and Marco Leonardi . Good acting from remaining cast , just like Antonella Attili , Enzo Cannavale , Leopoldo Triestre , Agnese Nano , Pupella Maggio, among others . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and stunningly photographed by Blasco Giurato who reflects splendidly the cinema , streets , square , village and many other things . Rousing as well as insistent score musical , including a continuous leitmotif from the beginning to the end ; being efficiently composed by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone . The film won several nominations and awards , Oscar included .This weeper picture was very well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore . He is a writer and director, known for making similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as ¨Malena¨ with Monica Belucci , ¨ The star maker¨ with Sergio Castellito , ¨Baaria¨ with Raoul Bova ; and ¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" (original title) or ""The Legend of 1900"" or ""The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean with Tim Roth . Being his English-language debut feature titled ¨The professor¨ with Ben Gazzara .

And, it is told so gently and affectionately that you can't help but love the film and the characters.

10.0,In memory of Philippe Noiret,"Philippe Noiret's death yesterday brings to mind all his movies, including ""Nuovo cinema Paradiso"". The first time that I saw this was right after I had seen ""The Postman"", and I recognized him as the man who had played Pablo Neruda. Here, he plays an equally great role, of the operator of a camera in a movie theater in an Italian village in years past. His friendship with and advice to young Salvatore proves to be more than the boy could have ever dreamed about. In a sense, the movie seems to be a look not only at what Italy was, but also what going to the movies was. It's definitely a masterpiece that I recommend. There may be the issue of whether or not we should make Italy's past look so idealistic, given that Mussolini was in power at the time. But I would assert that this movie shows that even in times of oppression, people can find ways to escape it. A really good movie.",memory philippe noiret,philippe noirets death yesterday brings mind all his movies including nuovo cinema paradiso first time that i saw this was right after i had seen postman i recognized him as man who had played pablo neruda here he plays equally great role operator camera movie theater italian village years past his friendship with advice young salvatore proves be more than boy could have ever dreamed about sense movie seems be look not only at what italy was but also what going movies was its definitely masterpiece that i recommend there may be issue whether or not we should make italys past look so idealistic given that mussolini was power at time but i would assert that this movie shows that even times oppression people can find ways escape it really good movie,0.42658730158730157,0.2029761904761905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,Sometimes less is more: Don't watch the uncut version first!,"Spoiler warning for anyone who hasn't seen this classic yet...ok? Don't read this review if you haven't seen at least one version of Cinema Paradiso.First of all, I was born in Italy, so I was extremely proud when Cinema Paradiso won the Oscar for best foreign film as well as the hearts of all movie goers when it was released. Also, I am a hopeless romantic who absolutely adores movies! So this movie was right up my alley on many levels!I saw the shorter version as most of us did when it came out in the US, and only recently saw the full uncut Director's version. It is one of my all-time favorite movies ever--and still is--but I must admit that I did not experience near the same magic or euphoria that the shorter original version gave me many moons ago! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the extra 51 minutes because I wanted MORE of a great thing, but as the old saying goes, sometimes less is more! Nothing, I repeat, nothing can match the power of the imagination and thus there in lies the magic and the power of the shorter version! By cutting out the extra scenes, we, the audience, were all left up to our own devices and forced to fill in the blanks ourselves with our imagination and our heart! By seeing everything the way we do in the full blown version, well, despite how sweet it was, it left something to be desired. I enjoyed the reunion (al though the whole flashing light effect grew VERY tiresome after awhile) but I could have done without it.Also, the thing that has been eating away at me is the whole question about why in the world Alfredo would (or could!) interfere with his supposed adopted son's first true love! Sure, I've been trying to come up with angles and reasons for his insanely cruel action, but nothing will convince me that the writer/director simply screwed up and should not have made the character do such a dastardly deed! Period! I loved the whole notion that he loved his ""son"" so much that he forced him to leave town and made him promise never to come back again...because we all knew that Alfredo was right...the only way Toto was going to achieve his dream was by leaving their small town and son of a gun if Fredo wasn't right! However....for him to be the main reason for the breakup of Toto's great love spoils the whole story. I will never watch this version again. I bought the DVD and pray that the original shorter verson that I saw and fell in love with is on the DVD!!!P.S. Some of my all-time favorite scenes come from this movie: The kiss in the rain (which is the cover on the DVD!) The dialogue where Alfredo tells Toto ""I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear people talking about you!"" The montague at the end of all the kisses and censored scenes. The haunting images of Elena on Toto's little movie projector...",sometimes less is more dont watch uncut version first,spoiler warning anyone who hasnt seen this classic yet ok dont read this review if you havent seen at least one version cinema paradiso first all i was born italy so i was extremely proud when cinema paradiso won oscar best foreign film as well as hearts all movie goers when it was released also i am hopeless romantic who absolutely adores movies so this movie was right up my alley many levels i saw shorter version as most us did when it came out us only recently saw full uncut directors version it is one my all time favorite movies ever still is but i must admit that i did not experience near same magic or euphoria that shorter original version gave me many moons ago dont get me wrong i enjoyed extra 51 minutes because i wanted more great thing but as old saying goes sometimes less is more nothing i repeat nothing can match power imagination thus there lies magic power shorter version by cutting out extra scenes we audience were all left up our own devices forced fill blanks ourselves with our imagination our heart by seeing everything way we do full blown version well despite how sweet it was it left something be desired i enjoyed reunion al though whole flashing light effect grew very tiresome after awhile but i could have done without it also thing that has been eating away at me is whole question about why world alfredo would or could interfere with his supposed adopted sons first true love sure ive been trying come up with angles reasons his insanely cruel action but nothing will convince me that writer director simply screwed up should not have made character do such dastardly deed period i loved whole notion that he loved his son so much that he forced him leave town made him promise never come back again because we all knew that alfredo was right only way toto was going achieve his dream was by leaving their small town son gun if fredo wasnt right however him be main reason breakup totos great love spoils whole story i will never watch this version again i bought dvd pray that original shorter verson that i saw fell love with is dvd p s some my all time favorite scenes come this movie kiss rain which is cover dvd dialogue where alfredo tells toto i dont want hear you talk anymore i want hear people talking about you montague at end all kisses censored scenes haunting images elena totos little movie projector,0.5322501072501072,0.19384652509652503,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,"A celebration of what the movies were, are, and hopefully can be again.","From beginning to end, Cinema Paradiso is, of course, about various forms of love, but my favorite element of the story is not just the way movies are portrayed, but the way old movies are portrayed. I have a particular fondness of older films (and a particular distaste for the shallow, exploitative and unimaginative garbage constantly cranked out by Hollywood these days), and one of the biggest themes of this film is the loss of purity and truth and innocence that movies once had.Obviously, I'm not talking about the glory days when kissing scenes were edited out of the projected version of a film, but the days when even a film that had the kissing and even minor, minor nudity scenes cut out of them would still draw a frantic crowd so eager to see films that they would sit for 30 minutes waiting for the second half the begin. Today, audiences would be up and asking for refunds within five minutes, and if there was no sex or explosions or car chases in the movie, many of them wouldn't be there in the first place, which is truly sad and is exactly what this movie rails against.I particularly loved the scene where Toto finally goes back home when he learns about the death of Alfredo (which would have been a spoiler, except that you learn of Alfredo's death within the first five or ten minutes of the movie), and his mother tells him that just before he died, Alfredo asked her not to tell Toto, not to ask him to come back. In the next scene Toto is walking through the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso and sees how cruel time has been to it and, even worse, how cheap and derivative the movies have become that are now played there.Alfredo didn't want Toto to come back because he saw what movies were becoming, and that is a direct message to the film industry the likes of which has never been seen like this.

This film is a fantastic trip into the world of 35mm cinema and its rippling effects throughout Europe post-World-War-Two.It's a great slice of 1980s cinema that you'd expect Hollywood to have remade a dozens times by now: thankfully this is not the case here and this movie is an experience that remains untainted by America's 'remake syndrome'. It's a love story about a little Italian town and it's theatre: the Cinema Paradiso. And like the films they watch the audience themselves all have their own stories to tell. It all centres around Alfredo's movie theatre and his raising of Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita through the magic of movies via 35mm-cinema projection.It's a coming-of-age story about cinema's wisdom and charm rather than the cynicism of the film industry: it's got a heart-warning vibe to it throughout its two-hour+ runtime (depending on whether you've seen the theatrical, or the near-three-hour extended, cut of the movie) and it's one any self-professed cinephile MUST watch!It's an example of European cinema that's artistically expressive and surprisingly accessible to more mainstream audiences.
