10.0,The masterpiece without a message,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.",masterpiece without message,one early scenes pulp fiction features two hit men discussing what big mac is called other countries their dialogue is witty entertaining its also disarming because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal if you didnt know better you might assume these were regular guys having chit chat their way work other than comic payoff at end scene which they use parts this conversation taunt their victims their talk has no relevance anything film or anything else that matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt be pulp fiction i get sense that tarantino put into film whatever struck his fancy somehow final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured its no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was suitcase reading far more into story than tarantino probably intended film is so intricately structured with so many astonishing details many which you wont pick up first viewing that it seems cry out some deeper explanation but there is no deeper explanation pulp fiction is as title indicates purely exercise technique style albeit brilliant layered one containing numerous references other films it is like great work abstract art or art about art it has all characteristics we associate with great movies fine writing first rate acting unforgettable characters one most well constructed narratives ive ever seen film but what end self contained story does not seem have bearing anything but itself movie becomes bit easier understand once you realize that its essentially black comedy dressed up as crime drama each three main story threads begins with situation that could easily form subplot any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident that causes whole situation come tumbling down leading increasingly desperate characters absurd measures tarantinos originality stems his ability focus small details follow them where they lead even if they move story away conventional plot developments perhaps no screenplay has ever found better use digressions indeed whole film seems consist digressions no character ever says anything simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda be cool no ones going get hurt which is just type line youd find generic run mill action flick instead he goes off tangent about what fonzie is like tarantino savors every word his characters finding potential wisecrack every statement infusing dialogue with clever pop culture references but lines arent just witty they are full intelligent observations about human behavior think mias statement vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut f up minute comfortably enjoy silence what is movies purpose exactly im not sure but it does deal lot with theme power marsellus is sort character who looms over entire film while being invisible most time whole point big date sequence which happens be my favorite section film is power that marsellus has over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent act ways you would not ordinarily expect dumb stoned gangster faced with attractive woman whose husband has gone away power theme also helps explain one more controversial aspects film its liberal use n word this film word isnt just used as epithet describe blacks jules instance at one point applies term vincent it has more do with power than with race powerful characters utter word express their dominance over weaker characters most these gangsters are not racist practice indeed they are intermingled racially have achieved level equality that surpasses habits many law abiding citizens our society they resort racial epithets because its patter that establishes their separateness non criminal world theres nice moral progression stories we presume that vincent hesitates sleep with mia out fear rather than loyalty later butchs act heroism could be motivated by honor but were never sure film ends however with jules making clear moral choice thus movie seems be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than self preservation still its hard find much larger meaning tying together these eccentric set stories none stories are really about anything they certainly are not about hit men pontificating about burgers nor is film really satire or farce although it contains elements both at times it feels like tale that didnt need be told but whatever reason this movie tells it does better job than most films its kind or any other kind,0.5590787545787543,0.182623015873016,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,A masterpiece of screenwriting,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.",masterpiece screenwriting,this is tarantinos masterpiece theres no other way say it it has arguably one smartest scripts ive ever seen story which is non linear is so well constructed it takes several viewings grasp it all movie doesnt seem be about any spesific thing but there is subtle hint redemption as central theme characters preformances this movie are practically perfect this is still one best performances ive seen sam jackson its outrage he didnt win oscar each scene has its own unique flavour charm every segment has its own arc while also tying into main plot comedy is great serious moments are great every word dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason exist this movie is just such great time i recommend it everyone who loves movies i cannot think single genuine flaw with it it will remain one my favorite movies long time,0.5947278911564625,0.3531462585034014,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,The rebirth of a genre – and film history,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",rebirth genre film history,i can only speak myself but i had never seen anything as stylish cleverly constructed well written electrifying as this milestone when i first saw it 1994 what really pulled me right start is what weve now come know as tarantino trademark dialogue when gangsters jules vincent talk each other or all other characters that matter there is natural flow sense realism yet something slightly over top very theatrical about their lines its mixture that immediately grabs your attention even if its just two dudes talking about what kind hamburger they prefer or contemplating value foot massage then theres music songs tarantino chose his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most those pieces music are now immediately associated with pulp fiction narrative different story lines that come together elegantly used flashbacks use chapters there is so much playful creativity at play here its just pure joy watch if youre bit film geek you realize how much knowledge about film love work other greats inspiration them went into this leone depalma scorsese course dozens hyper stylized asian gangster flicks but those accusing tarantino copying or even stealing other film makers i can only say there has never been artist who adored his kind art that was not inspired or influenced by his favorite artists if you watch tarantinos masterpiece today its impossible not recognize just what breath fresh air it was still is actually somehow movies especially gangster films never looked quite same after pulp fiction probably most influential film last 20 years its got simply everything amazing performances especially sam jackson it features some most sizzling iconic dialogue ever written it has arguably one best non original soundtracks ever its such crazy cool inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it first time its well its pulp fiction 10 stars out 10 favorite films masterpieces tv shows reviewed,0.5510238095238094,0.22916666666666663,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.02, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,The most rewatchable movie of all time,"Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh. As many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .So if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.Spoilers ahead(duh): For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.Sorry for the huge review..",most rewatchable movie all time,possibly most influential movie made history since first movie ever made even after 25 years countless number copy cats this movie absolutely holds up feels fresh as many you would know this movie is sort like tribute pulp stories written back 40s 50s which have punchy witty dialogue over top violence random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel waste time as it doesnt move plot but tarantino is genius he believes character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes characters lot makes them relatable memorable absolute converse nolan this movie is just collection wonderful scenes back back start finish movie is must watch just awesome screenplay alone top it off all actors arguably give their career best performance think about it it is true ability tarantino just create really tense or ridiculous situation out nowhere like psycho tribute scene with marsellus butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene is just awesome keeps you edge your seats so if you want entertaining but clever movie this is one you are looking it is funny filled with some best dialogues ever superbly acted great soundtracks i just wanna see tarantinos ipod boy does he have great taste is just spectacular experience spoilers ahead duh those you who say characters are hollow i suggest you revisit gold watch sequence walkens capt koons tells story young butch about how butchs grandpa requested enemy soldier return his watch his family soldier agreed similarly butch could have left marsellus but legacy his watch made him save him which i believe was nice touch how jules one my characters all time undergoes change is also noteworthy counter argument above mentioned criticism sorry huge review,0.5948148148148147,0.3055555555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,My Favourite Movie,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share.

,"It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!","My oh my. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie. It is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated. It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. They all leave lasting impressions as well. Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar. Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.

10.0,One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time).

10.0,One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage.

10.0,Unbelievable.,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close).

9.0,You know what they call a 1/4 Pounder with Cheese?,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success.",you know what they call 1 4 pounder with cheese,probably tarantinos best film pulp fiction is self sidetracking highly combustible film that out does itself at every turn centered around several people whos individual arcs all meet at fork road film does masterful job developing characters telling story about people striving keep flaunt their power performances by star studded cast are absolutely stunning are only augmented by tarantinos whimsical dialogue with almost twenty minute sequence with just vincent jules talking about nonsense every scene only enhances depth these characters providing great insight into personalities that make up people like butch or marsellus by providing window into way they think interact with others although jumbled time frame can cause confusion at first it all eventually falls into place wraps itself up end making one interesting film probably my favorite aspect film is how it treats every character like normal human being foregoing heroics pretense primary protagonist this leaves viewer with film where they observe initial position character watch that character go through set struggles completely unique some cases absolutely mental that put their personalities beliefs test all all this is tarantinos best film shows how ditching traditional film setup creates film with unprecendented form all only aid its success,0.557536231884058,0.2754347826086957,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.55}"
10.0,Popularity and gameplay victory,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy. Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities. ""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it. Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies.",popularity gameplay victory,postmodern discourse film because it is post industrial society era is driven by commercialization consumer society thus embodying commercial game popular colors jameson pointed out that old essentially advanced modernist boundary between advanced culture so called popular culture or business culture has been abolished new texts have emerged that are full forms categories contents cultural industries bourdieu believes that film has got rid shackles classic art has become popular culture or postmodern culture has become cultural capital purity aesthetics self discipline art have been impacted tower pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under impact popular art its aesthetics ensuing is appearance popular aesthetics it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy attracting audiences with popular themes flattening depth everything is flat this is what distinguishes serious attitude postmodernism modernism result is give audience leisure fashion relaxation surprise no tears violence crime sex other generally considered vulgar themes are themes postmodern movies especially terms violent style tarantino became single family violence has always been unshakable theme quentins works formed his black violence aesthetics violence is bloody cold game does not carry any moral political responsibilities pulp fiction thoroughly stylized gamified violence it makes audience realize that at this moment you are watching movies entertainment so tarentino will turn violence into joke sex into joke politics into joke history into joke it does not ask about meaning does not reflect does not touch politics not mention resistance bible quotes before jules killing were not intended legitimize his murder similarly scene mias overdose did not have any intention exhorting drug addicts black has also been treated as piece joke both vincent jules drove around city car full brains blood order not let police find it but also order not add trouble their friends they had do it within 40 minutes cleaning car is very technical task so that they have hire special problem solving expert headquarters guide them their work when two big hearted men finally washed themselves car afterwards while wearing two exaggerated somewhat funny t shirts standing front camera scene full blood terror was transformed into humorous sketch popularity gameplay are most vividly displayed here so some people say pulp fiction completed transformation violent movies modernity post modernity showing that post modern violent movies have completely lost power social criticism depth profound connection between old movies real world no longer carries meaning cultural symbols such as national mythology heroism social resistance political complaints etc some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out leaving only image itself frequent scenes violence film are echoing its circular structure clearly states that occurrence violence is cyclical never stops pulp fiction tells us life violence including wars boxing is omnipresent there is no justice life death right or wrong front it although quentin tarantino has never talked about postmodernism he knows its essence he seems tell us that life 20th century is developing rapidly changing fast worthless no one is immune no matter whether life or death is unreasonable fair is vulgar novel this is where subversive power postmodern cinema aesthetics lies,0.5386991646850801,0.027775745381379183,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"

Multiple tales of crime and corruption and robbery put together to create what seemingly is 3 or 4 short films that are interwoven, but done so in a way that just works so well.Shot in and around LA, every actor in this movie plays their role to absolute spot on perfection. No one feels out of place or out of character for one second of this film, and there are some serious big name actors in this considering it was only Tarantino's second film. even HE himself plays a very believable role.The only downside is sensitive folk might find it a bit gnarly hearing white people use the ""N"" word with sustained use, but it's certainly nothing that ruins the film to the state of it being unwatchable.Pulp Fiction has an awe inspiring cult following and so it should. It's just the perfect movie from the 90's. It's one of those rare gems that just has EVERYTHING on display you could ever want in a film. It doesn't feel outdated and it doesn't feel overacted.

10.0,Great,"Good day, dear friends and dear readers of reviews! Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions.

10.0,One of the best movies of the century!,"If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10.

,Awesome!,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)",awesome,i just finished screening this movie first time after putting it off number years because what seemed like equivocating appraisals some my friends hindsight however it seems me that while movie must have definitely bowled them over overall they werent sure exactly what make it or how articulate what were probably confused mix feelings but i am so impressed that i feel compelled add few specific observations many fine reviews already this database first this movie hits you with impact somewhere between say apocalypse now clockwork orange some people may be just as disturbing however this respect i am happy report i didnt think it rose level natural born killers full graphically violent action language pulp fiction is not picture everyone i would definitely not recommend it my parents born 1930s even my one fairly hip relative same generation who at age 66 still teaches high school sex education likes talk about things like sunbathing nude among other potentially sensitive issues irrespective audience sensibilities however film makers supported by superb acting every role manage create world full most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever appear screen travoltas pronounced almost child like curiosity about world jacksons sincere thoughtful philosophical ruminating williss deep devotion memory his father i think such fascination lies not only characters personalities as they are portrayed but way they tantalize viewer into considering possibility that such people could actually exist as lawyer some years experience dealing with all sorts people i was particularly drawn this aspect film thus response some other reviewers comments i think this movie is more character driven than plot driven instead story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as mere device move plot along as is too frequently case movies especially these days undeniably strong clever unpredictable plot lines pulp fiction are actually essentially secondary interest importance serving primarily as vehicles get you worried about fate characters you cant help caring about despite truly low attributes that otherwise form basis their respective personas as at least one other reviewer noted when film ends you are actually disappointed left craving more these crazy people their explosive lives finally as strange as it may sound this film reminds me another monumentally great film which one would never typically associate with it any way million years casablanca as that film made way back 1942 as another reviewer has suggested perhaps its special appeal its unusually high degree emotional impact lies its distinctly successful simultaneous application several different genres single film drama action dark humor with whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution every department while casablanca is no doubt clearly much more wholesome high minded like older film pulp fiction is not without pronounced theme redemption even if it is not as strongly felt considering all later films sleaze violence sum when people say that this is probably best film 1990s it is easy see why fundamentally truly outstanding movie it is must see anyone who considers themself film buff can handle graphic subject matter incidentally if you would like more toned down much more overtly humorous less serious picture with not altogether dissimilar look feel dont miss another 1990s travolta picture get shorty,0.5039443591056495,0.16614866018091823,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
