10.0,Perfect in every aspect.,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.",perfect every aspect,truly masterpiece best hollywood film 2019 one best films decade truly best film bring comic book so chillingly realistically real ife remarkable direction cinematography music acting some people are surprised find it disturbing violent but its necessity message its about society reflects those underappreciated unrecognized bullied people proving they can do something too way it shows class difference corruption how rich talented rule others around them is not exaggerated thats what makes it different its believable there could be multiple jokers living our society that could shake those around them much bitter way than film shows making people uncomforting people consider this wake up call message but first film perfect film,0.6015873015873017,0.30833333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10.0,"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",psychological study rather than superhero flick,i have seen joker yesterday at venice early ill fated screening we had some trouble with audio that lead near hour delay but it definitely was worth it joker deserved be presented at venice film festival event that regards cinema as form art because this film is far blockbuster or mere entertainer movie as most films genre are it focuses psyche main character as it slowly crumbles under pressure society thus joaquin phoenix does wonderful performance earning almost surely nomination at oscars at least its take joker that differs ledgers but id say that both are equally as good main difference might be that ledgers joker is rational that acts insane while phoenixs is insane root despite being movie about superhero villain joker is much superior most movies genre id exclude dark knight trilogy only but joker is easily as good as nolans movies or at least very close it is small scaled film with distinct style cinematography that cannot but be appreciated set very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive most notable are similarities scorseses taxi driver his king comedy but also chaplins modern times is somewhat referenced i am eager see more non comedic efforts by todd phillips this movie was so far probably best 2019 at worst contested so far only by dolor y gloria or once upon time hollywood that should be very convincing,0.5623306233062331,0.10203252032520325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,It's About a Man,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike, they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.",its about man,while ive watched many superhero movies that have come down pike they are often same so compensation sensational plots involves great special effects non stop action they are fun i dont mean dis them what is missing is truly psychological drama we dont get into heads characters this film is incredible as we watch man confront his demons we see him made fun attacked beaten when he responds he is seen as crazy he also find that he is diminished eye counselor his mother has kept secret i thought it gave us foundation batman mythos without getting deeply into it acting atmosphere sophisticated plot makes this really excellent film,0.48102548036758574,0.19767126148705091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director",just amazing how does this movie exist,let me start off by saying if joaquin phoneix doesnt get his oscar this movie then oscars should be cancelled phoneix is amazing as you mightve heard every review ever but todd phillips is at his best here story lines he takes visuals are just breathtaking score omg score every time that score came i felt very uncomfortable like something horrible was about happen it was great inspirations taxi driver king comedy are there add so much movie i got be honest there are scenes that are very violent its disturbing but i honestly expected it be wayyyy more violent all controversy going overall this movie was great come oscar season it needs be nominated best picture screenplay cinematography actor score director,0.6882352941176472,0.17941176470588238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.12}"
10.0,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it.

7.0,I would not call it a masterpiece as some did,"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews. What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer. Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull. Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious. In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.",i would not call it masterpiece as some did,there is no doubt that movie was well thought plot execution i must praise phoenixs superb acting he managed portray very believably awkward social reject also crazy murderer that he became i really think its role only few could do it was also very interesting watch how he deteriorated mentally little by little gave up trying fit into society gotta hand it script writer plot was unpredictable but there wasnt anything too complex about arthurs mental state no deep psychological analysis or web many deep factors that created one kind psychotic maniac could it be that i was expecting too much very possible since i came with very high expectations after reading some reviews what doesnt have anything with expectations is that at end he didnt remind much original joker he felt more like simply society reject that went completely crazy started killing people not that much different many other serial killers or mass murderers he didnt have master mind that so much designated joker made him different simple murderer another thing is that there were long parts movie that felt very dull also i found it hard buy reason behind riots city role joker played them even if taken into account that poverty anger was cooking long time that society it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people subway made joker so notorious conclusion i can identify with character which gave me lasting impression movie this movie could have been very great if it was movie about how person thats rejected by society turns slowly into serial killer but as movie about joker i felt it was lacking lacking things that made joker actually joker not just another crazy murderer,0.54054708994709,-0.014914814814814818,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"

6.0,"Worthy Acting Performance By Phoenix Worth a Watch, but This Joker is Not Smart Enough to Become the Joker We've Come to Know","Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too.

,"Yikes. THIS is people's ""best movie ever""?","The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$",yikes this is peoples best movie ever,recurring themes so many 10 star reviews here should tell you lot about this movie its audience if you cant get through movie review without tossing one or more claims that this movie is so much better smarter than your superhero movie or even basing your entire review around this premise then i hate break it you but kid youre nowhere near as intelligent grown up as you think you are this my comic publisher is better than yours bs should have been left behind your grade school playground it has absolutely no relevance quality this movie your opinion this movie should be considered highly suspect if youre this group i gotta say if this movie was also your idea most perfect film ever made you really need get out more look i get it if you live safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies mainstream blockbusters then i understand how exposure themes like this first time would seem new exciting you i think we can all agree that this is probably best dc comics related movie last decade or so though thats not high bar meet course joaquin phoenix is very talented actor but stop take step back look at this thing joker does indeed present theme that is importance our society that neglect demonizing mentally ill degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming mile away if they hadnt been too busy looking away avoid feeling uncomfortable unfortunately reminding us all fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has say it dances around important subjects like hey kids class inequality but then never offers any actual insight into them usually because its too busy making forced batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like dont smile sign scene which seem have been designed solely have something hot topic print new t shirt between that every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far advance because lot us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before i just wasnt impressed perhaps if this had been actual stand alone movie its own instead being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes dont get me wrong i dont have any problem with superhero movies but it just feels so gratuitous here as if someone came up with this idea pitched it executive was told sounds great but can you make it batman movie somehow im sorry but im just not into movie trying tell me half hearted yet dead serious speech about mental illness modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that its technically superhero movie because,0.510918501788067,0.1294588744588745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,"Timely and driven by a great lead performance and cinematic reference, even if it is not as smart as some would have you believe (SPOILER)","Low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this film's success, although not the biggest part. The levels of expectation on a DC 'universe' film is now pretty low - to the point that someone with film OCD like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years; likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this. The sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film, but it is not the main thing.The main reason is the central performance of Phoenix. He is totally committed to selling his character throughout, and even in the weakest moments of narrative, you believe his character in terms of its roots, development, and actions. It is not a film that would normally be associated with awards, but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film. A secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of Scorsese in so much as it falls between Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. This is not accidental, and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of Phoenix and de Niro (although the latter does more as a reference than an actor). With these elements working well, the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character. I could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did, because I'm not sure that the ""maybe it was all imagined"" bit at the end was a good idea.Otherwise, it is enjoyably dark and deliberate, and is driven by Phoenix, even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe.",timely driven by great lead performance cinematic reference even if it is not as smart as some would have you believe spoiler,low expectations subverted expectations play big part this films success although not biggest part levels expectation dc universe film is now pretty low point that someone with film ocd like myself has not bothered even dip toe recent years likewise what one expects superhero genre origin story is not something like this sense pleasant surprise certainly helped success film but it is not main thing main reason is central performance phoenix he is totally committed selling his character throughout even weakest moments narrative you believe his character terms its roots development actions it is not film that would normally be associated with awards but it would be significant failure were he not be recognized how much he delivered how much he made film secondary reason film works is its cinematic heritage films scorsese so much as it falls between taxi driver king comedy this is not accidental casting deserve lot credit getting actors quality phoenix de niro although latter does more as reference than actor with these elements working well film produces engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting character i could have done with it stopping just few seconds earlier than it did because im not sure that maybe it was all imagined bit at end was good idea otherwise it is enjoyably dark deliberate is driven by phoenix even if film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe,0.440328798185941,0.17153061224489796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,Venice 76 review,"I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.",venice 76 review,i have just watched joker venice i will say if joaquin doesnt get oscar this year then something is wrong with this world this perfomance is just jaw dropping it glues you screen doesnt let go till end story is very good has some interesting connections with batman lore especially one you cant guess trailers there are some scenes that are so tense well acted imaginative that push this movie 10 cinematography direction are great todd has proven himself as director robert is also good his small role will definitely see it again as soon as it out october,0.663,0.24266666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.2}"
8.0,"""That's Life.""","In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.",thats life,era cinema so saturated with superheroes gritty remakes todd phillips phoenix somehow take character so deeply intrenched pop culture create something compelling unique this film is unafraid be bleak scary without offering much viewer as means comfort only way we can deal with harsh cruelties world is by treating it as joke upon leaving this movie you will not hate joker you will hate world that made him phoenix simply cannot be praised enough he brings both sympathy tragedy way he moves his eyes way he contorts his shoulders way he laughs lesser actor would be unable swing his moods as far extremes as phoenix does nor add layers that phoenix intricately builds his character way he twists writhes his body is mesmerizing brings even more tragedy joker this is phoenixs movie as technical side this movie is far different than any other super hero films recent years cinematographer director choose shallow focus giving pheonix undivided attention viewer b more personal feel film there are wide shots with deep focus but they are used sparingly because this movie is about character not action or explosions color palette this movie is intentionally composed dour greens blues tepid yellows all which gives world sickly feel soundtrack is used affectively bringing waves optimism intentionally clash with our protagonists angry depression this film will likely be compared dark knight dceu films which i dont find be fair this film is far more akin machinist king comedy tone visual style i recommend this film i think anything short oscar nomination phoenix would be disrespectful effort he gives however i have one gripe i would like voice i found tie ins wayne family be unnecessary it came across as pandering audience that loves easter eggs more so than story itself my opinion i think story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself batman story other than that i had little issue with rest film joker is movie that tells us life is full sadness then gives us character whose purpose is spread laughter joy i was going finish this review with joke but you wouldnt get it,0.5908902691511386,0.01898291925465839,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.49}"
5.0,Acting Cannot Save Mediocre Script,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise.",acting cannot save mediocre script,they say its all writing this is great example that good acting production values cannot save script steeped tiresome stereotypes failure delve into characters identity we meet joker when already imbalanced his so called descent into madness is really couple weeks away far descent its stroll this is not character study despite claims contrary its showcase good actor overly contorting his body laughing manically as mistaken expression madness where is past where are influences where are conflicts what are seminal moments that create spiral perhaps if he had really had that relationship had it gone sour it would justify descent instead its fait accompli this is lazy writing focused more fancy long shots joaquin phoenix dancing crazily than producing something value franchise,0.5176470588235293,0.034313725490196054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"

7.0,Between a 7 and an 8,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.",between 7 8,i thought this film was good but i just dont get hype personally acting was amazing film was good overall but i think masterpiece film year are bit overused throughout reviews no way did i dislike this film i thought it was really good just overhyped i feel as though lot 10 10 reviews are purely based fact that it already has amazing reviews so people want carry praise further that it is about joker if this film was released was about some random guy same situation i dont think reviews would be as high but maybe thats point,0.4804166666666667,0.26452380952380955,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.17}"
