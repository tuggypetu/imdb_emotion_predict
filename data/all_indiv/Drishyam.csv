10.0,The psychological duel fought between a layman n a top cop is heart pounding.,"My earlier review which i posted on 31st July 2015 and which got more than 100 likes got deleted. Must be some blind bhakt who aint fond of this movie or my review or must be some fan boy who must hav got pissed off thru my imdb reviews.Unfortunately, there r countless blind bhakts n countless fan boys in my beautiful India.I saw this movie with my entire family in a theatre n that too, first day, first show.This aint ur regular Bollywood trash as there aint no songs, no dance, no unnecessary shirtless stuff, no gravity defying badly choreographed action, no jingoism n no melodrama.This one is a taut thriller with a superb performance by Ajay Devgn. He lost all his muscles n got into the skin of the character.His plain shirt, trouser n slippers act is convincing as a common person. Devgn is terrific n he nailed the character.The other guy who played Gaitonde is superb too.Audiences were cheering when he gets a beating. Such was the impact of his devilish act.It reminded me of a real life incident i read about.I read that many fellas in real life were very angry due to John Carradine's character shooting Jesse James (1939 version) at the movie's end. They say a young boy kicked John Carradine on his shoe during the premiere.Coming back to this film, it is full of tension n suspense throughout n the twist in the end makes it a top notch cerebral film.The saddest scene is the one where the character of Tabu n her onscreen husband anticipates their son's arrival whenever the door bell rings.Check out Suspect X (2008), Perfect Number (2012) n The Devotion of Suspect X (2017).All are based on the 2005 novel The Devotion of Suspect X (2005) by Keigo Higashino.",psychological duel fought between layman n top cop is heart pounding,my earlier review which i posted 31st july 2015 which got more than 100 likes got deleted must be some blind bhakt who aint fond this movie or my review or must be some fan boy who must hav got pissed off thru my imdb reviews unfortunately there r countless blind bhakts n countless fan boys my beautiful india i saw this movie with my entire family theatre n that too first day first show this aint ur regular bollywood trash as there aint no songs no dance no unnecessary shirtless stuff no gravity defying badly choreographed action no jingoism n no melodrama this one is taut thriller with superb performance by ajay devgn he lost all his muscles n got into skin character his plain shirt trouser n slippers act is convincing as common person devgn is terrific n he nailed character other guy who played gaitonde is superb too audiences were cheering when he gets beating such was impact his devilish act it reminded me real life incident i read about i read that many fellas real life were very angry due john carradines character shooting jesse james 1939 version at movies end they say young boy kicked john carradine his shoe during premiere coming back this film it is full tension n suspense throughout n twist end makes it top notch cerebral film saddest scene is one where character tabu n her onscreen husband anticipates their sons arrival whenever door bell rings check out suspect x 2008 perfect number 2012 n devotion suspect x 2017 all are based 2005 novel devotion suspect x 2005 by keigo higashino,0.5507147944647944,0.12599206349206352,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,A Cinematic Masterpiece!!,"What are the necessary requirements for making a good movie? I guess strong acting, realistic judgments made by characters, complementary music and tight pacing are essential elements in achieving this. In all these departments, Drishyam stands head and shoulders over every other Bollywood movie that has come out in this year. Even though it is a remake of a Malyalam movie, there is no loss of quality and it delivered emphatically.The essence of the movie is that due to some unexpected turn of events, a normal middle-class family gets itself involved in the missing case of the son of Senior Police Officers. As they never intended to do anything wrong, they decide to forge a story to dupe the police and save themselves.Ajay Devgan and Tabu are the two established actors in this movie, and both of them prove their mettle. It is a welcome change for Ajay Devgan as he has made one bad movie after another despite possessing great acting talent. He plays Vijay who runs a cable TV network and leads a modest life that revolves around his family. Tabu, on the other hand plays the IG officer who is the mother of her missing son. She once again proved that she is the finest actress in Bollywood with a menacing, layered performance that will leave people spellbound.Drishyam is a suspense movie and the director does well to include several trademark techniques that are used in such movies. The slow- zoom, slick editing and the tense background score all add another dimension to the well-written thriller. The movie explores several elements of Indian life such as the rampant corruption of police officers, unyielding devotion to family, and the longing for revenge. Drishyam is a well-made movie that deserves wide recognition for its achievement in making something that everyone can relate with. All the actions that the characters made were justifiable and any other person in that situation would have done the same. I have not revealed much about the movie in this review because you have to see it to understand the power of this movie.",cinematic masterpiece,what are necessary requirements making good movie i guess strong acting realistic judgments made by characters complementary music tight pacing are essential elements achieving this all these departments drishyam stands head shoulders over every other bollywood movie that has come out this year even though it is remake malyalam movie there is no loss quality it delivered emphatically essence movie is that due some unexpected turn events normal middle class family gets itself involved missing case son senior police officers as they never intended do anything wrong they decide forge story dupe police save themselves ajay devgan tabu are two established actors this movie both them prove their mettle it is welcome change ajay devgan as he has made one bad movie after another despite possessing great acting talent he plays vijay who runs cable tv network leads modest life that revolves around his family tabu other hand plays ig officer who is mother her missing son she once again proved that she is finest actress bollywood with menacing layered performance that will leave people spellbound drishyam is suspense movie director does well include several trademark techniques that are used such movies slow zoom slick editing tense background score all add another dimension well written thriller movie explores several elements indian life such as rampant corruption police officers unyielding devotion family longing revenge drishyam is well made movie that deserves wide recognition its achievement making something that everyone can relate with all actions that characters made were justifiable any other person that situation would have done same i have not revealed much about movie this review because you have see it understand power this movie,0.43585434173669474,-0.02387955182072828,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,Its Shawshank Redemption in bollywood. A masterpiece. The best south remake ever made in bollywood.,"DRISHYAM REVIEW- Hell yeah, just watched the Masterpiece, gem of thriller. Wow is the only word is in mouth now for this movie. Heard a remake of national award Malayalam movie is coming in bollywood and i was just waiting like anything for this movie. Trailer didn't offered much but it was promising. Then critics reviews came which took my expectations to sky level. And finally after watching it i must say movie worths it. A rare thriller which was made to look realistic only not as filmy masala content. First half takes time to set platform, sets movie plot then 2nd half blows you away with its masterclass planning and scenes. A simple plot, a common man who is 4th std failed not much educated tries to hide his family's crime from so called educated police officers. But the content and screenplay is so realistic that it makes this simple story a masterpiece. Even a Long runtime of 2 hrs 40 mins looks too tight and glues us to Our seat. Writer has done an extraordinary job, people will not forget this story in lifetime. Kudos to him and screenplay maker . Music wasn't much needed for movie,still 1 song after interval is situational which plays important role to make scene much tight. Entire star cast acted like real incident and really made me feel that its all happening in real in front of me. Ajay devgn the man who is the soul of this movie. His acting is just out of the world. Those intense eyes, innocent expressions, scary scenes and some emotional scenes as if this movie made for his acting only. Surely best performance of the year till date and i don't think someone will give better performance than him in this year at least, he deserves an award for this movie. Tabbu role is exactly half to Ajay according to runtime of movie. She did whatever expected from her role. Other star cast did fab job, each and every actor gave his best for their roles. Director Nishikant Kamat proves his skills and talent metal again here. He never left movie's grip till the end. Even the last ending scene of the movie was watchable and gives goosebumps. Hats off to him. He already had remake in hand which made direction much easier so there was no chance to make movie a crap. Overall a must watch for all. Only kids wont understand it, but other audience like classes, masses, youngsters and even seniors will love it. Go for this one, take 3 hrs from your life and enjoy the rare and the best thriller ever made in bollywood. Don't miss, you cant afford to miss this masterpiece. Here we have got the best movie of 2015.

9.0,Edge-of-the-seat thriller with surprising twists and turns,"Casting – 4/5Acting – 4.5/5Story – 5/5Screenplay – 5/5Editing – 5/5Cinematography – 4/5Background Score – 4/5Wow, finally a good thriller movie after a long time. Drishyam is a remake of the Malayalam movie by the same title. The movie is nestled in a Goan village, the kind where everyone knows one- another. The protagonist is a middle-class Goan Vijay Salgaonkar( Ajay Devgn) for whom his family's well being is paramount.Ajay plays the role of a 5th class school-dropout who runs a local cable-service provider shop. He is a big movie-buff and spends most of his time at work looking at the motion pictures.  Vijay has a cozy life with his wife Nandini(Shriya Saran) , elder daughter( Ishita Dutta, 'Poonam  from Ek Ghar Banaunga'  & Tanushree Dutta's sister) and younger daughter(Mrinal Jadhav).  The coziness of his family is shattered one night following an offhand chain of events.Vijay's character development is myriad throughout the film and it compels you to think away from the extreme principles of black vs white,  right vs wrong, yin vs yang.  His strong will and steadfastness to protect his family at all costs forms the backbone of the story.The unfateful night's chain of events leads to a massive police search headed by the stern and steely IPS Meera Deshmukh (Tabu).Tabu's acting is top-notch in multiple interrogation  scenes throughout the movie with a distinct no-nonsense persona on display at all times.Ishita Dutta is remarkable in her Bollywood debut with a wide palette of emotions. Mrinal Jadhav plays the role of the innocent and adorable younger daughter splendidly, generating a few interspersed audience laughs.Rajat Kapoor has a knack for playing the upper-class, businessmen –roles and is casted perfectly as Tabu's husband. However his character is a bit monochromatic, probably due to the script.The movie has multiple twists arousing the curiosity of the audience culminating into a superb climax.Even though the film is 2 hours and 43 minutes long, it binds the audience to their seats till the very last scene.I strongly recommend this film, especially to the thriller genre lovers.P.S. The film also teaches you why watching movies can impart you with paramount life-skills. So, definitely a connect with the movie buffs :)",edge seat thriller with surprising twists turns,casting 4 5acting 4 5 5story 5 5screenplay 5 5editing 5 5cinematography 4 5background score 4 5wow finally good thriller movie after long time drishyam is remake malayalam movie by same title movie is nestled goan village kind where everyone knows one another protagonist is middle class goan vijay salgaonkar ajay devgn whom his familys well being is paramount ajay plays role 5th class school dropout who runs local cable service provider shop he is big movie buff spends most his time at work looking at motion pictures vijay has cozy life with his wife nandini shriya saran elder daughter ishita dutta poonam ek ghar banaunga tanushree duttas sister younger daughter mrinal jadhav coziness his family is shattered one night following offhand chain events vijays character development is myriad throughout film it compels you think away extreme principles black vs white right vs wrong yin vs yang his strong will steadfastness protect his family at all costs forms backbone story unfateful nights chain events leads massive police search headed by stern steely ips meera deshmukh tabu tabus acting is top notch multiple interrogation scenes throughout movie with distinct no nonsense persona display at all times ishita dutta is remarkable her bollywood debut with wide palette emotions mrinal jadhav plays role innocent adorable younger daughter splendidly generating few interspersed audience laughs rajat kapoor has knack playing upper class businessmen roles is casted perfectly as tabus husband however his character is bit monochromatic probably due script movie has multiple twists arousing curiosity audience culminating into superb climax even though film is 2 hours 43 minutes long it binds audience their seats till very last scene i strongly recommend this film especially thriller genre lovers p s film also teaches you why watching movies can impart you with paramount life skills so definitely connect with movie buffs,0.4605595238095238,0.18797619047619046,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,Exceptional Piece of Writing,"Drishyam- Less are the cases present in any film industry where a film is made with brilliant piece of writing (By Jeethu Joshep in case of this movie)and every other thing just revolve around it. Drishyam was one of those cases. One thing i would like to clear before you watch the movie is that this is not a suspense movie. It has been wrongly promoted same as happened in case of Aamir Khan's TALAASH. But yes its a part family movie and a part thriller. From the very start culprit will be in front of your eyes , but its hard to prove. Its all about how deep the truth has been dumped and how difficult its gonna be dig it out. To say about the plot will ruin the movie. Like the trailer shows Vijay(Ajay) is a very good man , with a golden heart , but somehow his family is being caught by the police to prove that they have kidnapped the son of Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) a cop. After that starts a thrilling ride in which Meera want evidence to prove Vijay and his family guilty , and Vijay will do anything to save his family as he say - ""EK INSAAN KE LIYE USKI FAMILY HI SABKUCH HOTI HEI AUR UNHE BACHANE KE LIYE WO KISI BHI HADD TAK JA SAKTA HEI"". The character of Vijay literally lived up to this quote of himself . But the movies seeks for your patience . The first half up to the crime happens was a little too stretchy. Length of 2hr and 43min for a thriller is too long. Some editing was needed on the first half. Although i personally didn't find anything boring , as it was good with light moments , making base for title characters , some good humour and a nicely picturized song CARBON COPY. Still its true that some editing could have made it better. Its like a tasty cake has been made but the Cherry was missing. But wait , the cherry has been provided by the 2nd half. For me which compensate all the minor errors of first half. You couldn't imagine how the writer has managed to write such a plot with so much details of investigation and specially the interrogations. This movie has some of the best interrogation scenes which Bollywood haven't shown us till now. Nishikant Kamat is one hell of a director. His land marks includes 1. making movies in 3 languages 2. have directed the highest grossing Marathi film. 3. Is very good with remakes - first FORCE and now this one. 4. Lastly he can dig out acting out of John Abraham. And any director who can make John Abraham act , is a great director for me. Nisikant truly amazes me with showing how good he can control intense scenes. Ajay Devgan shines again in a serious role. He brings all the seriousness to the character and also provide some comic moments on the first half. The character he played has made some decisions with ethical difficulties , which could be right from someone's eyes and can also be wrong in someone else's view. Vijay makes us believe that his decisions were right for the situation and any person would have done such things for safe guarding his family. About Tabu , she is one of the greatest actress Bollywood have. She doesn't have any comparison . Only rivalry she had or have or will have is she herself. As cop she was tough , and you cant imagine how tough she was. You have to watch it to know how she mixes up her emotions of being the mother of the victim with the emotions of a tough cop who is investigating the same case. About Shreya Saran , i love her smile. And i missed that smile since i had seen her in Awarapan. Although she didn't get much of the meaty role but she was decent as Ajay's wife. Same goes for Rajat Kapoor as Tabu's husband. Some unique cinematography has been done , as the movie shows Goa not from a tourist point of view but from a resident's point of view. Vishal Bhardawaj as music director was OK as he doesn't get much chance to impose good songs in the movie but the background score by Sameer Phatarpekar was brilliant. Yes i have to cut some marks for a stretchy first half , but m going with 7.7/10 which is not bad at all. The thing i said for PIKU i would like to repeat for this is that there exist no reasons why should anyone not watch this movie except in case you have seen the original one. Just one request , DON'T EXPECT ANY SUSPENSE , be patient and FLOW WITH THE INTENSITY.

10.0,Family Drama With an Exciting thrill,"As everyone is aware it is a remake and the movies made before are exceptional. So, definitely the expectations would be high at least by the people who have seen it.The movie is super entertaining and comes off as a new genre. The first half gives you a beautiful picture about the characters, how they are simple, funny, trying to meet ends and commoner. Just before the interval you get a glimpse of the story and how it is going to screw everything up.Second half is just an intellectual battle between Tabu and Ajay. How they try to out do one another. The climax is brilliant.Ajay makes up for the time he was away from serious movies and excels scene by scene, Shriya is gorgeous and does well too. Tabu is menacing and yet a mother aptly supported by Rajat. Its a must watch!!!!!",family drama with exciting thrill,as everyone is aware it is remake movies made before are exceptional so definitely expectations would be high at least by people who have seen it movie is super entertaining comes off as new genre first half gives you beautiful picture about characters how they are simple funny trying meet ends commoner just before interval you get glimpse story how it is going screw everything up second half is just intellectual battle between tabu ajay how they try out do one another climax is brilliant ajay makes up time he was away serious movies excels scene by scene shriya is gorgeous does well too tabu is menacing yet mother aptly supported by rajat its must watch,0.6046221959858322,0.19225895316804406,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,"Drishyam :- Sheer Class and excellence, this is it","Well, visuals can indeed be deceptive. When the maker knows what he wants to present, you know you are in for an absolute treat. And for the ones who haven't seen the South Indian make of this movie, like me, are in for a masterpiece. Drishyam is inspired from a Japanese novel The Devotion of Suspect X & has been adopted into various languages in movies. When the roots have already been built, it is about proper presentation in a particular amount of time which is where Nishikant Kamat and his team come out triumphant. The best part about this movie is that it was presented and portrayed with utmost perfection in a manner in which the makers wanted it to be shown. The buildup was slow but every aspect was properly covered with enough evidence to win the audience. Suddenly, after a poor 1st half of 2015, Bollywood is coming up with tremendous flicks. It was the emotional journey of Bajrangi Bhaijaan 2 weeks back, critically acclaimed Masaan(I haven't seen it) last week and the gripping Drishyam now. Coming to the story, it is about the family of Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) ,his wife (Shriya Saran) ,his elder daughter Anju (Ishita Dutta) and the younger daughter Anu. Vijay is a 4th fail illiterate (as has been emphasized a lot in the movie) who lives a happy and satisfied life. He has his own cable service and he loves, watches, uses the scenes in movies in real life. Life takes a turn when the elder daughter (adopted) encounters a sad incident while on a School Nature Camp. This is the bitter reality of life:- We become culprit for no fault of ours and evil intentions of few spoilt rich. It was a mischief by a boy called Sam which came back to haunt the Salgaonkar family. Now, the only aim of Vijay is to protect his family from the police. It was to save themselves from blushes of the incident. But they were up against a tough & scary(I mean threatening) Inspector General (IG) Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) who was inclined to find the truth, after all Sam was her son. The way the planning is done, the manner in which it is portrayed, the confidence with which the family handles tough interrogations, the way the sequences are shown is all just perfect. Hats off to the original writer Jeetu Joseph, he left no stone unturned. The adaptation by Upendra Sidhaye is really good with a few changes here and there. The story unfolds wholly in Goa. The writing & script was so good that for me, it easily comes up amongst the best Bollywood has ever had. And the way Nishikant Kamat has handled it is simply phenomenal. The less said the better for Nishikant Kamat who has won my heart with such a wonderful vision and achieving the ultimate goal through this vision. You might feel that the pace is slow in the 1st half, but it doesn't bore you as its gripping. Some of the sequences are just scintillating especially after the arrival of Tabu. We have seen ample of movies regarding catching the criminal but this one is different, it's about saving the family. Will Vijay succeed? Or will Meera find out the truth? Watch it in a cinema theatre near you to find out. Direction by Nishikant Kamat is stupendous. It was an immense pleasure watching the movie on a Thursday night Premiere. When audience shouts and applaud towards the end, you know that the movie has won. Quite a lot of credit has to go to the casting director Vicky Sidana for coming up with a tremendous blend of actors. Apart from the big guns, it was the superb selection of supporting cast of Rajat Kapoor(Meera's husband), Ishita Dutta, Kamlesh Sawant (Inspector Gaetonde), Martin Uncle(Owner of Martin's cafe) etc. In such thriller movies, editing is a key aspect & with Aarif Sheikh, you know he will set it up perfectly & he did. Cinematography by Avinash Arun is also really good with the frames being simple yet catchy and beautiful rendition of Goa.There are just 2 songs comprising of the evergreen duo of Vishal Bharadwaj and Gulzar Saab but music isn't what matters in this movie. It's the haunting & terrifying back ground music by Sameer Phaterpekar which makes you deeply involved. I would specially like to point out the background music during the interrogation involving Tabu with her deadly eyes & the haunting music.Coming to the performances, Ajay Devgn delivers a phenomenal performance, one that will be remembered. His eyes speak a lot & he lived the character of Vijay Salgaonkar. Tabu is simply outstanding as Meera, playing the role of a tough cop & a concerned mother. She chooses her roles wisely and delivers a great performance most of the times. Shriya Saran is too young to play a mother but she also performs wonderfully well. She had a couple of difficult scenes and she did it really well. Debutant Ishita Dutta is someone whom I have seen earlier in the serial Ek Ghar Banaunga & I knew she would make it to Bollywood. She makes a really good debut. Rajat Kapoor is at his fluent best as he usually is. The younger daughter also does a decent job.

8.0,Drishyam: A Perfect movie for ending my tiring Thursday,"Just came back from the Premier Screening of Drishyam. The reason for me to catch the movie was the reviews of the original Drishyam which is a Malyalam movie with Mohanlal as the lead actor. The trailers of this Hindi remake with powerful existence of Ajay Devgan (or Devgn, as he writes it now) and Tabu, motivated me to go for this movie after a tiring Thursday in office, (mentioning the tiring day as disappointment was the last this I was willing to accept after the day, Glad I chose this movie). So the movie starts with a small happy family of Vishal Salgaonkar which is living happily in the ever happy town of Goa, there family was disrupted because of an unwanted person entering into their lives who happens to be the son of the Inspector general of Goa, Meera Deshmukh, then an accident happens which changes the life of this family for ever. The way this 4th grade failed person (Vishal) plays with the police department is commendable. So the movie is about how actually Vishal safeguard his family and himself against powerful Meera and her Police Department.My special suggestion is to have patience and sit for the first half of the movie as nothing much will happen but the story will be built up. After the interval when you come back with that tub of popcorn, its then the real investigation and the never ending plot of Vishal to safeguard his family starts, the proceedings will sometimes give you goose bumps and at times you will expect something to happen which will not happen and hence the tag line of the move ""Visuals Can Be Deceptive"" The Camera work of the movie is good. it features some of the beautiful locations of Goa (I am not sure if all of that was Goa) The acting done by the whole Salgaonkar family is superb along with Tabu's never disappointing appearance in front of the camera. The movie has limited songs, Two, actually, if I remember correctly, but both the tracks are good and perfectly goes with the situation. The side characters in the movie are also done by good actors and so they mix in the screenplay very meticulously. Overall, Its 100% worth a watch on this weekend, so go ahead book your tickets and go for it, I am sure you wont be disappointed, specially people who like Ajay Devgn on screen should go for this movie for sure.",drishyam perfect movie ending my tiring thursday,just came back premier screening drishyam reason me catch movie was reviews original drishyam which is malyalam movie with mohanlal as lead actor trailers this hindi remake with powerful existence ajay devgan or devgn as he writes it now tabu motivated me go this movie after tiring thursday office mentioning tiring day as disappointment was last this i was willing accept after day glad i chose this movie so movie starts with small happy family vishal salgaonkar which is living happily ever happy town goa there family was disrupted because unwanted person entering into their lives who happens be son inspector general goa meera deshmukh then accident happens which changes life this family ever way this 4th grade failed person vishal plays with police department is commendable so movie is about how actually vishal safeguard his family himself against powerful meera her police department my special suggestion is have patience sit first half movie as nothing much will happen but story will be built up after interval when you come back with that tub popcorn its then real investigation never ending plot vishal safeguard his family starts proceedings will sometimes give you goose bumps at times you will expect something happen which will not happen hence tag line move visuals can be deceptive camera work movie is good it features some beautiful locations goa i am not sure if all that was goa acting done by whole salgaonkar family is superb along with tabus never disappointing appearance front camera movie has limited songs two actually if i remember correctly but both tracks are good perfectly goes with situation side characters movie are also done by good actors so they mix screenplay very meticulously overall its 100 worth watch this weekend so go ahead book your tickets go it i am sure you wont be disappointed specially people who like ajay devgn screen should go this movie sure,0.5455865272938446,0.2658826945412311,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.32}"

6.0,"Many might like it who haven't seen the original, but as a remake, its the weakest one till date, missing the much needed soul, energy and fire.","With all honesty, the Hindi version of DRISHYAM gives me no energy to write about it in details being the weakest 4th remake of the original Malayalam film featuring Mohan Lal in the lead. Using a fresh backdrop and a local feel it has got its impressive moments that obviously come in the final hour when the proceedings become high paced, intense and brutal too with police interrogation crossing all its extreme limits at the orders of its own IG. But at the same time, it doesn't make any change in its slow first half, following the fixed format that was also pointed out as the weaker portions of the original by few critics. Still, despite the not so happening first hour, one might like it as a crime thriller that doesn't allow the viewers to move in its concluding hour, offering many unexpected twists and turns keeping them thoroughly engrossed. However it's the missing emotions, lack of energy or fire, average performances, a loud-inconsistent background score, avoidable spoon- feeding and few unnecessary (ridiculous) commercial insertions that don't let you rate the film more than anything above average or decent. Thankfully they use only two songs out of four (in the soundtrack) as required but fail to en-cash on the emotional aspect of the script that should ideally have been its key feature becoming a 'family- thriller'.As a bitter truth, the theme of the film didn't require any kind of philosophical soundtrack both Vishal and Gulzar are known for. The weak acts of Shriya Saran, kids and more contribute a lot in its feeble impact. Plus confirming my doubts Ajay Devgn remains a miscast in the role of a clever minded, cinema loving father guarding his small family. Moreover the most disappointing feature remains Tabu, who doesn't come up with anything even close to what was being expected quite surprisingly, whereas Kamlesh Sawant as the cruel sub- inspector scores the most.In comparative terms, it seems DRISHAYM (Hindi) has been made hurriedly in some kind of available time with the star or team, without giving any major emphasis on solid characterizations as seen in the original. In clear words, where in all the four regional films, the actors seem like sinking deep into their given characters, the Hindi version has them all doing it as another of their professional assignment standing in front of the camera with no home-work done of any sort to play their given roles. Mentioning it specifically I didn't find any concerning FATHER in Ajay Devgn or a MOTHER in either Shriya or Tabu disappointingly, that was supposed to be the main requirement of the script as my personal conclusion. So would suggest to go for the original Malayalam film first if you wish to enjoy the subject more in the right manner. Note: Hope after DRISHYAM many passionate Hindi filmgoers get enlightened that in reality our Indian Regional movies and makers are miles ahead than the present mainstream Hindi Cinema in all respects.",many might like it who havent seen original but as remake its weakest one till date missing much needed soul energy fire,with all honesty hindi version drishyam gives me no energy write about it details being weakest 4th remake original malayalam film featuring mohan lal lead using fresh backdrop local feel it has got its impressive moments that obviously come final hour when proceedings become high paced intense brutal too with police interrogation crossing all its extreme limits at orders its own ig but at same time it doesnt make any change its slow first half following fixed format that was also pointed out as weaker portions original by few critics still despite not so happening first hour one might like it as crime thriller that doesnt allow viewers move its concluding hour offering many unexpected twists turns keeping them thoroughly engrossed however its missing emotions lack energy or fire average performances loud inconsistent background score avoidable spoon feeding few unnecessary ridiculous commercial insertions that dont let you rate film more than anything above average or decent thankfully they use only two songs out four soundtrack as required but fail en cash emotional aspect script that should ideally have been its key feature becoming family thriller as bitter truth theme film didnt require any kind philosophical soundtrack both vishal gulzar are known weak acts shriya saran kids more contribute lot its feeble impact plus confirming my doubts ajay devgn remains miscast role clever minded cinema loving father guarding his small family moreover most disappointing feature remains tabu who doesnt come up with anything even close what was being expected quite surprisingly whereas kamlesh sawant as cruel sub inspector scores most comparative terms it seems drishaym hindi has been made hurriedly some kind available time with star or team without giving any major emphasis solid characterizations as seen original clear words where all four regional films actors seem like sinking deep into their given characters hindi version has them all doing it as another their professional assignment standing front camera with no home work done any sort play their given roles mentioning it specifically i didnt find any concerning father ajay devgn or mother either shriya or tabu disappointingly that was supposed be main requirement script as my personal conclusion so would suggest go original malayalam film first if you wish enjoy subject more right manner note hope after drishyam many passionate hindi filmgoers get enlightened that reality our indian regional movies makers are miles ahead than present mainstream hindi cinema all respects,0.5383638583638584,0.09668650793650795,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
7.0,One can learn surprising things from movies,"Drishyam, literally meaning 'visuals', is a Hindi-language crime mystery thriller about a upper middle-class family that comes under the scrutiny of police when they're suspected of murder of a young man who has powerful ties with the local authorities. Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), the father, must do everything he can to keep his family from going to prison, utilizing every legal and illegal trick he has learned as a lifelong movie buff.A fine example of how a good script can elevate a movie. Because to be honest the acting is not a strength of this film. Devgn is very good, which helps a lot, as is Tabu as Inspector General Meera Deshmukh, but all the rest are either rather wooden or a bit too over the top.But that doesn't really matter because it's really a movie about Devgn's character and how he continuously outsmarts the police. The greatest thrill of the film is finding out just how long he can keep up the juggling act without Tabu's character finally nailing him to the wall.And it's a good juggling act. The classic crime thrillers are more about ""who did it"", but this is a great example of a smaller subgenre tentatively called ""will they get caught"". And in executing the conventions of that subgenre is where this film shines.Recommended. Especially if you're looking for a Hindi film that's about more than singing, dancing and jumping around.",one can learn surprising things movies,drishyam literally meaning visuals is hindi language crime mystery thriller about upper middle class family that comes under scrutiny police when theyre suspected murder young man who has powerful ties with local authorities vijay salgaonkar ajay devgn father must do everything he can keep his family going prison utilizing every legal illegal trick he has learned as lifelong movie buff fine example how good script can elevate movie because be honest acting is not strength this film devgn is very good which helps lot as is tabu as inspector general meera deshmukh but all rest are either rather wooden or bit too over top but that doesnt really matter because its really movie about devgns character how he continuously outsmarts police greatest thrill film is finding out just how long he can keep up juggling act without tabus character finally nailing him wall its good juggling act classic crime thrillers are more about who did it but this is great example smaller subgenre tentatively called will they get caught executing conventions that subgenre is where this film shines recommended especially if youre looking hindi film thats about more than singing dancing jumping around,0.4757471264367817,0.27218390804597703,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.3}"

7.0,This Is a Solid Piece of Entertainment But it Could Have Been So Much More,"Drishyam is a Hindi remake of a Tamil monster blockbuster. I have not seen the latter so I can't make the comparison (but I have just found out that the Tamil movie with English subtitles is on YouTube ... Yeah!).Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) runs a cable TV network in a remote and hilly village of Goa. He lives a happy life with his wife Nandini and two daughters. A 4th grade dropout & an orphan, Vijay has worked his way towards success with his sheer hard-work & street smartness in order to provide for his family who mean the world to him. A man of few means & needs; Vijay believes life is to be lived simplistically - his wife, while she loves him devoutly, wants Vijay's thrifty & miserly behavior to end and wants the world for her family. If there's one thing that Vijay cannot live without, it is his passion for watching films. Such is his 'filmy' obsession that he doesn't mind staying up all night at his office binging on TV movies! In a bizarre turn of events; a teenage boy goes missing; he is the son of a headstrong & no-nonsense cop; IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) and the Salgaonkar family is the prime suspect! Will a humble & middle class man, be able to protect his family from oppression of the powerful? How the family weathers the storm that ensues during the violent investigation forms the rest of the story leading to an unexpected & shocking climax.Drishyam is a riveting entertainer. The first half lays the foundation for a rip-roaring second half and it didn't disappoint. The cast is great with Ajay Devgn leading the ultimate ""how to get away with murder"" plot line. We are treated to his ultimate foe in Tabu who has the killer look to match her crime brain. Elsewhere, I really enjoy watching Rajat Kapoor who plays Tabu's husband. His character moves in brilliant counterpoint to Tabu's relentless pursuit for the answer. Love the superb cat and mouse games and how the tables keep turning till we were tearing our hair off, but everything hits the groove and reaches a satisfying climax.Drishyam could have been a classic but several creative choices baffled me. The humour in the first half feels laboured and forced. How it paints the family of four is too obvious to me. But thankfully I love watching Vijay who is a character after my heart. He loves watching action movies, law and crime dramas, and the accumulated wealth of knowledge help lay the path of deceit and red herrings for the police. He is a character that is very easy to root for. Tabu also puts in a superb shift and it is easy to believe in her smarts, but it is her cold cruelty that puts a shiver in my heart. Overall, I find the writing couldn't match up with the characters and story, and it felt very ""by the numbers"" rudimentary to me. In more capable hands the shades of the characters would have been more layered and the theme of wrong versus wronged shining forth. Fans of the Japanese film Suspect X will find this quite familiar but thankfully with a good mixing up of elements and locale. As it is, it comes off just as a solid piece of entertainment than superb character studies.",this is solid piece entertainment but it could have been so much more,drishyam is hindi remake tamil monster blockbuster i have not seen latter so i cant make comparison but i have just found out that tamil movie with english subtitles is youtube yeah vijay salgaonkar ajay devgn runs cable tv network remote hilly village goa he lives happy life with his wife nandini two daughters 4th grade dropout orphan vijay has worked his way towards success with his sheer hard work street smartness order provide his family who mean world him man few means needs vijay believes life is be lived simplistically his wife while she loves him devoutly wants vijays thrifty miserly behavior end wants world her family if theres one thing that vijay cannot live without it is his passion watching films such is his filmy obsession that he doesnt mind staying up all night at his office binging tv movies bizarre turn events teenage boy goes missing he is son headstrong no nonsense cop ig meera deshmukh tabu salgaonkar family is prime suspect will humble middle class man be able protect his family oppression powerful how family weathers storm that ensues during violent investigation forms rest story leading unexpected shocking climax drishyam is riveting entertainer first half lays foundation rip roaring second half it didnt disappoint cast is great with ajay devgn leading ultimate how get away with murder plot line we are treated his ultimate foe tabu who has killer look match her crime brain elsewhere i really enjoy watching rajat kapoor who plays tabus husband his character moves brilliant counterpoint tabus relentless pursuit answer love superb cat mouse games how tables keep turning till we were tearing our hair off but everything hits groove reaches satisfying climax drishyam could have been classic but several creative choices baffled me humour first half feels laboured forced how it paints family four is too obvious me but thankfully i love watching vijay who is character after my heart he loves watching action movies law crime dramas accumulated wealth knowledge help lay path deceit red herrings police he is character that is very easy root tabu also puts superb shift it is easy believe her smarts but it is her cold cruelty that puts shiver my heart overall i find writing couldnt match up with characters story it felt very by numbers rudimentary me more capable hands shades characters would have been more layered theme wrong versus wronged shining forth fans japanese film suspect x will find this quite familiar but thankfully with good mixing up elements locale as it is it comes off just as solid piece entertainment than superb character studies,0.4916005291005292,0.16302429052429054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"

The film is set in Goa, thankfully no focus on beaches and bars.etc yet there are some stereotypes like the character of Martin who runs Martins corner, he offers the cop a beer at breakfast.

7.0,Indian crime noir,"Vijay Salgaonkar is a 4th grade dropout. He owns a small shop running cable TV in the neighborhood and spends most days watching TV. Using his TV knowledge, he helps an elderly couple get their son out of jail from a corrupt system where a crooked cop extorts from the locals. He's a father-knows-best at home. When creepy Sam threatens his daughter Anju with a peeping Tom video, Anju and his wife Nandini inadvertently kills him. Vijay sets off to hide the crime against Sam's unrelenting, ruthless police chief mother.I wasn't sure what this movie was going for at first. There is a bit of light tones which confused me a little. The first act needs to be tighter and darker. This does turn much darker with a hint of The Usual Suspects. The dates concerned me a little but the movie throws it a very nice reveal. The other concern is Sam's mother. She's definitely not a simple villain although a much darker villain may be better.

10.0,This is India's answer to 'Gone Girl' (2014)!!!!,"Discaimer: everything written below in praise of the film should also apply to the original South Indian (from 2013) that this one is a copy of, or perhaps even more for having come up with such a masterpiece.Yes, it's a masterpiece and mind-blowing concept and it goes down as one of the most entertaining films that I have ever watched. Not only does it keep you on your toes throughout but it makes you chew your nails in between. A thriller of the highest quality! This could be India's answer to 'Gone Girl' (2014), or even better I would say.One important point was to make the public side with the hero and his family and to sort of create an understanding for everything that he had done. This of course wouldn't have been possible if they had shown it as just some deliberate murder, or had shown a completely innocent guy being murdered. So that was quite smart.This film is all about self-confidence, trust in one's ability and about sticking to your decision come what may. I have gone through something somewhat similar to this in my life a few years ago, although I wasn't the one accused and neither was I on the wrong side - even more similarly to this film, perhaps no one was entirely on the wrong side - and add one more similarity, the only person on the wrong side had not intended for things to escalate to this much as that person was on the play trying to achieve some other goal. It's amazingly mind-blowing seeing the similarities! A bit sad that I can't elaborate much on the story to explain how similar things were, from character to character! Not to imply that I am as smart as the hero was, but I have one stunningly striking similarity from my very life with this film, and something that my friends often find hard to believe. To come to the point, all my English is based on what I had started from news channel and the commentary of cricket matches, then to the Internet and hence the articles etc. read online. Add to this learning very good, pure Hindi from online dictionaries and Urdu from reading the news-slide on Pakistani news channels. Add to this I am a complete film freak! Alone in July I have watched 23 films! So quite a few similarities there.",this is indias answer gone girl 2014,discaimer everything written below praise film should also apply original south indian 2013 that this one is copy or perhaps even more having come up with such masterpiece yes its masterpiece mind blowing concept it goes down as one most entertaining films that i have ever watched not only does it keep you your toes throughout but it makes you chew your nails between thriller highest quality this could be indias answer gone girl 2014 or even better i would say one important point was make public side with hero his family sort create understanding everything that he had done this course wouldnt have been possible if they had shown it as just some deliberate murder or had shown completely innocent guy being murdered so that was quite smart this film is all about self confidence trust ones ability about sticking your decision come what may i have gone through something somewhat similar this my life few years ago although i wasnt one accused neither was i wrong side even more similarly this film perhaps no one was entirely wrong side add one more similarity only person wrong side had not intended things escalate this much as that person was play trying achieve some other goal its amazingly mind blowing seeing similarities bit sad that i cant elaborate much story explain how similar things were character character not imply that i am as smart as hero was but i have one stunningly striking similarity my very life with this film something that my friends often find hard believe come point all my english is based what i had started news channel commentary cricket matches then internet hence articles etc read online add this learning very good pure hindi online dictionaries urdu reading news slide pakistani news channels add this i am complete film freak alone july i have watched 23 films so quite few similarities there,0.5812614870509608,0.13567460317460317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7.0,Intelligent but tiresome,"This film's entire conceit lies in the plots between the protagonist's family and the corrupt police force. The sneaky cat-and-mouse game stretches them to their limits as they attempt to outmaneuver each other in more and more daring ways. The schemes are intelligent and demand close viewing, as more is revealed gradually throughout the film, culminating in surprising plot twists near the end. However, the film relies too much on revealing the family's scheme and it gets tiresome to watch the same thing over and over - how many times can I see someone buying ""pav bhaji"" to get receipts? The characters seem to fulfil only the most basic archetypes - stoic family man, brutally corrupt cop, weeping wife, evil stalker (who, by the way, was too dumb to live) and so on. Although the film had good points, its runtime leaned too heavily on the same clever schemes at the expense of character development and other necessities.",intelligent but tiresome,this films entire conceit lies plots between protagonists family corrupt police force sneaky cat mouse game stretches them their limits as they attempt outmaneuver each other more more daring ways schemes are intelligent demand close viewing as more is revealed gradually throughout film culminating surprising plot twists near end however film relies too much revealing familys scheme it gets tiresome watch same thing over over how many times can i see someone buying pav bhaji get receipts characters seem fulfil only most basic archetypes stoic family man brutally corrupt cop weeping wife evil stalker who by way was too dumb live so although film had good points its runtime leaned too heavily same clever schemes at expense character development other necessities,0.5919753086419753,0.07696408529741865,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,Absolutely Top Class !!!,"Expectations were very high after watching the original movie but after seeing this I am 100 percent sure that none other than Ajay Devgn could justify the role of Mohanlal Sir as he did in the original one. This is pure class of acting superbly led by Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Shriya Sharan and others. This is one of the finest remakes ever made in Bollywood Cinema. Ajay Devgn as Vijay Salgaonkar and Tabu as IG Meera Deshmukh as just terrific in there respective characters.A bone chilling story with an excellent cast and a perfect climax - what else we need ! Even after the run time of the movie is around 2hrs 43mins it makes sure that we don't leave our seat till the movie is completed.

9.0,"Mindblowing Experience, Thrill it!","A extremely very well written thriller movie, based on Tamil movie, which was also remade in Malyalam and now in Hindi, featuring Ajay Devgn, Shriya Sharan and Tabu in the lead. How far a common man can go to save his family - This is the main storyline. Vijay (Ajay) saves his family from IG Meera Naiar (Tabu) and other policemen. The concept is very fresh and unique. No one can beat the visualization which Ajay's character has. Very well crafted. Director Nishikant Kamat has done a pretty good job. I was seating on the edge of the seat in most of the parts of post interval. He made a very good thriller. Other technical aspects are also good. Music is given by Vishal Bhardwaj. Carbon copy is my favorite from this album, written by Gulzar. Dumb Ghutata Hai is okay. Background score is in the flow of the movie. Actors are really good. Ajay, Tabu, Shriya - all have acted well. Rajat Kapoor has a small role, nothing to offer. When Bahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan both are rocking the box-office, it is obvious that only mouth publicity can help this film to survive in the battle. I've heard that this too is going strong. So, July brings the best for all the viewers.
