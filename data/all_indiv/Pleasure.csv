7,"The most realistic depiction of the porn industry put to film, by far","Ever since Evelyn Claire told me on set that she was being featured in an upcoming A24 film, I've been waiting for this one, so naturally I made an effort to go see it opening weekend. (I guess A24 dropped it at some point though - not sure why). Considering most of the pre-release press has been about the porn industry participants feeling ""betrayed"" or ""led astray"" by the production, I entered with ""certain"" expectations, I suppose.First, let me say that this is easily the most accurate portrayal of what it's like working in the porn industry that I have ever seen put to film, by far. Writer/director Ninja Thyberg obviously did her homework, because 2/3 of this movie just felt like my run-of-the-mill day at work (I've been an ""adult film actor"" for 13 years now) - the majority of the details were nailed, to a T. That deserves major accolades in itself. Of course, the viewing was a biased experience for me, by default, primarily at the movie's expense. For me personally, the majority of the central segments of the movie felt rather shallow and uninteresting, thematically, and in its actual events. After a strong opening, it began to wander into a rather empty direction from my perspective, but fortunately there is a character arc and thematic turn that gives the movie cautionary purpose in the last 45 minutes.On the subject of themes, I want to respond to the backlash coming from certain XXX industry folks by saying that I disagree about the movie making the industry look bad. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is that it does a great job of developing a display of what I've always seen as a looming truth: it's not the industry itself that destroys people who get involved, it's what the individual seeks from the industry. I've always thought that if someone gets into porn for the sole purpose of fame and/or money, with no passion for the actual sex acts, that is precisely how one may find themselves in a vapid black hole of loneliness or unhealthy practices. Overly competitive people have always rubbed me wrong, and this movie focuses precisely on how detrimental that can be. I'll never understand the need to be ""the best"" - just love what you do!This was a somewhat surreal viewing experience for me considering I ""know"" 80% of the cast, as well as in about half of the locations that the film took place in - that's a first with a mainstream film. I enjoyed watching all these acquaintances getting their chance to flex their acting chops in a somewhat different realm. Lead actress Sofia Kappel (one of the only cast members who's not actually in the porn industry) absolutely stole the show, delivering a brave, well-rounded, and pretty endearing performance, which gives the movie a lot of life and value it might not otherwise have. Ex-pornstar Zelda Morrison did a fantastic job building a realistic character throughout the film, as did fellow XXX talent Chris Cock. And, Evelyn Claire, who has always reminded me of young Jennifer Connelly, was the PERFECT casting choice for her very crucial role - she serves absolute FACE every single time she's on screen - she's stone cold.While I felt that the movie didn't have a lot of dynamic to it's pacing, and kind of lacked some necessary tension, I still think it's a very accomplished showcase of what performing in the industry is like for those curious to know. It's shot well and I enjoyed the direction of the music used. It is a VERY graphic film, hence the NOT RATED rating, so of course it's not for everyone! Plentiful erect penises and interpreted sex acts and cum! Not sure i'd ever watch it again, but, it stands out!",most realistic depiction porn industry put film by far,ever since evelyn claire told me set that she was being featured upcoming a24 film ive been waiting this one so naturally i made effort go see it opening weekend i guess a24 dropped it at some point though not sure why considering most pre release press has been about porn industry participants feeling betrayed or led astray by production i entered with certain expectations i suppose first let me say that this is easily most accurate portrayal what its like working porn industry that i have ever seen put film by far writer director ninja thyberg obviously did her homework because 2 3 this movie just felt like my run mill day at work ive been adult film actor 13 years now majority details were nailed t that deserves major accolades itself course viewing was biased experience me by default primarily at movies expense me personally majority central segments movie felt rather shallow uninteresting thematically its actual events after strong opening it began wander into rather empty direction my perspective but fortunately there is character arc thematic turn that gives movie cautionary purpose last 45 minutes subject themes i want respond backlash coming certain xxx industry folks by saying that i disagree about movie making industry look bad perhaps films greatest strength is that it does great job developing display what ive always seen as looming truth its not industry itself that destroys people who get involved its what individual seeks industry ive always thought that if someone gets into porn sole purpose fame or money with no passion actual sex acts that is precisely how one may find themselves vapid black hole loneliness or unhealthy practices overly competitive people have always rubbed me wrong this movie focuses precisely how detrimental that can be ill never understand need be best just love what you do this was somewhat surreal viewing experience me considering i know 80 cast as well as about half locations that film took place thats first with mainstream film i enjoyed watching all these acquaintances getting their chance flex their acting chops somewhat different realm lead actress sofia kappel one only cast members whos not actually porn industry absolutely stole show delivering brave well rounded pretty endearing performance which gives movie lot life value it might not otherwise have ex pornstar zelda morrison did fantastic job building realistic character throughout film as did fellow xxx talent chris cock evelyn claire who has always reminded me young jennifer connelly was perfect casting choice her very crucial role she serves absolute face every single time shes screen shes stone cold while i felt that movie didnt have lot dynamic its pacing kind lacked some necessary tension i still think its very accomplished showcase what performing industry is like those curious know its shot well i enjoyed direction music used it is very graphic film hence not rated rating so course its not everyone plentiful erect penises interpreted sex acts cum not sure id ever watch it again but it stands out,0.5853370140326661,0.14366632160110418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5,Average drama with a few extreme moments,"I didn't think this story was all that compelling or satisfyingly told. There were some details that were memorable, but I really didn't get invested in where it was going. I will agree that the lead actress did an amazing job, and most everyone else brought a realism to their roles, especially since they work in the adult film industry in real life. But I didn't feel like there was much connection between the scenes. Yes, the overall goal of the main character remains consistent, but I didn't feel like we were shown what motivated her to make the specific choices she did much of the time. The effect is that the story doesn't really progress and build believably. Even though it has an outstanding central performance, I felt this was a fairly average drama overall which happened to have a few scenes that were difficult to watch.",average drama with few extreme moments,i didnt think this story was all that compelling or satisfyingly told there were some details that were memorable but i really didnt get invested where it was going i will agree that lead actress did amazing job most everyone else brought realism their roles especially since they work adult film industry real life but i didnt feel like there was much connection between scenes yes overall goal main character remains consistent but i didnt feel like we were shown what motivated her make specific choices she did much time effect is that story doesnt really progress build believably even though it has outstanding central performance i felt this was fairly average drama overall which happened have few scenes that were difficult watch,0.4512820512820512,0.13814102564102565,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"
6,Incredibly nuanced for such a heavy subject matter,"It's pretty much true that everytime there's a mainstream movie about the adult industry, it always focuses on the extremes on one end; where there tends to be a very anti-porn industry undertone that guides these movies.So when you're making a movie about the industry with many actual performers showing up as themselves, there was the risk of it being extreme on the pro-industry end. But to my pleasant surprise, the movie composed itself with a lot of nuance on both ends of the argument to share its story without a strong bias on either side; something I very much appreciate. Pleasure is a very decent movie, but with very little originality in my opinion. Yes, I liked its tone overall, but the story plays out exactly the way you'd think it would by the first 15 minutes. It certainly wasn't boring, but it never captivated as much as it had the potential to, and that's something I wish this movie could have done different.Overall however, it was a decent watch, but more importantly, it was made with the right frame of mind... and that's what truly stood out to me.",incredibly nuanced such heavy subject matter,its pretty much true that everytime theres mainstream movie about adult industry it always focuses extremes one end where there tends be very anti porn industry undertone that guides these movies so when youre making movie about industry with many actual performers showing up as themselves there was risk it being extreme pro industry end but my pleasant surprise movie composed itself with lot nuance both ends argument share its story without strong bias either side something i very much appreciate pleasure is very decent movie but with very little originality my opinion yes i liked its tone overall but story plays out exactly way youd think it would by first 15 minutes it certainly wasnt boring but it never captivated as much as it had potential thats something i wish this movie could have done different overall however it was decent watch but more importantly it was made with right frame mind thats what truly stood out me,0.5672380952380952,0.1691527777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8,Mixing business and pleasure (not?),"There are certain things that can be critisized here. The biggest being the motivational void - the thing that drives our character to extreme lengths. She does tell us that she wants to be the biggest porn star, but that alone may not be sufficient for us to really get behind her and the decisions she is taking.Now having said that and as you can tell by my rating, that did not take any ""pleasure"" or entertainment away from the movie and what it was telling. There are a lot of uncomfortable scenes ... there are also a lot of scenes that make this look like glamour and fun. And that is one of the things that the movie is telling us.Of course it could not shy away from the male dominated aspects of the industry. Or what it does mentally to some ... again some are built to do this and some probably thought it is easy money. It is always important to set boundaries ... and hopefully be advised by the right people. Of course also listen to them.This is based on a short movie the director did a lot of years back. I never watched that, but I read an interview she did. She visited a lot of sets and apart from the main actress, almost everyone else involved is or was working in the porn industry. So they did not have to ""act"" ... well not more than normal. It also means there is a lot nudity - if you feel uncomfortable watching that ... well the movies aim is to make you uncomfortable watching a lot of things, but I'm just putting this out there, as a fair warning or whatever you want to call it.The movie still has a few cliches it touches upon and while it does not say things outright, most of them are ... hammered through! Innuendos and puns sort of intended. You may not be able to enjoy certain things anymore I reckon once you've seen how the ""magic"" is being made ... one thing is for sure, the movie is not meant to ""pleasure"" you. It doesn't even manage to pleasure the main character most of the time ... or any time? And the ending is as much a message as the rest of the movie. Still well done - and even without clear motivation the movie manages to convey everything it needs to.",mixing business pleasure not,there are certain things that can be critisized here biggest being motivational void thing that drives our character extreme lengths she does tell us that she wants be biggest porn star but that alone may not be sufficient us really get behind her decisions she is taking now having said that as you can tell by my rating that did not take any pleasure or entertainment away movie what it was telling there are lot uncomfortable scenes there are also lot scenes that make this look like glamour fun that is one things that movie is telling us course it could not shy away male dominated aspects industry or what it does mentally some again some are built do this some probably thought it is easy money it is always important set boundaries hopefully be advised by right people course also listen them this is based short movie director did lot years back i never watched that but i read interview she did she visited lot sets apart main actress almost everyone else involved is or was working porn industry so they did not have act well not more than normal it also means there is lot nudity if you feel uncomfortable watching that well movies aim is make you uncomfortable watching lot things but im just putting this out there as fair warning or whatever you want call it movie still has few cliches it touches upon while it does not say things outright most them are hammered through innuendos puns sort intended you may not be able enjoy certain things anymore i reckon once youve seen how magic is being made one thing is sure movie is not meant pleasure you it doesnt even manage pleasure main character most time or any time ending is as much message as rest movie still well done even without clear motivation movie manages convey everything it needs,0.5383060515873015,0.1345610119047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8,Just an HONEST OBJECTIVE REVIEW,"Okay so ""Pleasure"" delves into what it is like to be a porn star. It comes equipped with all of the debauchery you would expect to portray this sometimes sordid craft. However, porn is something we're all intimately acquainted with and we all have a least a passing passion for how it is done.The girls involved. The challenges they face working in such an industry. The guys they have to deal with on set. Even to the difficulties that male porn stars experience with 'being prepared and ready to go'Boogie Nights was the only other film to really memorialize the porn industry and obviously it was fantastic. It crystallized the early porno scene industry. Pleasure does much the same but without a lot of the bravado and drugs. It feels very intimate and as though it were something that happened to the writer.It captures the tensity of a live sex scene very well and you can even sense the nerves of the crew as they do their best to make the girls feel everything is professional and by the book. However it does get into the hardcore scenes, and even beyond that at times. Too far beyond it. The surreal nature of a ""rough"" scene and blurring the lines of what is performative art and what is bordering on sexual abuse and rape. Only the girls willingness to go through with it makes the act forgivable at all. I am not a fan of hardcore porn and this film doesn't glorify it. Much the opposite. It's an important film for pretty much everyone to see. Especially the younger generation that has been consuming porn for the entire lives via the internet.My only complaint would be that I think some of the cinematic scenes could have been edited down quite a bit. The movie had a few pacing issues although it didn't really matter it just felt... a little weirdly structured. I mean honestly the film is an 8 for me and I am really really picky. :OI found the film to be exceedingly entertaining and I really loved the wholesome acting of Linnea. After seeing it there are ALOT of takeaway feelings involved---In closing I think the message of the film was to just give us a real glimpse of the adult entertainment world. Obviously the industry is changing now and pornstars/sex workers are getting rid of the middle man and producing their own content on sites like Onlyfans.",just honest objective review,okay so pleasure delves into what it is like be porn star it comes equipped with all debauchery you would expect portray this sometimes sordid craft however porn is something were all intimately acquainted with we all have least passing passion how it is done girls involved challenges they face working such industry guys they have deal with set even difficulties that male porn stars experience with being prepared ready goboogie nights was only other film really memorialize porn industry obviously it was fantastic it crystallized early porno scene industry pleasure does much same but without lot bravado drugs it feels very intimate as though it were something that happened writer it captures tensity live sex scene very well you can even sense nerves crew as they do their best make girls feel everything is professional by book however it does get into hardcore scenes even beyond that at times too far beyond it surreal nature rough scene blurring lines what is performative art what is bordering sexual abuse rape only girls willingness go through with it makes act forgivable at all i am not fan hardcore porn this film doesnt glorify it much opposite its important film pretty much everyone see especially younger generation that has been consuming porn entire lives via internet my only complaint would be that i think some cinematic scenes could have been edited down quite bit movie had few pacing issues although it didnt really matter it just felt little weirdly structured i mean honestly film is 8 me i am really really picky oi found film be exceedingly entertaining i really loved wholesome acting linnea after seeing it there are alot takeaway feelings involved closing i think message film was just give us real glimpse adult entertainment world obviously industry is changing now pornstars sex workers are getting rid middle man producing their own content sites like onlyfans,0.4963671023965141,0.12972172707466825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8,The pleasure and the pain of porn,"I'm guessing that this movie got low ratings from many men because it wasn't the straightforward pornographic movie they were expecting. Though I'm sure some still managed to get sexual relief from watching this movie, most would have been turned off by this hard, gruesome look at the porn industry through the eyes of one woman. And that's because that is the intention of the movie: to get the viewer to see the true nature of the hidden process that leads to their sexual self-pleasuring product. Sadistic and aggressive porn is the most worrying, not least because it leads some men to believe such sex is the norm rather than a minority interest. Increasingly, porn degrades and devalues sexual love and pleasure - it's almost the opposite of eroticism. Comparing porn to eroticism is like comparing fast food to a 5-star gourmet meal.Anyone who is into porn but feels a growing unease about what they see should watch this movie and examine their own attitudes to visual depictions of sexual activity, to women, and to their own sexuality. Though porn can now be obtained free on the internet, it isn't free - it has a cost, and that cost is the potential corruption of your own sexual feelings and your attitudes to sex; as well as the exploitation of many women who are coerced and forced into making porn movies.The lead actress Sofia Kappel gives a stunning performance as a young girl trying to make it in the US porn industry, and the movie is well directed, skilfully edited, and has impressive production values.

Of course there are those who will say that viewers of porn are a large part of the problem. However, it is those who are actually in the porn industry who must bear the shame of the exploitation that obviously occurs there.This is not a bad movie by any means. But it was strange to me at least that the producers of the movie seemingly had little problem with showing the male actors in full naked detail while very largely keeping away from nudity among the female characters.I didn't mind the movie apart from the nastiness of some of think are called the ""Gonzo"" scenes depicted but it is not actually a movie that I'm ever very likely to seek out again.6/10 from me.",very difficult watch even anyone whos into porn,i am very open minded when it comes subject matter this movie i do agree with many others that sofia kappel was actually remarkably good this especially first timer although i have no personal problem with porn at all it is exploitation those such as bella character this movie that gives me cause concern course there are those who will say that viewers porn are large part problem however it is those who are actually porn industry who must bear shame exploitation that obviously occurs there this is not bad movie by any means but it was strange me at least that producers movie seemingly had little problem with showing male actors full naked detail while very largely keeping away nudity among female characters i didnt mind movie apart nastiness some think are called gonzo scenes depicted but it is not actually movie that im ever very likely seek out again 6 10 me,0.46222943722943716,0.06994047619047618,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.53, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8,Bold and brave about a difficult industry.,"I saw this movie on Gothenburg Film Festival. It was quite haussed in the media because of the subject.The story is shown thru the eyes of a young swedish woman, Bella, coming from a small town and now seeking fame, money and happiness in the american porn industry. It's a place where the men make the rules and Bella gets caught up in her search for fame. Where's her limits? What's she prepared to do?It is a complicated and graphic story and I think the main character is played well by the actress. She is talented and perfect for the role, with her insecurities and youth. She has an innocent face that can carry this difficult subject through out the movie.I felt sad watching this movie but that's because I think it's a sad world that's portrayed. The movie is important and well worth the time.",bold brave about difficult industry,i saw this movie gothenburg film festival it was quite haussed media because subject story is shown thru eyes young swedish woman bella coming small town now seeking fame money happiness american porn industry its place where men make rules bella gets caught up her search fame wheres her limits whats she prepared do it is complicated graphic story i think main character is played well by actress she is talented perfect role with her insecurities youth she has innocent face that can carry this difficult subject through out movie i felt sad watching this movie but thats because i think its sad world thats portrayed movie is important well worth time,0.6383333333333334,0.09583333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.4}"
5,I like submissive,"Bella Cherry (Sofia Kappel) leaves Sweden to come to LA to be an adult film star.

7,Pleasure,"This is the first movie I've seen from Ninja Thyberg.I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Yes, it has a lot of nudity, which is normal, but it doesn't have a lot of explicit things shown clearly, they're pretty much all implicit which takes your attention from the scene to the actress and her feelings.What I loved the most about the movie was the way they portraited the psychological aspect of pursuing a career in the adult industry. The huge pressure to just go out there and show herself, to grind everyday, not being sure if you're being scammed, if your colleagues are professional and serious or even how to take it to the next level.Apart from that, Sofia Kappel's voice is so magnetic and she has a good performance, keeping it simple but conveying the right message to the viewer. Things seem to go full circle and how dangerous it is to mix personal and work problems.I noticed some ""actors"" were playing themselves (e.g., Mark Spiegler, Aiden Starr and Axel Braun) so maybe they're actually members of the adult industry? Also, Chris Cock was born to play this role ehehOverall, I recommend you to see this movie and judge it by yourself.
