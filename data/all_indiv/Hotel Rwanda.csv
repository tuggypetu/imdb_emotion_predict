10.0,A fantastic and powerful film,"I was fortunate to see this film at the Toronto Film Festival. I had heard nothing about this film before I read up on it in the Fest guide and originally was going to see something else. But, the subway happened to shut down and I was not going to be able to see the film I originally intended. So, I decided to give this a try.And I am so very glad I did.This film is by far the best drama I have seen all year, and indeed was the best film of the 11 I saw at the festival. It is gripping, heart-wrenching, and opens your eyes to so many things. Don Cheadle -- who I am a long time admirer of his work -- is phenomenal in the lead role, and I hope that he is nominated for Best Actor this year, because he certainly deserves it.I am recommending this film to everybody I know and I hope that it gets a wide distribution because it certainly is a film that needs to be seen. While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda. It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated, because (as one character says) we will watch it on TV, say that it is terrible, and go right on eating our dinner. 10/10",fantastic powerful film,i was fortunate see this film at toronto film festival i had heard nothing about this film before i read up it fest guide originally was going see something else but subway happened shut down i was not going be able see film i originally intended so i decided give this try i am so very glad i did this film is by far best drama i have seen all year indeed was best film 11 i saw at festival it is gripping heart wrenching opens your eyes so many things don cheadle who i am long time admirer his work is phenomenal lead role i hope that he is nominated best actor this year because he certainly deserves it i am recommending this film everybody i know i hope that it gets wide distribution because it certainly is film that needs be seen while comparisons can be made schindlers list i think that this film goes further show that events like holocaust can happen any time even now so long as people look away just as un did rwanda it certainly makes one think about how easy it is us forget our history allow it be repeated because as one character says we will watch it tv say that it is terrible go right eating our dinner 10 10,0.6278888888888889,0.3042539682539683,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8.0,A brilliant movie that deserved a Best Picture Oscar-nomination,"At one point in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn't intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.The Rwandan genocide - that's what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide  also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.Terry George's film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, ""Hotel Rwanda"" contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since ""Schindler's List"" (1993). But whereas Spielberg's masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don't mean that pejoratively - George's film seems more immediate. Maybe it's because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren't doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives ""Hotel Rwanda"" a sense of urgency.As visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There's brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment's made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.Making a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.Cheadle carries the entire film. There isn't a false note in his performance. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. He's one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren't all that memorable. Here, he's in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul's frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That's why the moment's shattering.""Hotel Rwanda"" isn't flawless. George doesn't harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film's end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film's straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.I would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we're doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq's supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.I can only hope the success of ""Hotel Rwanda"" will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to.",brilliant movie that deserved best picture oscar nomination,at one point hotel rwanda our hero paul rusesabagina

,a great one,"I have no doubt that this is the only movie for the past year that can get me totally, if not 101%, emotionally involved. For other movies, I might be interacting with the story a lot , say associating my personal experiences with the characters, making judgment on them, criticizing the development of the story, ways of expression, the cinematography, acting, etc. BUT, Hotel Rwanda simply took me over as I was watching it. My emotion was going along with Paul ( Don Cheadle) all the time. The director did a great great job in capturing the feelings of people facing uncertainty, horror, ridicules, anger, death, waning faith... Family, life and dignity/integrity become the largest things in the situation. What's more is that it squarely shows the realist thinking in international politics.It honestly shows the weakness or helplessness of the UN and the non-governmental organizations. It truthfully tells how indifferent most of the international community (or individuals, which may or may not include you and me) are towards the deprivation of social justice taking place in other parts of the world. It makes you question to what extent that it is true to say what we see ( the sufferings in the world) is what we tolerate. It shows you how monstrous human being can be. It scares you how sanity would fail. At the same time, the uglier the people become, the more beautiful you find those who have managed to keep brave and maintain humanity. The movie fully succeeds in showing me the spirit, faith, and compassion that the world is dreaming for.",great one,i have no doubt that this is only movie past year that can get me totally if not 101 emotionally involved other movies i might be interacting with story lot say associating my personal experiences with characters making judgment them criticizing development story ways expression cinematography acting etc but hotel rwanda simply took me over as i was watching it my emotion was going along with paul don cheadle all time director did great great job capturing feelings people facing uncertainty horror ridicules anger death waning faith family life dignity integrity become largest things situation whats more is that it squarely shows realist thinking international politics it honestly shows weakness or helplessness un non governmental organizations it truthfully tells how indifferent most international community or individuals which may or may not include you me are towards deprivation social justice taking place other parts world it makes you question what extent that it is true say what we see sufferings world is what we tolerate it shows you how monstrous human being can be it scares you how sanity would fail at same time uglier people become more beautiful you find those who have managed keep brave maintain humanity movie fully succeeds showing me spirit faith compassion that world is dreaming,0.45531462585034016,0.21547619047619046,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Shaming and compelling,"Anything I say in this review is probably redundant, because there isn't a single negative review in all the comments so far here, and I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers.Nevertheless Hotel Rwanda is that rare kind of movie experience that doesn't easily relinquish its hold on the audience just because the credits have rolled. Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favour of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. The acting was flawless - Don Cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter, despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. The scenes which were hardest to watch in terms of tension and violence were often suffused with humour and hope.It's difficult sometimes to separate the significance of the true story, from the artistry of the product, and often I get impatient with 'worthy' movies scoring big at Oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought to be rewarded, whether or not they make good films. However, I can't recall being so profoundly moved by a film since I saw The Grey Zone, and I hope Hotel Rwanda gets all the plaudits it deserves.",shaming compelling,anything i say this review is probably redundant because there isnt single negative review all comments so far here i agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers nevertheless hotel rwanda is that rare kind movie experience that doesnt easily relinquish its hold audience just because credits have rolled watching with friend after ten minutes we had pause film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what basic facts conflict rwanda were so my shame we had read internet about what really happened before we could continue i say shame because we should have known both us were age when it happened have taken more interest world politics film is beautifully understated eschewing sentimentality favour raw emotion letting story tell itself acting was flawless don cheadles breathtaking performance being particular standout direction didnt falter despite all potential pitfalls dramatising recent horrific conflict scenes which were hardest watch terms tension violence were often suffused with humour hope its difficult sometimes separate significance true story artistry product often i get impatient with worthy movies scoring big at oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought be rewarded whether or not they make good films however i cant recall being so profoundly moved by film since i saw grey zone i hope hotel rwanda gets all plaudits it deserves,0.5952269952269954,0.1708929958929959,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,This year's Schindler's List,"I was fortunate to see it at the Toronto International Film Festival.Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle and was directed by Terry George. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali. When the war broke out he thought of only saving his immediate family but as he saw what was happening he opened the hotel to Tutsi and Hutus seeking refuge from the killing. He used all the favours he had stored as manager of the hotel and basically saved over a thousand lives. This will be the next Schindler's list. When the film was over, there was a standing ovation. Don Cheadle was excellent as an ordinary man forced to do extra-ordinary things. Paul Rusesabagina and his family attended the screening and he received a five minute standing ovation.

8.0,Extraordinary film based correctly on real deeds about the brutal genocide,"1994 Rwanda,Kigali. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu happily married (Sophie Okonedo) and with children .He's a Hotel manager -Millie Collines proprietary of Belgian Airlines : Sabena- and its General Director(Jean Reno) placed in Belgium. Paul is respected for his generosity , charm , friendship and numerous contacts with important people. He's accidentally trapped in violent events when his family and neighbours are threatened to be killed . He gets avoid it by means of bribes with the hope that United Nations (UN) and international forces arrive to preventing the civil war. However the happenings break out again . After assassination President of Rwanda, all get worse. It begins the horrible genocide including rampage , massacres and ravage in Rwanda which is spread along Burundi. Slaughter of Tusis by the Hutu is executed by soldiers and rebels. A journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) get into tumult and will shoot the events to show it all around the world. Paul gets to protect his family and unfortunate refugees at the hotel but others hapless people by the hundred are coming to ask for help. Meanwhile, the refugees Tutsis flee toward Congo to find shelter .The film has an acid critic to the indolence of United Nations (exception for Colonel incarnated by Nick Nolte) and international community and specially , the abandon of the European foreign policy .An interesting and thought-provoking film depicting terrible happenings and based on historical facts . Thus, a character tells that origin conflict is due to Belgians whom in colonization time differentiated the Tutsi as highest and more white complexion and co-governed united the country, now the Hutu are taking the vengeance. It's calculated in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by militia Interhamwe approximately one million people and in only three month. The bloody conflict finished in 1994 when the Tutsi throw out the Hutu army and militia through the frontier Congo. Leader of Interhamwe was condemned to maxim penalty. Don Cheadle's interpretation is magnificent , he was nominated to Academy Award , although wrongly didn't obtain it . The motion picture well directed by Terry George.

10.0,"Not surprisingly, you'll need to have some Kleenex nearby as you watch this film.","""Hotel Rwanda"" is an incredibly sad sort of film. After all, during 1994 between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were murdered--mostly Tutsis hacked to death due to an insane tribal rivalry with the more numerous Hutus. Genocide is not pleasant viewing. However, the film is a bit easier to watch than it could be, as most of the scenes of the slaughter are pretty tame. This isn't really a complaint--it doesn't deny the killings but it also doesn't show a lot of hacked off limbs and bodies (though there are quite a few of the latter). I appreciate how the MPAA changed their minds and re-rated the film PG-13 instead of R, as R would seem to imply that it's not a film for a wide audience. Folks should see this film.Instead of ""Hotel Rwanda"" showing the violence in a general fashion, it focuses on a very brave man. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) was the man who ran the swank Hotel Rwanda around the time of the genocide. In a very brave move, he opened the hotel to the Tutsi (who were being massacred) and created a tenuous safe haven. However, when the UN pulled out (as the UN did what it usually does in these situations...NOTHING!), Rusesabinga had to learn on the fly to work with the ruling powers, the mobs and the few remaining UN troops (though most had left). Rusesabinga managed to not only save his family (his wife was Tutsi and children half-Tutsi) but 1200 people through his heroics. The film shows the way he connived and begged and worked to make this possible in the midst of Hell.The film is a high quality and well made product. Not surprisingly it's on the IMDb Top 250 list and it also was nominated for three Oscars (including one for Cheadle who sure sounded African to my untrained ears). And, not surprisingly, it's an awfully tough film to watch. I don't recommend it for very young audiences but folks need to see this film and realize we have not come that far as a world. And, it's sad the film and other films about Rwanda during this period didn't come out until a decade after the massacres. It also makes you realize just how far from its original charter the UN has gone--it SHOULD have been able to take a stand against such evil.",not surprisingly youll need have some kleenex nearby as you watch this film,hotel rwanda is incredibly sad sort film after all during 1994 between 500 000 1 000 000 people were murdered mostly tutsis hacked death due insane tribal rivalry with more numerous hutus genocide is not pleasant viewing however film is bit easier watch than it could be as most scenes slaughter are pretty tame this isnt really complaint it doesnt deny killings but it also doesnt show lot hacked off limbs bodies though there are quite few latter i appreciate how mpaa changed their minds re rated film pg 13 instead r as r would seem imply that its not film wide audience folks should see this film instead hotel rwanda showing violence general fashion it focuses very brave man paul rusesabagina don cheadle was man who ran swank hotel rwanda around time genocide very brave move he opened hotel tutsi who were being massacred created tenuous safe haven however when un pulled out as un did what it usually does these situations nothing rusesabinga had learn fly work with ruling powers mobs few remaining un troops though most had left rusesabinga managed not only save his family his wife was tutsi children half tutsi but 1200 people through his heroics film shows way he connived begged worked make this possible midst hell film is high quality well made product not surprisingly its imdb top 250 list it also was nominated three oscars including one cheadle who sure sounded african my untrained ears not surprisingly its awfully tough film watch i dont recommend it very young audiences but folks need see this film realize we have not come that far as world its sad film other films about rwanda during this period didnt come out until decade after massacres it also makes you realize just how far its original charter un has gone it should have been able take stand against such evil,0.5862144702842376,0.034328165374677,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"

8.0,What were you doing in 1994?,"What were you doing in 1994? I was probably rockin to Soundgarden's latest album on my portable CD player, waiting for Seinfeld to come on while pondering the OJ Simpson murder case, the ""news of the century.""Meanwhile, as many as one million people were being butchered with machetes, raped and tortured by their fellow humans, as an entire nation collectively lost its mind.Suddenly Seinfeld ain't so funny.This film is epic, if for the sole reason that it brings to light a horrific chapter of human history that many of us would otherwise know nothing of. Let me repeat: as many as 1 million people (the population of North Dakota and Wyoming combined) were slaughtered, and the politicians of the western world did nothing to stop it, and the media never gave it 1/1000th as much air time as OJ. Yes, it is a disturbing film, but it focuses on the brave struggle of one individual in his efforts to save as many lives as possible. So it is also a very inspiring film.To be honest I was too engrossed in the story to be able to review this movie on technical merits such as acting, cinematography, musical score, etc. I believe that is the way to watch this film; it is not a film, it is an experience. A lesson. A reminder that, while we live our comfortable lives in 1080p HD Blu-Ray comfort, we have no clue what is going on with ""the other half"".I will say that every performance was very convincing, and several scenes could be called poetic if they weren't so disturbing (I'm referring to the river road in the fog... but you'll see what I mean). I was instantly pulled in by Don Cheadle as the ""everyman"" hero of the story, and I was equally intent on supporting cast members such as Nick Nolte whose character was based on Canadian general Dallaire (even though the real Dallaire was never consulted about this film).It's crazy, but you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this story is real, even though its plot is as preposterous as the craziest Hollywood fiction you've seen.This is a film I highly recommend to people who like to get involved. Whether you're a political activist, whether you volunteer walking dogs at your local animal shelter, or whether you blog about life in general, this is a film for you. Yes, it will upset you.

,An imperfect film but still a devastatingly emotional one that cries out to be seen (mild spoilers),"In 1994 tensions are high in Rwanda between the ruling Hutus and the Tutsis rebels while the UN tries to broken a peace agreement. This is of little interest to Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu with a Tutsis wife whose position within a leading hotel means he has to curry favour with many officials and smoothing over any potential problems at every turn. When the Hutu president is assassinated, a massacre of Tutsis begin  adults and children alike. With the UN unable to take action due to the indifference of the West the murders continue and Paul finds himself with a hotel, evacuated of important whites but full of Tutsis refugees as the Hutus seek to finish the job they started.I'm not entirely sure how one can review this film with a clear mind because no matter how good or bad a film it is, it is near impossible not to left shaken by the events it depicts. The plot follows the story of Paul Rusesabagina, who pulled all the strings he could to protect the Tutsis refugees who wound up in his hotel during the genocide by the Hutus. In this regard we are given a way into the atrocities through this specific story and this is both a strength and a weakness in the telling. The strength is that it gives us a focal point and a point of emotional connection that we can relate to and see a human face in the way that the terrifying numbers do not. However the downside of this is that it makes the story smaller than it could have been and puts the scale of atrocities outside of our direct view for the majority. It also means that it produces a ""happy"" ending that leaves you with a sense of some respite (not to mention the obligatory ""African"" song). This was a problem for me because the film had succeeded in gutting me at points and I didn't want to be left with any upbeat note  I wanted to go away feeling just like the foreign photographer did; ""f**king ashamed"".However considering what the film does well, it is petty and unfair to make a bit issue out of the fact that the narrative is occasionally a bit clunky and perhaps that the depiction of the genocide doesn't go far enough. Even without graphic violence and more than one scene of actual horror the film still sickened me to my stomach, had me almost shaking with anger and fear while at the same time failing to prevent tears rolling. Like many viewers I knew little more than a genocide occurred and couldn't have told you which side was killing the other  this is not ignorance on my behalf but just the fact that the West ignored this and stood by while it occurred while the media gave it little or no coverage. The film depicts this very well giving us enough horror and enough human emotion mixed with an understanding of the West's attitude to produce an impression of an event that is indefensible and truly, truly horrific. The characters are quite broadly painted but they do enough to give us an understanding of what occurred. While I do feel that the film could have shown more and been wider, the close focus on the hotel and the Rusesabagina's means that we are never far from understanding the true extent of horror and just how much of a reality death is  Paul does not discuss how his family will survive if the hotel is stormed, only how they will die in the least horrific way.Matching the tone of the film are two performances that blow away everyone they were nominated with at the 2005 Oscars. Cheadle's accent in Ocean's 11 was the worst cockney this side of Mary Poppins but here he gets the accent and mannerisms just right and made me forget that he was an American. His character changes throughout the film and he copes with it really well, producing a character that is easy to get behind and provides a very human face to the story. Okonedo is superb and is almost impossible to watch without being moved to tears more than once. Nolte is effectively gruff although he is less a character than he is a symbol of how ineffective the UN was at the time. In a similar vein Phoenix is excellent in a small role although really I could have done with a few less starry cameos as they tended to distract from the main material. Outside of the lead two, the actors are not given as much to work with as the lead two but Cheadle and Okonedo are superb and match the emotional impact of the material.Overall this is not a perfect film; it didn't quite go far enough and the focus on a small group tended to conceal the scale of the genocide. However this is a minor complaint because the film is devastatingly effective and is impossible to watch without feeling lost, helpless and utterly ashamed for our inaction. This is not an easy watch and will not be a fun night out for the audience but for many reasons it deserves as large an audience as possible.",imperfect film but still devastatingly emotional one that cries out be seen mild spoilers,1994 tensions are high rwanda between ruling hutus tutsis rebels while un tries broken peace agreement this is little interest paul rusesabagina hutu with tutsis wife whose position within leading hotel means he has curry favour with many officials smoothing over any potential problems at every turn when hutu president is assassinated massacre tutsis begin adults children alike with un unable take action due indifference west murders continue paul finds himself with hotel evacuated important whites but full tutsis refugees as hutus seek finish job they started im not entirely sure how one can review this film with clear mind because no matter how good or bad film it is it is near impossible not left shaken by events it depicts plot follows story paul rusesabagina who pulled all strings he could protect tutsis refugees who wound up his hotel during genocide by hutus this regard we are given way into atrocities through this specific story this is both strength weakness telling strength is that it gives us focal point point emotional connection that we can relate see human face way that terrifying numbers do not however downside this is that it makes story smaller than it could have been puts scale atrocities outside our direct view majority it also means that it produces happy ending that leaves you with sense some respite not mention obligatory african song this was problem me because film had succeeded gutting me at points i didnt want be left with any upbeat note i wanted go away feeling just like foreign photographer did f king ashamed however considering what film does well it is petty unfair make bit issue out fact that narrative is occasionally bit clunky perhaps that depiction genocide doesnt go far enough even without graphic violence more than one scene actual horror film still sickened me my stomach had me almost shaking with anger fear while at same time failing prevent tears rolling like many viewers i knew little more than genocide occurred couldnt have told you which side was killing other this is not ignorance my behalf but just fact that west ignored this stood by while it occurred while media gave it little or no coverage film depicts this very well giving us enough horror enough human emotion mixed with understanding wests attitude produce impression event that is indefensible truly truly horrific characters are quite broadly painted but they do enough give us understanding what occurred while i do feel that film could have shown more been wider close focus hotel rusesabaginas means that we are never far understanding true extent horror just how much reality death is paul does not discuss how his family will survive if hotel is stormed only how they will die least horrific way matching tone film are two performances that blow away everyone they were nominated with at 2005 oscars cheadles accent oceans 11 was worst cockney this side mary poppins but here he gets accent mannerisms just right made me forget that he was american his character changes throughout film he copes with it really well producing character that is easy get behind provides very human face story okonedo is superb is almost impossible watch without being moved tears more than once nolte is effectively gruff although he is less character than he is symbol how ineffective un was at time similar vein phoenix is excellent small role although really i could have done with few less starry cameos as they tended distract main material outside lead two actors are not given as much work with as lead two but cheadle okonedo are superb match emotional impact material overall this is not perfect film it didnt quite go far enough focus small group tended conceal scale genocide however this is minor complaint because film is devastatingly effective is impossible watch without feeling lost helpless utterly ashamed our inaction this is not easy watch will not be fun night out audience but many reasons it deserves as large audience as possible,0.5068266115970199,0.009370748299319732,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"

,"Indisputably a quality film, Hotel Rwanda is nevertheless a little more Hollywood than I thought it would be","The basic hurdle for the world to have more empathy with the macro issue of the horrendous massacre is the fact that the world is uninformed. Unlike the situation of Nazis and Jews, Irish Catholics and British Protestants or Crusade and Islam, the issue of Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda has not generally been heard of by an average citizen of the world. In the movie, the reporter asks two women at the bar in Hotel Rwanda what tribe they belong to. ""Hutu"" says one, and ""Tutsi"", the other. The reported turns around and comments to his companion ""They look like twins to me"". That says a lot.The film does educate us on the brief background of the local history, on how the Belgians used the Tutsi's to rule the Hutu and so since they left, the Hutu had been waiting for their chance to revenge. That is however just the bare backbone of the history, but we have not been brought to a deeper understanding of the bitter hatred that drove the Hutus to a diabolical genocide of a million Tutsi in 1994 as the world turned its back: ""the nations are united in their indifference towards Rwanda"" as Mr. Ebert aptly puts it.Rather than being an epic on macro scale, Hotel Rwanda is a personal story (albeit a true one) on micro scale, about hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina's heroic efforts which saved twelve hundred hotel ""guests"" of Tutsi descent, including his own wife. This is a story told with high quality filming and yet one cannot help but come away feeling that it leans slightly towards looking like a Hollywood thriller. It would be gross injustice to say it's crafted and yet, the climax after climax of narrow escape and cliffhanging suspense does feel a tad Hollywood. It would be gross injustice to say that it's a tearjerker and yet one cannot help feeling traces of familiarity in the Hollywood style emotional pull. And there is considerable predictability, such as the sudden bumpy ride of the jeep in the fog would be easily discerned by a regular moviegoer as the signal for the next scene: a road strewn with bodies of massacred victims.Oscar nominee Don Cheadle's performance as the circumstance-driven hero is deservedly recognized by the nomination. Nick Notle, who was wonderful in ""Clean"", puts in another great performance here as a similarly circumstance-driven hero in the U.N. peace keeping force Col. Oliver. The rest of the cast contributing to making this film a solid success includes Sophie Okonedo who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Pauls's wife Tatiana and Joaquin Phoenix as the reporter whose videotape of the massacre made the world pay attention. All told, Hotel Rwanda is a high-quality movie, but I can't agree with many comments hailing Hotel Rwanda as another Schindler's List.",indisputably quality film hotel rwanda is nevertheless little more hollywood than i thought it would be,basic hurdle world have more empathy with macro issue horrendous massacre is fact that world is uninformed unlike situation nazis jews irish catholics british protestants or crusade islam issue tutsi hutu rwanda has not generally been heard by average citizen world movie reporter asks two women at bar hotel rwanda what tribe they belong hutu says one tutsi other reported turns around comments his companion they look like twins me that says lot film does educate us brief background local history how belgians used tutsis rule hutu so since they left hutu had been waiting their chance revenge that is however just bare backbone history but we have not been brought deeper understanding bitter hatred that drove hutus diabolical genocide million tutsi 1994 as world turned its back nations are united their indifference towards rwanda as mr ebert aptly puts it rather than being epic macro scale hotel rwanda is personal story albeit true one micro scale about hotel manager paul rusesabaginas heroic efforts which saved twelve hundred hotel guests tutsi descent including his own wife this is story told with high quality filming yet one cannot help but come away feeling that it leans slightly towards looking like hollywood thriller it would be gross injustice say its crafted yet climax after climax narrow escape cliffhanging suspense does feel tad hollywood it would be gross injustice say that its tearjerker yet one cannot help feeling traces familiarity hollywood style emotional pull there is considerable predictability such as sudden bumpy ride jeep fog would be easily discerned by regular moviegoer as signal next scene road strewn with bodies massacred victims oscar nominee don cheadles performance as circumstance driven hero is deservedly recognized by nomination nick notle who was wonderful clean puts another great performance here as similarly circumstance driven hero u n peace keeping force col oliver rest cast contributing making this film solid success includes sophie okonedo who was nominated best supporting actress as paulss wife tatiana joaquin phoenix as reporter whose videotape massacre made world pay attention all told hotel rwanda is high quality movie but i cant agree with many comments hailing hotel rwanda as another schindlers list,0.38930828861061423,0.17478682170542637,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,I heard Paul Rusesabagina speak at Lewis & Clark College.,"""Hotel Rwanda"" recreates the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in the same way that ""Schindler's List"" recreated the genocide against the Jews. The movie shows not only the massacre, but also how the international community did nothing to stop it. Hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) sheltered several Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the Mille Collines hotel, saving them from getting murdered.Right after I saw the movie, I attended a speech by the real Paul Rusesabagina at Lewis & Clark College. He explained how the Belgian colonization of Rwanda set the stage for the 1994 genocide (the Belgians put the minority Tutsis in power, completely disenfranchising the majority Hutus), and what it was like for him experiencing it. As for why specifically the international community did nothing to stop the massacre, Rusesabagina said (as a mild joke): ""Maybe it's because Rwanda doesn't have oil."" Anyway, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a very powerful movie that reminds us not only of this specific event, but about what can happen if we forget the past.

10.0,A document for humanity,"The madness one sees in this brilliant film is hard to imagine, yet it occurred in Rwanda. Terry George, the director, captures those terrible days in Rwanda in his film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Mr. George has to be commended for bringing to the screen a detailed account of a country in chaos. Working with Keir Pearson on the screen play, the director presents us with the horrors of what the country lived during the holocaust that befell Rwanda.At the center of the story is Paul Rusesabagina, a courageous man who witnessed first hand the worst days of the Hutu rebellion and its bloody aftermath. This man alone was able to protect and to save more than a thousand Rwandans that clearly would not be around today, had it not been for his tremendous stand against people that showed no mercy, or wouldn't reason about what they were doing to their fellow citizens.The performance of Don Cheadle, as Paul Rusesabagina, is worth the price of admission! This wonderful actor projects such an intelligence that it's hard to find in any American film released in 2004. Mr. Cheadle was right to portray this man; it was a role he was born to play. Mr. Cheadle got under the skin of the hotel manager and runs away with the film. It's hard to keep ones eyes from this commanding performance.The rest of the mostly black cast is excellent. One must single out Sophie Okoneko, who plays Paul's wife with such dignity that she perfectly matches Mr. Cheadle's performance. Nick Nolte is fine as the UN Colonel trying to keep peace in a place gone mad.Congratulations to Mr. George. With this film he touches us in more ways than we imagined. The unfortunate tragedy could well have been avoided if the international community would have intervened sooner, but obviously, it didn't even try until it was too late.",document humanity,madness one sees this brilliant film is hard imagine yet it occurred rwanda terry george director captures those terrible days rwanda his film hotel rwanda mr george has be commended bringing screen detailed account country chaos working with keir pearson screen play director presents us with horrors what country lived during holocaust that befell rwanda at center story is paul rusesabagina courageous man who witnessed first hand worst days hutu rebellion its bloody aftermath this man alone was able protect save more than thousand rwandans that clearly would not be around today had it not been his tremendous stand against people that showed no mercy or wouldnt reason about what they were doing their fellow citizens performance don cheadle as paul rusesabagina is worth price admission this wonderful actor projects such intelligence that its hard find any american film released 2004 mr cheadle was right portray this man it was role he was born play mr cheadle got under skin hotel manager runs away with film its hard keep ones eyes this commanding performance rest mostly black cast is excellent one must single out sophie okoneko who plays pauls wife with such dignity that she perfectly matches mr cheadles performance nick nolte is fine as un colonel trying keep peace place gone mad congratulations mr george with this film he touches us more ways than we imagined unfortunate tragedy could well have been avoided if international community would have intervened sooner but obviously it didnt even try until it was too late,0.6000000000000001,0.06605222734254994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,Movie with a message,"Like most ethnic conflicts around the world, the divisions in Rwanda between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis have long antecedents, in this case the invasion of the Rwanda highlands by the Tutsis from Ethiopia in the 15th century. However, it was Belgium - who ruled the country under a UN mandate from 1918 to 1961 - who institutionalised the discrimination by favouring Tutsis and introducing identity cards which specified the holders ethnic group. The spark which lit the tinder was the shooting down of the aircraft carrying the Hutu President on 6 April 1994. In the next 100 days, there was a ferocious outbreak of genocide orchestrated by the Interahamwe militia and sanctioned by the Hutu government in which around 800,000 mostly Tutsis were massacred while the world community failed to intervene. A decade later, a kind of collective guilt sees the release of no less than four films about these events, the most high profile being ""Hotel Rwanda"" which garnered three Academy Award nominations.Portraying death on this scale in a work of 'entertainment' almost demands that we observe the savagery through the prism of selected individuals and, in this case, Irish writer and director Terry George has chosen to use the real-life experience of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina and his family. Rwanda is often called 'Le pays des Milles Collines' (the Land of a Thousand Hills) and Paul worked at the Sabena-owned Hotel des Mille Collines, a four-star establishment in the capital of Kigali. A well-educated Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi and had three young children, so he was geographically and ethnically at the heart of the madness. Like a kind of Oskar Schindler, he used a mixture of simple bribery and his sharp wits, together with charm and even obsequiousness, to create a haven in the horror that enabled 1,268 mainly Tutsis to survive.America actor Don Cheadle, who played a cockney fool in ""Ocean's Eleven"" & ""Ocean's Twelve"", gives a powerful and textured performance here which marks him out as someone who is going to become an A-list star, while able British actress Sophie Okonedo is his wife Tatiana (Tutsis are lighter-skinned and finer-featured), and it is such a change to see the leading roles in a movie taken by black actors. The fear and powerlessness of the hotel occupants - over a thousand men, women and children crammed into a 113-room establishment - is well created and sustained. The settings are very realistic, being largely shot in Johannesburg, and most of the technical and support crew were African. The focus of the action is the hotel itself and the violence is deliberately understated and left largely to the imagination.While one does not wish to see killing portrayed gratuitously, this artistic decision runs the risk that a largely ignorant western audience fails to appreciate the true nature and scale of this machete-fuelled rampage of rape and murder but, this reservation aside, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an important and worthy work that should serve as a political warning of the price of international inaction in the face of ethnic conflict. Paul Rusesabagina, now lives in Belgium with his family, and recently told the US ""People"" magazine: ""What happened in Rwanada is now happening in Darfur, in the Congo, in all of these places they are butchering innocent civilians. It is high time we know that a human life in Africa is as important as a human life in the west.""",movie with message,like most ethnic conflicts around world divisions rwanda between majority hutus minority tutsis have long antecedents this case invasion rwanda highlands by tutsis ethiopia 15th century however it was belgium who ruled country under un mandate 1918 1961 who institutionalised discrimination by favouring tutsis introducing identity cards which specified holders ethnic group spark which lit tinder was shooting down aircraft carrying hutu president 6 april 1994 next 100 days there was ferocious outbreak genocide orchestrated by interahamwe militia sanctioned by hutu government which around 800 000 mostly tutsis were massacred while world community failed intervene decade later kind collective guilt sees release no less than four films about these events most high profile being hotel rwanda which garnered three academy award nominations portraying death this scale work entertainment almost demands that we observe savagery through prism selected individuals this case irish writer director terry george has chosen use real life experience hotel manager paul rusesabagina his family rwanda is often called le pays des milles collines land thousand hills paul worked at sabena owned hotel des mille collines four star establishment capital kigali well educated hutu he was married tutsi had three young children so he was geographically ethnically at heart madness like kind oskar schindler he used mixture simple bribery his sharp wits together with charm even obsequiousness create haven horror that enabled 1 268 mainly tutsis survive america actor don cheadle who played cockney fool oceans eleven oceans twelve gives powerful textured performance here which marks him out as someone who is going become list star while able british actress sophie okonedo is his wife tatiana tutsis are lighter skinned finer featured it is such change see leading roles movie taken by black actors fear powerlessness hotel occupants over thousand men women children crammed into 113 room establishment is well created sustained settings are very realistic being largely shot johannesburg most technical support crew were african focus action is hotel itself violence is deliberately understated left largely imagination while one does not wish see killing portrayed gratuitously this artistic decision runs risk that largely ignorant western audience fails appreciate true nature scale this machete fuelled rampage rape murder but this reservation aside hotel rwanda is important worthy work that should serve as political warning price international inaction face ethnic conflict paul rusesabagina now lives belgium with his family recently told us people magazine what happened rwanada is now happening darfur congo all these places they are butchering innocent civilians it is high time we know that human life africa is as important as human life west,0.4132655423280424,0.13331183862433862,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.47}"
,Very good....,"A searing indictment of the West's complete refusal to do Anything 11 years ago. When the Rwandan massacres began, it was like a dam burst-the Hutu president's plane is shot down, and the violence tore across that country for 100 days. I remember the news--500,000, 800,000, maybe up to a million people were butchered. We did Nothing. White people from away got out, and that was all. I have always been a Clinton fan but that was his worst moment, being too scared of committing to another Somalia to do so much as send in a single GI.So here you have the Hotel, a four-star swanky oasis during the genocide's, w/ Don Cheadle bribing every general or bigwig Hutu in sight to stay alive, stay in business, and keep the huddled Tutsis inside alive for yet another day, a week, month, 'til freedom finally comes at the end. Cheadle is incredible in this. He deserved an Oscar.It's played very much as a Schindler's List goes Africa, from the point of view of the Hotel. You wind up only seeing the violence here, here, and there, whenever the sea of war hits the Hotel itself before moving on again.The most jarring scenes--the van load of Tutsi's surrounded by militia in the street, w/ a desperate Cheadle bribing them to their freedom, the 'bumpy road' which turns out to be acres of bodies lying hacked to death as far's the eye can see, and of course the separation from his wife.

8.0,Excellent and emotionally devastating,"""Hotel Rwanda"" gives a first-hand account of the genocide that occurred between the two main tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of a luxury hotel in the area that caters to the wealthy and to government figures. Outside of the gates of the resort, Tutsis are being killed by the Hutu militia, and though Paul (a Hutu) is married to Tatiana (Okonedo) (a Tutsi) for the sake of his family, he turns a blind eye until his in-laws disappear and the militia literally come to his doorstep demanding his cooperation and the surrender of his wife, children and neighbors. With the diplomacy that he has learned in his job he is able to barter with them, basically paying a great deal of money for the lives of his family and neighbors. Meanwhile, Col. Oliver (Nolte), who is with the United Nations, is trying to help the refugees and keep some semblance of order, but is forced to evacuate only the Caucasian residents of the hotel, leaving all of the Rwandans (both Tutsi and Hutus that are Tutsi sympathizers) to fend for themselves, which leads Paul to open the hotel to over 1,000 Tutsi refugees. There they try desperately to get out of the country, and ultimately, survive since the Hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well.From about fifteen minutes into ""Hotel Rwanda"", I was pretty upset, and that feeling didn't go away once. Don Cheadle is incredibly good as a conflicted hero. Many comparisons have been made between this film and ""Schindler's List"", but if there is a way to rate levels of heroship, Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed in the film is pretty high up there. He is repeatedly given the chance to escape unharmed, but never gives in, a big turnaround from the beginning of the film when he first turned a blind eye, then became a reluctant hero. Cheadle captures this complicated figure brilliantly. It's not just the superficial coups that he achieves (flawless accent, etc.) it is the subtle strength he gives the character. His character may not be a beloved singer or a good impersonation of someone, but the strength of his performance should have given him an Oscar, not just a nomination. (Though I am glad that he at least got that much.) This is the first film that I have seen Sophie Okonedo act in, and she also extremely good. She quickly shows that she is more than a pretty face, and her strength and mettle are admirable, while experiencing the worst atrocities first hand.As a film, ""Hotel Rwanda"" was not manipulative emotional. Under Terry George's direction, it felt at times like a documentary because it was truly an unblinking look at a terrible and shameful time in history. Though I had heard about the genocide, I was not fully aware of the ""reasons"" for the war, and as completely ridiculous as they were, the film is excellent at providing us a lesson in recent history without commentary. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty level look at the conflict and while it was incredibly emotional, it was not preachy. While I mention that it had an almost documentary feel to it, which is not to say that there were dramatic moments. One moment in particular where I literally felt like I was going to be sick was when Paul (in what was probably his defining moment) encounters literally hundreds of dead bodies on a road that he and one of his hotel employees are traveling. Having said that, however, even a moment like this one was managed with care and subtlety by George.I was telling some co-workers about the film and its emotional impact and a couple of them who hadn't seen it went, ""Gee  that sounds too depressing for me"". ""Hotel Rwanda"" is certainly not a cheerful film, it is a film about a conflict that ended the lives of one million people in a matter of months while most of the world turned a blind eye. But it amazingly ends on a note that did not make me want to find the nearest closed garage and turn on the car, and left me with a newly found understanding of something I had only heard about and until Saturday night, knew nothing about. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is not an easy film to watch, but it is really and truly an excellent film that should be seen, both for its impactful storytelling and for its command performances. 8/10 --Shelly",excellent emotionally devastating,hotel rwanda gives first hand account genocide that occurred between two main tribes rwanda hutus tutsis paul rusesabagina cheadle is manager luxury hotel area that caters wealthy government figures outside gates resort tutsis are being killed by hutu militia though paul hutu is married tatiana okonedo tutsi sake his family he turns blind eye until his laws disappear militia literally come his doorstep demanding his cooperation surrender his wife children neighbors with diplomacy that he has learned his job he is able barter with them basically paying great deal money lives his family neighbors meanwhile col oliver nolte who is with united nations is trying help refugees keep some semblance order but is forced evacuate only caucasian residents hotel leaving all rwandans both tutsi hutus that are tutsi sympathizers fend themselves which leads paul open hotel over 1 000 tutsi refugees there they try desperately get out country ultimately survive since hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well about fifteen minutes into hotel rwanda i was pretty upset that feeling didnt go away once don cheadle is incredibly good as conflicted hero many comparisons have been made between this film schindlers list but if there is way rate levels heroship paul rusesabagina as portrayed film is pretty high up there he is repeatedly given chance escape unharmed but never gives big turnaround beginning film when he first turned blind eye then became reluctant hero cheadle captures this complicated figure brilliantly its not just superficial coups that he achieves flawless accent etc it is subtle strength he gives character his character may not be beloved singer or good impersonation someone but strength his performance should have given him oscar not just nomination though i am glad that he at least got that much this is first film that i have seen sophie okonedo act she also extremely good she quickly shows that she is more than pretty face her strength mettle are admirable while experiencing worst atrocities first hand as film hotel rwanda was not manipulative emotional under terry georges direction it felt at times like documentary because it was truly unblinking look at terrible shameful time history though i had heard about genocide i was not fully aware reasons war as completely ridiculous as they were film is excellent at providing us lesson recent history without commentary as far as i can tell this is pretty level look at conflict while it was incredibly emotional it was not preachy while i mention that it had almost documentary feel it which is not say that there were dramatic moments one moment particular where i literally felt like i was going be sick was when paul what was probably his defining moment encounters literally hundreds dead bodies road that he one his hotel employees are traveling having said that however even moment like this one was managed with care subtlety by george i was telling some co workers about film its emotional impact couple them who hadnt seen it went gee that sounds too depressing me hotel rwanda is certainly not cheerful film it is film about conflict that ended lives one million people matter months while most world turned blind eye but it amazingly ends note that did not make me want find nearest closed garage turn car left me with newly found understanding something i had only heard about until saturday night knew nothing about hotel rwanda is not easy film watch but it is really truly excellent film that should be seen both its impactful storytelling its command performances 8 10 shelly,0.6244288806431662,0.09902968460111317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Probably the most important movie of 2004,"Hotel Rwanda (2004) Directed by Terry George, is the great film of 2004.Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, an African who has bought into the European ideal of the perfect life. He's the manager of a four-star hotel in Rwanda. He has a beautiful wife (played by Sophie Okonedo), handsome and healthy young children, a new vehicle, and a fine suburban home.All this changes when civil strife erupts in Rwanda. When this happens the former colonial powers wash their hands of the problems, and the Rwandans are left to fend for themselves in an atmosphere of increasing violence and anarchy.The acting is excellent and the story is emotionally gripping. Like Schindler's List, the film follows one man's attempt to save as many people as he can. Schindler and Rusesabagina were heroic, resourceful, and amazingly effective. However, as individuals, they could accomplish only so much. Outside intervention could have saved a million lives in Rwanda, but it was never forthcoming. The Rwandan genocide is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Hotel Rwanda brings this horror onto the screen and into our lives.Addendum: Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, the U.N. commander in Rwanda. This role is obviously based on Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian officer who commanded the ridiculously small force of 400 U.N. soldiers. These troops were unable to do anything more than watch the genocide taking place before their eyes.

8.0,Powerful,"'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie.First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons.In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George.Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope. There is one complaint (one that also counts for 'Schindler's List') I have here. The people in Rwanda were not speaking English as their main language, but they were definitely not speaking English with accents. Maybe it makes it more realistic for an English speaking audience, it does not for most others. Just let them speak their original language or normal English. You didn't see the people from 'Gladiator' speak English with a Latin accent either and it worked just fine.",powerful,hotel rwanda tells story hotel manager paul rusesabagina don cheadle who used his skills save over thousand people during terrible events that happened rwanda early nineties tutsis were slaughtered by hutus simply because they were tutsi while rest world was looking away way united nations acted here is portrayed by colonel oliver nick nolte only fictional person movie first we learn about way paul hutu handles things hotel he is good manager keeping important customers happy with little gifts they may come handy later his life we meet pauls wife tatiana sophie okonedo who is tutsi then massacre starts slowly more more people try hide hotel protected by just few un soldiers who are not allowed use their weapons more than one way i was reminded schindlers list schindler started save people only make money but ended up caring all them pauls reasons are less selfish than making money although at first he only wants save his own family with power he has paul also ends up caring every single soul he can save both men stood up against greater power with risk being killed schindlers list is better movie mostly because it was amazing how it told story about one man but gave us strong impression holocaust surrounding him hotel rwanda has some scenes that have that effect as well but overall it feels more movie that plays smaller scale course steven spielberg is also better director than terry george still movie is very powerful moving like i said there are scenes that are close unbelievable showing once again what mankind is able performances are helpful here especially cheadle does superb job showing smart man slowly losing hope there is one complaint one that also counts schindlers list i have here people rwanda were not speaking english as their main language but they were definitely not speaking english with accents maybe it makes it more realistic english speaking audience it does not most others just let them speak their original language or normal english you didnt see people gladiator speak english with latin accent either it worked just fine,0.5200467687074829,0.17298256802721082,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"
6.0,"Not bad, but definitely a disappointment","Sentimental dramas are not my thing, but after the good reviews that Hotel Rwanda has been winning itself; I figured it has to be worth a go, and it was; but that's all it's worth. For a film that's supposed to 'stay with you' and 'leave an impact'; Hotel Rwanda is a huge disappointment. There isn't much in this film that wouldn't be able to be took from a documentary on the subject of the plight of Rwanda; but it has to be said, in spite of this, that Hotel Rwanda balances it's story with the human drama rather well, as not too much time is ever spent on either. The film can easily be likened to a disaster movie, as it gives two sides of a story - one being a terrible happening and the other being the effect on the people involved. This likeness continues when you come to realise that the protagonists are totally uninvolving characters and the only reason that the film gives you for feeling for them is the fact that they're the leads. Hotel Rwanda will get praise from some people because it's based on a true story, but this film fan isn't as easily impressed as many evidently are.The film is very well put together, with the acting, direction and production values all being very classy examples of how good each can be. The story takes in themes of the futility of war, love for your fellow man and, of course, the race divide (another reason for the good critical reaction), and it has to be said that all of these things are done well, and even quite potent at times. The film is also notable for avoiding many of the pitfalls that befall most dramas of this nature - things such as over the top sentiment or long, heartfelt speeches. While the film definitely has an underbelly of sentiment, it never sees fit to fully expose it; and that is always a good thing in my opinion. The film is keen to give glimpses of it at it at times, however, and these moments tend to be cringe-worthy. The ending is a prime example of that; and despite the fact that this is based on a true story and that's simply 'how it ends'; the film could have handled it better, and then I wouldn't have left the cinema feeling like I'd just been slapped in the face after spending two hours of my time on the film.On the whole, Hotel Rwanda is a long shot away from being a 'bad' film; but it's not a great film either, and the lack of sympathy for the characters will make some people feel like they should have watched a straight documentary instead. Many have, and will continue to be seduced by the racism theme and the fact that it's based on a true story; but not me, and hopefully not you either, as there's more to a great film than just that.",not bad but definitely disappointment,sentimental dramas are not my thing but after good reviews that hotel rwanda has been winning itself i figured it has be worth go it was but thats all its worth film thats supposed stay with you leave impact hotel rwanda is huge disappointment there isnt much this film that wouldnt be able be took documentary subject plight rwanda but it has be said spite this that hotel rwanda balances its story with human drama rather well as not too much time is ever spent either film can easily be likened disaster movie as it gives two sides story one being terrible happening other being effect people involved this likeness continues when you come realise that protagonists are totally uninvolving characters only reason that film gives you feeling them is fact that theyre leads hotel rwanda will get praise some people because its based true story but this film fan isnt as easily impressed as many evidently are film is very well put together with acting direction production values all being very classy examples how good each can be story takes themes futility war love your fellow man course race divide another reason good critical reaction it has be said that all these things are done well even quite potent at times film is also notable avoiding many pitfalls that befall most dramas this nature things such as over top sentiment or long heartfelt speeches while film definitely has underbelly sentiment it never sees fit fully expose it that is always good thing my opinion film is keen give glimpses it at it at times however these moments tend be cringe worthy ending is prime example that despite fact that this is based true story thats simply how it ends film could have handled it better then i wouldnt have left cinema feeling like id just been slapped face after spending two hours my time film whole hotel rwanda is long shot away being bad film but its not great film either lack sympathy characters will make some people feel like they should have watched straight documentary instead many have will continue be seduced by racism theme fact that its based true story but not me hopefully not you either as theres more great film than just that,0.5199507389162561,0.19836206896551722,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,One of the Most Moving Pictures Ever!,"For a while now, there have been uprisings in Africa, most of the time, it is quite violent. In Tears of the Sun starring Bruce Willis, the problem in Nigeria was put into perspective. It was shown through the eyes of the US military trying to rescue a couple of select people but end up bringing back refugees. Hotel Rwanda takes a different path, shown through the eyes of those under attack.Hotel Rwanda is based on a true story out of Rwanda, Africa. It is a country gripped by war and oppression. When a four-star hotel is now thrown right into the mix of things, manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) has to make a very important decision. He must decide whether or not to let Tutsi's live in his hotel to take refuge from the Hutu soldiers.The problem is that the Hutu's, a tribe of Africans in Rwanda, are taking control and want to exterminate the Tutsis, a rival tribe. This hostile take over is one that spreads all over Paul's town. One night over a radio broadcast, the Hutu militia's leader told all of his soldiers to find and eliminate the Tutsis. Now, Paul, his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi, and their children must stay in the hotel and watch over all of the ""new guests"". With Paul paying off the leader of the Hutu militia, General Bizimungu, he tries to keep his hotel out of harms way.When he runs out of ideas and aid from the General and from the United Nations, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), and the media, he must defend his hotel by finding a way to get those refugees out of there and keep his family safe at the same time. Paul is faced with heart breaking decisions and must stay strong so he doesn't show weakness or give up the Tutsis.Cheadle's performance is breathtaking. When everything seems to be coming apart and he might lose it, he has to hold it together. Cheadle's character sees things that shouldn't be seen by anyone. So much death and destruction in one area can have an impact on a man. With scenes that are similar to Schindler's List, this movie is powerful and really shows how little people have known about the crisis in Rwanda.Hotel Rwanda was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor (Cheadle), Best Supporting Actress (Okonedo), and Best Original Screenplay. Although it didn't win, the movies message was carried across and brought attention to the devastation in Africa.Hotel Rwanda is a masterpiece and is one of the most moving films of all time.

,"""Schindler's List"" meets ""The Killing Fields"" by way of ""Casablanca"" ; Cheadle's triumphant career best","HOTEL RWANDA (2004) **** Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix. (Dir: Terry George)""Schindler's List"" meets ""The Killing Fields"" by way of ""Casablanca"" ; Cheadle's triumphant career bestWhat would you do if suddenly you found yourself in the oncoming path of a genocide? That is the question that South African Paul Rusesabagina faced ten years ago when the Hutu militia hunted down its Tutsi citizens determined to wipe out these 'cockroaches'.Rusesabagina (played beautifully by Cheadle who deserves an Oscar nomination) is a mild-mannered yet savvy businessman who works as a hotel manager in Rwanda in 1994 who has put on blinders to the unrest in his nation that suddenly sets its all-too-true reality in his neighborhood one night when he witnesses one of his neighbors being dragged bodily from his home by a jeep of Army soldiers and then beaten when he resists. Life as he knows it is now over as this is the tip of iceberg to what events lay in wait.Determined to save his small neighborhood and his family l Rusesabagina maneuvers one of the hotel's van shuttles crammed with his friends and family to the Hotel Demille where he works as a refugee site. Shortly thereafter the hotel is inundated with scores of fleeing Tutsis seeking solace and Paul must then decide what can be done to keep the bloodshed at bay. On hand is the UN soldiers led by Canadian Col. Oliver (a world-weary Nolte doing some fine supporting work) who informs Paul that things are only getting worse for the most part and as predicted the black South Africans will not be rescued leaving the ingenuity and quick thinking of Paul to keep things on track until they manage a form of escape.Director Terry George racks up the suspense and dread without resorting to any truly graphic images of the war at hand and the uprisings depict the machete brandishing hordes at a safe distance yet there is no doubt of just how horrific the proceedings at hand are in some truly unnerving moments including Paul's decision to get supplies in the dead of night when he encounters what he fears the most  that things in fact are only worse than he could have ever imagined.Cheadle, one of our finest and most versatile actors working today, gives his portrayal of a decent, ordinary and extraordinary man that many of us would only aspire to be in the face of death and the threat of violence so thick in the air it would more than likely only cause paralysis to contemplate a next move in a morbid game of chess  a dignity that encompasses the entire film and spread to his co-stars, namely the stoic Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana who also provides some soul and tenderness yet a stern anger fueled turn. Inevitably there are comparisons to ""Schindler's List"", ""The Killing Fields"" and even ""Casablanca"" yet the film stands alone in its defiance to what mob mentality is about and how prejudice is much deeper than what is on the surface. This is one of the most inspiring, harrowing journeys into fear and is one of the year's very best.",schindlers list meets killing fields by way casablanca cheadles triumphant career best,hotel rwanda 2004 don cheadle sophie okonedo nick nolte joaquin phoenix dir terry george schindlers list meets killing fields by way casablanca cheadles triumphant career bestwhat would you do if suddenly you found yourself oncoming path genocide that is question that south african paul rusesabagina faced ten years ago when hutu militia hunted down its tutsi citizens determined wipe out these cockroaches rusesabagina played beautifully by cheadle who deserves oscar nomination is mild mannered yet savvy businessman who works as hotel manager rwanda 1994 who has put blinders unrest his nation that suddenly sets its all too true reality his neighborhood one night when he witnesses one his neighbors being dragged bodily his home by jeep army soldiers then beaten when he resists life as he knows it is now over as this is tip iceberg what events lay wait determined save his small neighborhood his family l rusesabagina maneuvers one hotels van shuttles crammed with his friends family hotel demille where he works as refugee site shortly thereafter hotel is inundated with scores fleeing tutsis seeking solace paul must then decide what can be done keep bloodshed at bay hand is un soldiers led by canadian col oliver world weary nolte doing some fine supporting work who informs paul that things are only getting worse most part as predicted black south africans will not be rescued leaving ingenuity quick thinking paul keep things track until they manage form escape director terry george racks up suspense dread without resorting any truly graphic images war at hand uprisings depict machete brandishing hordes at safe distance yet there is no doubt just how horrific proceedings at hand are some truly unnerving moments including pauls decision get supplies dead night when he encounters what he fears most that things fact are only worse than he could have ever imagined cheadle one our finest most versatile actors working today gives his portrayal decent ordinary extraordinary man that many us would only aspire be face death threat violence so thick air it would more than likely only cause paralysis contemplate next move morbid game chess dignity that encompasses entire film spread his co stars namely stoic okonedo as pauls wife tatiana who also provides some soul tenderness yet stern anger fueled turn inevitably there are comparisons schindlers list killing fields even casablanca yet film stands alone its defiance what mob mentality is about how prejudice is much deeper than what is surface this is one most inspiring harrowing journeys into fear is one years very best,0.5373086419753086,0.11135802469135804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,Making a film and a contribution to humanity,"I usually say my criteria for assessing a film are asking myself if it inspired, educated or entertained me. I somehow don't seem to have a category for 'it totally devastated me'.Nearly all the main characters are based on real life people  very real. One of the problems we have in coming to terms with the ethnic destruction of a peoples we have no knowledge of, have little culturally in common with, have little to identify them as 'people' other than a biological acknowledgement is that, for us, they are not very 'real'. So is the point of a film about the Rwandan genocide that left a million dead that they become more real? Does that make any difference? One of the results of going to see this very powerful, very harrowing (and in terms of the personal integrity and bravery of some central characters, very beautiful) film is that part of the proceeds go towards helping the people who are left. Another, perhaps, is that by becoming more aware of suffering our desire to find a way to avoid or alleviate it increases. The film shows a divide between - on one hand - the Rwandan people who, rich or poor, had sensibilities much like you or I, - and on the other hand - the troglodytes that wanted to kill each other and (with a logic reminiscent of President Bush's ""if you're not with us you're against us"" simplistic attitude) anyone who didn't join them. The inclusiveness of the carnage and the inability (or unwillingness) of the West to help meant there was no get out along the lines of 'if they want to kill each other let them'.The performances are so spellbinding that it is hard to watch the film without feeling the suffering of those involved. Although it points the finger at a reluctance of the West to get involved, we also have to ask ourselves that, even if the powerful governments or the UN were willing to get involved, could the carnage have been prevented? The lack of any well-structured hint at a potential solution is perhaps one of the (very few) flaws of the film. Similarly, the swiftness of some of the events makes historic sense but there is not always enough detail to explain why things happened the way they did. But it seems clear that some intervention could have at least reduced a large amount of the carnage, so in a way Hotel Rwanda is a protest against international apathy.The official website of the movie provides much in the way of reference material, links and analysis. This helped to confirm my view while watching the film that those involved felt that there was something more at stake than being film stars. In doing so they have become true stars, irrespective of what awards were won or not.",making film contribution humanity,i usually say my criteria assessing film are asking myself if it inspired educated or entertained me i somehow dont seem have category it totally devastated me nearly all main characters are based real life people very real one problems we have coming terms with ethnic destruction peoples we have no knowledge have little culturally common with have little identify them as people other than biological acknowledgement is that us they are not very real so is point film about rwandan genocide that left million dead that they become more real does that make any difference one results going see this very powerful very harrowing terms personal integrity bravery some central characters very beautiful film is that part proceeds go towards helping people who are left another perhaps is that by becoming more aware suffering our desire find way avoid or alleviate it increases film shows divide between one hand rwandan people who rich or poor had sensibilities much like you or i other hand troglodytes that wanted kill each other with logic reminiscent president bushs if youre not with us youre against us simplistic attitude anyone who didnt join them inclusiveness carnage inability or unwillingness west help meant there was no get out along lines if they want kill each other let them performances are so spellbinding that it is hard watch film without feeling suffering those involved although it points finger at reluctance west get involved we also have ask ourselves that even if powerful governments or un were willing get involved could carnage have been prevented lack any well structured hint at potential solution is perhaps one very few flaws film similarly swiftness some events makes historic sense but there is not always enough detail explain why things happened way they did but it seems clear that some intervention could have at least reduced large amount carnage so way hotel rwanda is protest against international apathy official website movie provides much way reference material links analysis this helped confirm my view while watching film that those involved felt that there was something more at stake than being film stars doing so they have become true stars irrespective what awards were won or not,0.44122710622710604,0.06919920505026889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.46}"
