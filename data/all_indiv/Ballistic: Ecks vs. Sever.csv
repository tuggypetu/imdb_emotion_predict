,"It blowed stuff up, and blowed up more","Let's be honest with ourselves for a moment. In a movie like this, the producers don't pay expensive actors to act or to create realistic performances or to use their talents to win our sympathy. No, they pay these actors for face and name recognition, so when a movie like Ballistic: Banderas vs Liu comes along we don't have the inconvenience of learning about characters and plot. Hell, we don't even have the inconvenience of wondering, ""Is this actor hot while all this excitement rushes them by?"" Name recognition, baby, it's all marketed by name recognition.And why should they let actors acting take up precious moments from the rooftop chases, the explosions, the gunfire, and posing like models? Everyone already knows these actors right? No need to develop anything more than flimsy excuses for action/motivation, right? Sarcasm aside - I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I think Ballistic would have been a better, more sophisticated, film if they scrapped the plot and cliché character developments and just went for 90 minutes of uninterrupted Banderas and Liu gunning at each other backdropped by a slow-mo explosions.This film would have to scale a cliff before reaching the level of plot intricacies and intelligence that just thrive in Michael Bay films.We get a crappy plot and crappy characterizations anyway just in case we don't have a favorite actor to root for. We get ultra cliché scenarios that anyone who has been to a theatre in the last fifty years will pick up on. Oh no, a child's been kidnapped  we're supposed to sympathize with the boy. There's the old (young?) has-been former cop (FBI guy in this movie) who lost his motivation  we're supposed to sympathize with him and the loss of his family. And then there's--oh, but wait? What are these plot revelations? What are they pointing towards? Gasp! They're making the already obvious villain even more obvious! Me? I was rooting for the aliens from Independence Day to come down and blow them all up, but the bastards got stuck in traffic.Somewhere in the movie is a subplot about a nano-assassin, but I cared about that as much as the movie does.And since we're being honest, I admit this is a great film to watch after a night of provocative and cultured cinema to recalibrate your personal scale to the realities of the industry. Like I explained to the guy at Blockbuster, ""I just got a box-set of Hitchcock, been watching those back to back, and the other day I watched De Palma's Femme Fatale. I need something trashy before I become a full-blown film snob."" So I walked out with Ballistic and Shark Attack 3, went home, and turned off my mind for a marathon of stock footage and needless gunfire/explosions . . . and all was well.",it blowed stuff up blowed up more,lets be honest with ourselves moment movie like this producers dont pay expensive actors act or create realistic performances or use their talents win our sympathy no they pay these actors face name recognition so when movie like ballistic banderas vs liu comes along we dont have inconvenience learning about characters plot hell we dont even have inconvenience wondering is this actor hot while all this excitement rushes them by name recognition baby its all marketed by name recognition why should they let actors acting take up precious moments rooftop chases explosions gunfire posing like models everyone already knows these actors right no need develop anything more than flimsy excuses action motivation right sarcasm aside i never thought id hear myself say this but i think ballistic would have been better more sophisticated film if they scrapped plot clich character developments just went 90 minutes uninterrupted banderas liu gunning at each other backdropped by slow mo explosions this film would have scale cliff before reaching level plot intricacies intelligence that just thrive michael bay films we get crappy plot crappy characterizations anyway just case we dont have favorite actor root we get ultra clich scenarios that anyone who has been theatre last fifty years will pick up oh no childs been kidnapped were supposed sympathize with boy theres old young has been former cop fbi guy this movie who lost his motivation were supposed sympathize with him loss his family then theres oh but wait what are these plot revelations what are they pointing towards gasp theyre making already obvious villain even more obvious me i was rooting aliens independence day come down blow them all up but bastards got stuck traffic somewhere movie is subplot about nano assassin but i cared about that as much as movie does since were being honest i admit this is great film watch after night provocative cultured cinema recalibrate your personal scale realities industry like i explained guy at blockbuster i just got box set hitchcock been watching those back back other day i watched de palmas femme fatale i need something trashy before i become full blown film snob so i walked out with ballistic shark attack 3 went home turned off my mind marathon stock footage needless gunfire explosions all was well,0.4627865961199295,0.19257054673721336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"

Rumor has it that the film makers know a thing about movie making. I know the cast does, but what wanders across the screen looks like the dailies of a really bad TV commercial put together by someone with no sense of film structure. I'm told that this has something to do with two assassins fighting each other after some one is kidnapped, but I'm not certain since things just sort of happen for no real reason. I would like to think that this movie was a big joke on the movie going public but no one would want to spend what it cost to make this movie as a joke, especially when there was no hope of ever getting the money back in ten thousand life times.

,absurdly bad espionage thriller,"`Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever' has been saddled with not only one of the worst movie titles in recent memory, but one of the worst screenplays as well. The film's third-rate espionage plot makes no sense at all and serves basically as a lame excuse for endless explosions, shootouts and double-flipping car chases, which have become the standard accoutrements for virtually every action picture since `Bullitt' in 1968. The problem with `Ballistic' is that the viewer can never tell who is doing what to whom or why  and we never care.  The film is really all about style anyway. How else to account for the rather ludicrous image of Lucy Liu - looking more like a fashion model out on a shoot than a trained killer doing the shooting herself - strolling in elegant slow motion through the streets of Vancouver, wiping out what seems to be an entire hit squad with a combination of superhuman marksmanship and Matrix-like kickboxing moves? With her ankle-length designer coat and her icy-cool demeanor, she looks like Calvin Klein's idea of what the well-dressed assassin should be wearing this season. It's enough to reduce the whole enterprise to the level of comic absurdity  and, indeed, I often found myself laughing out loud at many of the ostensibly serious shenanigans occurring in the film. The flashbacks, which are obviously intended to clarify the characters' relationships, are so poorly done that they actually end up making the whole story more muddled and confusing. (And, although the child-kidnapping scenario is never as offensive in this film as it is in `Trapped,' one can still question the propriety of filmmakers running to this theme with the kind of frequency they seem to have been doing of late). Antonio Banderas makes up the other half of the film's title (he is Ecks, she Sever), and one only wonders what he could have been thinking about when he signed on to co-star in this particular project. `Ballistic' is utterly dispensable moviemaking: here today, forgotten tomorrow, a film utterly without distinction, conviction or purpose.",absurdly bad espionage thriller,ballistic ecks vs sever has been saddled with not only one worst movie titles recent memory but one worst screenplays as well films third rate espionage plot makes no sense at all serves basically as lame excuse endless explosions shootouts double flipping car chases which have become standard accoutrements virtually every action picture since bullitt 1968 problem with ballistic is that viewer can never tell who is doing what whom or why we never care film is really all about style anyway how else account rather ludicrous image lucy liu looking more like fashion model out shoot than trained killer doing shooting herself strolling elegant slow motion through streets vancouver wiping out what seems be entire hit squad with combination superhuman marksmanship matrix like kickboxing moves with her ankle length designer coat her icy cool demeanor she looks like calvin kleins idea what well dressed assassin should be wearing this season its enough reduce whole enterprise level comic absurdity indeed i often found myself laughing out loud at many ostensibly serious shenanigans occurring film flashbacks which are obviously intended clarify characters relationships are so poorly done that they actually end up making whole story more muddled confusing although child kidnapping scenario is never as offensive this film as it is trapped one can still question propriety filmmakers running this theme with kind frequency they seem have been doing late antonio banderas makes up other half films title he is ecks she sever one only wonders what he could have been thinking about when he signed co star this particular project ballistic is utterly dispensable moviemaking here today forgotten tomorrow film utterly without distinction conviction or purpose,0.5070833333333333,-0.035833333333333314,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,For the love of Christ! Make it stop!,"Once in a while, a movie comes out that just defies logic. Sometimes logic is defied in how rewarding the watching experience was, say like with the Sixth Sense. Sometimes logic is defied in such a way as to make you question the mental state of those involved with giving this movie the ""greenlight"". This is not necessarily a good thing. This movie hurts on so many levels that it could be considered a cruel and inhuman torture to be made to sit through this. Everything about this movie screams bargain bin. With the exception of one scene (see below), this movie pretty much blows. Antonio Banderas is absolutely useless in this picture. You'd think from the ad campaign, let alone the fact that the movie is titled ""Ecks vs. Sever"", that he would be more of a serious ass kicker. No, no. The only one who gets to do any serious ass kicking is Lucy Liu and I'm 100% positive that she did this one only to pay the bills. Even with that revelation, she still sucked in it. The direction is pretty much what you'd expect from someone who goes by the name, ""Kaos"" but sometimes I'd like a little order to my chaos, ya know? I read a quote somewhere, where they said, 'who knew so much action could be so boring?' That's definitely the case here. Yeah there's a lot of action but it's of the direct-to-video variety. God, help me but this movie sucked. It wasn't even of the ""so bad, it's good"" type of flick. The story is incomprehensible, something about microscopic termites and little babies blown to smithereens and wives that bounce on you and the guy from Payback and.... AARRRRGGGHHH!!! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I can't recommend this to anyone. I'll give it a 1/2* out of ***** ONLY and I repeat, ONLY because of the aforementioned scene where some guy is knocked off of a rooftop by a grenade launcher and is shown falling to his death onto a parked car.

3.0,"Not to be taken seriously, but entertaining at 3 AM","I gave this movie a 3 of 10 which, I guess, makes me one of its biggest fans in my age group(I'm 41, and the highest ratings for this film averaged 2.5 at the time of my writing and were limited to sub-18 year olds).Banderas and Liu saved this film from deserving the rating it got here on IMDb. The film is certainly pointless, loaded with ridiculous plot twists and absurd action sequences, but how many action films don't fit this description? Seriously, if you want to see what two entertaining actors and a lot of wasted film can do together, this film is worth a look. it's plot heavy, bit soul-less and clichéd, but entertaining nonetheless.I turned it on at 3AM one sleepless night because I wanted to see what the heck Liu and Banderas were doing in a direct to video film. Expecting a thoroughly dreadful film, I was pleasantly surprised, and found the film to be entertaining. The film views like a series of strung together early-80s MTV videos with a contemporary hard rock sound track, plenty of loud noises and explosions, and, thankfully, few words.To the extent that I remember it, the plot was about Banderas trying to rescue his wife and son from the clutches of some very evil super-secret spy types (who are nevertheless apparently exceedingly inept). A lot of stuff got blown up - in fact most of the sets were heavily rigged with explosives which seemed to go off at random intervals. Of course there were a lot of gunshots, fists, and kicks. I don't recall any swords or phasers though. If I say anything about Lucy Liu at all, I will give away the rest of the plot (which ought to tell you something about the quality of the script and the complexity of the plot) Lighten up! It's bad, but it's just a B movie. And this is what B movies are supposed to be about. By the way, a better choice for an utterly stupid action/violence flick is the masterpiece of violence surrealism ""Mean Guns""",not be taken seriously but entertaining at 3 am,i gave this movie 3 10 which i guess makes me one its biggest fans my age group im 41 highest ratings this film averaged 2 5 at time my writing were limited sub 18 year olds banderas liu saved this film deserving rating it got here imdb film is certainly pointless loaded with ridiculous plot twists absurd action sequences but how many action films dont fit this description seriously if you want see what two entertaining actors lot wasted film can do together this film is worth look its plot heavy bit soul less clich d but entertaining nonetheless i turned it at 3am one sleepless night because i wanted see what heck liu banderas were doing direct video film expecting thoroughly dreadful film i was pleasantly surprised found film be entertaining film views like series strung together early 80s mtv videos with contemporary hard rock sound track plenty loud noises explosions thankfully few words extent that i remember it plot was about banderas trying rescue his wife son clutches some very evil super secret spy types who are nevertheless apparently exceedingly inept lot stuff got blown up fact most sets were heavily rigged with explosives which seemed go off at random intervals course there were lot gunshots fists kicks i dont recall any swords or phasers though if i say anything about lucy liu at all i will give away rest plot which ought tell you something about quality script complexity plot lighten up its bad but its just b movie this is what b movies are supposed be about by way better choice utterly stupid action violence flick is masterpiece violence surrealism mean guns,0.5280505952380954,-0.033556547619047604,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1.0,""" ""I had no idea what was going on. I just showed up, did what they told me and that was it"",","...says Lucy Liu about her role in this film. When one of your two leads is willing to say, on the record, that they haven't got a clue what the film in which they are starring is about or the motivation of their character is, you know you are in trouble.Ultimately, this film's big sin is that it is so incoherent and completely lacking in motivation for the characters or backstory that it is boring. And cool slow motion flips through the air Matrix style and explosions - lots of them - are not going to change that. I have no idea what the background is between the two adversaries, no idea what makes the bad guy a villain, and no idea how they can spin this into a warm family drama, which they attempt to do at the end, I am just supposed to forget about all of those charred bodies left behind in Vancouver.The director of this film goes by ""Kaos"". And somebody actually let him direct another film after this bomb. Granted, it was ten years later, but he got a second chance.

2.0,"Never mind the ballistics, here's the pathologist","When I say ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" was incredible, I don't mean that in a good way. All the main characters are current or former US federal agents, presumably to keep it interesting, but all the action takes places in Vancouver, BC, which, last time I looked, was not in the United States. The basic storyline was fairly straightforward (and rather hackneyed), but the motivations of the various characters were utterly incomprehensible. The film was somewhat on the short side, and I couldn't escape the feeling that the three scenes which might have tied together the loose ends inexplicably ended up on the cutting room floor. Banderas phoned in his performance (for God's sake, enunciate, man), and the musical score was just irritating. The only two things ""Ballistic"" had going for it were the presence of some rarely-seen hardware (fun for you firearms buffs) and some spectacular action sequences (though these were plagued by some annoying clichés, such as a protective vest preventing all injury to a character, and henchmen showing complete disregard for personal safety), and these were simply not enough to save this turkey.

1.0,Negative review *spoiler warning*,"This is a review chock full of spoilers. I find it difficult to express why I disliked this film as much as I did without expressly pointing out key scenes and events that made me cringe while attempting to enjoy a thoughtless summer film. I did approch this film as just that. I am a guy who likes a thoughtless action film more often than not. I love thoughtful ones but the thoughtless ones can truly be fun. xXx comes to mind. I was expecting something along those lines when I came to see Ballistic. What it turned out to be was a number of explosions that seemed to occur for no reason what so ever. To say there was little plot bringing these explosions together is a given. That comes with the territory, but in this case the reasons are even below the lowest C movie in quality. No one reacts to an event the way you'd expect a normal human being to react. In fact the two main characters were so devoid oh personality I have come to wonder whether or not they were both blackmailed into performing the roles. I'm used to Lucy Liu not showing any on screen personality but Antonio consistently show's his ""Latin Lover"" charm. Not here.* spoilers begin below *Everyone is out to get Lucy Liu. No one seems to know where to find her. In fact they need to draw an FBI agent 7 years out of retirement to capture her. His groundbreaking method of investigation is to sit in a car listen to a radio and carry on dull conversations with secondary characters. Meanwhile across town Lucy Liu is walking in circles for no reason in a coffee bar. The bad guys know this and have snipers set up all over the place that would make the Kennedy assassination look like amateur night. How is it that they don't know where she hides out but knows when and where she's going to walk in circles? After giving the order not to hurt her immediately all snipers try to kill her and an overly armed SWAT team hit's the scene. By overly armed I mean they have grenade launchers and heavy machine-guns all designed to kill as many innocent bystanders as possible. In fact the FX crew even botched the way rifle mounted grenade launches work and turned them into mini rocket launchers. But fear not, they don't use them. They are just there for Lucy to pick up and level 12 city blocks with. I often wondered how it is if she were so professional she'd stand in one place and take on an army rather than just slip away in the crowd.Once the mayhem is complete Antonio arrives glances at a few bullet holes and declares that the FBI should pick up and not investigate the devastation because `she's not done here.' I was able to relate to the FBI assistant directors baffled expression in this scene because I wouldn't know what to say to one of my agents who asked me to pull out all of my investigators cause the criminal might be coming back. Wouldn't you want to catch her? Skipping ahead to what I assume is the largest injustice here. Antonio finds his wife to learn that for the past 7 years she was in bed with the big bad guy of the film. Married to him in fact. He confronts her in an aquarium while she is contentedly looking at whales, which must be where she goes whenever her son is kidnapped and threatened to be killed within 12 hours. And she also proceeded to have Antonio's son, who has been raised by her and the man who;1) Tried to hill Antonio's character.2) Faked the death of himself and Antonio's wife in an effort to `have her to himself'. Which evidently worked for 7 years.When confronted she reveals that she had knowledge that Antonio was not dead and in fact always really loved him and not the big villain. She only stayed with him to `protect their son'. By having the son live with this guy? Give me a break! But what's worse is Antonio's reaction. He instantly understands and forgives her. No anger, no slap for her lack of logic. It's all OK. Lets go get the bad guy now. Honestly that ended the film for me.

1.0,Worst film I will EVER see.,"I can't understand why this film was made. It's so appalling and so bad that someone involved in the production must have noticed something. Everything in every area of filmmaking is wrong with Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. Even the title as Banderas and Liu are not in competition with each other. Here's the plot. Oh, wait a minute, I can't tell you what the plot is because it doesn't exist. It just a massive load of old cobblers. And what's even worse is that the nonexistent plot is full of holes. Make sense? No didn't think so. It's not even worth watching to see what I mean.The dialogue is the truly worst ever. At least the bad dialogue in movies such as Dolemite is eternally quotable. Ray Park's 'acting' makes Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal on their worst day look like Laurence Olivier.

,It actually sucks the fun of a moviegoing experience.,"1/2 out of ****I'm not typically a particularly demanding moviegoer when it comes to action films; just give me well-choreographed mayhem set amidst a plot that makes a little bit of a sense or a few engaging characters and I'll probably be reasonably pleased. Ballistic fails to follow even that, which explains why the film bored the hell out of me. I'm almost hesitant to say this, but the latest straight-to-video Jean-Claude Van Damme schlock might actually be better than Ballistic, which was arguably 2002's worst film (I've never seen Rollerball).There's something of a plot here, but I'm not entirely sure what the hell was going on. Antonio Banderas plays FBI Agent Ecks, Lucy Liu is Agent Sever, and the two of them are duking it out because they somehow have crossed paths with a wealthy man (Gregg Henry) who is determined to smuggle a small electronic device that can assassinate its intended victim via heart attack.  Mixed up in it all is Talisa Soto as Banderas' supposedly dead wife, only she's not really dead. Much mayhen ensues.Ballistic is directed by Kaos, a Thai filmmaker who apparently wanted his movies to live up to his name. This is his first American feature and he shows almost no ability in crafting an action sequence. Martial arts fights that should get the adrenaline-pumping are so stiltedly choreographed, it'll inspire either laughs or yawns. Kaos also goes overboard on the slow motion, ensuring there's never an opportunity for the fight scenes to build momentum. And this is the only film I can think of where the people involved in a car chase actually follow the speed limit!I feel a bit sorry for the cast here, particularly Lucy Liu, whose martial arts talents are squandered here. To date, she hasn't been much of an actress, but she looks and convincingly acts tough so such a role here must have seemed like a good idea. For Banderas, this is the third film where he has trouble with mysterious women. I've heard of typecasting, but never to such a ridiculous extent. The only thing keeping this guy's career afloat is Robert Rodriguez and that Spy Kids franchise.",it actually sucks fun moviegoing experience,1 2 out im not typically particularly demanding moviegoer when it comes action films just give me well choreographed mayhem set amidst plot that makes little bit sense or few engaging characters ill probably be reasonably pleased ballistic fails follow even that which explains why film bored hell out me im almost hesitant say this but latest straight video jean claude van damme schlock might actually be better than ballistic which was arguably 2002s worst film ive never seen rollerball theres something plot here but im not entirely sure what hell was going antonio banderas plays fbi agent ecks lucy liu is agent sever two them are duking it out because they somehow have crossed paths with wealthy man gregg henry who is determined smuggle small electronic device that can assassinate its intended victim via heart attack mixed up it all is talisa soto as banderas supposedly dead wife only shes not really dead much mayhen ensues ballistic is directed by kaos thai filmmaker who apparently wanted his movies live up his name this is his first american feature he shows almost no ability crafting action sequence martial arts fights that should get adrenaline pumping are so stiltedly choreographed itll inspire either laughs or yawns kaos also goes overboard slow motion ensuring theres never opportunity fight scenes build momentum this is only film i can think where people involved car chase actually follow speed limit i feel bit sorry cast here particularly lucy liu whose martial arts talents are squandered here date she hasnt been much actress but she looks convincingly acts tough so such role here must have seemed like good idea banderas this is third film where he has trouble with mysterious women ive heard typecasting but never such ridiculous extent only thing keeping this guys career afloat is robert rodriguez that spy kids franchise,0.4994212962962963,-0.007604692760942756,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"

Sure, Lucy Liu beats up a lot of people... but her character is so boring and emotionless that she doesn't come off as cool as she should have. I mean, she barely says a word throughout the whole movie. Yes, lines DO matter in an action film. It all plays out like a video game... and I can see why; it was intended to be one.

6.0,"Middling, muddled, cool looking action flick","While I did not think this was a particularly good movie, I am very surprised to see how low of a rating it got. The same people that gave ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" close to six stars gave this only 3.6? Ballistic was disjointed, over-edited, shallow, and cliched, but it was at least entertaining, unlike the barely-watchable ""Charlie's.""Lucy Liu was the only bright point in ""Charlie's,"" and as such is, in my opinion, completely under-utilized in this film. While she is given a chance to look great, she has few lines and little character building. She does the best she can with what she's been given. Banderas also does a good job with his stereotype character and manages to make him a bit less of a cardboard cutout than he what he started out as. Liu is very believable as a badass. She doesn't even blink when she fires a weapon and does a decent job of fighting in the non-stuntman scenes.The blame for this movie's weak points rests mostly on the director. It seems like anything of any substance was cut in one of the ""artful"" cuts of current and past exposition that seem spliced and blended together almost at random. A good editor could probably fix some of this damage, dropping at least 5 minutes of run time, but another 10 to 15 minutes of footage would have to be added to give the story a hint of coherence. On the plus side, some of the photography was beautiful.Bottom line: good action, crappy plot, looks cool, the two main character(s) are babes (depending on your gender/orientation).

8.0,"""Ballistic"" contains more than enough action and plot reversals to keep its audiences enthralled","Thailand-born film director Wych Kaosayananda pulls out all stops in his first English- language actioneer ""Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever,"" a fast-paced, slam-bang, high-octane, revenge-thriller that pits Hispanic heartthrob Antonio Banderas against Asian beauty Lucy Liu of ""Charlie's Angels"" fame. Kaosayananda, who made ""Fah,"" the highest moneymaking movie of all time in Thailand, has since slashed his multi-syllabic moniker to Kaos. Not only does this talented Asian action helmer live up to his alias, but also ""Ballistic"" traces the trajectory of its title with a pyrotechnical frenzy. Our clench-jawed hero, our long-haired heroine, and a multitude of disposable but dastardly SWAT-style villains brandish a formidable arsenal of firepower, ranging from auto pistols to submachine-guns to rocket launchers, and unleash inexhaustible barrages of bullets in slow-motion for more than an hour with barely a word of dialogue. Moreover, when these one-dimensional archetypes aren't shooting up everything in sight, they resort to either kicking butt martial arts style a la ""The Matrix"" or demolishing dozens of cars, buses, SUVs, and railway freight cars. Although none of this nonsense remains remotely original, ""Ballistic"" delivers more than enough gunplay to compensate for its prefabricated, cookie-cutter plot about rival assassins.Cast as a disillusioned but fashionably disheveled ex-G-Man named Jeremiah Ecks, Antonio Banderas wears a single expression throughout ""Ballistic"" as nondescript as his rain-sodden trench coat. According to the melodramatic, bullet-riddled screenplay by Alan McElroy, whose credits include ""Spawn"" and ""Rapid Fire,"" Ecks quit the Bureau after his wife died in an explosion seven years ago. Ecks nurses a drink in a dimly-lit bar with rain dripping off his trench coat when his former Agency boss Julio Martin (Miguel Sandoval of ""Mrs. Winterbourne"") drops in and informs him that his dead wife is alive. Martin refuses to divulge the details until Ecks retrieves a microscopic assassination device from bad guy Robert Gant (""Payback's"" Gregg Henry) which can be injected into a person's bloodstream and kill them when activated. Meanwhile, Gant faces troubles of his own when Sever (Lucy Liu) abducts his young son Michael (Aidan Drummond) and spirits him off to her Batcave of sorts where she hordes more hardware than most women have shoes. As an ex-DIA agent trained as an assassin because she was an orphan, Sever bears a grudge against Gant for killing her only child. When Gant isn't dodging Ecks and Sever, he contends with his grief-stricken wife Rayne (Talisa Soto of ""License To Kill) who fears for her son's life.""Ballistic"" doesn't pretend to be anything more than a $70-million B-movie thriller. McElroy and Koas waste no more than a minute or two on expository dialogue before they load up this ode to the NRA and open fire. The taciturn cast spends more time ducking lead and spinning drop kicks than they do acting. One interesting shot shows a wounded villain plummeting backwards off a building to smash into a car beneath him. What makes the shot so fascinating is that we get to watch him as he falls without any cuts. As Gant's second-in-command, Ray Parks shows off his considerable martial arts expertise. Previously, Parks appeared in George Lucas's ""The Phantom Menace"" as Darth Maul and as Toad in ""X-Men.""

,"Kill me. Kill me now. Am I dead yet? Sheesh, this sucker is LONG!","Mystery Science Theater 3000 was a show dedicated to making fun of really bad movies. If it were still around today, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever would be the perfect candidate for the cast to tear apart limb from limb. It's that bad. First off, let me just mention the director of the film. His name is Wych Kaosayananda, but he calls himself Kaos. Ooh, real cool, dude. Hey, my last name's pretty hard to pronounce too, but you don't see me walking around calling myself Pern. Anyway, back to the movie itself. What the overly complicated plot boils down to is a custody battle, but if I wanted to see that I would watch Divorce Court and be better off. Oh, and there's some inane babbling about some microscopic assasin robot that can get into your bloodstream and give you a heart attack, but considering that this multi-million dollar virus looks like Frogger armed with a syringe and an Inspector Gadget claw you can't take it too seriously. And you know you're in trouble when the scenes of people parking their cars and making cell phone calls are more exciting than the 'action' scenes (if, by more exciting I mean how dancing with an empty Pepsi can is more exciting than trying to shove it in your eye). Ya know the classic movie disclaimer, ""No animals were harmed during the making of this film""? Well, Ballistic needs a disclaimer that says something like, ""Exactly 1,587 cars got real blowed up during the making of this film, along with a black bus and some train boxcars."" There are literally so many explosions in this piece of junk that it seems like the director (who, remember, calls himself Kaos) thought, ""If all else fails, BLOW IT UP!"" And there are far too many moments that reminded me of The Matrix, a movie that is ten times more intestering than Ballistic. There are gun fights galore, wire-assisted kung-fu battles, and an insane amount of slow motion that pops up at the weirdest times (look, Antonio Banderas is walking in the rain...in slow motion! And they're shaking hands...in slow motion! WHY?!). Now let's get to the acting. The story got so boring at one point that I actually played the Let's See How Many Lines Lucy Liu Has Game. Turns out she has 32 LINES, none of which exceed four or five words. And she can't even pull off those measley 32 lines with any sense of credibility! Here's one of those golden lines right now:Agent Ecks: Where did you get all of this artillery? Agent Sever (Liu): ...Some women buy shoo...She's supposed to have said the word 'shoes' but since the woman mumbles all of her 32 LINES it's hard for the audience to tell...or care. Antonio Banderas doesn't come out of this looking great either. He has one facial expression, and that's Dazed. Oh sure, he tries to get all emotional like in the scene where he meets his long lost wife at the local aquarium (I kid you not), but he comes off very robotic. As for the rest of the cast...ditto.It's too bad that Sweet Home, Alabama was sold out, because if it had not been, you would be reading a totally different review, no doubt. As things stand, however...well, here are some MST3K quotes to express my thoughts on this blasted piece of crap-tastical junk:""To be dead. To be nothing. To watch 'Ballistic' no more."" ""Who would this film appeal to? Elderly squirrels? People without heads? Little pieces of material that fell off of plastic trays?""And finally, I have an idea for the title of Ballistic's sequel, which, if there truly is a higher power, will never actually be made. Seeing as how the filmaker were so stylish as to spell out the letter X as the needlessly complicated Ecks, how 'bout this:Ballistic II: Ecks vs. WHY?!My score: 0/4 Do not see this movie. Ever. EVER!",kill me kill me now am i dead yet sheesh this sucker is long,mystery science theater 3000 was show dedicated making fun really bad movies if it were still around today ballistic ecks vs sever would be perfect candidate cast tear apart limb limb its that bad first off let me just mention director film his name is wych kaosayananda but he calls himself kaos ooh real cool dude hey my last names pretty hard pronounce too but you dont see me walking around calling myself pern anyway back movie itself what overly complicated plot boils down is custody battle but if i wanted see that i would watch divorce court be better off oh theres some inane babbling about some microscopic assasin robot that can get into your bloodstream give you heart attack but considering that this multi million dollar virus looks like frogger armed with syringe inspector gadget claw you cant take it too seriously you know youre trouble when scenes people parking their cars making cell phone calls are more exciting than action scenes if by more exciting i mean how dancing with empty pepsi can is more exciting than trying shove it your eye ya know classic movie disclaimer no animals were harmed during making this film well ballistic needs disclaimer that says something like exactly 1 587 cars got real blowed up during making this film along with black bus some train boxcars there are literally so many explosions this piece junk that it seems like director who remember calls himself kaos thought if all else fails blow it up there are far too many moments that reminded me matrix movie that is ten times more intestering than ballistic there are gun fights galore wire assisted kung fu battles insane amount slow motion that pops up at weirdest times look antonio banderas is walking rain slow motion theyre shaking hands slow motion why now lets get acting story got so boring at one point that i actually played lets see how many lines lucy liu has game turns out she has 32 lines none which exceed four or five words she cant even pull off those measley 32 lines with any sense credibility heres one those golden lines right now agent ecks where did you get all this artillery agent sever liu some women buy shoo shes supposed have said word shoes but since woman mumbles all her 32 lines its hard audience tell or care antonio banderas doesnt come out this looking great either he has one facial expression thats dazed oh sure he tries get all emotional like scene where he meets his long lost wife at local aquarium i kid you not but he comes off very robotic as rest cast ditto its too bad that sweet home alabama was sold out because if it had not been you would be reading totally different review no doubt as things stand however well here are some mst3k quotes express my thoughts this blasted piece crap tastical junk be dead be nothing watch ballistic no more who would this film appeal elderly squirrels people without heads little pieces material that fell off plastic trays finally i have idea title ballistics sequel which if there truly is higher power will never actually be made seeing as how filmaker were so stylish as spell out letter x as needlessly complicated ecks how bout this ballistic ii ecks vs why my score 0 4 do not see this movie ever ever,0.5265632684998882,-0.015373351218421644,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.31}"
