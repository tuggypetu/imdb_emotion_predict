8,flavour rich drama,"Ustad Hotel is a flavour rich drama which has got all the ingredients to satisfy everyone alike, that without compromising on the artistic elements! Anwar Rasheed Anjali Menon duo doesn't disappoint, true to be, they don't strike Gold either! The story, roughly, is about a young guy who tries to get away with his career only to find himself in the thick of things which goes otherwise. With the backdrop of food and malabar,it does provide an interesting watch, the more appeasing if you are from malabar region. The screenplay by Anjali menon is too good that we don't get stuck anywhere, a bit let loose towards the end, making it melodramatic - I got a lump in my throat after a very long time. The sulaimani & mohabbath scene with Dulqar and Thilakan was a mesmerizing one. The background score & songs were so soothing to the senses - hindustani, folk rock and even a sufi track - which went well with the storyline did wonders for the movie. We have a young hero in Dulqar Salman who is handsome and stylish - improved a lot from Second Show - and an ever amazing Thilakan who excels as Ustad, Nithya Menen who plays the love interest of Dulqar does well too.With food being an important element in the plot, chances are high the movie being compared to ""Salt ' n' Pepper"". Ustad Hotel is a feel good drama which would skip being at par with S 'n' P which was a romantic comedy. It did disappoint me that the romance was so underplayed in Ustad Hotel, the only romantic scene was sweet leaving us craving for more! All said, Anwar Rasheed & crew does it in style, a good feast to relish.",flavour rich drama,ustad hotel is flavour rich drama which has got all ingredients satisfy everyone alike that without compromising artistic elements anwar rasheed anjali menon duo doesnt disappoint true be they dont strike gold either story roughly is about young guy who tries get away with his career only find himself thick things which goes otherwise with backdrop food malabar it does provide interesting watch more appeasing if you are malabar region screenplay by anjali menon is too good that we dont get stuck anywhere bit let loose towards end making it melodramatic i got lump my throat after very long time sulaimani mohabbath scene with dulqar thilakan was mesmerizing one background score songs were so soothing senses hindustani folk rock even sufi track which went well with storyline did wonders movie we have young hero dulqar salman who is handsome stylish improved lot second show ever amazing thilakan who excels as ustad nithya menen who plays love interest dulqar does well too with food being important element plot chances are high movie being compared salt n pepper ustad hotel is feel good drama which would skip being at par with s n p which was romantic comedy it did disappoint me that romance was so underplayed ustad hotel only romantic scene was sweet leaving us craving more all said anwar rasheed crew does it style good feast relish,0.623474358974359,0.2633803418803419,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10,Excellent,"Ustad Hotel is a real treat for eyes, which keeps us engaged and makes our taste-buds come alive.The pluses include well crafted story line, with simplicity to the core, excellent background score and music, breathtaking visuals, and moreover, it brings out a valuable message.Dulquar has done a good job, and Thilakan stands out as Kareemikka, and kudos all the cast and crew members for giving such a wonderful experience.Overall I rate this as must watch and request Dileep and other mimicry artists to stop degrading Malayalam movies with films like Mayamohini, Pachakuthira etc, as this surely is the re-birth of Malayalam movie with a cry for quality and lasting content.Thanks.",excellent,ustad hotel is real treat eyes which keeps us engaged makes our taste buds come alive pluses include well crafted story line with simplicity core excellent background score music breathtaking visuals moreover it brings out valuable message dulquar has done good job thilakan stands out as kareemikka kudos all cast crew members giving such wonderful experience overall i rate this as must watch request dileep other mimicry artists stop degrading malayalam movies with films like mayamohini pachakuthira etc as this surely is re birth malayalam movie with cry quality lasting content thanks,0.5587606837606839,0.4288461538461539,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9,A visual Treat.,"This is my first review and i am very glad to have started up with this particular movie.First of all full points to Anwar Rasheed for casting Thilakan in this particular role,because he did absolute justice to the character.Dulquer and Nithya played along quite nicely.Then full points to both the story and direction.Excellent First half.Beautiful second half.This will be a milestone in Dulquer's career.I hope Listin Stephen continues to reap success because he is one of those producers who gives importance to the script rather than to the lead actors.Hats off guys for taking Malayalam film industry to a whole new level. Positives:good cast,direction,story,enchanting music. Negatives:a bit lagging at times.

8,Thilakan stole the show.,"Though it was Dulquer Salmaan's first film as an actor, he didn't go with the typical mindset of Indian actors of introducing himself as an super hero or central character of any film (when he could do that). That shows his maturity and wisdom.There were many times when the viewers felt the central character was Thilakan and not Dulquer Salmaan. Thilakan sir again proved that with whomever he is acting, he will steel the show. What an actor .!I really liked the cute, smart Nithya Menon. Her Malabar accent was awesome.The rest of the crew also did their job fabulously. The background music was also very good.It must be the kind of masterpiece that every director and viewers dream of.I congratulate all the crew member for making the film such a huge success and wish them to always come with such ideas.Thanks, Sujith",thilakan stole show,though it was dulquer salmaans first film as actor he didnt go with typical mindset indian actors introducing himself as super hero or central character any film when he could do that that shows his maturity wisdom there were many times when viewers felt central character was thilakan not dulquer salmaan thilakan sir again proved that with whomever he is acting he will steel show what actor i really liked cute smart nithya menon her malabar accent was awesome rest crew also did their job fabulously background music was also very good it must be kind masterpiece that every director viewers dream i congratulate all crew member making film such huge success wish them always come with such ideas thanks sujith,0.5643609022556391,0.3179448621553885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8,"Very lovable , even with obvious imperfections","The movie was a good one. Music,including background music is a high point of the movie. I think what stood out most though was Tilakan's acting. Tilakan is indeed a veteran actor. Dulqar is also very likable with his simple charms.The start of the movie was interesting with Sidhique trying to get a boy child. While there were many sections of the movie that were very heart-warming, as a whole piece, somehow, there is an incompleteness. It is fine to leave threads open.The movie is about a youngster trying to find his life. He pursues his dreams innocently and more or less succeeds in that. His grandfather offers him all the guidance. There is a positive interaction between Dulqar and Tilakan and you feel good as you watch him grow. There is a universal appeal in that theme - youngsters relate to it as their present, older people relate to it in their past.Music is definitely a high point of the movie. Appangalellam is an interesting number and the fluorescent painted faces in the night is impactive in the theater. Other songs have a heart of their own as well - vaathilil aa vaathilil , sanchari nee.The movie presents a lot of situations that you do not see usually. The camera work is excellent in certain sequences.Though personally, I am not a fan of Nithya Menon, I think the slow motion running sequence of Dulqar and Nithya has been excellently shot.The theme background of the movie is awesome.It gnaws at you all the while - there is no escaping it.The sequence where Tilakan talks about rain in the desert somehow impresses you deeply. The camera work is excellent here too. Some pieces talk too directly to you that you cannot express it. You need to get it from the depths where the impression is and sometimes you don't reach it.The movie also attempts at presenting real-life situations that people go through in their daily lives. The sequence where Jishnu complains about the food and how deeply hurt Dulqar is as he makes the dish again is a good one. The sequence is earnest and complete in itself and serves to characterize Jishnu but otherwise seems to not integrate. Or may be not, that is how things are in real too. The prejudice against a cooking job. The lorry driver misbehaving with Dulqar in Burqa. Youth who try to live their passion in music.The movie talks about hunger and how millions are still starving. This sequence is again presented well. It is a feel good movie and I might watch it again.I can watch it again for all the wonderful people in the movie and the endearing gentle malabari accent. Technically, we watched the first day first show of the movie. We reached 6:45 for the 6 PM show but the 6PM show had been canceled due to lack of people. So 9PM was the show and we were there.-----------------------------------------------Well, we did watch it again and this watch was as worthy a one, in fact a more worthwhile one. The first half is almost flawless. Varying techniques have been used in different sequences to keep the movie interesting. Humour was the highlight of the first sequence where Siddique is looking for a boy child.The second scene has a continuous sequence where between cuts, the number of sisters with him drop off one by one as they get married one after the other. Dulqar is a Europe returnee and the movie has not one scene in Europe where as the impression is well established.Through catchy music and sketch art, his life abroad is presented through the credits screen.The ego clash between Siddique and Dulqar has been carefully presented too - using mirrors to represent the egos and carefully calibrating the sound inside and outside the bathroom door. This attention to detail is also seen when Dulqar leaves taking just cash and not the gold chain or passport/credit cards from the drawer. Thereafter, the world around Usthad hotel is very well presented as well.However, looks like there are flaws towards the second half.The usthad hotel is repainted with enthusiasm. But thereafter, the older look of the hotel seems to have been presented again - at least that is the impression I got and that in itself is a flaw.I think there is some lack of focus towards the end.We have the hotel in trouble, then we have the people fighting and getting it up. And then Dulqar gets an offer to work abroad and is about to go and then Tilakan gets a heart attack. Tilakan sends Dulqar to Chennai Chef who exposes him to hunger and his service based approach to cooking.Then he comes back and Tilakan is not there and the hotel is closed. He then takes over and the hotel becomes a huge success. Looks like some unnecessary coding has been done here.If I were to redesign this, I would take out the job offer abroad and the heart attack out from the equation. Tilakan can just send him to Chennai Chef as part of one of his assignments and Dulqar can decide to settle down in Ustad hotel.Either ways, malayalam movie industry is so very back. Earlier I used to hope for more good malayalam movies. Now, I don't have to hope - I just have to look forward to the ones that are on the way.",very lovable even with obvious imperfections,movie was good one music including background music is high point movie i think what stood out most though was tilakans acting tilakan is indeed veteran actor dulqar is also very likable with his simple charms start movie was interesting with sidhique trying get boy child while there were many sections movie that were very heart warming as whole piece somehow there is incompleteness it is fine leave threads open movie is about youngster trying find his life he pursues his dreams innocently more or less succeeds that his grandfather offers him all guidance there is positive interaction between dulqar tilakan you feel good as you watch him grow there is universal appeal that theme youngsters relate it as their present older people relate it their past music is definitely high point movie appangalellam is interesting number fluorescent painted faces night is impactive theater other songs have heart their own as well vaathilil aa vaathilil sanchari nee movie presents lot situations that you do not see usually camera work is excellent certain sequences though personally i am not fan nithya menon i think slow motion running sequence dulqar nithya has been excellently shot theme background movie is awesome it gnaws at you all while there is no escaping it sequence where tilakan talks about rain desert somehow impresses you deeply camera work is excellent here too some pieces talk too directly you that you cannot express it you need get it depths where impression is sometimes you dont reach it movie also attempts at presenting real life situations that people go through their daily lives sequence where jishnu complains about food how deeply hurt dulqar is as he makes dish again is good one sequence is earnest complete itself serves characterize jishnu but otherwise seems not integrate or may be not that is how things are real too prejudice against cooking job lorry driver misbehaving with dulqar burqa youth who try live their passion music movie talks about hunger how millions are still starving this sequence is again presented well it is feel good movie i might watch it again i can watch it again all wonderful people movie endearing gentle malabari accent technically we watched first day first show movie we reached 6 45 6 pm show but 6pm show had been canceled due lack people so 9pm was show we were there well we did watch it again this watch was as worthy one fact more worthwhile one first half is almost flawless varying techniques have been used different sequences keep movie interesting humour was highlight first sequence where siddique is looking boy child second scene has continuous sequence where between cuts number sisters with him drop off one by one as they get married one after other dulqar is europe returnee movie has not one scene europe where as impression is well established through catchy music sketch art his life abroad is presented through credits screen ego clash between siddique dulqar has been carefully presented too using mirrors represent egos carefully calibrating sound inside outside bathroom door this attention detail is also seen when dulqar leaves taking just cash not gold chain or passport credit cards drawer thereafter world around usthad hotel is very well presented as well however looks like there are flaws towards second half usthad hotel is repainted with enthusiasm but thereafter older look hotel seems have been presented again at least that is impression i got that itself is flaw i think there is some lack focus towards end we have hotel trouble then we have people fighting getting it up then dulqar gets offer work abroad is about go then tilakan gets heart attack tilakan sends dulqar chennai chef who exposes him hunger his service based approach cooking then he comes back tilakan is not there hotel is closed he then takes over hotel becomes huge success looks like some unnecessary coding has been done here if i were redesign this i would take out job offer abroad heart attack out equation tilakan can just send him chennai chef as part one his assignments dulqar can decide settle down ustad hotel either ways malayalam movie industry is so very back earlier i used hope more good malayalam movies now i dont have hope i just have look forward ones that are way,0.43451063794087047,0.23140348669418423,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10,Extremely well written and directed.,"We see a lot of movies every year (or say week in my case), but not every movie would leave us with such everlasting memories like some movies. Ustad Hotel is one such movie which i can recall with extreme accuracy even though i watched it years ago. This is an example of extremely good writing. You can't wake up one fine morning and write ustad hotel, it requires months of experience and thinking. The movie has such a tightly coupled setting and strong native binding that even if u remove a single brick out even if it is a very small one like kareem ikka biriyani or sulaimani, it won't look good. The movie treats its primary thing(food) with utmost respect. Just look at every scene in which food is being displayed. It has such fantastic scenes like the one in the pic and the whole climax episode in madurai. There are some movies which can make your entire day awesome irrespective of how down you are and make you wish that the movie never ends. When someone combines your favorite thing in the world(food) with your favorite genre(feel-good drama) and have such a good team working for it, Ustad Hotel is the end product. Even if you take world cinema there can be only a handful of movies with such good writing. Wish Anjali Menon and team keeps producing such gems.(TL;DR - watch ustad hotel if you love food or when you feel down if language is not a barrier.)",extremely well written directed,we see lot movies every year or say week my case but not every movie would leave us with such everlasting memories like some movies ustad hotel is one such movie which i can recall with extreme accuracy even though i watched it years ago this is example extremely good writing you cant wake up one fine morning write ustad hotel it requires months experience thinking movie has such tightly coupled setting strong native binding that even if u remove single brick out even if it is very small one like kareem ikka biriyani or sulaimani it wont look good movie treats its primary thing food with utmost respect just look at every scene which food is being displayed it has such fantastic scenes like one pic whole climax episode madurai there are some movies which can make your entire day awesome irrespective how down you are make you wish that movie never ends when someone combines your favorite thing world food with your favorite genre feel good drama have such good team working it ustad hotel is end product even if you take world cinema there can be only handful movies with such good writing wish anjali menon team keeps producing such gems tl dr watch ustad hotel if you love food or when you feel down if language is not barrier,0.6118703703703705,0.22379629629629633,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.25}"

9,Delicious,"The holy offspring when a beautiful story meets a group of gifted artists and a fabulous film crew. The movie completely engulfs you until you give in to a sublime story telling. And to top it up with a fabulous soundtrack is like icing the cake with gold. This joyous movie ride promises you with comedy, clean concise romance before surprising you with a larger delicate theme of a social stigma that plagues our country. The culmination of the movie deserves nothing less than a standing ovation. Mazel Tov to this wonderful team.I'm no critic. I don't know the finer details about movie-making. Ustad Hotel satiated my soul and has cast a lingering effect on me. It is only very rarely that one doesn't feel even a tinge of regret when he has spent 180 bucks for a movie ticket.

9,Great Movie...,"A movie which has impressed me across all dimensions - In terms of Acting, Story, Direction, Cinematography and last but not the least Music. It is difficult to come across a great Malayalam movie these days and Anwar Rasheed has weaved his Magic yet again. It is a movie which kept me glued to the seat throughout, like his previous venture - Kerala Cafe.I am not going to discuss the story or plot elements here, as it is to be seen to be experienced. In one sentence, Ustaad Hotel is a MacGuffin that transforms the life of the central character played by Dulquer Salmaan. He and Thilakan are the stars of this movie and did a great job, well supported by Siddique & Mamukkoya. Nithya Menen had little role to play, but did well as the supportive,romantic interest.It is sad that Thilakan would not be there anymore to amaze us with his acting talents, he will be really missed. The fresh face of Dulquer(although a striking resemblance of his Megastar Dad)was a treat to watch and had it been played by an established actor, I don't think would have given the same effect.Watching Ustaad Hotel reinstated my belief in the Malayalam Movie Industry. I really appreciate the bold path taken by the young film makers,exploring new vistas and bringing us such contemporary visual treats! We want more...",great movie,movie which has impressed me across all dimensions terms acting story direction cinematography last but not least music it is difficult come across great malayalam movie these days anwar rasheed has weaved his magic yet again it is movie which kept me glued seat throughout like his previous venture kerala cafe i am not going discuss story or plot elements here as it is be seen be experienced one sentence ustaad hotel is macguffin that transforms life central character played by dulquer salmaan he thilakan are stars this movie did great job well supported by siddique mamukkoya nithya menen had little role play but did well as supportive romantic interest it is sad that thilakan would not be there anymore amaze us with his acting talents he will be really missed fresh face dulquer although striking resemblance his megastar dad was treat watch had it been played by established actor i dont think would have given same effect watching ustaad hotel reinstated my belief malayalam movie industry i really appreciate bold path taken by young film makers exploring new vistas bringing us such contemporary visual treats we want more,0.5084900731452455,0.22179989550679208,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8,"Not in parallel to the created hype, but exceptional. ♦ 84%","The acting is absolutely amazing with some good, fresh writing by Anjali Menon. But the plot loses its charm towards the end as we realize the character depths!The music is amazing and totally clings with the theme of the film. Yet, some questions are unanswered.If you look from a celluloid point of view, the plot is actually clichéd and the hype which was created before the movie release was of no use. Because except the hit song ""Appangalepadum,"" the actress has not much part to play. A salute to Thilakan's thespian attitude! RIP!Anyways, you cannot miss this one.
