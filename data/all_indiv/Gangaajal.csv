,Essence of democracy is shown in Gangaajal.,"Movie is amazing, the movie depicts what actual liberalism stands for. What democracy stands for, and depicts the advantage of living in a civilize form of government. If we do not take care of the values that make us unique we can turn into savages as well. We do have such tendencies. There are on going debates about criminal justice system being broken in democracies. The golden rule of law, rich people have better chances of getting away with a crime. Although film shows that law or constitution is not weak in sense, but it is lack of good citizenship by us that makes it weak. Faith in the civilization, law, constitution, and democracy. The rights like freedom of press, and speech. The movie is all about that. It is finely depicted. Prakash Jha is an admirable director and good story teller. Ajay Devgan's enaction of the main role is wonderful. He deserved accolades or awards for his role. It was played with maturity and sensibility. He didn't go over the top as most actors do when they get a powerful role. He played it real and controlled. Gracy singh was OK. Mukesh Tiwari was quite good too, he wasn't loud as his other movies, he was quite controlled too. Mohan Joshi played a typical villain, he did it probably millions of time. Yashpal Sharma too was simply just OK. There was nothing amazing to do for villains other than what they did in other movies. The cop gang was good too. The jail cell incident gave me goosebumps because it was based on real incident, it was barbaric. it was funny to me how they only had one curse word allowed in the whole movie. haha. The movie was not just a cop movie about anti corruption. The message hidden in it was far greater. It was about a death of human civilization, and how when it dies the fundamental rights are crushed with it. The rights of freedom of press and freedom of objection to majority. Movie showed transformation democracy to anarchy back to democracy at the end. It was simply great, I didn't expect to be such a good movie but it is. Faults in society is curable, but the cure starts within ourselves first.",essence democracy is shown gangaajal,movie is amazing movie depicts what actual liberalism stands what democracy stands depicts advantage living civilize form government if we do not take care values that make us unique we can turn into savages as well we do have such tendencies there are going debates about criminal justice system being broken democracies golden rule law rich people have better chances getting away with crime although film shows that law or constitution is not weak sense but it is lack good citizenship by us that makes it weak faith civilization law constitution democracy rights like freedom press speech movie is all about that it is finely depicted prakash jha is admirable director good story teller ajay devgans enaction main role is wonderful he deserved accolades or awards his role it was played with maturity sensibility he didnt go over top as most actors do when they get powerful role he played it real controlled gracy singh was ok mukesh tiwari was quite good too he wasnt loud as his other movies he was quite controlled too mohan joshi played typical villain he did it probably millions time yashpal sharma too was simply just ok there was nothing amazing do villains other than what they did other movies cop gang was good too jail cell incident gave me goosebumps because it was based real incident it was barbaric it was funny me how they only had one curse word allowed whole movie haha movie was not just cop movie about anti corruption message hidden it was far greater it was about death human civilization how when it dies fundamental rights are crushed with it rights freedom press freedom objection majority movie showed transformation democracy anarchy back democracy at end it was simply great i didnt expect be such good movie but it is faults society is curable but cure starts within ourselves first,0.5294072948328268,0.2348404255319148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.48}"
10.0,"A very real drama revolving around politics, police and public.","Firstly I must say I was very, very impressed with the realism of the whole atmosphere throughout the film, the initial setting is enough to engage your whole mind to the screen. Well, what makes the film shine so much? there are about several reasons.Ajay Devgan gives his very best performance here, as he did in 'Legend of Bhagat Singh'. Devgan manages to capture every emotion possible, by a man who is a policeman but also a human being, Gracy Singh does a decent work as well, despite having very brief appearance. Apart from Devgan's powerhouse performance, it's practically the whole cast that deserves to be applauded for doing justice to their various roles as well, above all Manoj Joshi and Yashpal Sharma deliver brilliant performances that just breathes even more life into the film. There is not a single cast actor who hasn't done any justice to his character, therefore 'Gangajal' is a small masterpiece and one of the rare gems of Bollywood drama. because of its honest team work by the whole cast and crew. A film you simply cannot ignore.

9.0,Highlights the essence of democracy!,"The two mistakes: The script turns out faulty at two instances. The first one is Magni Ram's suspension and its reversal. The second instance is why Officer Amit Kumar did not attend Apoorva's wedding until the phone call was made to him.The reason why movie outshines: The movie is how police and people of Tezpur turn violent against crime in their area, after posting of Officer Amit. In further run what is described is his journey on how He acts out to save people from becoming criminal. The speech that he gives at the end is phenomenal. One of the factors that I would like to put light on is local press described in the movie. How society runs is captured well.Final Verdict: The movie highlights the essence of democracy.

8.0,Dark and Violent,"Gangajal is a dark and ultra-violent movie; darker than Ardh Satya, more violent than Shool.In the end, the hero lives to survive another day and the villains die. But I would not call it a happy ending. The line between criminals and police, the good and the bad is wafer-thin in this movie. It's tough for me to cheer, when a person gets acid, a.k.a gangajal, poured into his eyes, even though he might be an incorrigible criminal. And, except for the hero Amit Kumar (essayed by Ajay Devgan), nobody seems to mind in the movie.Ajay Devgan brings a lot of passion with him. Mukesh Tiwari, who played the role of Bacha Yadav is convincing. Akhilesh Mishra as the corrupt D.S.P is refreshing. Others play their roles to the best of their abilities. Good triumphs over evil. But at what cost? At the end, Ajay Devgan thunders, ""main samaaj ko darinda hone se bachaanaa chahtaa hoon."" I agree with the sentiment whole-heartedly.",dark violent,gangajal is dark ultra violent movie darker than ardh satya more violent than shool end hero lives survive another day villains die but i would not call it happy ending line between criminals police good bad is wafer thin this movie its tough me cheer when person gets acid k gangajal poured into his eyes even though he might be incorrigible criminal except hero amit kumar essayed by ajay devgan nobody seems mind movie ajay devgan brings lot passion with him mukesh tiwari who played role bacha yadav is convincing akhilesh mishra as corrupt d s p is refreshing others play their roles best their abilities good triumphs over evil but at what cost at end ajay devgan thunders main samaaj ko darinda hone se bachaanaa chahtaa hoon i agree with sentiment whole heartedly,0.7216666666666669,-0.05111111111111109,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,A very under rated movie. A must watch if you are a fan of some hard hitting drama,"Gangaajal is a highly underrated movie. A fast paced story which keeps you involved and doesn't give you any breathing space and keeps your adrenaline going. Simply brilliant.Realism portrayed manages to suck you completely in the scenarios. You feel like punching those guys myself every time I watch it. Simply loved Ajay Devgan in Gangaajal. I haven't liked him better in any other movie. Only he could have played Amit Kumar like he did. His expressions and those eyes instill his angry police officer look. His body overall body language speaks volumes about his idealistic character.Apart from Ajay, all his subordinates have played their roles well. Mohan Joshi and Yashpal Sharma, though stereotyped, play their parts authoritatively. The performances overshadow the weaknesses of the second half.If you watch movies just for getting stress off you by watching a light hearted comedy, then Gangaajal is not for you. But if you like fast, edge of the seat, hard hitting stuff like ""A Wednesday"", for instance, then Gangaajal IS for you.",very under rated movie must watch if you are fan some hard hitting drama,gangaajal is highly underrated movie fast paced story which keeps you involved doesnt give you any breathing space keeps your adrenaline going simply brilliant realism portrayed manages suck you completely scenarios you feel like punching those guys myself every time i watch it simply loved ajay devgan gangaajal i havent liked him better any other movie only he could have played amit kumar like he did his expressions those eyes instill his angry police officer look his body overall body language speaks volumes about his idealistic character apart ajay all his subordinates have played their roles well mohan joshi yashpal sharma though stereotyped play their parts authoritatively performances overshadow weaknesses second half if you watch movies just getting stress off you by watching light hearted comedy then gangaajal is not you but if you like fast edge seat hard hitting stuff like wednesday instance then gangaajal is you,0.5832499999999998,0.13925,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.23, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.33}"

,Excellent,After Shool I knew there w'd be more in the row . not as good as shool was but in one way you feel good by watching nice good things happening to bad people and in that way Movie simply rocks. Gracy singh looks very nice and a typical indian wife. And I don't find whom to compare Ajay Devgan. He has become a perfect actor after starting from Phool aur Kaante. 3 cheers for him..but I have one question: Why Ajay Devgan was not there in Apoorva's wedding. WHY NOT?????? He should be there.but anyways apart from that one I simply love this movie. excellent in everything. and after watching this movie I want to kill all the MINISTRERS:-P...

6.0,Interesting with a good performance by Ajay,"Ajay Devgan has another feather to add to his cap of quality movies. He gives an excellent performance. His character of an honest cop trying to stop corruption is quite convincing. Gracy Singh is not bad for the small time she's on screen.

,REALITY BITES,"A few years back my grandmother told me about an incident that happened when family was coming out of theatre after watching Hrishikesk Mukerjhi's 'Satyakam'.My grandmother told me that one of my cousin grandfather commented after watching the grim movie that'We watch movies to better our mood,not to spoil it'.I guess many people echo this feeling even today after watching a serious-hard hitting saga like Gangaajal.The movie begins with the coming of SP Amit Kumar(Ajay Devgan) to an imaginary town of Tezpur.He is acoompanied by his wife(Gracy Singh).Kumar is very perturbed to see the condition of law-breakers and law-keeperes in this crime filled city.Sadhu Yadav(Mohan Joshi) and his notorious son(Yashpal Sharma) are the self-proclaimed crime kings of the city.They have reduced Tezpur to a corrupt,violent and terrible city.The police officers charcters range from honest Khan(Ayub Khan) to corrupt yet brave Bachcha Yadav(Mukesh Tiwari) to totally corrupt (Akhilendra Mishra).Even the IG(Mohan Agashe) also has close inks with Sadhu.Amit tries to pump life in the dead system and succeeds to an extent.However when angry policemen start giving criminals the punishment they deserve by blinding them in jail(a violent depiction of the Bhagalpur blindings) and pouring acid over them(Gangaajal),the condition goes out of hand.What follows is a series of events which confuse Amit as much as it confuses the viewer as to what is right and what is wrong.While Amit feels that criminals should be dealt strictly,the concept of Gangaajal(acid pouring) is a total no-no.What should be done and what should not be done is the question which keeps lingering in the mind of audience hours after the saga has ended.To start off with the negative points, it has to be said that the concept of police fighting the criminals has been done to death.Prakash Jha's saga ranges from intense to grim to drag.infact the last half an hour is unecessarily dragged and tests the patience of viewer.Anothet negative point of the movie is that it is too violent.The scenes of policemen blinding the prisoners is chilling but at the same time too gory.The usage of swear words many times in the movie will not be accepted by the family audience.The song sequence looks forced in.Now the positive points.Prakash Jha's script shows that he has done commendable research on Bihar.Many of the incidents shown in the movie are real and have been handled very ably.Jha's direction is first rate.He has succeeded in giving that rough look and made the movie in a very realistic way.Unlike other cop movies here the hero does not use the barrel till the end as a mean to end the menace.Ajay devgan one again shows his talent as an actor and screen presence as a star.He looks every bit the police supritendent and acts amazingly controlled.The way he uses his eyes,lights his cigaratte and dailogue delivery is absolutely first rate.Mohan Joshi also tries to underplay his character but falls flat.Yashpal Sharma hams.Akhilendra Mishra is hopeless.Mohan Agashe as usual is horrible.Ayub Khan is ok.However after Ajay Devgan if any actor makes an impact it is undoubtedly Mukesh Tiwari.In the role of a police officer Tiwari has given a sterling performance which is award-worthy.On the whole despite having its set of flaws,Gangaaajal is Still several notches above a normal hindi movie.It is quite capable of creating a controversy for its realism and very capable of getting Jha and Devgan both awards as well as critical acclaim.",reality

7.0,One of the rare good good-cop bad-cop movie,"I never expected to be impressed by this movie, going by the cover which had the regular in-your-face expressions from an outraged hero and a heroin with sadness written all over her face. It seemed like just another good-cop bad-guy movie. It was pleasantly surprising for me. Ajay Devgan, who is the only interesting and important character in this movie has given a more-than-decent performance. The song are minimal and this keeps the movie riveting for most part. The role of the villain is weak and did not develop into anything significant. However the dialogue delivery of AD and his no nonsense style of acting (or of the director) adds to the effect of the movie. The final dialogue: when AD has the villains under his feet and whole city is all set to burn them, AD says ""I am not protecting them from you, but I am protecting you from them. It is my duty to make sure you don't descend to the level of these villains. Jaisi Janatha, Waisi Police. If you are corrupt, what do you expect the police to be?""

,A Gorefest.,"When it comes to depicting violence,Hindi Movies have an edge. The savagery is mind boggling but it is the candid depiction is what is more disturbing. Prakash Jha as a Director and Screen-writer needs to be credited for his potential talent since the rest of the Cast including Ajay Devgan have done what is expected of them. There is message-as in every Indian Movie (more so than Hollywood movies), the message is always about Corruption. What stikes me as a viewer is the branding and type Casting.This may have been taken from a real event, even though all movies carry disclaimer to the contrary but the exxageration of the event to politizise and polarise is sometimes irresponsible and it goes beyond the reams of intended message that is supposed to be deciphered. This could have been a good Movie but for the inordinate lenth and the the sidestreets it travels.Like many other Indian movies (Plan,Kal Ho Na Ho-to name a few). The few who have the courage not to fall into this trap-like Ram Gopal Varma (Company,Bhoot& Ab Tak Chappan),Abbas Mastan (Humraaz)who are very focussed as to the message they want to deliver and they deliver it in a tight and neat package. I also tend to think that the message could be delivered without the gore that is seen in this Movie, however authentic it apears to be.",gorefest,when it comes depicting violence hindi movies have edge savagery is mind boggling but it is candid depiction is what is more disturbing prakash jha as director screen writer needs be credited his potential talent since rest cast including ajay devgan have done what is expected them there is message as every indian movie more so than hollywood movies message is always about corruption what stikes me as viewer is branding type casting this may have been taken real event even though all movies carry disclaimer contrary but exxageration event politizise polarise is sometimes irresponsible it goes beyond reams intended message that is supposed be deciphered this could have been good movie but inordinate lenth sidestreets it travels like many other indian movies plan kal ho na ho name few few who have courage not fall into this trap like ram gopal varma company bhoot ab tak chappan abbas mastan humraaz who are very focussed as message they want deliver they deliver it tight neat package i also tend think that message could be delivered without gore that is seen this movie however authentic it apears be,0.48738095238095236,0.15976190476190474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,I liked the Gangaajal Nautanki,"I quite liked the solo 'nautanki' song sequence in the movie Gangaajal. I thought it was very original, rustic and authentic.I admit that almost all the reviews that are on the web have found the song sequence either superfluous or not up to the mark, but I think otherwise.I much liked the choreography, the dancing (Maanyata), the singing, and the music (Wayne Sharpe, Sandesh Shandilya). Kudos to Prakash Jha and his team.I rate it much better than many a remix videos that have become popular. Maybe some remix producer should revisit the item number.
