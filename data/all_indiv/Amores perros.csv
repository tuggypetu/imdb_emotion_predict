8.0,A smartly modern elegy.,"There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx. He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles. Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.El Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called 'The Goat', who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function. With intricate structure, 'Amores perros' tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls 'illegal economies' (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can't depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world's mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments. Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.These two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his 'job', wiping out businessman. If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left, happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.There is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the 'Cain and Abel' half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia's functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious.Except for the director. Like Paul Thomas Anderson in 'Magnolia', although to a less self-conscious degree, Gonzales Inarritu is the God of his film, intricately creating the structure that links his characters and their different environments. These are negative connections, however, which work against the idea of coherent meaning in life - contact usually results in destruction (physical, material, spiritual), or diminishing.He is also an Old Testament god, punishing those who would get too confident with their future plans or their seemingly inviolable present success - the gains of capitalism are prey to the violent whims of chance: Gonzalez Inarritu doesn't need frogs to shake a rigid society or mindset.Moral change is linked to physical change - being beaten up, losing a leg, cutting hair. The punning title, with its reference to the dog-eat/fight-dog nature of modern life, and its general unsatisfactoriness, also gives the film its Biblical feel, the idea of Mexico as an asphalt desert, or a rubbish heap, with all these scrawny mutts scavenging the remains.'Amores perros' shares the sickly, bleached near-monochrome look of many recent crime films, like 'Chopper' or 'Bleeder'. But where the heightened mise-en-scene in those works were expressionistic projections of their protagonists' psychosis, here it's part of a controlling world-view, the universal consciousness that creates, connects and destroys. The three stories, though connected narratively and symbolically, are mutually distinct - the first is an exhilirating mix of violent gangster film and frustrated romance; the second is like a short story (the screenwriter is a novelist), a figurative plot where movement is through image, symbol and idea, rather than film narrative; the third is a kind of spiritual journey, with an appropriately Biblical (or Wim Wenders-like) openness.'Amores perros' is not quite as amazing as its admirers claim - it says more about contemporary cinema that a film only has to hold your interest for it to be a masterpiece - but it is consistently enthralling, and, despite all the stylistic tics and brutal violence, bracingly humanist.",smartly modern elegy,there is character amores perros who looks like karl marx he is tramp assassin good bourgeois who one day reggie perrin like abandoned his family un reggie perrin like joined sandanistas effort create better world earning 20 years prison his troubles walking streets with creaky cart gaggle mangy dogs he was found by policeman who jailed him who gave him dingy place live food odd non official contract el chivo is soul film missing link both appearance man called goat who has rejected civilities society lives beast like existence with his dogs amongst ruins civilisation narrative function with intricate structure amores perros tells three stories one underclass mexican life where survival depends what new labour calls illegal economies dog fighting bank robbing etc where bright young women are stifled degraded by thoughtless pregnancies brutal marriages where single mothers depend usually cant depend shiftless sons subsistence this worlds mirror opposite world media celebrity models magazine editors daytime tv perfume advertising campaigns bright apartments family life is central here too although this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui dissatisfaction these two stories are mediated by narrative el chivo man who left one these worlds other but who still negotiates two through his search daughter he left as toddler his job wiping out businessman if mexico is emerging as part super confident globalism high capitalism than el chivo is grizzly sore thumb ex sandinista marx lookalike man who said no drop out forgotten depleted spirit left happily killing torturing servants new economic regime there is something biblical about his hirsute ascetism too presuming judge cain abel half brothers one adulterer other with contract out his sibling another example family gone badly wrong this bleak funeral grave scenes octavias functional crossing himself every time he passes icon landing are sole residual elements religion society once ostentatiously religious except director like paul thomas anderson magnolia although less self conscious degree gonzales inarritu is god his film intricately creating structure that links his characters their different environments these are negative connections however which work against idea coherent meaning life contact usually results destruction physical material spiritual or diminishing he is also old testament god punishing those who would get too confident with their future plans or their seemingly inviolable present success gains capitalism are prey violent whims chance gonzalez inarritu doesnt need frogs shake rigid society or mindset moral change is linked physical change being beaten up losing leg cutting hair punning title with its reference dog eat fight dog nature modern life its general unsatisfactoriness also gives film its biblical feel idea mexico as asphalt desert or rubbish heap with all these scrawny mutts scavenging remains amores perros shares sickly bleached near monochrome look many recent crime films like chopper or bleeder but where heightened mise en scene those works were expressionistic projections their protagonists psychosis here its part controlling world view universal consciousness that creates connects destroys three stories though connected narratively symbolically are mutually distinct first is exhilirating mix violent gangster film frustrated romance second is like short story screenwriter is novelist figurative plot where movement is through image symbol idea rather than film narrative third is kind spiritual journey with appropriately biblical or wim wenders like openness amores perros is not quite as amazing as its admirers claim it says more about contemporary cinema that film only has hold your interest it be masterpiece but it is consistently enthralling despite all stylistic tics brutal violence bracingly humanist,0.41486089466089454,0.026445021645021646,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Doggie Holocaust makes for Best Mexican Film Ever,"Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of the overtly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic, because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involving the people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, ""Amores Perros"" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.",doggie holocaust makes best mexican film ever,some people just wont want sit through this film because overtly graphic disturbing dog fighting scenes which is ironic because most people dont seem mind graphic violence involving people this film others simply wont watch it because subtitles this is shame since this is by far best film i have ever seen come out mexico far better more complex than comparably immature y tu mama tambien here we get intertwining tale involving dog fights petty gangsters tragically injured model cheating husband abused teenage wife homeless hit man as you might expect homeless hit man becomes soul film dogs serve as link reminding us violence we inflict upon each other nature fractured relationships we think beyond repair but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine brilliantly directed with great soundtrack bigger heart than you might initially perceive amores perros is deep thought provoking utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget,0.5166149068322982,0.225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,Brilliant movie! One of the best this decade...,"'Amores Perros' impressed the hell out of me. Three interrelated tales of the darker side of life in contemporary Mexico City, each one as fresh and as fascinating as the last. Each of the three stories are dark, disturbing and filled with humanity. Superbly acted all round, but especially noteworthy is the standout performance by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo, a political dissident turned hitman, and if the charismatic Gael Garcia Bernal (Octavia, the lovesick dog fighter) isn't an international star in the making I'll eat my words. This brilliant movie shows up the mediocrity of most current Hollywood ""product"", and to my mind ranks with a small handful of movies made this decade ('Chopper', 'The Pledge', 'The Way Of The Gun') that are truly memorable and with genuine substance. This one is a winner and essential viewing for all movie lovers. A future classic.",brilliant movie one best this decade,amores perros impressed hell out me three interrelated tales darker side life contemporary mexico city each one as fresh as fascinating as last each three stories are dark disturbing filled with humanity superbly acted all round but especially noteworthy is standout performance by emilio echevarria as el chivo political dissident turned hitman if charismatic gael garcia bernal octavia lovesick dog fighter isnt international star making ill eat my words this brilliant movie shows up mediocrity most current hollywood product my mind ranks with small handful movies made this decade chopper pledge way gun that are truly memorable with genuine substance this one is winner essential viewing all movie lovers future classic,0.5583333333333333,0.24567901234567902,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.25}"
9.0,On Men And Dogs,"This Mexican movie was surprisingly good. I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success. Three different stories in today's Mexico mix with very few common elements. The characters belong to different social categories, and nothing connects them at first sight, excepting the feeling of un-happiness, and - yes - dogs. Dogs play an important role in all three stories. One more warning - there is a lot of cruelty including dog fights - this film is certainly not for sensitive animal lovers. Directing is excellent, the stories are human and complex and despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome, they still leave you with a shade of hope - maybe because the humanity that the author uses to create his characters. There are so many memorable scenes, that I would commit another sin to pick any and describe it here - just rent, or go to watch this movie in the theater - it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend. 9/10 on my personal scale.",men dogs,this mexican movie was surprisingly good i confess sin prejudice concerning mexican cinema this being maybe second mexican film i have ever seen but here my sins are punished this is work director big talent hopefully he will not be spoiled by success three different stories todays mexico mix with very few common elements characters belong different social categories nothing connects them at first sight excepting feeling un happiness yes dogs dogs play important role all three stories one more warning there is lot cruelty including dog fights this film is certainly not sensitive animal lovers directing is excellent stories are human complex despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome they still leave you with shade hope maybe because humanity that author uses create his characters there are so many memorable scenes that i would commit another sin pick any describe it here just rent or go watch this movie theater it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend 9 10 my personal scale,0.38720000000000004,0.14093333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,What a masterful feature film debut,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's debut feature film 'Amores Perros' to me is one of the most remarkable film debuts there is in terms of direction and as an overall film. While he hasn't made a bad film (his weakest 'Babel' is still very good), even if some of his films are very divisive, 'Amores Perros' to me is his best.It is a long film but don't let that put you off, 'Amores Perros' makes the most of the running time and rarely does it feel drawn out or overlong. The middle act is quite as good as the rest of the film, the pacing drags a bit but not enough to bring the film down too much. The first story is absorbing but even better is the magnificent last one. Even if they are purposely not likable the characters are compellingly real.Visually, 'Amores Perros' is a very well made film. Very atmospherically lit, edited and designed. Not a fan of the hand held camera technique but it's very cleverly used here, with an intriguing documentary-like style, and is not abused. It's beautifully scored too.Scripting is complex and absorbing, and the way 'Amores Perros', exploring love, desire, desperation and traumas, is told and constructed allows for many disturbing, shocking, suspenseful and moving moments. It's very thought-provoking too and has real immediacy, as well as hard-hitting emotional power, vast emotional range and is uniquely twisted. Iñárritu's direction is exemplary, even early on his style is well established.Acting is very good, especially Emilio Echevarría.Overall, a masterful feature film debut and a masterpiece in its own right. 10/10 Bethany Cox",what masterful feature film debut,alejandro gonz lez i rritus debut feature film amores perros me is one most remarkable film debuts there is terms direction as overall film while he hasnt made bad film his weakest babel is still very good even if some his films are very divisive amores perros me is his best it is long film but dont let that put you off amores perros makes most running time rarely does it feel drawn out or overlong middle act is quite as good as rest film pacing drags bit but not enough bring film down too much first story is absorbing but even better is magnificent last one even if they are purposely not likable characters are compellingly real visually amores perros is very well made film very atmospherically lit edited designed not fan hand held camera technique but its very cleverly used here with intriguing documentary like style is not abused its beautifully scored too scripting is complex absorbing way amores perros exploring love desire desperation traumas is told constructed allows many disturbing shocking suspenseful moving moments its very thought provoking too has real immediacy as well as hard hitting emotional power vast emotional range is uniquely twisted i rritus direction is exemplary even early his style is well established acting is very good especially emilio echevarr overall masterful feature film debut masterpiece its own right 10 10 bethany cox,0.5628587301587301,0.20650317460317452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.25}"
6.0,"A Movie about life choices and its conclusions, Disturbing, Intense","It's a life-changing experience.

,As a director's film it is astounding but as a narrative it has it's highs and lows,"A young man gets into the world of illegal dog fighting in order to get enough money together to be able to run away with his brother's wife, but in the meantime he starts tension with another dog owner. A beautiful young model signs a lucrative contract with a perfume company and moves into her new flat with her lover  only for her tragedy to strike and her dog to go missing. Finally an ex-convict and guerrilla mourns the wife he left decades ago and longs to meet the daughter who thinks he is dead  but is also contracted to kill a businessman. These three lives come together in a car crash that acts as a catalyst in changing their lives.After seeing 21 Grams I knew that I had to get round to seeing this film. With it's appearance on TV (BBC4 showing itself to really be a 'place to think' and a wonderful channel to have) I took the opportunity to watch it, expecting a film that would match the good things I had heard about it. >From the opening car chase that results in the crash that the film spirals outwards from like debris, through for most of the first hour, I was hooked  the pace was great and the story gripping. It was violent, exciting and yet had a human element to it as well. However the second story knocked the wind out of it for a moment, and seemed to lack the emotion of the first. It was based around an urban myth of sorts and wasn't as good  even if it did pick up towards the end.The third story saw it return to a much more involving story of pain and the grinding out of life (as in 'getting by'). Maybe it was the rich lifestyles of the characters in story two that stopped me caring as much  I don't know but I know that the contrast between one & two made it more obvious how much the pace had dropped  especially when we are left wanted to know what happened to the characters we had spent an hour getting to care about. Anyway, the third story is a satisfying ending to the film and drew me back in emotionally where the second story had cut me off by it's abrupt start. Story two finishes before story three begins, and therefore it was easier to move on.I think the problem with this film for me was not the fact that three stories were intermingled but that I didn't think they were actually mixed well  the way the film moves away from characters before concluding their section (eg Octavia), the way the stories are actually quite separate from one another, these things and other I felt weakened the films  although each story was strong on it's own I just felt that story 2 was such a change to the film that it hurt it.However, as a film debut this is an amazing piece of work and is relentlessly impressive. From the opening car chase to the dog fights to the silent pain of the model looking out where her image once hung  in all these different moments I thought he did a great job and visually the film was never dull once no matter if it was set in a penthouse flat or a basement of an old building with the blood of dead dogs. And while we're on the subject, at the time of release I heard critics say they walked out of the film, refusing to watch cruelty to animals even being simulated. I can see their point but also think that they missed the fact that the animals in the film are mostly loved (even if they mostly die!)  however it is love and compassion for other humans that the film shows the characters having difficulty with, and this is where the emotional impact of the film is  not in simulated dogfights, albeit very well simulated dogfights that are hard to hear even if they are mostly unseen.The cast were all natural but I always find it hard to judge performances when they are not in English. Having said that, there were no bad performances in the whole thing  even if some have better material to work with than others. Of course I still think this is a director's film and the cast often take second place to the style and the feel of the film.Overall I really enjoyed this film but don't believe it deserves to be considered one of the 'best films ever made'! The opening hour is superb and it's pace is relentless (even in more sensitive moments) but the sudden stop the film makes when it changes to story two is too much to stand and really caused the film to stutter for me. It gets better and is fully back on track for story three but there are problems running all through the narrative. Even though it has a lower rating on IMDb at time of writing, I'd still say that 21 Grams offer this same fragmented style but with a much more satisfying narrative. Regardless of my nit picking I still think this is a powerful film that makes 150 minutes fly by with a huge amount of style from the first-time director, even if it does not live up to the endlessly gushing praise lavished upon it by many viewers.",as directors film it is astounding but as narrative it has its highs lows,young man gets into world illegal dog fighting order get enough money together be able run away with his brothers wife but meantime he starts tension with another dog owner beautiful young model signs lucrative contract with perfume company moves into her new flat with her lover only her tragedy strike her dog go missing finally ex convict guerrilla mourns wife he left decades ago longs meet daughter who thinks he is dead but is also contracted kill businessman these three lives come together car crash that acts as catalyst changing their lives after seeing 21 grams i knew that i had get round seeing this film with its appearance tv bbc4 showing itself really be place think wonderful channel have i took opportunity watch it expecting film that would match good things i had heard about it opening car chase that results crash that film spirals outwards like debris through most first hour i was hooked pace was great story gripping it was violent exciting yet had human element it as well however second story knocked wind out it moment seemed lack emotion first it was based around urban myth sorts wasnt as good even if it did pick up towards end third story saw it return much more involving story pain grinding out life as getting by maybe it was rich lifestyles characters story two that stopped me caring as much i dont know but i know that contrast between one two made it more obvious how much pace had dropped especially when we are left wanted know what happened characters we had spent hour getting care about anyway third story is satisfying ending film drew me back emotionally where second story had cut me off by its abrupt start story two finishes before story three begins therefore it was easier move i think problem with this film me was not fact that three stories were intermingled but that i didnt think they were actually mixed well way film moves away characters before concluding their section eg octavia way stories are actually quite separate one another these things other i felt weakened films although each story was strong its own i just felt that story 2 was such change film that it hurt it however as film debut this is amazing piece work is relentlessly impressive opening car chase dog fights silent pain model looking out where her image once hung all these different moments i thought he did great job visually film was never dull once no matter if it was set penthouse flat or basement old building with blood dead dogs while were subject at time release i heard critics say they walked out film refusing watch cruelty animals even being simulated i can see their point but also think that they missed fact that animals film are mostly loved even if they mostly die however it is love compassion other humans that film shows characters having difficulty with this is where emotional impact film is not simulated dogfights albeit very well simulated dogfights that are hard hear even if they are mostly unseen cast were all natural but i always find it hard judge performances when they are not english having said that there were no bad performances whole thing even if some have better material work with than others course i still think this is directors film cast often take second place style feel film overall i really enjoyed this film but dont believe it deserves be considered one best films ever made opening hour is superb its pace is relentless even more sensitive moments but sudden stop film makes when it changes story two is too much stand really caused film stutter me it gets better is fully back track story three but there are problems running all through narrative even though it has lower rating imdb at time writing id still say that 21 grams offer this same fragmented style but with much more satisfying narrative regardless my nit picking i still think this is powerful film that makes 150 minutes fly by with huge amount style first time director even if it does not live up endlessly gushing praise lavished upon it by many viewers,0.48388991960420524,0.2109423314780458,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,Lest the Dramatic Structure be Stillborn,"True to the structure, Iñárritu attacks the subject of love with a multi-pronged approach, addressing three different stages, or complications, common in `love.' All three storylines represent the `struggling' aspect of love. It would be fair to say that Amores Perros, roughly translated to be `Love's a Bitch,' makes the ultimate statement, `Love is a struggle.' More specifically, however, Octavio's narrative can be most suitably seen as the `hunt for love' and acquisition or fight for it. To be with his love, Susana, he must overcome both the fact that his brother is married to her and the fact that his dreams of leaving the city are hamstrung by his less than admirable socio-economic state. Daniel and Valeria, who are about fifteen to twenty years Octavio and Susana's elders, represent love's most frustrating peak - when one is already in it and wants or needs to get out, for better of for worse. Daniel is trying to get out of a marriage in which he has kids to be with the supermodel, Valeria, a woman whose meaning to him is ultimately superficial. El Chivo, whose story is a perfect compliment to Daniel's, represents distance and alienation from love, inwardly looking at it from the outside. He has abandoned his family twenty years prior to become a guerilla terrorist and now operates as a vagabond hit man. It would be difficult to look at these three different `stages' of love in a classically structured film. The episodic structure eases us between each stage, at no point forcing us to tolerate the unrealistic concept of one couple going through all of these stages. Breaking it up into three different narratives, each revolving around different characters, presents the audience with the ability to view each story as independent the others, a more pervasive perspective.However, this film is not a simple three-part love story. In Amores Perros, violence is akin to love. Each character displays this brutally: El Chivo leaves his love to be a terrorist; Octavio engages his dog in violence and even attempts murder to provide money for his love; Daniel and Valeria's relationship is verbally and nearly physically volatile to the point where they hate each other. Each character's love for another character is manifested in their violent acts. This is an interesting theme considering the paradoxical relationship between love and violence, one of which is the induction of harm, the other which is the polar opposite. This juxtaposition of love and violence, if for no other reason, is meant to show the impulsive nature of love. We take it for granted as a compassionate, helping characteristic of life but Iñárritu reveals his characters through this juxtaposition, allowing the audience to consider the consequences of love that are otherwise unforeseen.Iñárritu does a lot of things right in this film. Mainly, he keeps us in constant suspense through the causality of the plot, forcing us to anticipate the results of the characters' actions. This causality can be as brazen as Octavio's decision to stab Jarocho, inevitably leading one into apprehension over what will happen to Octavio. Less obviously, however, is the way he creates suspense around Daniel and Valeria. Their whole relationship is characterized by conflict. While this makes for good dialogue, it insists upon a boiling point - one that is anticipated throughout the entire length of their chapter. Likewise, there is delicate suspense over what Valeria's disfigurement will mean for their relationship. Not only is Daniel forced to confront whether or not Valeria's beauty is the only thing keeping them together, but Valeria must adjust to living without her beauty. Suspense revolves around El Chivo from the moment he first comes onto screen. We see him. He murders someone. We're back to the story of Octavio. The entire first two hours of the movie beg of an answer as to who this man is and what he has to do with the subject of the film. We later find out, not only does he have everything to do with it; he makes the film, seeking redemption on behalf of every other love-torn character. The type of monologue Emilio Echevarria's character, El Chivo, delivers at the end of the film would have a completely different meaning in a film without an episodic structure, in which case he would only be seeking redemption for himself. However, the way Iñárritu cross cuts between El Chivo and the other characters, in all their woe - the consequences of their actions, applies greater meaning to El Chivo's words and actions in the final scene.Perhaps where we get some of the most important information about the characters, and Amores Perros as a whole, is through what is representative. Iñárritu makes steady use of symbols and motifs throughout the film, some of which work well, lending themselves nicely to the dramatic structure of the film, others failing to enhance the story. For example, the massive Enchant billboard looming above Valeria's apartment like the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg is one of the more lackluster motifs in the film. First, we are unavoidably asking, `Why they would want to live under that thing in the first place? Second, the removal of the billboard coinciding with the fall of Valeria's career, Daniel's self-assurance, their relationship, whatever you want to intuit, is much to explicit for this film. The more understated motifs such as the recurring telephone ring, `Bueno?.Bueno?' someone always answers, come off better. This repetition is telling of the deception and unfaithfulness rampant in this world. It works. Another representative device that supplements the story is how the dogs act as metaphors for their respective owners. El Chivo's dogs are the very embodiment of him. They are all strays much the same way he is a vagrant. Cofi, Octavio's rottweiler is equivalent to Octavio in his impulsive and aggressive behavior. This is displayed in Cofi most notably during the fight scenes, but we see it particularly in Octavio when he head-butts his brother, Ramiro, and when he stabs Jarocho in the stomach and thereby provoking the car chase. Valeria's dog, Richie, is lost under the floorboards, confined for most of this narrative. Valeria is physically much the same way, confined to her wheelchair. More implicitly, she is confined to a life that has been propped up around her by people who idolize, envy, or lust after her. Valeria's death is also parallel to her dog's death in that they both die from their respective internment, Valeria being trapped in a room and too immobile to save herself, Richie trapped in the floor and too exhausted to fend off armies hungry rats. The motifs and metaphors within each narrative help structure them as self-contained bodies.The episodic structure of Amores Perros could have been damaging to the film had it not been for the inspired way the stories overlap only so much as to not exasperate the audience. In the three stories, rarely does a character from one interact with a character from another, outside the unifying car crash scene. There are truly only two occurrences: when El Chivo, sword in hand, scares off a frustrated Jarocho who plans to sic his dog on one of El Chivo's, and when Valeria appears on a Mexican morning show broadcast into Octavio's home the morning of the accident. This interaction was all that was needed for Amores Perros to be successful as an episodic film. Its structure lends itself well to subject matter and storyline. Iñárritu tells it to us this way; the literary devices at use bring it to life and its structure gives it legs to move. Throughout it, so well crafted, one can mentally fuse all three stories together and see one single character going through the process of fighting for love, realizing what a trivial pursuit it is, abandoning it, and then spending the rest of his life trying to touch it from behind the bars self-guilt.",lest dramatic structure be stillborn,true structure i rritu attacks subject love with multi

twenty years prior become guerilla terrorist now operates as vagabond hit man it would be difficult look at these three different stages love classically structured film episodic structure eases us between each stage at no point forcing us tolerate unrealistic concept one couple going through all these stages breaking it up into three different narratives each revolving around different characters presents audience with ability view each story as independent others more pervasive perspective however this film is not simple three part love story amores perros violence is akin love each character displays this brutally el chivo leaves his love be terrorist octavio engages his dog violence even attempts murder provide money his love daniel valerias relationship is verbally nearly physically volatile point where they hate each other each characters love another character is manifested their violent acts this is interesting theme considering paradoxical relationship between love violence one which is induction harm other which is polar opposite this juxtaposition love violence if no other reason is meant show impulsive nature love we take it granted as compassionate helping characteristic life but i rritu reveals his characters through this juxtaposition allowing audience consider consequences love that are otherwise unforeseen i rritu does lot things right this film mainly he keeps us constant suspense through causality plot forcing us anticipate results characters actions this causality can be as brazen as octavios decision stab jarocho inevitably leading one into apprehension over what will happen octavio less obviously however is way he creates suspense around daniel valeria their whole relationship is characterized by conflict while this makes good dialogue it insists upon boiling point one that is anticipated throughout entire length their chapter likewise there is delicate suspense over what valerias disfigurement will mean their relationship not only is daniel forced confront whether or not valerias beauty is only thing keeping them together but valeria must adjust living without her beauty suspense revolves around el chivo moment he first comes onto screen we see him he murders someone were back story octavio entire first two hours movie beg answer as who this man is what he has do with subject film we later find out not only does he have everything do with it he makes film seeking redemption behalf every other love torn character type monologue emilio echevarrias character el chivo delivers at end film would have completely different meaning film without episodic structure which case he would only be seeking redemption himself however way i rritu cross cuts between el chivo other characters all their woe consequences their actions applies greater meaning el chivos words actions final scene perhaps where we get some most important information about characters amores perros as whole is through what is representative i rritu makes steady use symbols motifs throughout film some which work well lending themselves nicely dramatic structure film others failing enhance story example massive enchant

removal billboard coinciding with fall valerias career daniels self assurance their relationship whatever you want intuit is much explicit this film more understated motifs such as recurring telephone ring bueno bueno someone always answers come off better this repetition is telling deception unfaithfulness rampant this world it works another representative device that supplements story is how dogs act as metaphors their respective owners el chivos dogs are very embodiment him they are all strays much same way he is vagrant cofi octavios rottweiler is equivalent octavio his impulsive aggressive behavior this is displayed cofi most notably during fight scenes but we see it particularly octavio when he head butts his brother ramiro when he stabs jarocho stomach thereby provoking car chase

9.0,Do dogs have personal characters? Or they just try to be loyal to their owners? What if they reflect our personalities by means of their loyalty?,"Thanks to contributors, plot synopsis has been very well written. Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly life-like vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies, we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash, and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.The more you see this film over and over again you'll get to a deeper point where the lives and choices of the characters won't matter any more. It's still affecting in the first-time watch, but with an examining view the next time you see it; you're driven into a vision, a cast of mind.There were 3 main characters and 3 main stories from each one, which are nested altogether. If we look at these stories over the characters' relationships with their dogs, it's intriguing. As if the dogs exemplify their owners: 1' Young loafer Octavio commits crime in order to earn money to make a living. He fights his dog Cofi in dog-fighting tournaments. How Cofi needs to fight for his life, so does need Octavio to commit crime for his life.2' In the second story, beautiful model Valeria receives a surprise gift from her fiancé to choose a puppy from a pet store. By time, the puppy gets used to live a super-luxury pet life; which is the same life style of her owner. Valeria and her fiancé's apartment unit is under a hardwood flooring construction. One day while alone at home the puppy falls into a gap between the hardwood and the concrete; thus stays stuck there and began to squawk, since she is not used to live without comfort. At the same day her owner Valeria gets involved in a car accident while driving alone, having no one to help her just as happened to her puppy. She loses her leg in this accident and her luxury life comes to an end, as same as the life of her puppy. She begins complaining like her puppy squawking.3' In the last story, the grim hit-man El Chivo saves the life of Octavio's dog Cofi, after Octavio gets killed in the traffic accident in which Valeria lost her leg. Saving him changes Cofi's life, he no longer needs to fight for Octavio's bets on dog-fighting. His life becomes safe and peaceful. El Chivo starts looking after Cofi beside his other dogs. Among the other dogs Cofi looks very ugly and dirty. One day when El Chivo leaves the dogs together at home, Cofi kills every one of them. His reason of killing all the dogs explains why his owner is a hit-man. As Cofi killed innocent dogs; El Chivo kills innocent people for El Chivo seeing himself ugly,dirty and strange among the people; like his dog feeling himself ugly,dirty and strange among the dogs. El Chivo feels bad about his dogs, when he finds out Cofi has killed them. Yet, he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that Cofi's attitude gave him a lesson of life. Then El Chivo shaves, cuts his beard and hair, gets cleaned up and turns out looking like a gentleman. Cofi's attitude changes his life; his life becomes safe and peaceful just as when El Chivo saved Cofi's life.The vision we're getting when we compare these 3 stories is about the public loneliness of an individual. The only person, who can guide and who can help us, is ourselves. This loneliness brings our freedom of choices. With making our own choices, we build the essence of our character: Our quintessences. Life is sum of all our choices. In order to build our quintessences; we always face the risk, fear and pressure of the chance of making a wrong choice. Life makes it obligatory to make choices. This obligatory builds our inner crisis and develops our personality. To find the secrets of our own personality, we try to find someone or something else to lay a burden on the responsibility of self-search. Here in Amores Perros, the 3 main characters are used by their self-search reflection on their dogs.Doesn't this vision form the idea of Jean Paul Sartre's ""Being and Nothingness""? Since Amores Perros hides the character views through the situations created by dogs; it is a movie that has no characters, but only situations. This is the systematic of Existentialism. If there was no situation or happening, there wouldn't have been any characters. Existence precedes essence. A person is nothing without his actions. So, a person doesn't have a soul(or a character) if he is not alive. Then there wasn't and won't be anything before and after our lives. If we don't believe in this vision, certainly the signs of fate that we come across in our lives must be delusion.",do dogs have personal characters or they just try be loyal their owners what if they reflect our personalities by means their loyalty,thanks contributors plot synopsis has been very well written amores perros is included most important movies beginning 21st century it marked new epoch with its thoroughly life like vision twist fate then 5 years time within more recognized movies we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each persons fate one them was crash it won best picture oscar 2005 more you see this film over over again youll get deeper point where lives choices characters wont matter any more its still affecting first time watch but with examining view next time you see it youre driven into vision cast mind there were 3 main characters 3 main stories each one which are nested altogether if we look at these stories over characters relationships with their dogs its intriguing as if dogs exemplify their owners 1 young loafer octavio commits crime order earn money make living he fights his dog cofi dog fighting tournaments how cofi needs fight his life so does need octavio commit crime his life 2 second story beautiful model valeria receives surprise gift her fianc choose puppy pet store by time puppy gets used live super luxury pet life which is same life style her owner valeria her fianc s apartment unit is under hardwood flooring construction one day while alone at home puppy falls into gap between hardwood concrete thus stays stuck there began squawk since she is not used live without comfort at same day her owner valeria gets involved car accident while driving alone having no one help her just as happened her puppy she loses her leg this accident her luxury life comes end as same as life her puppy she begins complaining like her puppy squawking 3 last story grim hit man el chivo saves life octavios dog cofi after octavio gets killed traffic accident which valeria lost her leg saving him changes cofis life he no longer needs fight octavios bets dog fighting his life becomes safe peaceful el chivo starts looking after cofi beside his other dogs among other dogs cofi looks very ugly dirty one day when el chivo leaves dogs together at home cofi kills every one them his reason killing all dogs explains why his owner is hit man as cofi killed innocent dogs el chivo kills innocent people el chivo seeing himself ugly dirty strange among people like his dog feeling himself ugly dirty strange among dogs el chivo feels bad about his dogs when he finds out cofi has killed them yet he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that cofis attitude gave him lesson life then el chivo shaves cuts his beard hair gets cleaned up turns out looking like gentleman cofis attitude changes his life his life becomes safe peaceful just as when el chivo saved cofis life vision were getting when we compare these 3 stories is about public loneliness individual only person who can guide who can help us is ourselves this loneliness brings our freedom choices with making our own choices we build essence our character our quintessences life is sum all our choices order build our quintessences we always face risk fear pressure chance making wrong choice life makes it obligatory make choices this obligatory builds our inner crisis develops our personality find secrets our own personality we try find someone or something else lay burden responsibility self search here amores perros 3 main characters are used by their self search reflection their dogs doesnt this vision form idea jean paul sartres being nothingness since amores perros hides character views through situations created by dogs it is movie that has no characters but only situations this is systematic existentialism if there was no situation or happening there wouldnt have been any characters existence precedes essence person is nothing without his actions so person doesnt have soul or character if he is not alive then there wasnt wont be anything before after our lives if we dont believe this vision certainly signs fate that we come across our lives must be delusion,0.4750147579693034,0.04590974681883774,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,"Must've beaten Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the Academy Awards","I think we're talking about one of the best Mexican films ever (i say so, knowing there's been excellent Luis Buñuel films as well as Arturo Ripstein ones, like 'Principio y Fin' -Begining and End- that is this director's highest peak (based on the book by Naguib Mafusz)and Emilio 'El Indio' Fernandez ones that i don't personally like that much (even though he received the Golden Bear in the 'Berlinale').Being surrounded by terrible Mexican movies, 'Amores Perros' was so refreshing and remarkably above every expectation that everybody could have about a first-time director (even though he was well-known for his wonderful work at advertising (changing the way ads were made in Mexico) and as a radio DJ in a WFM radio station that contributed to change radio in Mexico, too, along with Rock 101. Gonzalez Iñarritu (in cooperation with his almost personal screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga) creates such a complex yet flawless history based on three individual ones that converge not only in the dantesque (reference to Dante Alighieri's style, The Divine Comedy) car accident, but in their perception and description of how love can be harsh, as well as life itself, of how love can get to be a bitch, a struggle.First Story ('Octavio y Susana') is about Octavio's (Garcia Bernal) obsession with his sister-in-law, Susana (Vanessa Bauche), but it's also about the violence, about an illusion, about betrayal, about loss. This is also reflected in the character of Octavio's dog, Cofi in a parallel relationship with his owner while he seeks his own destiny, having lost everything, he'll have to redefine his life. This parallelism also occurs in the second story('Daniel y Valeria'), an almost surreal one, where Ritchie being trapped underneath the condo's floor represents how it's owner Valeria (Goya Toledo) is trapped in a relation with Daniel that grows sicker as her injury (caused by the car accident) gets worse. The removal of the gigantic advertising of 'Enchant', the scent campaign that she used to be the image for, from the view of her balcony represents their decline: Daniel (Avaro Guerrero) left behind his marriage for this superficial mirage kind of dream, and she will have to make a whole redefinition of her life after losing everything. The dog-character parallelism with the main characters of this film can also be noticed in the third story ('El Chivo y Maru'), where 'El Chivo' (Emilio Echevaria), a former College teacher that left it all, family included, to become some guerrilla terrorist (is there a symbolism for Subcommander Marcos, from EZLN?), and now finds, by losing it all (all of his dogs being killed), but finding a new reason, new company just before a hit-man-type mission where he sets a confrontation between two brothers in such a biblical style the chance that none of the characters from the rest of the stories had: redemption. That's when he decides to retrieve some of the things he has lost, like Maru (Lourdes Echevarria -Emilio's actual daughter in real life), by at least apologizing to her, and redeeming himself finding a new life. It's clear that he'll stop being a homeless, because by the end of the movie he's got plenty of money. This story is one step ahead of the other two, cause after the loss they are all victims of, 'El Chivo' is the only one who gets that chance to start from scratch once again. Huge merit to Emilio Echevarria's performance for making believable the only character that was in risk of not being plausible of the film. Because of the relation within the characters, their dogs and their own love personal story, the title is, too a big success (both in Spanish and in English). Of the episodic narrative structure of the movie (a few critics in the Cannes Film Festival compared it with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction), it can be said that besides making it more beautiful and complex, it's also necessary. One can't figure a way to resolve the situation other than this one. The thrill, the shock would never be the same. For example, if each one was a short film instead, it wouldn't work the same way as the whole movie.In the film, Gonzalez Iñarritu allows himself to appear a few times: in the editorial where Daniel works, for example, verifying a magazine cover; having some of the TV spots he made in the 90's when he was a publicist shown in the movie; and in the last scene, 'El Chivo' names the dog he rescued (formerly known as Cofi) as 'El Negro', Iñarritu's nickname.",mustve beaten crouching tiger hidden dragon academy awards,i think were talking about one best mexican films ever i say so knowing theres been excellent luis bu uel films as well as arturo ripstein ones like principio y fin begining end that is this directors highest peak based book by naguib mafusz emilio el indio fernandez ones that i dont personally like that much even though he received golden bear berlinale being surrounded by terrible mexican movies amores perros was so refreshing remarkably above every expectation that everybody could have about first time director even though he was well known his wonderful work at advertising changing way ads were made mexico as radio dj wfm radio station that contributed change radio mexico too along with rock 101 gonzalez i arritu cooperation with his almost personal screenwriter guillermo arriaga creates such complex yet flawless history based three individual ones that converge not only dantesque reference dante alighieris style divine comedy car accident but their perception description how love can be harsh as well as life itself how love can get be bitch struggle first story octavio y susana is about octavios garcia bernal obsession with his sister law susana vanessa bauche but its also about violence about illusion about betrayal about loss this is also reflected character octavios dog cofi parallel relationship with his owner while he seeks his own destiny having lost everything hell have redefine his life this parallelism also occurs second story daniel y valeria almost surreal one where ritchie being trapped underneath condos floor represents how its owner valeria goya toledo is trapped relation with daniel that grows sicker as her injury caused by car accident gets worse removal gigantic advertising enchant scent campaign that she used be image view her balcony represents their decline daniel avaro guerrero left behind his marriage this superficial mirage kind dream she will have make whole redefinition her life after losing everything dog character parallelism with main characters this film can also be noticed third story el chivo y maru where el chivo emilio echevaria former college teacher that left it all family included become some guerrilla terrorist is there symbolism subcommander marcos ezln now finds by losing it all all his dogs being killed but finding new reason new company just before hit man type mission where he sets confrontation between two brothers such biblical style chance that none characters rest stories had redemption thats when he decides retrieve some things he has lost like maru lourdes echevarria emilios actual daughter real life by at least apologizing her redeeming himself finding new life its clear that hell stop being homeless because by end movie hes got plenty money this story is one step ahead other two cause after loss they are all victims el chivo is only one who gets that chance start scratch once again huge merit emilio echevarrias performance making believable only character that was risk not being plausible film because relation within characters their dogs their own love personal story title is too big success both spanish english episodic narrative structure movie few critics cannes film festival compared it with tarantinos pulp fiction it can be said that besides making it more beautiful complex its also necessary one cant figure way resolve situation other than this one thrill shock would never be same example if each one was short film instead it wouldnt work same way as whole movie film gonzalez i arritu allows himself appear few times editorial where daniel works example verifying magazine cover having some tv spots he made 90s when he was publicist shown movie last scene el chivo names dog he rescued formerly known as cofi as el negro i arritus nickname,0.4209049959049958,0.12917690417690417,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"

The rest of my time with Amores Perros was spent wondering why none of these people have caller ID, wondering whether this movie set some kind of record for most fake dead dogs in a film, wondering who El Chivo reminded me of (Il Duce from Boondock Saints), wondering why they just didn't cover the darn hole (who leaves gaping holes in the middle of their apartment floor?), and trying to think up a name for the dog (never came up with anything I liked more than Lost Dog).

7.0,"Good, but I didn't get much out of it","Three stories are connected by a horrific car accident in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's feature film debut. All three stories also revolve, at least to some extent, around dogs (the title translates to Love's a Bitch, with ""Bitch"" having a double meaning). The three stories vary in interest, in my opinion, and I struggled by the end to connect them or really to care about any of them on a deep level. Still, it's a pretty entertaining flick and very strongly directed. In the first story, Gael Garcia Bernal stars as a young man who's in love with his older brother's wife. He decides to enter his rottweiler into a series of dog fights, but he runs up against an opponent who isn't keen on losing. In the second story, a model (Goya Toledo) moves in with her boyfriend, but their happiness is immediately destroyed by the aforementioned accident. During her recovery, her beloved terrier disappears into a hole in their apartment's hardwood floor and never comes back. In the third story, a hit-man (Emilio Echevarria) who poses as a bum has an existential crisis.

7.0,Amores Perros,"Director Alejandro Iñárritu heralded the Mexican New Wave cinema with Amores Perros.Between 2010 to 2020. Iñárritu, Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro have won 5 Best Director Oscars between them.Amores Perros in some ways has a beginning reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs. It has a dog bleeding profusely in the back of a car instead of Mr Orange who has just been shot.The rest of the film has a jumbled narrative. A bit like Pulp Fiction. However that is where the similarities end.A car crash in the streets of Mexico links three set of stories.The first story is about Octavio (Gael García Bernal) who lusts after his sister in law Susana. She is married to his older brother Ramiro who brutalises her. Already pregnant with a second child. Octavio enters the world of dog fights to earn enough money to run away with her.Luckily the dog he has is a beast who beats all comers. However a rival hoodlum does not like Octavio, his older brother and the dog. That is the catalyst which leads to the car chase and the eventual crash.The second story concerns rising model Valeria. She has just moved into a luxury apartment with her older married lover. Disaster strikes as she is badly injured in a car crash. When she arrives home with a severely injured leg. Her dog disappears under the floorboards.The third story concerns El Chivo. He is in the periphery of society and has a tangential role in the first two parts of the story.He is a tramp who roams the streets with his cart and a pack of dogs. He rushes to aid Octavia in the aftermath of the car accident.It also turns out that El Chivo was once a well respected academic. A family man who became a revolutionary and was then jailed. After leaving prison, he became a hitman but now sees things differently when he reads news that his ex wife has died.This is a full throated movie. It is a visceral study of the working class and the underclass of Mexico.The dog fighting scenes although short can be off putting for some. Octavio is one of the nicer people in the movie. Ramiro is not only rough with his wife. Despite working in a supermarket he is also a violent robber.Although Valeria represents the aspirational celebrity strata. Her story is an allegory.The dog being lost underneath the floorboards that is crawling with rats shows how easy it is to slide down. Valeria loses modelling work and her lover wants to get back with his wife.

,Panting Astrology,"Spoilers herein.I believe that the future of film is now firmly in the hands of Spanish-speaking filmmakers. Not that they make the best films, but that they have the current crop of ideas. We saw Italians introduce us to the notion that a camera can be tethered to the soul of a character and follow him around. This is still the standard of the much celebrated Scorsese.The French were briefly interesting when to this they added the notion of reflexivity, where the mechanics of film-making became a character. Hollywood - in their more interesting films - extended this notion of folding to an amazing collection of ironic and self-referential devices.Meanwhile, Spanish literature was long incubating a synthesis of fabulism within self- reference (Cervantes invented the notion) combined with earthy sensuality, sometimes natural energy.So in contrast to the Scorsese-led `character' stuff, and the often mechanical Hollywood folding exercises, we get Spanish films from Medem, Almodovar and Garcia. Rodriguez is very much in this camp. And now this.Yes, it is overly long and uneven. Yes it is artificially gritty and has some dishonest performances. But it is extremely well constructed, both on a dramatic and conceptual level.Folding in this context is placed in the fantasy of rather than perspective or character. Why give several stories? Taratino does because Kar Wai Wong does, and his motive is to bleach the story away and focus on the musical texture of the mood. But Garcia does it (`Ten Tiny Love Stories,' `Things You Can Tell By Just Looking at Her.') to synthesize a single entity out of many and a single larger context out of the many sketched situations. The focus is on that larger context, and what magical dynamics are at work. It is pop cosmology as art drawn from drowning the soap opera content. It is new melodrama - melodrama is when the characters are puppets to external forces - with attention to interesting exposition and subterranean channels of those forces.Fate.

7.0,Excellent Storytelling But Flawed,"I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for £8. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.When Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it's not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn't seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it's best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.The movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn't taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn't seem very convincing and doesn't really go anywhere. You think it's just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn't make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn't make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. Another good solid foreign film that didn't hit all the marks but still very good.",excellent storytelling but flawed,i was really looking forward this as i had heard all hype about it off imdb managed get it dvd sale 8 only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights it i dont take kindly watching animal cruelty films i know its not real but it reminds me that it does happen some countries its just bit upsetting but i thought myself its only movie i am sure it wont take anything away it thankfully it didnt i liked way they put beginning film reminding us that no animal was hurt during course movie because people dont usually watch credits at end unless they really want because that quote about animals doesnt really come up till very last bit credits but without it at beginning then i am sure there would be lot very upset people but back film amores perros is all about three different stories that come together through car accident we see how there lives are before after accident we start off with octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother mother his brothers girlfriend who he has taken shine his brother is always at him smacks about his partner which doesnt like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken his story begins when his dog kills champion fighting dog owned by ruthless gangster town when octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape slums mexico city but its not so easy as he wants take his brother girlfriend her baby with him but she takes some convincing other story is do with valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife kids her but terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound she loses her grip wanting enjoy her life things start become hard her her lover but only thing that is keeping her occupied is love her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath floor boards valeria worries as there are rats down there doesnt seem find way getting dog out as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting last story is with el chiro homeless man with nothing his life apart his love his own pet dogs he also has past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed see his daughter after he walked out family but now is ex wife is dead he tries make up what he has done with his daughter but family do its best keep him away obsolete her life movie is very long has lot unneeded scenes it i really wasnt taken by story valeria as it didnt seem very convincing doesnt really go anywhere you think its just about get interesting but at last minute it has gone it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out entire screen as she doesnt make difference if i had it my own way then i would have kept whole film focusing octavio his dog cofi trying their best gather enough money get out there depressing lives with el chiro coming one or two scenes make it lot more interesting this doesnt make amores perros bad film just not great one you will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again its not sort film you go back watch it again again unless it intrigued you another good solid foreign film that didnt hit all marks but still very good,0.5002242036570396,0.13810729900282137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.25}"
9.0,Brutally Powerful,"'Amores Perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu. It's a difficult film to watch, one which continuously challenges its audience, but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. It puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love, and those who are destroyed by it. It gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation, 'love is a bitch'.In a single moment in time, several lives in Mexico City will be changed forever by a devastating car crash. The film divides itself into three separate segments: representing the past, present, and future. Octavio is searching for recognition and love, but looks in the wrong places. It's a desire that drives him, leading him to make choices in life that will soon haunt him. Valerie, whose life is most impacted by the car accident, finds herself living in a relationship that's crumbling and self-destructing. El Chivo must deal with the absence of his daughter, and the void it's left in his life. He finds companionship in the dogs he picks up off the street, and they soon become the only living things he can connect with. Together, the lives of these individuals will collide in more ways than one. They will find themselves connected by a single thread: love. And the hell that can be unleashed with it.When I finished watching 'Amores Perros', one of the first things that popped into my mind was why 'Babel' couldn't have been this good. Where 'Babel' lacked in emotional depths and highs, 'Amores Perros' at times finds itself drowning in it. It's a visceral and gritty film, so raw and intense. You may think you've seen it all, but 'Perros' will challenge even those who are rarely phased by cinema. You may find it difficult not to look away at times. Iñarritu's movie has been described as being a 'dog holocaust', and at times I can't disagree. The film's sheer violence is so penetrating and disturbing, it packs a mighty punch. And while this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart, there's no question that 'Amores Perros' has a tender heart and message ready to be heard. Iñarritu crafts a compelling story from start to finish, which strips down to the bare basics. His ability to capture a piece of the human spirit is wondrous, even if it doesn't always cast us in the best light. It's dark, fierce, and relentless, but nothing short of greatness.'Amores Perros' features an array of actors and actresses, all of which work wonders in their respective roles. Gael Garcia Bernal is, as always, brilliant. It's a more restrained and less quirky role than many are used to seeing him in, but nonetheless has the rare ability to capture and audience's attention with ease. Emilio Echevarria stars as El Chivo, and delivers a haunting performance as a man who finds himself alone and saddened. It's the weakest part of the film, but is made up for by Emilio's wonderful presence. Goya Toledo plays Valerie, a celebrity crippled by the accident the film revolves around. I found her part in the story to be most interesting, if not for the fact of seeing the life of someone who goes from having it all to nothing at all. There are many numerous performances, too many to cover, but they all lend their talents to create something extraordinary.'Amores Perros' is an adrenaline rush for its entire running, which tops two-and-a-half hours. It's all a very human and primal film, which can be attributed to Iñarritu's impeccable style and talent. Combining a mutli-faceted story with electric performances, 'Perros' works on many different layers to satisfying results. An original and bold step in film-making, this nearly perfect picture will have you experience a collage of emotions, and invest in flawed characters... all for the sake of love.",brutally powerful,amores perros is shocking experience visionary director alejandro gonzalez i arritu its difficult film watch one which continuously challenges its audience but reward itself those who can withstand its brutality it puts magnifying glass pain love those who are destroyed by it it gives new meaning film titles literal translation love is bitch single moment time several lives mexico city will be changed forever by devastating car crash film divides itself into three separate segments representing past present future octavio is searching recognition love but looks wrong places its desire that drives him leading him make choices life that will soon haunt him valerie whose life is most impacted by car accident finds herself living relationship thats crumbling self destructing el chivo must deal with absence his daughter void its left his life he finds companionship dogs he picks up off street they soon become only living things he can connect with together lives these individuals will collide more ways than one they will find themselves connected by single thread love hell that can be unleashed with it when i finished watching amores perros one first things that popped into my mind was why babel couldnt have been this good where babel lacked emotional depths highs amores perros at times finds itself drowning it its visceral gritty film so raw intense you may think youve seen it all but perros will challenge even those who are rarely phased by cinema you may find it difficult not look away at times i arritus movie has been described as being dog holocaust at times i cant disagree films sheer violence is so penetrating disturbing it packs mighty punch while this film is definitely not squeamish or faint heart theres no question that amores perros has tender heart message ready be heard i arritu crafts compelling story start finish which strips down bare basics his ability capture piece human spirit is wondrous even if it doesnt always cast us best light its dark fierce relentless but nothing short greatness amores perros features array actors actresses all which work wonders their respective roles gael garcia bernal is as always brilliant its more restrained less quirky role than many are used seeing him but nonetheless has rare ability capture audiences attention with ease emilio echevarria stars as el chivo delivers haunting performance as man who finds himself alone saddened its weakest part film but is made up by emilios wonderful presence goya toledo plays valerie celebrity crippled by accident film revolves around i found her part story be most interesting if not fact seeing life someone who goes having it all nothing at all there are many numerous performances too many cover but they all lend their talents create something extraordinary amores perros is adrenaline rush its entire running which tops two half hours its all very human primal film which can be attributed i arritus impeccable style talent combining mutli faceted story with electric performances perros works many different layers satisfying results original bold step film making this nearly perfect picture will have you experience collage emotions invest flawed characters all sake love,0.5702446024185155,0.15149297160166725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"

5.0,What's the big deal?,"Will someone please tell me what all the fuss is about? If the presence of gore is the gauge of cinematic skill, then yes, AMORES PERROS is a masterpiece. But surely one first-time director's fascination with maimed dogs and Mexicanismo does not a 21st-century film template make. Granted, it's a somewhat cleverly crafted story, but this blood-guts-passion trip through Mexico City fails to make any real point or leave the audience with much to ponder. (Though I did find myself contemplating how they managed to locate all those dead-dog body doubles for the live dogs...)AMORES PERROS, which the film translates as ""Love is a Bitch,"" might be better rendered ""Love is Like a Dog,"" or ""Some of These People Actually LOVE Dogs,"" or ""If You Love Your Dog, Don't See This Movie."" It opens with a truly gruesome car crash in which blood and guts swirl around liberally. If you happen to walk in late, never fear: the scene will replay twice more. With this event as the anchor, the film flashes back and forward on the lives directly and tangentially involved--what led up to this bloody wreck and how it affects all concerned.Driving the offending vehicle is Octavio (Gael García Bernal), brother of the abusive Ramiro (Marco Pérez) and lover-in-waiting of his wife, Susana (Vanessa Bauche). Octavio's role is basically to hang around the house panting at his sister-in-law, until he decides to make money by entering Ramiro's vicious mastiff in dog fights. The car he's slammed into conveys supermodel Valeria (Goya Toledo), whose successful career ends on impact. She is mistress to Daniel (Álvaro Guerrero), who's gone middle-age crazy and separated from his wife to live with Valeria 24/7. The supermodel's true love, however, is her moplike Lhasa apso, Richie.The triptych's third panel focuses on El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría), a former revolutionary. Imprisoned while his daughter was born, he has never met her, though he's remained obsessed with images of her for more than 20 years. He moons over her while alternately practicing his assassination skills and living with his own pack of canines.AMORES PERROS is the debut film of director Alejandro González Inárritu, a Mexican DJ who's apparently seen PULP FICTION a few times. While it doesn't slavishly imitate Tarantino, it noticeably cops a few of his moves. Like a bad case of coffee nerves, the film functions best at high velocity and on razor's edge. There's plenty of speeded-up action, trick cuts, and always the threat of imminent gore. With many scenes rife with tension, AMORES often strays into telenovela territory, though it's tough to tell if the melodrama is intentional.Yet, strangely enough, after all this adrenaline puts us on red alert, we are thrust into an extremely tedious middle portion, in which Valeria's dog gets trapped beneath floorboards and the hapless couple can't reckon how to retrieve him. Richie whines night after night, Valeria whines night after night, fights ensue, she stages a minirevolt from her wheelchair--and we're left with a yawning, ""And your point is....""Is love a bitch? Sure. Do people treat their loves like dogs? Sometimes. Is this a rich metaphor that bears 2 1/2 hours of graphically violent exploration? Not really. Does this represent, as raves the NEW YORK TIMES, ""the first classic of the new decade""?

8.0,A hard-hitting debut from one of the modern eras great directors,"Becoming one of the most well-regarded and unique filmmakers of the modern era, Mexican born director Alejandro G. Iñárritu started his career off in exemplary fashion with his Oscar nominated and critically praised multi-narrative drama Amores Perros, a hard-hitting experience that was a sign of things to come for the future Oscar winner.Spanning three separate stories, all interconnected through an horrific car crash and a shared bond with a four legged friend, Amores Perros is both an unflinching look at love and life in Mexico, as our various flawed individuals (all of whom aren't likable as such but remain humanistic in their behaviors and decision making) find their lives unraveling around them to various degrees.Our first introduction to this world is through Gael García Bernal's Octavia and his pursuit of Vanessa Bauche's Susana, a pursuit that leads him into the dangerous and horrific world of dog fighting, as we are then welcomed into the world of Goya Toledo's supermodel Valeria and then Emilio Echevarría vagrant El Chivo, a man more at home with dogs than his own kind.There's barely an ounce of respite from the unending relentlessness of Iñárritu's examinations of the harsh realities of love and life in the troubled country of his birth, championed by Guillermo Arriaga's rugged script (a partnership that would spawn 21 Grams and Babel also) and D.O.P Rodrigo Prieto's documentary like filming style, giving Amores Perros a rough and raw veneer but also one that has been clearly designed for the purpose at hand.Not many films before or since Iñárritu's exercise in consistent bombardment of life's troubles have managed to capture the frenetic nature of every day life and every day struggles, particularly south of the border, with the films first 60 minutes in particular hugely impressive, even more so when you consider this was the directors first feature film effort.Filled with abundant energy and intrigue around Octavia and Susana's potentially elopement, Amores Perros never truly reaches its early heights again as Valeria's story strand in particular suffers from a sense of over indulgence and El Chivo's more over the top story strand taking some time to get use to.There's no doubt there's elements of each stories importance and emotional resonance but it's a shame Amores Perros couldn't maintain the early pace it sets, a facet Iñárritu was able to iron out with his future efforts, most notably in Birdman and The Revenant, films that managed to combine all the best elements of the director in one cohesive package.Final Say -A tough watch that set the tone for Alejandro G. Iñárritu's impressive and still growing in stature career, Amores Perros is rough around the edges and suffers from some middling moments in its middle and latter sections but when it punches, it punches hard.4 chocolate treats out 5",hard hitting debut one modern eras great directors,becoming one most well regarded unique filmmakers modern era mexican born director alejandro g i rritu started his career off exemplary fashion with his oscar nominated critically praised multi narrative drama amores perros hard hitting experience that was sign things come future oscar winner spanning three separate stories all interconnected through horrific car crash shared bond with four legged friend amores perros is both unflinching look at love life mexico as our various flawed individuals all whom arent likable as such but remain humanistic their behaviors decision making find their lives unraveling around them various degrees our first introduction this world is through gael garc bernals octavia his pursuit vanessa bauches susana pursuit that leads him into dangerous horrific world dog fighting as we are then welcomed into world goya toledos supermodel valeria then emilio echevarr vagrant el chivo man more at home with dogs than his own kind theres barely ounce respite unending relentlessness i rritus examinations harsh realities love life troubled country his birth championed by guillermo arriagas rugged script partnership that would spawn 21 grams babel also d o p rodrigo prietos documentary like filming style giving amores perros rough raw veneer but also one that has been clearly designed purpose at hand not many films before or since i rritus exercise consistent bombardment lifes troubles have managed capture frenetic nature every day life every day struggles particularly south border with films first 60 minutes particular hugely impressive even more so when you consider this was directors first feature film effort filled with abundant energy intrigue around octavia susanas potentially elopement amores perros never truly reaches its early heights again as valerias story strand particular suffers sense over indulgence el chivos more over top story strand taking some time get use theres no doubt theres elements each stories importance emotional resonance but its shame amores perros couldnt maintain early pace it sets facet i rritu was able iron out with his future efforts most notably birdman revenant films that managed combine all best elements director one cohesive package final say tough watch that set tone alejandro g i rritus impressive still growing stature career amores perros is rough around edges suffers some middling moments its middle latter sections but when it punches it punches hard 4 chocolate treats out 5,0.5448921448921447,0.12111653778320447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,"A Car Crash, Canines and Consequences Examined in Iñárritu's Viscerally Powerful Feature Film Debut","If like me, you were dazzled by this year's ""Babel"", you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to ""Babel"", this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga (who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy, ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel""), all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City, and as the title implies (English translation: ""Love's a Bitch""), dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like ""Babel"", the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes, it consistently holds your attention.The first plot line, ""Octavio and Susana"", is about a love triangle that occurs between young Octavio, his abusive older brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife Susana. Dog fighting is common sport in their downscale neighborhood, and the brothers own a rottweiler that's a natural aggressor in the fight pit. Octavio sees the dog as his meal ticket to steal Susana away from Ramiro and escape to Juarez. The second story, ""Daniel and Valeria"", focuses on Daniel, a married, guilt-ridden TV producer who buys a fancy new condo for him to live with his tempestuous supermodel girlfriend Valeria. Their relationship unravels in light of the car accident, and further complications occur when her little dog is trapped underneath the floorboards. The third story, ""El Chivo and Maru"", is about former political revolutionary El Chivo who has years ago left his family and became a hit man for hire. Living in squalor with a herd of homeless dogs, he is recruited by a businessman to kill his partner, both of whom turns out to be brothers. The integration of these stories is handled with supple dexterity in a non-linear fashion that allows the viewer to peel off the layers of the characters in order to understand their common dilemmas.Unbelievably, this powderkeg of a film represents Iñárritu's feature film debut as a director, and his confidence and audacity are felt throughout although the third episode seems too deliberate a pastiche of ""Pulp Fiction"". He has assembled a superb cast with Emilio Echevarría the standout as the grizzled El Chivo, a scarifying vagrant who reveals himself to be a troubled soul who is the only one who successfully escapes his trying existence. In his first major role, Gael García Bernal portrays Octavio with escalating emotional fervor; and as Susana and Ramiro, Vanessa Bauche and Marco Pérez provide powerful support. Together, they generate a palpable sense of imminent violence throughout their episode. Goya Toledo makes a vivid impression as Valeria, fully capturing her spoiled character's misplaced sense of entitlement, while Alvaro Guerrero affectingly humanizes the put-upon Daniel's increasing regret. Just as he would prove later with ""The Motorcycle Diaries"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Babel"", Rodrigo Prieto showcases superbly evocative cinematography that is in keeping with the emotional shadings of the story.The 2001 DVD provides a surprising number of extras beginning with an informative, often meticulous commentary track by Iñárritu and Arriaga (spoken in Spanish and subtitled in English). There are three quick featurettes. The first is a six-minute short that shows how the numerous dogs used in the film were trained and protected during the production. Considering how realistically violent the dog fighting scenes are, I find this short helpfully reassuring. The second is the standard, making-of featurette, about fifteen minutes long. Even though Iñárritu seems to be promoting the film as well as explaining the genesis of it, there is good behind-the-scenes footage, including some interesting table readings from the cast. This leads to one quick short about the staging of the car accident itself. Also included are about a dozen deleted scenes, totaling about fifteen minutes, which actually help provide context in understanding some of the characters' motivations. There are also three music videos from the movie's soundtrack, which is a dramatically effective mix of Mexican and Spanish rock-rap tracks.",car crash canines consequences examined i rritus viscerally powerful feature film debut,if like me you were dazzled by this years babel you will likely be as curious as i was check out first film director alejandro gonzalez i rritus trilogy about death similar narrative structure babel this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by defining car accident written with dramatic precision by guillermo arriaga who later wrote other two films trilogy 21 grams babel all three take place within different social strata mexico city as title implies english translation loves bitch dogs are intriguingly pivotal each story also like babel various interconnections among stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant gradually revelatory manner even though movie runs epic length 153 minutes it consistently holds your attention first plot line octavio susana is about love triangle that occurs between young octavio his abusive older brother ramiro ramiros wife susana dog fighting is common sport their downscale neighborhood brothers own rottweiler thats natural aggressor fight pit octavio sees dog as his meal ticket steal susana away ramiro escape juarez second story daniel valeria focuses daniel married guilt ridden tv producer who buys fancy new condo him live with his tempestuous supermodel girlfriend valeria their relationship unravels light car accident further complications occur when her little dog is trapped underneath floorboards third story el chivo maru is about former political revolutionary el chivo who has years ago left his family became hit man hire living squalor with herd homeless dogs he is recruited by businessman kill his partner both whom turns out be brothers integration these stories is handled with supple dexterity non linear fashion that allows viewer peel off layers characters order understand their common dilemmas unbelievably this powderkeg film represents i rritus feature film debut as director his confidence audacity are felt throughout although third episode seems too deliberate pastiche pulp fiction he has assembled superb cast with emilio echevarr standout as grizzled el chivo scarifying vagrant who reveals himself be troubled soul who is only one who successfully escapes his trying existence his first major role gael garc bernal portrays octavio with escalating emotional fervor as susana ramiro vanessa bauche marco p rez provide powerful support together they generate palpable sense imminent violence throughout their episode goya toledo makes vivid impression as valeria fully capturing her spoiled characters misplaced sense entitlement while alvaro guerrero affectingly humanizes put upon daniels increasing regret just as he would prove later with motorcycle diaries brokeback mountain babel rodrigo prieto showcases superbly evocative cinematography that is keeping with emotional shadings story 2001 dvd provides surprising number extras beginning with informative often meticulous commentary track by i rritu arriaga spoken spanish subtitled english there are three quick featurettes first is six minute short that shows how numerous dogs used film were trained protected during production considering how realistically violent dog fighting scenes are i find this short helpfully reassuring second is standard making featurette about fifteen minutes long even though i rritu seems be promoting film as well as explaining genesis it there is good behind scenes footage including some interesting table readings cast this leads one quick short about staging car accident itself also included are about dozen deleted scenes totaling about fifteen minutes which actually help provide context understanding some characters motivations there are also three music videos movies soundtrack which is dramatically effective mix mexican spanish rock rap tracks,0.4549037674037672,0.0896089271089271,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1.0,"Brutal, unpleasant, and anyway, what's GOOD about it?","A movie shot in ugly, unsaturated greenish-black colours with a jiggly camera that shows dogs being ripped apart has three serious marks against it, right from the start. It tries to harrow us with sheer length (two and a half hours is a long time under the circumstances), and in this it succeeds: after the truly horrible bit (in part three - you know the scene I'm referring to), I found myself taking an interest in the story at last, perhaps from a lack of anything better to do. But it's too little, too late. The three stories have nothing to do with one another (they coincide spatially at one point - big deal), and they're simply laid before us, without art, like three uncut, rotting slabs of reality TV. If this film were a physical object there would be policemen standing around it saying, ""Move along, nothing to see here."" And they'd be right.",brutal unpleasant anyway whats good about it,movie shot ugly unsaturated greenish black colours with jiggly camera that shows dogs being ripped apart has three serious marks against it right start it tries harrow us with sheer length two half hours is long time under circumstances this it succeeds after truly horrible bit part three you know scene im referring i found myself taking interest story at last perhaps lack anything better do but its too little too late three stories have nothing do with one another they coincide spatially at one point big deal theyre simply laid before us without art like three uncut rotting slabs reality tv if this film were physical object there would be policemen standing around it saying move along nothing see here theyd be right,0.5274891774891776,-0.11626082251082251,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"
