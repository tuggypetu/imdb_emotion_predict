10.0,One of the most path breaking bollywood films ever!!!!,"WOW, what a film, I was pretty much speechless after i exited the theater. The message this film gives is that god is in every human being, then why do we go looking for him in mandhirs, churches, mosaics, gurdwaras, etc Why has god and religion become a business, why do we spends millions and billions of dollars at religious places as people when we can take that same money and help the poor, won't god be more happy then. This and many more messages are conveyed in this movie through characters, like Kanji Bhai, Krishna, etc Another really plus point about the film is that it is told in a light hearted way, in a comedy, the film isn't very preachy and still conveys its beautiful and real message. For me when it comes to performances Paresh Rawal has just done such an amazing job, he deserves all the applauds, accolades, awards, in the world for his portrayal as Kanji bhai. Akshay Kumar as always is very good in a small but important role, his and Paresh's chemistry is just too good. Other notable performances Mithun, was really good as the sadhu, and so was Govind Namdev. Music was good and suited the film very well. All tech aspects were just perfect. Umesh Shukla the director is the heart of the film and he has done an incredible job, he deserves, a national award for his efforts, he was just that good. A special mention for the amazing dialogues very smart and well written,So all in all this is must watch film for not just the people in India, but for everyone in the world. A masterpiece film, this should be India's official entry to the Oscars. its that good and beyond one of the best movies ever made in bollywood. 10 out 10 rating",one most path breaking bollywood films ever,wow what film i was pretty much speechless after i exited theater message this film gives is that god is every human being then why do we go looking him mandhirs churches mosaics gurdwaras etc why has god religion become business why do we spends millions billions dollars at religious places as people when we can take that same money help poor wont god be more happy then this many more messages are conveyed this movie through characters like kanji bhai krishna etc another really plus point about film is that it is told light hearted way comedy film isnt very preachy still conveys its beautiful real message me when it comes performances paresh rawal has just done such amazing job he deserves all applauds accolades awards world his portrayal as kanji bhai akshay kumar as always is very good small but important role his pareshs chemistry is just too good other notable performances mithun was really good as sadhu so was govind namdev music was good suited film very well all tech aspects were just perfect umesh shukla director is heart film he has done incredible job he deserves national award his efforts he was just that good special mention amazing dialogues very smart well written so all all this is must watch film not just people india but everyone world masterpiece film this should be indias official entry oscars its that good beyond one best movies ever made bollywood 10 out 10 rating,0.5868650793650795,0.3947420634920634,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.18}"

9.0,Love the God!! God is our friend and stays in humans not in stones!! Superb subject,"We have always been taught that God is our father always fear God. But this movie say God is our best friend so love the Almighty.

His life take a big turn when he lost everything in earth quake, Insurance company refuses to claim saying this is act of God and can't be claimed.Thus he decided to take big decision and movie is all about that decision.Akshay played role of modern God. If you are thinking that why God is modern go watch a movie you will find a meaningful reason behind it. Akshay is excellent too. Movie criticizes the big business that is based on selling God or we can say playing with emotion of people.God is not in stones or temples. God is in emotions,humans.

10.0,An intelligent comedy,Oh My God is based on successful gujarati play Kanji Viruddh Kanji. Oh My God is a story of Kanjibhai who does not believe in god. One day Kanjibhai's shop gets destroyed in earthquake. Then Kanjibhai complains about God in court. Paresh Rawal is absolutely splendid as a Kanjibhai and his arguments about reality of religion will make you think for a while. Akshay also plays the role of lord Krishna superbly. Surprise package of the film is Mithun Chakraborty. His comic timing is bang on.First half of the film is filled with some good comedy sequences and second half will make you amazed with some heart touching and heart shaking scenes. Main USP of the film is its unique concept. The film ends with a noble message.

,"A rightful War against Blind Faith,superstition & rituals","Karl Marx quoted ""Religion is the opium of the people"".He tried to say Religion is not the disease, but merely a symptom.It is used by oppressors to make people feel better about the distress they undergo for being exploited.As a child I had grown seeing people trying to find solace in laps of some idol or subjected to some uncanny fear revolving around idols or god-men. I tried to understand difference between rituals & religion. This remained unanswered during my growing years.Omg addressed those tactfully without taking any diplomatic or biased stance on the subject. Adaptation of Gujrathi play ""Kanji virudh Kanji"" which is inspired from an Australian film ""The man who sued the God"",the story revolves around the life of a businessman Kanjilal Shah who is an atheist and ironically his business is that of selling idols of various gods.Being a person with strong self belief he is never naive to fall prey to the traps of rituals & superstitions.In one dreaded night Kanji's shop got demolished due to earthquake and since it is ""act of God"" as per the Insurance terms he is deprived of the claim amount.Shattered and angry he registers a case against God to get his money back.Since God's address is unknown he files case against the God-men, saints as they are supposedly agents of God- and thus begins a hilarious ride as one understands the true meaning of religion.Umesh Shukla's film makes a strong case against blind faith.The film has message for both the ends of the spectrum – the atheists as well as the believers.The makers of the film has diluted on the complexities of the play to take it to the mass.Even the executions occasionally drift towards melodrama and become loud but then the end justifies the means.The film is meant to reach a larger audience and the often didactic mode of the film strikes a chord.Bhavna Mandalia's dialogs are spot on with ample support from Shukla's screenplay which leaves an impression in many scenes specially the court room sequences and Kanji's interactions with God.The film rightfully highlights on the fake god-men and how they manipulate the weakness and fear of ordinary men for their own benefits.Referring to holy Gita, Bible, Koran the film points out that God believes in equality but the big ashrams and temples will let beggars die under natural calamity but never allow them to enter. In the talk show sequence Kanji reflects on the corruption within such organizations.Subtly referring to Tirupathi he tells how all the Hairs taken are smuggled to foreign land for monetary gains.Even the so called social service done by all such temples and ashrams are just to convert their black money into white analogical to a Gutkha(raw tobacco) company building a cancer hospital (referring to a dialog in the film).He continues how religion makes one bewaas(helpless) or aatankwadi(Terrorist). The film doesn't attack any particular religion but speaks in a general tone.In one scene we find a Hindu priest, a Muslim Malawi and a Christian priest fighting within themselves about superiority of their ""individual"" god,while sadly god himself(brilliant portrayal by Akshay kumar) hopelessly looks at the ignorance of the people.The god-men are either shown ignorant and egoistic or intelligent and manipulative.During the climax, God himself tells Kanji that God is omnipresent and the knowledge of divine truth lies within every human which is written even in the holy books but sadly people don't have the time to read them. Over the years they are manipulated and genesis of rituals happened.Sadly even the educated mass falls prey to this over years.A large portion of violence and in-division are existent due to the distorted concept of religion.In one of the heart warming scene we find people are queuing to pour milk over some stone and the whole milk is going out through the drain while a poor hungry fellow looks helplessly at it.Such huge amount of resources are wasted or misused in the name of blind faith.God exists in all of us.To worship him one doesn't need to go to temples and waste crores of money on idols; but one should help people as Swami Vivekananda said ""Jibe prem Kore jei Jon Se Jon sebiche iswar"" (Bengali) (Those who loves and serves the people are serving the God). Paresh Rawal again proves his competency as an actor and his Kanji will make his position strong among the stalwart actors of the nation.He uses his whole body to emote various emotions.Mithunda is another brilliant actor who can play a disco-dancer or a saint with same conviction. His portrayal of a knowledgeable effeminate saint who uses religious believes to lop off their money is brilliant. He does brings laughter with his gestures and at the same time makes us vulnerable and guilty at the thought of existence of such fake-god men traveling in BMW and speaking of humble existence. Govind Namdeo as the Hindu saint was loud and predictable. He did justify the character he played but could have toned down a bit.Akshay Kumar was restraint and calm which made the audience connect with him as God.Probably this is one of his best performances till date.Om Puri was effective in a small role of Muslim lawyer.The supporting cast were adequate.The characters were too one-dimensional and caricaturist at times but then probably the writer was more concerned on delivering the message than developing them. Low in production value the camera and editing were just about OK.Music was irrelevant in the film though ""mere Nissan"" song had some strong lyrics and apt visuals that would stay with the audience.The dance song ""Go Govinda"" was unnecessary. On the whole this is not a path breaking cinema like Wasseypur or technically excellent like Barfi but it has a strong relevant message that needed to be told and they have done it in a commendable manner to reach to an wider audience.It is a must watch-one.",rightful war against blind faith superstition rituals,karl marx quoted religion is opium people he tried say religion is not disease but

7.0,"Though not a good adaptation but still it is fresh and has a valuable lesson to teach, so do watch it!","First clearing the air about its inspired status, the team clearly accepts its sources in a detailed caption in the titles, making it all official this time which needs to be appreciated. The caption said that the film is based on a Gujarati play, 'Kanji Virrudh Kanji' or 'Krishan Vs Kanhaiya', which was adapted from the original film ""The Man Who Sued God"" (2001) and then there were two more lines written below it which I couldn't read as it stayed for only less than 2 seconds on the screen. Still it was good to see that the right kind of credits were given to the original creator of the idea as it should be.As an Adaptation of the original film ""The Man Who Sued God"" (2001) The film is actually developed from the basic idea introduced in this lesser known Australian venture featuring Billy Connolly in the lead. And if one has seen the same then he is sure going to give a mixed response to OMG as it somehow reduces the impact generated by the original. Reason being, that in the English film the proceedings just keep moving in and out of the court and that's it. There are no separate tracks of various God-men and there is no Real GOD coming into Billy Connolly's home to make it filmy. In the original we only have a case filed by Billy against the God (involving the Church) catching the phrase ""Damages caused by the ACTS OF GOD"" in the Insurance Company's papers and then its all about the court and arguments given for or against the claim filed the applicant. In short, the film has everything focused on the logical points brought forward by the lawyers along with a beautiful insertion of ""A Sign from the GOD himself"" coming into the court-room towards the end, which serves as a pleasant surprise for the viewers.Plus the original had a brilliant culmination wherein Billy takes his case back, sighting a drastic conclusion for the society whether he wins or loses, which is sadly not there in this Hindi adaptation. Yet OMG scores decently on its own merit with its Indianised version of the concept which remains highly recommended even if you have watched the original flick or play.As an individual film making a new breakthrough in Hindi Cinema. Looking upon OMG as an individual film for viewers who haven't seen the original English film or the Gujarat play, it is no doubt an appreciable attempt by the makers giving us something fresh and new which we have been loudly craving for. Moreover it can also be called a daring attempt by the team, considering our society's conservative state of mind which always gets active when it comes to RELIGION. So in that terms the film successfully manages to make us aware of the so called ""Religious Markets"" strongly functioning around us like big super-malls with different names and titles.Director Umesh Shukla and his writing team adds many good entertaining punches which are able to make you think and laugh at the same time. Hence as it progresses, the viewer largely feels entertained as well as tickled regarding his individual religious beliefs, which I personally consider nothing short of an achievement by the entire team. But at the same time the film has its flaws too. It takes too much time to come to the point and then tries to add too many elements into the narration which were not required. Further, its main publicized theme talking about the GOD himself coming on the earth, seems to be of no use in its basic storyline. So it thankfully remains far away from the Sanjeev Kumar classic YEHI HAI ZINDAGI (1977). In other words, Askhay posing as KRISHNA (and that too on a modified bike like BATMAN) does nothing substantial in the film and is just added to give an extra edge to the project commercially. OMG also loses its grip towards the climax with some overstretched references of Paresh reaching the hospital and then THE GOD giving him the healing touch, which in turn seems to be added just to satisfy the religious sentiments of the viewers emotionally. Performance wise OMG is one of those few films which has its script as the biggest performer in its more than 2 hours of duration. However regarding the cast, Paresh Rawal is as always first rate carrying the entire film on his experienced shoulders, well supported by his entire cast namely Om Puri, Mahesh Manjrekar & Govind Namdeo. Akshay Kumar making his entry just before the intermission looks cute but the scene stealer in the second half remains Mithun Chakraborty as a Spiritual Leader (like never seen before). In reality the few Spiritual Icons shown in the film are based on some highly famous Guru's presently active in the country which you can easily judge without taking any names. Musically OMG doesn't have much scope but even then the producers have added an item song ""Go Govinda Go"" to en-cash the festival season featuring Prabhu Deva and Sonakshi Sinha dancing to the beat energetically. Cinematography and Background Score just serve the purpose well making a decent impact along with the minimal special effects used to showcase The GOD. In the last century, New Age Indian Spiritual Masters like J. KRISHNAMURTHY and OSHO kept saying this for many years throughout their life but very few heard them resulting in the present chaos in the country and world over. So here is OH MY GOD giving the same message to the people once again but deep inside I also know that the situation is never going to change for the very reason that,""We all are taught to be GOD FEARING and not GOD LOVING people by our so called Religious Teachers!""",though not good adaptation but still it is fresh has valuable lesson teach so do watch it,first clearing air about its inspired status team clearly accepts its sources detailed caption titles making it all official this time which needs be appreciated caption said that film is based gujarati play kanji virrudh kanji

9.0,Creating pleasant atmosphere in every aspect only matters.,"Oh my God is a story about a person (Kanji Lalji Mehta) who loses his shop in an earthquake. The shop is located an area in Mumbai, known as chor bazaar. Kanji is a person, who even does not fear God and even puts God on ill usage, for his benefit. After disaster, Kanji lodges complaint against God as he does not get benefit of insurance due to act of God. The notice is sent to all bigger baba's. He first goes through a lot of resistance, but eventually people turn out in his favour. People from other religions also join him. Thus notice is sent to every religious head.Cinematography was awesome. Paresh as Kanji acted well. The build up of the movie and the execution was superb.It's a matter of great controversy that, whatever things people do like doing abhishek, lighting candles, chaddars, etc. Do they come out to be beneficial? The answer to this lies in the quest to understand what turns out to create a pleasant atmosphere in bigger picture. I mean no poverty, equal status to lives, peace of mind, respecting life, creating a better world. This can be achieved by investment of wealth in proper direction i.e for poor.Various religious heads need to understand the method that creates pleasant atmosphere from micro level to major only matters. If we put something in front of God, it should not go waste. Every bit of thing we keep in front of God should be utilized for good in some or other way. Eatables should be utilized for animals if not humans. There should not be any harm done to any form of life. Example Lead in kumkum has been killing animal life in water, which challenges the concept of respecting life. Things of this sort, should not happen. A movie highly recommended.I do kept pace with kanjilal at the ending scene, one of the instances that made me feel special.Rating: 9.5/10",creating pleasant atmosphere every aspect only matters,oh my god is story about person kanji lalji mehta who loses his shop earthquake shop is located area mumbai known as chor bazaar kanji is person who even does not fear god even puts god ill usage his benefit after disaster kanji lodges complaint against god as he does not get benefit insurance due act god notice is sent all bigger babas he first goes through lot resistance but eventually people turn out his favour people other religions also join him thus notice is sent every religious head cinematography was awesome paresh as kanji acted well build up movie execution was superb its matter great controversy that whatever things people do like doing abhishek lighting candles chaddars etc do they come out be beneficial answer this lies quest understand what turns out create pleasant atmosphere bigger picture i mean no poverty equal status lives peace mind respecting life creating better world this can be achieved by investment wealth proper direction i e poor various religious heads need understand method that creates pleasant atmosphere micro level major only matters if we put something front god it should not go waste every bit thing we keep front god should be utilized good some or other way eatables should be utilized animals if not humans there should not be any harm done any form life example lead kumkum has been killing animal life water which challenges concept respecting life things this sort should not happen movie highly recommended i do kept pace with kanjilal at ending scene one instances that made me feel special rating 9 5 10,0.5585753968253968,0.15473809523809523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"
4.0,Takes itself too seriously.,"I am agnostic but even I cringed at the childish arguments made against religion in this movie. It started off ok and had subtle comedic undertones but then it takes a turn for the worst when they introduced magic and gods as characters in the movie. It suddenly became a serious courtroom drama with some of the most unintelligible characters anyone can create for a movie like this. It also makes a complete mockery of the legal system. Even in India, the courts are not this silly. Then there is the final revelation was complete garbage. Basically, take away religion and you become the replacement for religion which is apparently just as bad or worse. What? No, that is not the only possibility yet this is the argument made to keep the institutions. The truth is religions evolve like anything else and in almost all cases, it improves and adapts to human knowledge. How many religions still run espouse virgin sacrifice to an alter? Practically none. This was replaced with animals. How many still sacrifice animals? Practically none. Now you just have to give money and most have become savvy enough to hide the fact that they want your donation by cloaking it as a ""donation"" or to help the needy which are almost always partial lies/truth. But you see, religion evolves and generally gets better. So a reasonable person would actually tell you to tear them down and rebuild. Eventually, humans will get it right. What is right? Coming to the realization that we dont know the real truth and thats ok. There is nothing wrong with not knowing something. Do you see 95% of humans complaining they dont understand why chemical bonds result in an exothermic reaction or that they cant figure out how energy can be converted to matter or how quantum coupling works? No, most simply move on and focus on what we do know. This is when humanity will finally be united.

10.0,"Watch it for the Story, the Message and Paresh Rawal's Brilliance","The three best things you will take away from this movie when you walk out of the hall would be story, message and brilliant acting by Paresh Rawal. The movie is adapted from a famous Gujarati play Kanji vs. Kanji, which also had Paresh Rawal in the lead role. The story flow is gripping and you wouldn't want to miss even a single second of movie. With a unique case of a human suing GOD, the direction has been brilliant to keep the story in context and make sense at the same time. While words won't be able to describe Paresh Rawal's acting brilliance, the movie also witnessed impressive performances from Mithun Chakraborty, Govind Namdev and Akshay Kumar. Om Puri, as always, was impeccable even in a brief role. However, the major highlight of the movie is its war against commercialization of religion in the country. The extent of monetary and non-monetary waste to please GOD, not out of love but out of FEAR, has been depicted at various points of time in the movie. It is this fear, that dharma-gurus take advantage of and make billions out of it. And as long as this fear is there to stay, the blind beliefs are also there to stay. While Kanji is an atheist, he is well aware of this and also takes advantage of it in his own way to run his business of God idols. However, he questions this foolishness in the society and the searches the answers as well.In the nutshell, the movie offers a food for thought at the end and, of course, a brilliant movie experience as well.",watch it story message paresh rawals brilliance,three best things you will take away this movie when you walk out hall would be story message brilliant acting by paresh rawal movie is adapted famous gujarati play kanji vs kanji which also had paresh rawal lead role story flow is gripping you wouldnt want miss even single second movie with unique case human suing god direction has been brilliant keep story context make sense at same time while words wont be able describe paresh rawals acting brilliance movie also witnessed impressive performances mithun chakraborty govind namdev akshay kumar om puri as always was impeccable even brief role however major highlight movie is its war against commercialization religion country extent monetary non monetary waste please god not out love but out fear has been depicted at various points time movie it is this fear that dharma gurus take advantage make billions out it as long as this fear is there stay blind beliefs are also there stay while kanji is atheist he is well aware this also takes advantage it his own way run his business god idols however he questions this foolishness society searches answers as well nutshell movie offers food thought at end course brilliant movie experience as well,0.514010989010989,0.3083104395604395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,A Reformist and a revolutionist movie.,"This review is about how important this movie is for us.The movie is hilarious and i mean it. It is not the cheap dim-wit comedy that people have been relating to Akshay Kumar since a couple of years. The comedy is 10 star.Some critics have given the movie only 3 and a half stars out of 5. However, I say this movie is beyond the scale of 5 or 10. The reason being the effect it is going to or should leave on the Indian society where people live there lives full of superstitions. It is a message against that. And through sarcasm!!. There are many scenes in the film which will make an impact.Example 1. All the religious heads are in a petrified state because Paresh Rawal has sued the almighty GOD in a court of law. They then decide that if his case against GOD is strong, nothing would happen since people in-spite of being educated and learned in school listen and believe them illiterates instead of what they learn in school.So the message is that we are making it too easy for the mullahs, pundits and likes to create problems for us by blindly believing in and following them. They are not any higher or divine beings and their authority should be abolished. Example 2. Mithun Chakaraborty, tells Paresh Rawal that his efforts are in vain because people are God fearing & not God loving. Therefore they will repeat the social evil i.e. commercialism of faith again and again. That is they will go to temples in search of personal gains (rather than GOD) and will spend a lot of money on superstitions to get things done.They can be easily made into gullible fools until unless they realize that GOD needs nothing except love only from the heart. The only movie after three idiots that manages to deliver a strong message. There are just so many messages in the movie. It is for the masses of all religions and no God(if exists)has been attacked. It will reform you. It will make people more tolerable because it gives a message of sanity and peace. We need an open society. Please change yourselves. Watch the movie carefully and learn.",reformist revolutionist movie,this review is about how important this movie is us movie is hilarious i mean it it is not cheap dim wit comedy that people have been relating akshay kumar since couple years comedy is 10 star some critics have given movie only 3 half stars out 5 however i say this movie is beyond scale 5 or 10 reason being effect it is going or should leave indian society where people live there lives full superstitions it is message against that through sarcasm there are many scenes film which will make impact example 1 all religious heads are petrified state because paresh rawal has sued almighty god court law they then decide that if his case against god is strong nothing would happen since people spite being educated learned school listen believe them illiterates instead what they learn school so message is that we are making it too easy mullahs pundits likes create problems us by blindly believing following them they are not any higher or divine beings their authority should be abolished example 2 mithun chakaraborty tells paresh rawal that his efforts are vain because people are god fearing not god loving therefore they will repeat social evil i e commercialism faith again again that is they will go temples search personal gains rather than god will spend lot money superstitions get things done they can be easily made into gullible fools until unless they realize that god needs nothing except love only heart only movie after three idiots that manages deliver strong message there are just so many messages movie it is masses all religions no god if exists has been attacked it will reform you it will make people more tolerable because it gives message sanity peace we need open society please change yourselves watch movie carefully learn,0.6280913978494624,0.09431818181818181,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"

He makes valid points against God and today's ritual and he deserves nothing of whatever happened to him later. Could have been a great film on the silence of God. How ironic is that in a film that questions the silence of God, it appears, and to meet whom?, the person who doesn't believe in it. They have totally missed the point.The film relies totally on Paresh Rawal (as Kanji Lal). His dialogues are witty and hilarious. He uses perfect analogies every time. The arguments he put in the court may not make sense to you but are totally valid.Paresh Rawal was brilliantly cast here. Role required a person which acts real with a pinch of comedy. And he is a master of such subtle comedy, but I don't think it's one of his best roles.In PK, God was an idea, not a physical entity. But here, they messed things up for the sake of explaining them.
