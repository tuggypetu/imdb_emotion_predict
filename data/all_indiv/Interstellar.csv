10.0,Out of this world,"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...",out this world,lot has been said written about interstellar you can obviously take apart any movie that is out there youll either love this one or you wont i kind would have loved have watched this imax screen sheer scope whole thing its just amazing what nolan has put screen here its not only visual experience there is no 3d here by way its story ride you take with it it might be clear some earlier than others where its heading no pun intended but it doesnt change fact that its beautiful terrifying at same time going out saying this will be considered classic might not be too far stretched but you still can never predict those things deserved love movie gets imdb other places would be indicator that this will ring true though acting is really good but i can understand if some people have issues with ending but movie had end one way or another its best possible way this could go even if its not our grasps just yet,0.5645833333333333,0.21631944444444448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,A visual and auditory marvel,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",visual auditory marvel,interstellar is movie like no other unlike many apocalyptic sci fi films that feature advanced technology as source our destruction ala terminator movies it instead asserts that technology will save us not everyone interstellar recognizes potential advanced technology most dismiss it as waste time resources not just old curmudgeons feel this way thoughtful intelligent young characters share this sentiment this belief gained steam following world wide blight that wiped out vast majority life earth crops humans farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous cooper mcconaughey remains one few survivors who still appreciates need engineering he feels like man lost time until he stumbles into headquarters nasa which had been operating secret due public disapproval here he meets others who realize that return our old ways is unsustainable will ultimately lead our demise we need technology save us as michael caine playing brilliant duh professor brand eloquently tells cooper we were never meant save world we were meant leave it movie that won oscar best visual effects deservedly so sound stole show hans zimmer dark knight trilogy unleashed performance that was quite appropriately out this world never have i seen movie elevated so much by its score sound literally took my breath away forgive me next paragraph i will gush irresponsibly about magic that is this movies sound skip it if you please you have your warning music fueled every important scene every meaningful moment zimmers harmonies captivated watchers attention way coach commanding locker room with pregame speech music elucidated those emotional scenes particularly ones featuring cooper his daughter way that no words or visual ques possibly could i sat frozen jaw agape with tears pouring down my cheeks as music completely overwhelmed my emotions sound penetrated my soul reverberated through my body flowing my appendages supplying me with life like heartbeat pumping blood through my veins music was truly life force movie yes we all witnessed visual triumph daring creative wonder likes which we havent encountered since inception yes nearly every actors performance proved worthy commendation mcconaughey is fire chastain is blossoming into star at this point michael cain exudes such knowledge wisdom by merely appearing screen that if he were cast as albert einstein people would wonder if role were beneath him all this considered sound still towered over everything i walked out theater believing that i had experienced something unique something truly special interstellar inspires it awes above all it entertains i cannot ask more than that,0.4865512265512264,0.1975288600288601,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Excellent Movie,"I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults?

9.0,Absolutely Brilliant,"A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics.",absolutely brilliant,team explorers travel through wormhole attempt ensure humanitys survival going into this i had mixed feelings because some have praised it others have panned it some say it is good with reservations there were allegedly issues with he sound theaters any number other issues then when we get oscars film gets nominations technical fields but not top honors this was wrong maybe this is not best role matthew mcconaughey or anne hathaway though fact that hathaway hater like myself enjoyed it should say something i think jessica chastain should have received best supporting nomination she easily outshines laura dern wild this may be greatest ever film about physics,0.5005208333333333,0.23802083333333332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,A journey across the galaxy to save humanity,"Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.",journey across galaxy save humanity,set future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot joseph cooper is now farmer growing corn his daughter murphey thinks there is ghost her room cooper doesnt believe ghosts but accepts that something is there when dust floor is set coordinates binary form he goes that location finds himself at nasa base where he learns secret programme find another habitable world involving wormhole discovered near saturn he is asked take part mission find best planet out three orbiting black hole each which has scientist who went one way mission sending data back plan is find world transfer humanity but if that is impossible there is back up plan crew raise 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship time is issue as it moves at different rate near black hole this means that as hours pass cooper years are passing back earth this film starts at gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened earth before getting mission save world started this means separation cooper murphey is more emotional once mission is underway there is plenty tension including some particularly gripping moments second planet they visit small cast does fine job especially matthew mcconaughey who plays cooper anne hathaway who plays amelia brand scientist aboard mission mackenzie foy jessica chastain who play younger older murphey effects looked great as one would expect film christopher nolan i was pleased that space was depicted as silent something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive things do get little confusing near end but way that made me want watch again rather than causing frustration overall id recommend this somebody looking intelligent science fiction mould 2001 space odyssey although this has more emotion it than that classic,0.47004504504504513,0.10844594594594598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8.0,Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best,"To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it?

,A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.",visually monumental thoughtful sci fi epic,i was extremely lucky get chance see this film upon its first day release before entering cinema my expectations were already high after all this was film cinematic genius who brought us likes inception dark knight summarise following review single sentence i left cinema extreme awe visual masterpiece i had just viewed film that explores psychological emotional state man whose life revolves around his family interstellar is thrilling thought provoking film that boasts intellectual story masterfully written by nolan brothers whilst there seems have been influence films like 2001 space odyssey apollo 13 interstellar is unique its own way whilst subject may be hard comprehend at times it cant be denied how visually monumental thoughtful christopher nolans epic science fiction masterpiece is can easily be named best film this year possibly one greatest science fiction films have ever graced screen sheer brilliant feat cinema,0.5267511520737328,0.21925499231950848,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,A Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout ""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending.",sci fi masterpiece,hollywood science

9.0,"An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",emotional beautiful journey into unknown,this is both review film assertion christopher nolans filmmaking style there have been many reviewers critics alike that have high praise film visual effects acting music but say how its not christopher nolans best directed film this is where i personally would have disagree before i get into it though ill talk about interstellar bit interstellar is truly sci fi epic like no other compare said film 2001 space odyssey isnt just disservice but unnecessary films are almost nothing alike simply sharing small plot elements also stanley kubricks vision arthur c clarkes sci fi epic wasnt ponder philosophical questions that accompanied story but make art art is was is with interstellar mr nolan set out make his most personal emotional film date about love time time being recurring theme throughout all nolans films but its so much more than that too there are no words express epic journey nolan takes us film but needless say its tear jerking emotional throughout acting is top notch especially mcconaughey who gives i would say his most emotional performance yet but actor who stole show few scenes one particular when theyre alien planet was david gyasi as romilly one astronauts aboard endurance their spacecraft musical score hans zimmer is without doubt his best most influential work date helping drive films bold breath taking vision church organ helped significantly visual effects are easily best date as well year see black hole created through visual effects such way with pages theoretical equations provided by kip thorne theoretical physicist whoms work inspired films genesis what you see film is most realistic depiction black hole even offered new insight accretion discs surrounding anomalies but even everything else alien planets endurance visuals always look real then theres writing i would definitely have say this has some best dialogue ive ever heard sci fi movie script continually pours or oozes emotion keeping audience tethered film now about mr nolan dont just look at nolan but look at his films some say inception would be his masterpiece while others would say its dark knight or memento but honestly every single film christopher nolan has directed is masterpiece not its genre but nolan following is his quiet masterpiece not film that put mr nolan map as phenomenal director but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed nolan after seeing memento what could be called his breakout masterpiece then right after he directed remake norwegian thriller insomnia this too could be considered masterpiece even if remake then we were given his take batman universe starting with batman begins origin masterpiece then theres prestige adapted novel same name which can be called his dark masterpiece dark knight his bold masterpiece inception his complex masterpiece dark knight rises his flawed masterpiece now we have interstellar his emotional or personal masterpiece this is just my looking at nolan his films but whatever your thoughts are you cant deny interstellar is one hell journey he certainly is one best filmmakers our time all time i cant wait see what he does next but im not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as interstellar,0.4332728022338412,0.12148184067015234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014",interstellar open hearted mastered human odyssey,film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions men overexploited land resources which is why only goal they have left is survive this life is not enough cooper brilliantly played by mcconaughey who gave body soul this character but all this wouldnt hold without total control christopher nolan based languishing soundtrack by hans zimmer luminous impenetrable photography hoyte van hoytema sincerity nolans directing he manages film characters find right cut at right time always harmony with hans zimmers soundtrack give film aspiring inspiring dimension that went missing many many years thus we are transported into same cockpit that cooper we feel same remorse that he can already feel we feel same gravity we feel same fear unknown melted with force his will all this is brilliantly illustrated very simple directing choice which my point view is decisive impetus film directly jump when cooper leaves his truck leaving his family behind him endurance taking off this simple editing decision allows nolan give original movement his film musical crescendo makes us physically feel sentimental break between two parts film you dont necessarily have understand it immediately film will raise questions you such as what is it be human being is there some physical limitations our humanity how far could we be willing go determine knowledge is there other dimensions that we can not access above all what is nature this intact immutable bond that unites us others wherever we are universe is this bond only intelligible or is it also tangible all these questions resonate harmony nolans interstellar interstellar is itself crescendo increasing sensitivity creativity i use term deliberately because it goes crescendo with soundtrack by hans zimmer which is one most beautiful music ever scored sci fi movie we are witnessing perfect musical arrangement total symbiosis bit like music gravity which had understood very well how match image rhythm sequence its own musicality zimmers crescendos are giving new powerful breath every new scene whether it is visually powerful intense moments or more intimate moments it intrudes into our momentary feelings sensations manages extend them sometimes almost choking before resting balance film frame along with our mind spell bounded i have seen all talent director that i knew he was outside norm but whom i did not know his capacity reinvent itself because this is it interstellar is not action movie not really blockbuster it goes not entirely but mostly again expectations common people its much more than that this is much more than just sci fi movie it is unlike any his previous films some hoped see interstellar as christopher nolans best film they were disappointed that this was not case indeed this is not best film christopher nolan because way it is his first film im not saying that interstellar is not as good as his other films it goes beyond all them but me interstellar is first film new stage nolans filmography it is masterpiece as it beginning work ahead interstellar is proof that nolan has finally managed despite all expectations that were placed him after success dark knight move away his own reputation create personal work original humble sincere deeply meticulously measured now this third act film it all comes life with unparalleled strength nolan poses answers questions that raise others but he focuses his attention great mystery love that emotional bond that can unite men sometimes separate them but nolan is only one that can successfully speak love being another film that mainly takes place another galaxy my point view only solaris by steven soderbergh 2002 unfortunately neglected by audience was able accomplish that interstellar is based premise which is following terrestrial dust depths space time we can never be separated who we are as individuals as species as we always leave part ourselves behind us other words i could say that this is human story even if we go as far as we want if we travel through universe believing that we can be detached one we are fond we will only get closer them because separation thus distance time can only ultimately reinforce relationship between people who really love each other because it is going end world when we reach end ourselves that we reach singularity black hole beyond horizon it is our humanity no i wasnt been able find any bad flaws film not one im still looking after all interstellar is like gravity all it takes is little push youll have see movie figure that one out f lix tardieu november 1st 2014,0.5420764510570336,0.141032551590804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.5}"

The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space.

Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night...

But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

9.0,Leaves you wondering,"A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece.",leaves you wondering,lot has been said heard about this movie but none it comes even close experience watching it it has all elements nolan movie just like all his other movies he decides go bit further this time he went little too far story behind movie has its flaws there really is no explanation what happened is happening instead you are given fragments first half movie hoping one will put all pieces together all all first part seems bit rushed leaves you wondering if more could have been told but since real story is not why travel is necessary but travel itself once crew is off story really kicks main part movie gives great ride pumps your blood with adrenaline time time gets you emotional pretty often problem i personally had was that story taking place simultaneously earth was less shown than i expected different approach was expected but that did not stop chastain giving best role movie last part movie is dynamic filled with problems real people would have if found situation like that but explanation given at very end was bit much me i heard that this was called most scientifically accurate movie that physicist around world fought over fact was that true or not nevertheless way too much theoretical physics end since i love sf movies i am willing look past over top science part but what really got me was that it was predictable very moment i saw black hole movie i put two two together that kinda ruined it me little regarding acting as i said before chastain gave most powerful performance movie she doesnt have much screen time but she sure knows how use it two that actually lead movie mcconaughey hathaway were brilliant mcconaughey did little better job handling emotions father with responsibilities team leader savior mankind his performance was outstanding hathaway was good decent without single word that can be said against her but movie like this that is almost completely shoulders actors she should have done more others did good job particularly casey affleck whos character was grand comparison chastains music given it was done by mastermind hans zimmer was spectacular just right notes just right timing just right music his understanding what movies should sound like is amazing all all interstellar is magnificent movie it is type movie nolan does best it has all elements being classic like kubricks 2001 space odyssey it comes really close being new space odyssey it will not perish with time still this might be bit too much average moviegoer lot has be digested here it is not simple or easy movie watch but if your braincells dont shut off you dont expect another die hard movie you will appreciate this masterpiece,0.4892934102934102,0.21857215007215008,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Absolutely thrilling! A can't miss movie!,"Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart.

,Emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging,"This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.""Interstellar"" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever.

9.0,Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY,"INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses.
