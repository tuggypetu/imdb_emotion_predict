8,Baahubali is Indian Grand Spectacle,"I was eagerly waiting for this film and I was not disappointed.Baahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places). I didn't know who Rajamouli was, basically because I am from North India and I don't follow south Indian cinema. But I am sure he is someone you should know about. SS Rajamouli is amazing. He has made something that we can be proud of. I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the story. Rajamouli proved me wrong with this film. The story and the execution is really good. Story takes elements from Indian mythologies (specially from the life of Lord Krishna) . You can not expect more. He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman fans should learn something from it. All the actors are good and perform their part really well(except Tamanna. She tries too hard but fails miserably). In fact, Tamanna has been used as a plot device (A MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock used to call it). Prabhas is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionaly but his presence is enough to give you the feels.The background score needs special mention because it is amazing. It is different from anything you have ever heard in India. The score that plays during war is haunting. (Clearly inspired from the LotR) I would be lying if I didn't say that Rajamouli spent a lot of time watching The Lord of The Rings. Yes, some scenes will remind you of 300 and the Lord of The Rings but believe me it is completely different. He doesn't copy anything, he uses it as a source of inspiration. There is only one scene that I remember from LotR which has been used in Baahubali. But denying that he was influenced by Peter Jackson would be a big lie. Its a great thing that he was influenced by such a great film otherwise we wouldn't have Baahubali.The quality of graphics work is very good. In fact its insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is SPECTACULAR and reminded me of Battle of Helm's Deep and Pelennor fields from LotR.But the movie is not without some minor problems. There are unnecessary songs which ruin the experience (I laughed so hard when Prabhas started dancing randomly. Everyone was looking at me.) and some parts are dragged (specially the first half) . Also there are continuity problems and some actors are over-the-top. Cut down the songs and edit the movie and voil√† we will have a SPECTACULAR film.Baahubali is not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go. It's not the Indian 300, its Indian ""Baahubali"".So in the end, I would like to say - Go and watch it instead of watching the crap that Bollywood has been producing lately. Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it. P.S: I want to see Rajamouli doing ""Mahabharata"" next.",baahubali is indian grand spectacle,i was eagerly waiting this film i was not disappointed baahubali is one most visually impressive films that have come india everything about this film is good story direction beautiful cinematography haunting score amazing visuals though they lack some details at some places i didnt know who rajamouli was basically because i am north india i dont follow south indian cinema but i am sure he is someone you should know about ss rajamouli is amazing he has made something that we can be proud i was sure that vfx would be good however i had doubt about story rajamouli proved me wrong with this film story execution is really good story takes elements indian mythologies specially life lord krishna you can not expect more he took big risk made it big this is what we need good quality cinema salman fans should learn something it all actors are good perform their part really well except tamanna she tries too hard but fails miserably fact tamanna has been used as plot device macguffin as alfred hitchcock used call it prabhas is okay beginning but transforms into behemoth during second half this guy is natural he doesnt act exceptionaly but his presence is enough give you feels background score needs special mention because it is amazing it is different anything you have ever heard india score that plays during war is haunting clearly inspired lotr i would be lying if i didnt say that rajamouli spent lot time watching lord rings yes some scenes will remind you 300 lord rings but believe me it is completely different he doesnt copy anything he uses it as source inspiration there is only one scene that i remember lotr which has been used baahubali but denying that he was influenced by peter jackson would be big lie its great thing that he was influenced by such great film otherwise we wouldnt have baahubali quality graphics work is very good fact its insane such cheap price given that hollywood uses big budget same battle sequence is spectacular reminded me battle helms deep pelennor fields lotr but movie is not without some minor problems there are unnecessary songs which ruin experience i laughed so hard when prabhas started dancing randomly everyone was looking at me some parts are dragged specially first half also there are continuity problems some actors are over top cut down songs edit movie voil we will have spectacular film baahubali is not answer 300 gladiator or lord rings because saying so would be foolish dont compare this movie hollywood ones because we still have long way go its not indian 300 its indian baahubali so end i would like say go watch it instead watching crap that bollywood has been producing lately its something be proud book your tickets watch this indian grand spectacle you wont regret it p s i want see rajamouli doing mahabharata next,0.5707362637362637,0.19887789987789986,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10,A superb visual treat.,"If a person is bit of into movies, I am sure that person heard about Baahubali couple of years back. It took almost four years to complete the first part. Hero Prabhas had completely dedicated his time to this movie and no movie after his super successful movie Mirchi. Same is true from S.S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So obviously there are high expectations.I was eagerly waiting for this movie and within no time I booked the tickets and went with my family. The results are out now, history books are being rewritten. An excellent movie, every frame is a mega scale. I couldn't remember a single scene which I felt bored. This movie will redefine Indian movie standards. Nothing less than The Lord of the Rings or in fact, can easily compete with any Hollywood movie. Each and every character superbly framed. Every actor has done a decent job and Prabhas and Raana are over the sky, earned more than 100% credit. Can't wait for part 2. Overall It's a superb visual treat.",superb visual treat,if person is bit into movies i am sure that person heard about baahubali couple years back it took almost four years complete first part hero prabhas had completely dedicated his time this movie no movie after his super successful movie mirchi same is true s s rajamouly after his last non conventional movie eega so obviously there are high expectations i was eagerly waiting this movie within no time i booked tickets went with my family results are out now history books are being rewritten excellent movie every frame is mega scale i couldnt remember single scene which i felt bored this movie will redefine indian movie standards nothing less than lord rings or fact can easily compete with any hollywood movie each every character superbly framed every actor has done decent job prabhas raana are over sky earned more than 100 credit cant wait part 2 overall its superb visual treat,0.5061019536019535,0.2600915750915751,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8,This one is a Visual Wonder!,"3 years of sheer hard-work of many people who have worked their hearts out for this Visual Wonder has paid off well? Not exactly though, since the answer is simple and straight, you just have to wait for the 'Conclusion' till 2016 and that would decide the fate of this franchise on a whole. The story is paced slowly in the first half giving way and screen space to our Mother Nature's beauty and CGI's magic and one might find it a little too draggy if one considers 'Baahubali' to solely be a hero and since that's not possible, Shivudu has a love life and heroic nature and scenes of his own.Abrupt cuts and unconvincing CGI at certain places in first half are the only flaws with the whole film. Coming to the second half, one is told what he'd expect to be told, as the trailer tells the same. War sequences are really well shot and makes it hard to believe that they were actually made by Indians! One has to just bow down to Srinivas Mohan and his team for excellent CGI and Senthil Kumar for superb visuals. Our captain gives us a bang, as his trademark style known as 'Interval Bang' only at the end this time because technically this movies' end is the interval for the 2 parts taken as a whole. Art work in this Epic is just out of the world, kudos to Sabu Cyril sir and thousands of technicians who worked on this aspect.BGM is soothing for the first half which is apt for what we get on screen and the second half war episodes get the best of the lot BGMs to elevate the scenes. Songs are places really well except for 'Manohari' song.Dolby Atmos effect is an added attraction and I highly recommend people to watch this flick in theatres with this specific sound system, it will surely remain as a great experience for you. The sound effects are haunting, pleasing and give you goosebumps at the same time. Anushka had an extended cameo but did perform commendably well, special applause to her expressions. Special mention to Ramya Krishna madame, she was at her best! Katappa will blow your mind with his characteristics and Sathya Raj Sir does 100% justice to it. Though Prabhas and Rana Daggubati did well only their attitude in their respective roles stands out as the best because more of them is yet to come in the sequel. All you need to do is to watch the movie as it comes because expectations lead to disappointment. If you miss this movie, you've just lost a once in life-time 'Indian' movie experience on a big screen.",this one is visual wonder,3 years sheer hard work many people who have worked their hearts out this visual wonder has paid off well not exactly though since answer is simple straight you just have wait conclusion till 2016 that would decide fate this franchise whole story is paced slowly first half giving way screen space our mother natures beauty cgis magic one might find it little too draggy if one considers baahubali solely be hero since thats not possible shivudu has love life heroic nature scenes his own abrupt cuts unconvincing cgi at certain places first half are only flaws with whole film coming second half one is told what hed expect be told as trailer tells same war sequences are really well shot makes it hard believe that they were actually made by indians one has just bow down srinivas mohan his team excellent cgi senthil kumar superb visuals our captain gives us bang as his trademark style known as interval bang only at end this time because technically this movies end is interval 2 parts taken as whole art work this epic is just out world kudos sabu cyril sir thousands technicians who worked this aspect bgm is soothing first half which is apt what we get screen second half war episodes get best lot bgms elevate scenes songs are places really well except manohari song dolby atmos effect is added attraction i highly recommend people watch this flick theatres with this specific sound system it will surely remain as great experience you sound effects are haunting pleasing give you goosebumps at same time anushka had extended cameo but did perform commendably well special applause her expressions special mention ramya krishna madame she was at her best katappa will blow your mind with his characteristics sathya raj sir does 100 justice it though prabhas rana daggubati did well only their attitude their respective roles stands out as best because more them is yet come sequel all you need do is watch movie as it comes because expectations lead disappointment if you miss this movie youve just lost once life time indian movie experience big screen,0.4530656443368308,0.19540422383642728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
3,Clich√© elevated from Gutter to BlockBuster by Fanboys.,"Test whether this movie was a clich√© or not? 1. Pathetic romance where hero woos a beautiful actress by stalking and harassing her. And after one song they are in love. 2. A sad mother waiting for his son to take revenge. ""Mere karan Arjun aayenge"". 3. Hero has enormous superhuman like strength and intelligence without any battle training and can beat 20 people with weapons bare handed. 4. Physics is just ignored. 5. Plot copied from movies 300 (Trishul battle defence), Troy, Matrix trilogy (the chosen one concept, multiple fight scenes), Lord of the Rings etc.People said this was best VFX ever. Best VFX is the one where after watching the scene you say - I wonder where they shot this movie-this place is so beautiful. Which means although movie looks aesthetically pleasing but VFX is ""undetectable"". The moment you are able to VFX is being used, it becomes pathetic VFX.This movie highlights starvation and craving of us Indians for watching a half a decent movie, so much so, that a clich√©d with non-existent plot is said to be the best Indian movie ever and is reinforced by the fact that everyone else likes it - Typical Herd Mentality.

9,A new bench mark for Indian Cinema!!!,"I'm a big fan of Rajamouli, but this is not a biased review. The rating I gave is not just for Rajamouli but the entire unit of Baahubali. Right from the story which reminded me of all the beautiful Indian stories that were part of my childhood,(I'm getting back to reading Amar Chitra Katha now!!!) to every guy who says ""Baahubali"" in the movie. There were several scenes that gave me goosebumps, not scary ones but like those that put you in awe.It should just get better from here for Indian Cinema. This should be the benchmark for story telling, direction, script, visuals, sets, screenplay etc.(but not for acting!!!)The story keeps you hooked to the movie. I wouldn't say too many good things about the movie as they may contain spoilers. But I could compare the movie to a good mythological comic that you would like to read again and again.(So I'm watching the movie again tomorrow!!!)But I would like to mention why I reduced the two stars 1. The make up was not at all good. Especially Anushka's 2. The costumes could be better, probably more realistic(if you compare costumes in Troy or even Hercules, they were more relevant) 3. At times people in the background were not true to the scene, my concentration was distracted due to some idiots who didn't match the scene. A few villagers, few priests, few classical dancers, few tribal guys. The Kalakeya warriors were amazing though. 4. WHO THE HELL CHOSE TO PUT AN ITEM SONG. There were many uufffs in the theatre at that time. How the hell did probably an eastern European end up in that. 5. There were a few glitches in the VFX, like whenever the hero is jumping around... it made it look unnatural. That's poor graphics. I'm not an expert on this but few of those jumping sequences could be avoided. You don't see them in Hollywood mythological except for superhero movies which are more convincing.But not too many complaints about that as I understand there are certain budget constraints for VFX but Makeup, there is no excuse for that.All said and done, it was a fantastic movie and worth the wait and ends with a nice climax which keeps you guessing the 2nd half story. My favourite characters were Sivagami and Kattappa. I am in love with Ramya Krishna again. I'm watching it again tomorrow.",new bench mark indian cinema,im big fan rajamouli but this is not biased review rating i gave is not just rajamouli but entire unit baahubali right story which reminded me all beautiful indian stories that were part my childhood im getting back reading amar chitra katha now every guy who says baahubali movie there were several scenes that gave me goosebumps not scary ones but like those that put you awe it should just get better here indian cinema this should be benchmark story telling direction script visuals sets screenplay etc but not acting story keeps you hooked movie i wouldnt say too many good things about movie as they may contain spoilers but i could compare movie good mythological comic that you would like read again again so im watching movie again tomorrow but i would like mention why i reduced two stars 1 make up was not at all good especially anushkas 2 costumes could be better probably more realistic if you compare costumes troy or even hercules they were more relevant 3 at times people background were not true scene my concentration was distracted due some idiots who didnt match scene few villagers few priests few classical dancers few tribal guys kalakeya warriors were amazing though 4 who hell chose put item song there were many uufffs theatre at that time how hell did probably eastern european end up that 5 there were few glitches vfx like whenever hero is jumping around it made it look unnatural thats poor graphics im not expert this but few those jumping sequences could be avoided you dont see them hollywood mythological except superhero movies which are more convincing but not too many complaints about that as i understand there are certain budget constraints vfx but makeup there is no excuse that all said done it was fantastic movie worth wait ends with nice climax which keeps you guessing 2nd half story my favourite characters were sivagami kattappa i am love with ramya krishna again im watching it again tomorrow,0.4469932241671373,0.18937747035573124,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"

This is an ego-trip, following the need to present a spectacle to a spectacle-hungry audience which has never needed anything philosophical or intellectual. For such an audience, a simplistic plot and beautiful visuals are needed, which this film caters to. But beyond that, we cannot be persuaded to find any relevance of such an endeavor. The ideas and people get lost behind the purported veil of glamor and show.

Although side role characters are OK , the acting from main main characters is simply horrible, actually i do not even want to elaborate.Story has no depth and full of gaps and inconsistencies, but is kind of a cheap remake of the story of prophet Moses, the difference finding family is good but the real family is bad . You cannot understand why many of the occurrences happen. Also war scene is almost stolen from troy , same shield wall, two brothers....

5,Valiant effort but lacks content,"To be portrayed as the biggest Indian spectacle till date is a heavy accolade to hold, let alone achieve. And baahubali is definitely not up to the mark.Let's look at the movie objectively:1) Starting with the most talked about aspect of the movie VFX/CGI. The CGI is so over the top that it felt like a badly edited video game at times. For instance, the scene in which Baahubali is running away from the guards in the fort. Loud and showy landscapes can not be termed as spectacular CGI. It should merge seamlessly with the movie and CGI stands out like a sore thumb in this one.2)Acting: Its loud and crass to say the least. The reactions of all characters after every dialogue reminds a bit of the daily soaps.3)StoryLine: Its old and repetitive from a 1000 other movies of the same genre. A messiah who comes to save the day. Yes, that's never been done before in Indian cinema.However, despite all the above points Baahubali puts in a valiant effort. But to compare it to the likes of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit with the sheer depth of Tolkien's work is sacrilege. No where near that league.Only recommended for the faithful.

2,Super hero movie without mentioning as superhero.,"Watched it recently when it was aired on TV. It's nothing but superhero movie where the main protagonist does everything impossible with his hands. The main character can do anything like fighting 1000s of soldiers with a sword, hold a 1000 kg idol with just a rope, jump from mountains and catch a falling guy. Too many unrealistic scenes. Story line is very weak. Vfx looks OK nothing great. All characters having fake and funny beards. Just an overrated movie.",super hero movie without mentioning as superhero,watched it recently when it was aired tv its nothing but superhero movie where main protagonist does everything impossible with his hands main character can do anything like fighting 1000s soldiers with sword hold 1000 kg idol with just rope jump mountains catch falling guy too many unrealistic scenes story line is very weak vfx looks ok nothing great all characters having fake funny beards just overrated movie,0.680448717948718,0.05096153846153846,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
5,All Hype No Heart,"When it is announced that tollywood is embarking on a first of its kind visual ""epic"", curiosity rose to the skies, the budget (250 crores), the stellar cast and the technicians all brought goose pimples to tollywood audience, especially when it was announced that the story was so mammoth it needed two parts to tell it. While we walk into the multiplex screening this mammoth spectacle of epic proportions, we prepare ourselves for a visual grandeur of a la Cleopatra, ten commandments, Spartacus or even Ben-hur, but sadly that was not to be, and ""BAHUBALI"" does disappoint on lot of areas, primarily the screenplay and the story.The movie begins with queen mother Sivagami (Ramyakrishna) trying to save an infant from some soldiers and dies just after handing over the baby to a tribal queen Sanga (Rohini). Rohini christens the boy as Sivudu (Prabhas), who actually develops an infatuation over a mountain peak and wants to see what lies beyond it.One day he succeeds in his mission and goes over the peak and runs into a rebel Avanthika (Tamannah Bhatia) and falls for her. Avanthika is on a rescue mission to save a certain Devasena (Anushka Shetty) who was imprisoned by the cruel king Balala Deva (Daguppati Rana) for more than 25 years. Devasena is waiting anxiously for her son to come and rescue her, though repeated requests from her loyalist Kattappa (Sathyaraj) to free her fell on deaf ears.Sivudu, takes over the mission from Avanthika and enters the kingdom of Mahishmathi to rescue Devasena. He succeeds in rescuing her and also killing the crown prince. Out in the wilderness, he learns the truth about his father Bahubali (prabhas again) and how he was treacherously killed by none other than..........................Sure, the movie was mounted on a mammoth scale, but what was lacking was a proper storyline. I know fans of the actors would argue that the real story is in the part II and this was just giving us a taste of what was to come. Well! I still say that they should have done a better job at giving us a good taste. The battle scene (only one) was neatly choreographed by Peter Heins and yes it does bring to memory lot of Hollywood epic battle scenes most notably 300 and Troy.Anushka Shetty was breathtakingly horrific as Devasena, her eyes spewing venom and the prosthetic makeup on her was natural and radiated a kind of zombiesque look, but it was magnificent.Tamannah Bhatia was the surprise package, she looked glamorous in the strip battle scene ( a format borrowed heavily from Zorro series starring Catherina Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas) and was chilling as the blood thirsty rebel hacking and chopping her way in her actual introduction sequence.The movie belongs to RamyaKrishna who takes charge as Sivagami and radiates an immense presence even in scenes where she is not to be seen. Her performance when she cuts the throat of a traitor and immediately goes back to singing a lullaby to her baby was chillingly horrific.Prabhas disappoints big time, what was he thinking using the same bhimavaram accent and the hairstyle, they should have at least done something about these two. He does appear confused with both the roles, maybe we get to see some performance in the second part.Rana too dashes hopes, he is not so menacing as the publicity designs make him to be. He is just a sorry mess of Duryodhana and Rameses, the Egyptian pharaoh.Sathyaraj's character reminds you too much of Bheeshma from Mahabharata, a person who knows his king is wrong, but what the hell, he has sworn allegiance and he is to stand by the king.Music by Keeravani is forgettable, you don't remember any of the songs except the ""pachhabottu"" song, even that because of Tamannah's strip act.KK Senthil Kumar's cinematography is a wow, he has managed to capture every single thing the way it was meant to be. The battle scenes were beautifully covered, so was Sivudu's mission impossible mountain hike as well as the palace grandeur.End of the day, it only looks like SS Rajamouli has bitten more than he can chew this time. But yes he does deserve a pat on the back for even thinking of mounting a movie on such a scale, if only he had concentrated on the story as well, we would have had a epic adventure on our hands.",all hype no heart,when it is announced that tollywood is embarking first its kind visual epic curiosity rose skies budget 250 crores stellar cast technicians all brought goose pimples tollywood audience especially when it was announced that story was so mammoth it needed two parts tell it while we walk into multiplex screening this mammoth spectacle epic proportions we prepare ourselves visual grandeur la cleopatra ten commandments spartacus or even ben hur but sadly that was not be bahubali does disappoint lot areas primarily screenplay story movie begins with queen mother sivagami ramyakrishna trying save infant some soldiers dies just after handing over baby tribal queen sanga rohini rohini christens boy as sivudu prabhas who actually develops infatuation over mountain peak wants see what lies beyond it one day he succeeds his mission goes over peak runs into rebel avanthika tamannah bhatia falls her avanthika is rescue mission save certain devasena anushka shetty who was imprisoned by cruel king balala deva daguppati rana more than 25 years devasena is waiting anxiously her son come rescue her though repeated requests her loyalist kattappa sathyaraj free her fell deaf ears sivudu takes over mission avanthika enters kingdom mahishmathi rescue devasena he succeeds rescuing her also killing crown prince out wilderness he learns truth about his father bahubali prabhas again how he was treacherously killed by none other than sure movie was mounted mammoth scale but what was lacking was proper storyline i know fans actors would argue that real story is part ii this was just giving us taste what was come well i still say that they should have done better job at giving us good taste battle scene only one was neatly choreographed by peter heins yes it does bring memory lot hollywood epic battle scenes most notably 300 troy anushka shetty was breathtakingly horrific as devasena her eyes spewing venom prosthetic makeup her was natural radiated kind zombiesque look but it was magnificent tamannah bhatia was surprise package she looked glamorous strip battle scene format borrowed heavily zorro series starring catherina zeta jones antonio banderas was chilling as blood thirsty rebel hacking chopping her way her actual introduction sequence movie belongs ramyakrishna who takes charge as sivagami radiates immense presence even scenes where she is not be seen her performance when she cuts throat traitor immediately goes back singing lullaby her baby was chillingly horrific prabhas disappoints big time what was he thinking using same bhimavaram accent hairstyle they should have at least done something about these two he does appear confused with both roles maybe we get see some performance second part rana too dashes hopes he is not so menacing as publicity designs make him be he is just sorry mess duryodhana rameses egyptian pharaoh sathyarajs character reminds you too much bheeshma mahabharata person who knows his king is wrong but what hell he has sworn allegiance he is stand by king music by keeravani is forgettable you dont remember any songs except pachhabottu song even that because tamannahs strip act kk senthil kumars cinematography is wow he has managed capture every single thing way it was meant be battle scenes were beautifully covered so was sivudus mission impossible mountain hike as well as palace grandeur end day it only looks like ss rajamouli has bitten more than he can chew this time but yes he does deserve pat back even thinking mounting movie such scale if only he had concentrated story as well we would have had epic adventure our hands,0.5346497858402619,0.04089191232048374,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.27}"
