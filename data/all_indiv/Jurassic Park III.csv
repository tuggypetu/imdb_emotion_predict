8.0,Much Better Than Its Reputation; Short & Fun,"First of all, this final episode in the Jurassic series did not deserve all the bad reviews it got when it was released. In fact, it was a lot more enjoyable than the stupid second JP. Did it equal the first? No, of course not. The original story was easily the best of the three, but I found this an enjoyable movie and far better than what I had been led to believe.The filmmakers were smart in making this a short film. People had seen plenty of the dinosaurs by now so let's no overdo it...and they didn't with an film just under an hour-and-a-half (not including the final credits.).That made this short-and-sweet. We saw some new reptiles, had a few scares, enjoyed the beautiful jungle scenery (filmed in Hawaii) and - bang - it's over. The characters were fine, nobody totally annoying as in the second film. The lulls featured a family getting back together and finding their missing teen. Nothing wrong with that.A good story unfairly maligned and nice, short evening of entertainment.",much better than its reputation short fun,first all this final episode jurassic series did not deserve all bad reviews it got when it was released fact it was lot more enjoyable than stupid second jp did it equal first no course not original story was easily best three but i found this enjoyable movie far better than what i had been led believe filmmakers were smart making this short film people had seen plenty dinosaurs by now so lets no overdo it they didnt with film just under hour half not including final credits that made this short sweet we saw some new reptiles had few scares enjoyed beautiful jungle scenery filmed hawaii bang its over characters were fine nobody totally annoying as second film lulls featured family getting back together finding their missing teen nothing wrong with that good story unfairly maligned nice short evening entertainment,0.510457963089542,0.10824077238550925,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,Underrated pure fun popcorn Action film!,"Jurassic Park III (2001) is a pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film and the third entry of the Jurassic Park trilogy. It is an awesome underrated Action flick a million ways better than the new movie Jurassic World (2015)!!!!!!!! The third entry of Jurassic park Trilogy is very underrated solid action flick. I will take third Jurassic Park III movie over Jurassic World! Just like a pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film, I will take this one. They brought Sam Neill back as Dr. Alan Grant back. The film was a rescue mission, it was fast paced and it was short than the second flick. I still love The Lost World: Jurassic Park equal as the first flick Jurassic Park, but this flick grow on me and I love it and I have changed my mind. I love this flick I love it to death. I will rather watch this flick than forgettable Jurassic World! I love this flick to death and it is my third favorite film in the Jurassic park trilogy. As the first time I saw this film, I wasn't fan about it, but I keep watching it and I liked it, this movie grow on me. The film was fast paced, it went really fast around, it was an action film, it wasn't an epic adventure like was the first movie Jurassic Park (1993) it was actually an action flick an a rescue mission. Plot: Adventure runs wild when renowned palentologist Dr. Alan Grant agrees to accompany a wealthy adventurer and his wife on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna, InGen's former breeding ground for prehistoric creatures. But when they're terrifyingly stranded, Dr. Grant discovers that his hosts are not what they seem, and the island's native inhabitants are smarter, faster, fiercer and more brutal than he ever imagined in this heart-stomping thriller.The film was directed by Joe Johnston who also directed The Rocketeer, I haven't seen that flick in ages yet, The Pagemaster, Jumanji and Captain America: The First Avenger that I am fan of that film. After the success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Joe Johnston expressed interest in directing a sequel. Spielberg instead gave Joe Johnston permission to direct the third film in the series, if there were to be one. I don't think the director did a terrible job, I think that this movie more lacked on a script writers, so is not Joe Johnston fault for directing this film for using more CGI in the film.I love Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant and I love that he goes on an Island Isla Sorna, where man is up against dangerous predators in the ultimate battle for survival. This movie takes no prisoners and pulls no punches. It takes the idea of the original, puts an interesting twist into the plot, injects it with good FX, good acting and a decent budget, and you have something far superior to the original.I like all- new dinosaurs and the special effects CGI, more practical effects are in there, they did not bothered me or that it was directed from someone else and not Steven Spielberg himself. I like the CGI in this film.A wealthy couple with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) land on a island Isla Sorna and all the mercenaries are killed off, I like that in the film that the mercenaries are killed off. This film is very quickly paced, is not boring film and it is not a dull movie, it does not drag a long, is very interesting to me and it is a good action film. Jurassic park III is MILES way better to me than Jurassic World, I will rather watch this film than the new one. The first time I reviewed this film I hated it, but now I loved it a lot.I am fine with the FX of the Spinosaurus, I like Spinosaurus, I thought it was pretty cool. Btw the kid in this movie wasn't annoying and I think he really did a good job, he was smart and recourses, he was useful in this movie, he survived that length of time by himself & saved Alan against Spinosaurus, so yea I like that and I like this film. I don't think it was terrible or forgettable at all. I really did not like that Laura Dern can't return with her character in a cameo scene, but still I liked that they made her a happy married woman with the kid and I still like that Alan and Ellie are still in contact together, that is decent in the film. Also Michael Jeter from Drop Zone (1994) as a mercenary is in here, John Diehl from Miami Vice is in it and Bruce A. Young from The Sentinel and Basic Instinct (1992) is in it, as a third mercenary. Overall: The ranting for this film I am giving is an 8.5/10 I love this film and In my opinion is the last good Jurassic film, a very hated and underrated. Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American adventure science fiction film. It is the third installment in the Jurassic Park film series. The film stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. It is the first film in the series not to have been directed by Steven Spielberg, nor based on a book by Michael Crichton (though numerous scenes in the film were ultimately taken from Crichton's novels Jurassic Park and The Lost World).8.5/10 Grade: B+ Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Sam Neill, William H.

4.0,When a powerhouse franchise crumbles,"I mentioned in my review of The Lost World: Jurassic Park that it would be difficult to call a dinosaur film, at that time, at least, ""routine"" or cliché because of how rarely dinosaurs were put on film. With Jurassic Park III, however, we now have two very capable films to compare this one to, and this, on top of several issues this installment bears, work to not only derail a franchise that had fairly solid footing in the ground but managed to defy odds to become one of the few defining films in American history for its special effects.Jurassic Park III can't manage to conjure up the same kind of danger that the original film did, nor the moodiness and the energetic cast of misfits of the second film. It plays like a theme park ride, with little sense of danger and a heavy sense of perfunctory happenings that simply occur in without much added spark of ingenuity or creativity behind them. Where Steven Spielberg had a method to his madness, and a terrific sense of buildup in both of his films, director Joe Johnston and writers Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne (yes, Election and Sideways Alexander Payne), and Jim Taylor simply stumble when trying to find a route to take with Jurassic Park III that works and breeds new life into material that's beginning to show signs of wear.We refocus on Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) of the first film, who is now refreshed with the events of Jurassic Park out of his mind. Despite saying he has no ambition to return to a life involving dinosaurs, Dr. Grant meets a man named Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his wife Amanda (Téa Leoni), who cut him a blank check to give them an aerial tour of the island of Isla Sorna. He reluctantly agrees until, while on the plane, realizes that the Kirby's want to land on and explore the island, resulting in a plane crash that leaves the three of them, plus Grant's son Billy (Alessandro Nivola) and a handful of Kirby's men, stranded in a playground filled with dinosaurs. Worst of all, many of the dinosaurs are Pterodactyls, soaring menaces that hunt for prey on the ground before scooping them up and taking off without a trace.The Pterodactyls steal the show in this film, for they are the ones who are unpredictable, quick-witted, and more entertaining to watch than the group of misplaced actors on display. The Lost World had the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Vince Vaughn, all actors you wouldn't think would star in a Jurassic Park film, but somehow found their way onto the set and decided to make due with what they had. In turn, they turned into be a cast of likable character actors, making for one of the most surprisingly functional misfit casts I have yet to see.Jurassic Park III, on the other hand, is what happens when a series of actors find themselves working together and something feels off. It's not really an involvement thing, but there seems to be a general level of discomfort amongst the actors; actors like Macy and Leoni seem terribly out of place with a film like this, and no character, not even Grant, bears any likability throughout the course of the film. The original Jurassic Park had its share of empty characters, but at least devoted enough time to them to show that Spielberg and company were trying to provide audiences with an even balance of talking and action, whereas The Lost World found a way to more-or-less balance the dichotomy out to a rather effective level. Jurassic Park III can't seem to do either very convincingly; it's too busy trying to set up the next action sequence when it focuses on the characters and is too busy looking for an easy way out during the action sequences.Finally, there's the emotionally manipulative angle that comes up with this film too, particularly in the ending, which ties everything together with a very incredulous circumstance combined with cloying choral music to let us know that everybody involved is safe and sound. This kind of thing only works to soil the scope and power of the original film and the kind of dark, brooding atmosphere The Lost World bravely built. The special effects are still strong, only this time, merging CGI with animatronics leaves a bit of a hokiness to the dinosaurs, particularly the Velociraptor, which bears a feathery coat (while this may be more scientifically accurate, it looks messy and unbelievable on-screen). Where the other two films were creating a powerhouse franchise in film, Jurassic Park III is looking for a quick buck, and that part is evident from the cast choices, the writing, and the general feel, all of which feel significantly squandered and traded in for something convenient rather than daring.Starring: Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, and Alessandro Nivola.

5.0,A Bad Sequel,"Jurassic Park III is the worst out of the Jurassic Park trilogy. It failed in making a great film. The spinosauros just disturbed me throughout the movie of how stupid and dull it was to be the main dinosaur of the movie. T-Rex has been my ultimate favorite dinosaur and Joe Johnston made the stupid spinosauros kill it. The T-Rex was amazing and even the scientists said it was the most fiercest dinosaur on the planet. Why did they make the spinosauros be the best. Paleontologists haven't even found all of the fossils of the spinosauros. Sorry, but that just makes me mad that they would put the spinosauros the fiercest when the T-Rex was. But, I did like the raptors in the movie. They were very neat and the raptors were the ones that were the mostly entertaining throughout the movie. I guess this was an entertaining despite the stupid spinosauros and the bad acting this could've been a good film.5/10",bad sequel,jurassic park iii is worst out jurassic park trilogy it failed making great film spinosauros just disturbed me throughout movie how stupid dull it was be main dinosaur movie t rex has been my ultimate favorite dinosaur joe johnston made stupid spinosauros kill it t rex was amazing even scientists said it was most fiercest dinosaur planet why did they make spinosauros be best paleontologists havent even found all fossils spinosauros sorry but that just makes me mad that they would put spinosauros fiercest when t rex was but i did like raptors movie they were very neat raptors were ones that were mostly entertaining throughout movie i guess this was entertaining despite stupid spinosauros bad acting this couldve been good film 5 10,0.6916666666666665,-0.05681818181818179,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.2}"
2.0,Far-fetched and ridiculous.,"Its the third film of the ""Jurassic Park"" saga and tells the return of Alan Grant to Isla Sorna, of the second film, and that Alan never have thought to visit again in his life. He eventually returns, convinced by a couple who hides her true intent with that trip: to rescue a child who was lost on the island.Its the only film in this franchise that has not been directed by Steven Spielberg, one noted and notable absence throughout the film, which reveals itself, scene after scene, increasingly far-fetched and unbelievable, to the point of becoming absolutely ridiculous and we almost wish all end up devoured by dinosaurs. The director, Joe Johnston, proved that he only serves to direct comedies (is the director of ""Jumanji"" and ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids""). The script is a shame and looks more like a parody of Spielberg's movies than something that we should take seriously. The characters are totally improbable, and who saw the first movies will never believe that a child can survive with such dangerous animals more than two or three days. The only positive note is the performance of Sam Neill, lending talent to a film that should have been lost in the bowels of the dinosaurs he portrays before coming to our homes.",far fetched ridiculous,its third film jurassic park saga tells return alan grant isla sorna second film that alan never have thought visit again his life he eventually returns convinced by couple who hides her true intent with that trip rescue child who was lost island its only film this franchise that has not been directed by steven spielberg one noted notable absence throughout film which reveals itself scene after scene increasingly far fetched unbelievable point becoming absolutely ridiculous we almost wish all end up devoured by dinosaurs director joe johnston proved that he only serves direct comedies is director jumanji honey i shrunk kids script is shame looks more like parody spielbergs movies than something that we should take seriously characters are totally improbable who saw first movies will never believe that child can survive with such dangerous animals more than two or three days only positive note is performance sam neill lending talent film that should have been lost bowels dinosaurs he portrays before coming our homes,0.6563241106719367,0.05281620553359684,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
1.0,Get Closer withThe Adventures of Jungle-Boy,"Say what you want about Jurassic Park (JP1,) or the inferior follow-up, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (JP2,) you know you had a good thing when the name ""Steven Spielberg"" is written on the back of the director's chair.This (should've been) direct-to-video mess of a movie, unoriginally called Jurassic Park III (JP3)– I'm guessing only because they wanted to show claws for the I-I-I, failed on EVERY LEVEL. So much so, I don't know where to begin.Was the downfall the awful (and over-)acting? The terrible dialogue – including one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes, when the raptor calls out Alan's name? The downsized special effects? The sheer mockery of using the classic original score to remind us of a better film? The idiotic reasons to get both Laura Dern back and Sam Neill as well as Sammy back on an island full of dinos? How about the Saving Private Ryan Spielberg tribute finale or was it Jungle-Boy? (More on that atrocity later.) Orwas it the insanely 568th zoom-in/close up of the both the actors, namely Mr. Initforthemoney Neill, and the dinosaurs?Mercifully, the movie's only attribute was its 92 minute length. After you get past that sigh of relief and the regret of wasting those precious 92 minutes knowing all well you shouldn't have returned to the island with Mr. Spiralingdowncareer Neill, you have silly people running around doing and saying silly things making you wonder why this wasn't rated G. Heck, it was basically animated with some of the dinosaurs. Some that even talk!And what's worse? A character that vows never to step into the land of the lost-scripts, but sells out with the deposit of a check or an actor that does the same? What's that old phrase: Fool me oncewell, Alan (Neill) did make this very same mistake in JP1 but you'll have to forgive him: though he was offered money, he was tricked onto the island of the dinos. Here, he, wellwas offered money and was tricked onto the island of the dinos. How does someone of such idiocy become a doctor?I digress, he isn't real and this just further proof of poor screenplay writing – and from three different men, one of which I WILL NOT forgive: Alexander Payne, author of excellent movies such as Election and Sideways.And speaking of poorly written Part IIIs, I'm sure it's already been stated this is the Jaws 3D of our generation with the coincidence of Spielberg directing both part ones of the series mentioned. Thankfully, in 2001, the 3D re-trend hadn't begun yet, so I can imagine this movie actually could've been worse with the use of 3D. Though they certainly tried towith all those damned close-ups.I have NOT seen so many close ups in my life. Back in 2001, when I saw this movie for the first (of now only two) time(s), I saw it with a buddy friend of mine. We laughed our asses off throughout – yeah, laughing at it, but one of the things that were hilarious, though annoying, were the zoom in creatures, including the actors. This occurs roughly every 2-3, maybe 5, minutes of screen time. The last straw towards the ending when my friend wanted to put his fist through a wall: in the fiftieth time they showed off their graphics of the dinos, the scene was set-up and was, once again another zoom in on one of the creatures. My buddy saw it coming and he warned me: if theyif they do it Of course, we always had the same response of whenever they did: we would say to each other ""Alan?"" as in the first of many horrid scenes towards the beginning when a raptor speaks Alan's name to himon an airplane.Anyways, I better seal off this review, though I am happy now that I've seen it, it's fresher in my mind to review it and now I never, ever have to see it again. The BASIC plot is idiot male takes Erik (Trevor Morgan, a.k.a. Jungle-Boy) on a ""Dino-Soar"" expedition of the restricted island of dinosaurs left vacant (of humans, supposedly) from JP2. Inevitably, they crash onto the island.In comes Mommy & Daddy, too inept to barely walk and chew at the same time yelling out idiot lines and gestures. They hire sell-out Alan to ""just fly"" over the island, but in reality, they're there to get back their son who's been gone for two months. Literally, after the AGAIN inevitable crash the movie turns to some odd-ball screw-ball comedy with all-but zero original ideas of how to now use the dinosaurs on screen.ThenJust when you thought it was safe towait, let me start overJust when you thought JP3 couldn't get any worse, in comes Jungle-Boy to the rescue. And let's give him some credit: he is one humble kid. After incredibly surviving eight weeks without training, adequate supplies, company, help or hope, his first concern when found: ""Golly gee wilikers, I hope mom and dad are getting along!""He swoops in (believe me, this had me and my buddy roaring in laughter in the theatre), saves Alan from the seventh near-death situation, who promptly has a very nice and calm conversation about Alan's books (again, see JP1), about how mommy & daddy are getting along while Alan unforgivingly eats the kid's precious final food scraps.At any rate, this leads to that, that leads to more of the same and the conclusion will have you, for the umpteenth time laughing out loud.Just skip the throw-away JP3.

6.0,Not as good as the previous JP's.,"Jurassic Park 3 was a shorter and less entertaining of the three. I thought this sequel might be good because JP2 was good but I was wrong! I have picked some notes while watching this movie. Usually Jurassic Park films are 2 hours long, this one is some 40 minutes less! and does not quite contain the same fun and horror it did on previous jp's. DR. Grant returns which is a suprise. It didn't have it's entertaining parts though i must admit. JP3 had amazing special effects, most probably the best out of the three. I have heard that Jurassic Park 4 will be released in 2004. Should I say this one will be a bad sequel as well?",not as good as previous jps,jurassic park 3 was shorter less entertaining three i thought this sequel might be good because jp2 was good but i was wrong i have picked some notes while watching this movie usually jurassic park films are 2 hours long this one is some 40 minutes less does not quite contain same fun horror it did previous jps dr grant returns which is suprise it didnt have its entertaining parts though i must admit jp3 had amazing special effects most probably best out three i have heard that jurassic park 4 will be released 2004 should i say this one will be bad sequel as well,0.44630325814536337,0.19423558897243112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
7.0,Amusing Dino Adventure Without The Sophistication or Craftsmanship of Spielberg's Originals,"I must admit, straight away, that Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movie franchises of all-time. I have a special place in my heart for Steven Spielberg's one-two punch of Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Both films represent, to me, the absolute zenith of blockbuster filmmaking. More than just the game-changing special effects, it was smart writing, endearing characters, and a savory buffet of craftsmanship that made those films stand out from the crowd. For the third Jurassic Park movie, the directorial torch was passed to Joe Johnston, and predictably, the result is a film that seems like it comes from another universe. Jurassic Park 3 is nowhere near the level of the first two Jurassic Park movies, and I suppose for those less enthusiastic about the series, that may be a dealbreaker. For me? Well, I was able to get past it. The clear step down in quality may take some getting used to (maybe even a couple of viewings), but I found that once I made peace with the fact that JP3 isn't an A-caliber blockbuster, what I was left with was a good B-caliber blockbuster; A breezy little summertime thrill ride with some fun dinosaur action. And come on, who doesn't love dinosaurs?Was Jurassic Park 3 really a necessary sequel? Was there some story waiting to be told? Some unanswered questions or themes to explore? Of course not. You can smell the studio's fingerprints all over Jurassic Park 3's script. The story is best described as a question, ""How do we get Alan Grant back to a dinosaur-infested island?"" The writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, answer this question, but after that, they've got nothing. After Grant is duped by a divorced couple into visiting Site B in order to find their missing son, the film is just a chase picture, or maybe you could call it a wander picture, because there really is no urgency to the group's plan. Just get off the island, is about the extent of it. Tea Leoni and William H. Macy play the divorced couple, and they are good as typical Midwestern, suburban parents. Sam Neil's return as paleontologist Alan Grant is one of the few welcome sights in the character department. Neil does some classy work, and it is nice to see him back after he sat The Lost World out. The other characters, with the exception of the kid, are basically dino food from the beginning, and I do mean the beginning. Jurassic Park 3 wastes little time getting to what we all paid to see, dinosaurs eating, chasing, and just downright harassing humans. From the very start of the film, with a cartoony title card that shows a raptor claw slashing ""///"" through the Jurassic Park logo, it's apparent that this Jurassic Park does not take itself near as seriously as the first two do. There is not much effort given to building tension, which was at least half the appeal of Spielberg's movies. No time spent preparing us for the eventual running... and screaming. No, it's just all-out action from the very moment Grant arrives on the island. The dinosaurs themselves have taken the leap from lifelike animals to movie monsters. They chase and eat and roar. Why? Because they're dinosaurs, that's why. You won't hear any talk of maternal instincts here. Jurassic Park 3 aims for the basic visceral thrills of the series, and Johnston hits that target. Watching people run from dinosaurs is a lot of fun, no matter the context, but Johnston and company do construct some truly rousing set-pieces. The Spinosaurus vs T-Rex fight is a neat little 'Why Not?' moment, and the trip into the Pterodactyl cage is bigger in scale than anything from the previous two films. You don't get much in the way of tension in JP 3's action scenes, but they move along nicely, and they're well mounted for sure. The special effects, while not quite on the same level as its predecessor's (despite coming out four years after), are still effective. When it comes to realizing extinct creatures in three dimensions, ILM and Stan Winston are still a quantum leap in front of everybody else.Jurassic Park 3 is a textbook definition of 'disappointment'. It's a sequel that lacks the passion, spark, and creative talent of its predecessors. I hated it the first time I saw it, but as time goes by, I find it harder and harder to dislike. It works like a thrill ride at Disney World or Universal Studios. A quick pre-ride set up, and then it's time to strap in for non-stop dinosaur action. Jurassic Park 3 doesn't claim to offer more than those basic thrill ride pleasures, but those pleasures are enough for me. For summer matinée fare, you could do much worse.72/100",amusing dino adventure without sophistication or craftsmanship spielbergs originals,i must admit straight away that jurassic park is one my favorite movie franchises all time i have special place my heart steven spielbergs one two punch jurassic park lost world both films represent me absolute zenith blockbuster filmmaking more than just game changing special effects it was smart writing endearing characters savory buffet craftsmanship that made those films stand out crowd third jurassic park movie directorial torch was passed joe johnston predictably result is film that seems like it comes another universe jurassic park 3 is nowhere near level first two jurassic park movies i suppose those less enthusiastic about series that may be dealbreaker me well i was able get past it clear step down quality may take some getting used maybe even couple viewings but i found that once i made peace with fact that jp3 isnt caliber blockbuster what i was left with was good b caliber blockbuster breezy little summertime thrill ride with some fun dinosaur action come who doesnt love dinosaurs was jurassic park 3 really necessary sequel was there some story waiting be told some unanswered questions or themes explore course not you can smell studios fingerprints all over jurassic park 3s script story is best described as question how do we get alan grant back dinosaur infested island writers peter buchman alexander payne jim taylor answer this question but after that theyve got nothing after grant is duped by divorced couple into visiting site b order find their missing son film is just chase picture or maybe you could call it wander picture because there really is no urgency groups plan just get off island is about extent it tea leoni william h macy play divorced couple they are good as typical midwestern suburban parents sam neils return as paleontologist alan grant is one few welcome sights character department neil does some classy work it is nice see him back after he sat lost world out other characters with exception kid are basically dino food beginning i do mean beginning jurassic park 3 wastes little time getting what we all paid see dinosaurs eating chasing just downright harassing humans very start film with cartoony title card that shows raptor claw slashing through jurassic park logo its apparent that this jurassic park does not take itself near as seriously as first two do there is not much effort given building tension which was at least half appeal spielbergs movies no time spent preparing us eventual running screaming no its just all out action very moment grant arrives island dinosaurs themselves have taken leap lifelike animals movie monsters they chase eat roar why because theyre dinosaurs thats why you wont hear any talk maternal instincts here jurassic park 3 aims basic visceral thrills series johnston hits that target watching people run dinosaurs is lot fun no matter context but johnston company do construct some truly rousing set pieces spinosaurus vs t rex fight is neat little why not moment trip into pterodactyl cage is bigger scale than anything previous two films you dont get much way tension jp 3s action scenes but they move along nicely theyre well mounted sure special effects while not quite same level as its predecessors despite coming out four years after are still effective when it comes realizing extinct creatures three dimensions ilm stan winston are still quantum leap front everybody else jurassic park 3 is textbook definition disappointment its sequel that lacks passion spark creative talent its predecessors i hated it first time i saw it but as time goes by i find it harder harder dislike it works like thrill ride at disney world or universal studios quick pre ride set up then its time strap non stop dinosaur action jurassic park 3 doesnt claim offer more than those basic thrill ride pleasures but those pleasures are enough me summer matin e fare you could do much worse 72 100,0.4114907897315305,0.10922006662747404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.48}"
1.0,"An Insult, A Disgrace, An Absolute Betrayal To The Jurassic Park Franchise","I like Joe Johnston. The Wolfman is an underrated masterpiece, Captain America: The First Avenger is probably the best MCU film and The Rocketeer is one of the better 90s superhero movies. So how, God almighty, how, did he create something as irredeemably and unforgivably awful as this? Jurassic Park III is a spit to the face to everything that made me love this franchise, disrespectful to its legacy at best and an insulting betrayal to everything it stands for at worst. I hate Johnston's Jurassic Park III almost as much as I love his Wolfman remake.The way this film ruins Alan Grant's character really doesn't get mentioned enough. Grant here is a self centered, miserable, greedy, unnuanced, cranky dickhead. Remember that scene in the original Jurassic Park where he's explaining to Lex how the carnivorous dinosaurs of the island aren't necessarily bad, just an aggressive part of a natural ecosystem? (""The other kind aren't bad, they just...Do what they do."") Well you can forget all about that here, a film where he speaks on a pulpit like a fire-and-brimstone preacher about how they're ""genetically engineered theme park monsters"" who need to be destroyed, later whining about how they deserve it because they tried to eat him. He has to be tricked and bribed into saving a child for Pete's sake!The other characters aren't that much better. Most of them are just shallow and empty archetypes with zero characterization (The workaholic parent, the badass kid, the reckless pupil, e.t.c) that are hardly worth remembering, let alone liking. Then there's Tea Leoni's Amanda Kirby, who is almost as unlikable as this film's version of Grant. Her only characterization here appears to be screaming unconvincingly and being as loud and obnoxious as possible because this film thinks that's funny. It's hard to believe watching this how this was once a franchise lauded for its relatively feminist depiction of women in a very male-dominated genre of Sci-Fi (It's telling how this and the original Jurassic World are both the worst franchise installments, as well as the least female empowering ones.) The only form of development any of these characters get is the stock ""workaholic parents are finally there for their family"" that we've seen in God knows how many bad family movies.Speaking of Tea Leoni, nobody gives a good performance in this. Yes, that includes Sam Neil, who is clearly sleep walking his way through a paycheck role that he seems to have active contempt for. He underacts as much as Leoni overacts, not that the screenplay gives him anything to work with in terms of its flaccid, pathetically weak dialogue. William H. Macy's performance is similarly phoned in; show up, be quirky in a very William H. Macy way, collect the check and leave. Nobody in this cast had any passion, nobody cared.This film talks a big game with lines about how InGen ""play(s) God"" and how certain characters are ""no better than the people who built this place"" but it all goes nowhere. It's mentioned and never expanded upon so that the movie can feel more mature and adult than it actually is. Jurassic Park III is a film that goes absolutely nowhere thematically and literally talks about nothing. It wants to feel epic without actually being epic. Without actually earning that title. It's like a High School student who lazily slaps together a school paper on Romeo & Juliet in 20 minutes and then expects to get an A+. It'a anti-ambition and it's infuriating.For a series so traditionally dependent on visual storytelling, the film lacks any kind of awe and wonder. It's a hollow Horror show, a great, big shock-fest to see which hollow caricatures can die first and how. Sure, Jurassic Park has always had an element of terror, but it also had a deep element of (For lack of a better term) humanity to it. The best of these films were about the power of nature, both to horrify as well to shock and enchant. There is nothing to be enchanted by here. None of the dinosaurs here have any personality beyond being mindless, vicious killing machines that stalk our main characters like Jason Voorhees, even when they're reasonably full and fed. Don't even get me started on the Spinosaurus, a dinosaur with a boring design whose sole personality trait is to be a ""cooler"" and ""edgier"" T-Rex for a new generation of wide-eyed youths. Even as a kid, I hated this pretender to the role of franchise icon and his killing of the iconic T-Rex felt like a massive piss over everyone who grew to care for this franchise. The film only has one moment where it so much as attempts a moment of genuine heart with these creatures, but it's so unearned and out of left field with such a poor CGI render that it's just laughable. If these are truly what the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park have become, maybe Grant's terrible, misguided, out of character like about ""genetically engineered theme park monsters"" isn't so inaccurate.Jurassic Park III also has no idea what tone it's going for at all. It'll showcase extremely dark imagery at times with its graphic death scenes, and its musical score definitely takes on the darkest tone of any Jurassic Park film to date, but then engages in weird comedic gags like talking raptors and jokes about T-Rex pee. Nothing meshes here. It's a mashup of ideas that aren't coherent and don't blend with each other at all.Jurassic Park III is an absolute travesty, the kind of disastrous sequel that should be mentioned with the likes of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem and Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. Even thinking about it gets me somewhat angry at how much this missed the mark to anything resembling a quality film. How people sit back and tell me this is a better film than The Lost World is beyond me.",insult disgrace absolute betrayal jurassic park franchise,i like joe johnston wolfman is underrated masterpiece

6.0,Jurassic Park 3 is as Inventive as it's title.,"Jurassic Park 3 was released four years after the Luke warm reception of Spielberg's (underrated) The Lost World. Spielberg opted to not return to helm another Jurassic film, and directing duties were passed over to Joe Johnston. Jurassic Park 3 see's the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, from Jurassic Park. Laura Dern also returns as Ellie Sattler, but sadly in a less prominent role. The story for JP3 is quite simple, Grant is lured by ""adventurous"" couple Paul, & Amanda Kirby, played by William H. Macy & Tea Leoni, to fly over Isla Sorna, with Grant acting as their guide, for money. However the Kirby's are not rich, and lied to Grant so he could help them find their missing son Eric, who wen't missing weeks ago in a parasailing accident near the island. Of course things go wrong, the plane crashes leaving the Kirby's, Grant, his colleague Billy, and a few others stranded on the island. JP3 can only be enjoyed as a trilling dinosaur spectacle, but there isn't much of anything new, or interesting.There are some positives aspects in this film, Sam Neill is a fine actor, and he brings credibility to the film, and is still believable as the Grant character. While the rest of the characters aren't all that fleshed out, the film is well acted, with William H. Macy, and Sam Neill being the standouts. There's a few new dinosaurs, Spinosaurus being the main one. Spinosaurus is a neat dinosaur, and the roar for Spinosaurus is also well executed, and is distinctly different sounding from the now famous T- Rex roar. The animatronic dinosaurs/CGI are once again well executed by Stan Winston's team, and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). JP3 is the first film in the series to combine CGI dinosaurs along with practical ones in the same shot, and the blending between the two is well done. The Spinosaurus attack on the river is a thrilling scene, taking place in water, which hadn't been done. There is also a thrilling Pteranodon sequence, offering a ariel attack which hasn't been seen yet in the franchise. The scene is dimly lit, with fog, and creates the best sense of suspense in the movie. The music in the scene is probably my favorite bit of new music in the film. John Williams didn't score JP3, instead composer Don Davis best known for his work in The Matrix films, provides the music, and does a good job, creating new music that still fits stylistically within the franchise.Though there are positives in JP3 there are many negatives as well. One of the biggest ones I had was the screenwriters not having Grant, and Ellie as a couple. Instead they have a friendship type relationship, and Ellie has a child (with some random guy) who call's Grant ""the dinosaur man"". It just seems stupid to not have Grant be with Ellie after the events of the first film. Grant's character arch of not wanting children changes after he saves Lex, and Tim, and is seemingly ready to settle down with Ellie, which now seems wasted. The dumbest thing about it is it adds nothing to the characters, or the overall film, and was a stupid decision on the writers part. Grant has a dream on the plane nearing the island, and turns to see a raptor that says ""Alan"". The scene is very cheesy, and really is just plain silly, right up there with the gymnast scene in TLW. The Spinosaurus T-Rex fight is neat, but having the T-Rex (a fan favorite) lose, and die, just didn't sit right with many fans, myself included. The characters (while well acted), aren't all that interesting, or all that likable, the Kirby's put peoples lives in danger to find their son, and Billy, decides it would be a good idea to steal raptor eggs to help fund their research back home. There are also many continuity issues in the film, like why the island doesn't look the way it did in TLW, or why the raptors look radically different (some have feather-like quills on their head) from how they did in the pervious films. Where the Spinosaurus was during the events of TLW is suspicious too, the only clue given in the film is when Grant says that Spinosaurus wasn't on Ingen's list. Perhaps the worst part of JP3 is it's ending, which feels insanely rushed, and anti-climantic, almost as if the filmmakers said ""This is going on too long, lets wrap it up"", but with a runtime just over 90 minutes, the abrupt conclusion seems strange, with the previous films being over two hours long. Jurassic Park 3 despite is faults, and there are multiple ones, is still an enjoyable flick for what it is, but it's a huge step down in terms of story, and character, and is just an unnecessary edition to the franchise. The story isn't very interesting, or inspired, and the only thing new in the film are the look of the raptors, and a few new dinosaurs. It's explained during a dinner scene with Grant, and Ellie that the raptors were far more intelligent than imagined, and could talk to each other, but much of this could be assumed in the previous films. Spinosaurus makes for a cool looking successor to T-Rex, but seems more like a movie monster than an animal, compared to T-Rex who while running around chasing/eating people, had moments in both Jurassic Park, and The Lost World that showed a naturalistic side of them, like caring for the infant T-Rex. The only real advances in Jurassic Park 3 are technical ones, but effects aren't what makes a film great, it's the story, and characters that drive a film, and that wasn't strong enough in this entry of the Jurassic Park series.",jurassic park 3 is as inventive as its title,jurassic park 3 was released four years after luke warm reception spielbergs underrated lost world spielberg opted not return helm another jurassic film directing duties were passed over joe johnston jurassic park 3 sees return sam neill as dr alan grant jurassic park laura dern also returns as ellie sattler but sadly less prominent role story jp3 is quite simple grant is lured by adventurous couple paul amanda kirby played by william h macy tea leoni fly over isla sorna with grant acting as their guide money however kirbys are not rich lied grant so he could help them find their missing son eric who went missing weeks ago parasailing accident near island course things go wrong plane crashes leaving kirbys grant his colleague billy few others stranded island jp3 can only be enjoyed as trilling dinosaur spectacle but there isnt much anything new or interesting there are some positives aspects this film sam neill is fine actor he brings credibility film is still believable as grant character while rest characters arent all that fleshed out film is well acted with william h macy sam neill being standouts theres few new dinosaurs spinosaurus being main one spinosaurus is neat dinosaur roar spinosaurus is also well executed is distinctly different sounding now famous t rex roar animatronic dinosaurs cgi are once again well executed by stan winstons team industrial light magic ilm jp3 is first film series combine cgi dinosaurs along with practical ones same shot blending between two is well done spinosaurus attack river is thrilling scene taking place water which hadnt been done there is also thrilling pteranodon sequence offering ariel attack which hasnt been seen yet franchise scene is dimly lit with fog creates best sense suspense movie music scene is probably my favorite bit new music film john williams didnt score jp3 instead composer don davis best known his work matrix films provides music does good job creating new music that still fits stylistically within franchise though there are positives jp3 there are many negatives as well one biggest ones i had was screenwriters not having grant ellie as couple instead they have friendship type relationship ellie has child with some random guy who calls grant dinosaur man it just seems stupid not have grant be with ellie after events first film grants character arch not wanting children changes after he saves lex tim is seemingly ready settle down with ellie which now seems wasted dumbest thing about it is it adds nothing characters or overall film was stupid decision writers part grant has dream plane nearing island turns see raptor that says alan scene is very cheesy really is just plain silly right up there with gymnast scene tlw spinosaurus t rex fight is neat but having t rex fan favorite lose die just didnt sit right with many fans myself included characters while well acted arent all that interesting or all that likable kirbys put peoples lives danger find their son billy decides it would be good idea steal raptor eggs help fund their research back home there are also many continuity issues film like why island doesnt look way it did tlw or why raptors look radically different some have feather like quills their head how they did pervious films where spinosaurus was during events tlw is suspicious too only clue given film is when grant says that spinosaurus wasnt ingens list perhaps worst part jp3 is its ending which feels insanely rushed anti climantic almost as if filmmakers said this is going too long lets wrap it up but with runtime just over 90 minutes abrupt conclusion seems strange with previous films being over two hours long jurassic park 3 despite is faults there are multiple ones is still enjoyable flick what it is but its huge step down terms story character is just unnecessary edition franchise story isnt very interesting or inspired only thing new film are look raptors few new dinosaurs its explained during dinner scene with grant ellie that raptors were far more intelligent than imagined could talk each other but much this could be assumed previous films spinosaurus makes cool looking successor t rex but seems more like movie monster than animal compared t rex who while running around chasing eating people had moments both jurassic park lost world that showed naturalistic side them like caring infant t rex only real advances jurassic park 3 are technical ones but effects arent what makes film great its story characters that drive film that wasnt strong enough this entry jurassic park series,0.544727348674717,0.14045663400926559,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.45}"

1.0,Hunt for more money,"The original Jurassic Park was exciting mainly because of the dinosaurs and the special effects, but the characters, the dialogue, and the overall plot were rather dull.By the third film the characters, the dialogue and the plot have all become much worse, and in addition to that the dinosaurs are no longer that interesting. The end result is a dull, unimaginative film filled with stupid characters, unrealistic plot twists, and not so impressive CGI creatures. This film wastes no time to introduce us to the characters, but it does not bother to develop them. Most of them die pretty quickly anyway. Of course, we are introduced to a child in the latter half of the film, and this character manages to be more irritating than all the rest combined. Apparently he has been living all alone for two months, evading giant meat-eaters and actually having fun. He almost seems sad that the show is over and shows no emotional reaction to the fact that he is not only being rescued, but that his parents are on the dino-infested island. It all ends with a deus ex machina that overshadows the one from the first film (of course, they could not use that one, because they used it early in the film, in a scene where they are saved from a dinosaur by having another dinosaur show up and start a fight with it, allowing the characters to escape in the confusion). Does anyone know how many islands inhabited by dinosaurs there are, and who is in charge? Who cares? There are people being chased by dinosaurs, and that's what you paid to see, right? So shut up and stop asking questions.This film was made for no other reason but to squeeze even more money from the franchise, and it exhibits no traces of genuine desire to create something artistic.

3.0,"""Jurassic Park 3"" Is Hideous!","""Jurassic Park 3"" doesn't take itself seriously like its predecessors and neither should you. Director Steven Spielberg and best-selling author Michael Crichton, who collaborated on the superlative ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and the knockout sequel ""The Lost World (1997), had something to say about scientists who play God and the dangers of cloning. Sadly, Spielberg and Crichton had nothing to do with this sequel. Former ""Star Wars"" art director Joe Johnston of ""October Sky"" (1999), ""The Rocketeer"" (1991), and ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989) replaced Spielberg. You'd think Johnston's experience on ""Jumanji"" (1995) where zoo animals stomped everything in sight, would have made him an ideal candidate. Unfortunately, it didn't. You can count the major differences between Johnston's ""Jurassic Park"" and Spielberg's ""Jurassic Parks"" in minutes. ""JP3"" clocks in at about 90 minutes, while both Spielberg epics exceeded two hours. Although it isn't as pretentious as the first two movies, ""JP3"" relies far more on humor than horror to its detriment. This lukewarm, less-than-savage installment in the cloned-dinosaurs-run-amok series makes references to its predecessors that only hardcore, nitpicking ""Jurassic Park"" fans could catch. The joke about Jack Horner was cute. The dinosaurs are just as menacing, even though bloodthirsty moviegoers may feel cheated. (Imagine what Italian gorefest cult director Lucio Fulci would have done with a ""Jurassic Park"" movie.) Missing this time around is 'chaos theoretician' Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum of ""Independence Day""), who enlivened both the original and the follow-up with his sarcasm. Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill of ""Jurassic Park""), who skipped out on ""The Lost World,"" returns as the dullest of dull heroes, while Grant's former colleague Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern of ""October Sky"") reappears in a welcome cameo. Grant visits her in the opening scene and finds her happily married to a U.S. State Department official with a toddler son and baby daughter. Before she waves goodbye, Ellie reminds Grant to call her if he ever needs her help. Predictably, freshman scenarist Peter Buchman, along with writers Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor of ""Election"" and ""Citizen Ruth"" don't let her welsh on her promise. Film scriptwriting manuals classify this as 'foreshadowing,' setting up some future action so it doesn't appear to haphazardly pop up out of the blue.Basically, ""JP3"" follows the formula that ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" created with greater detail and daring. Reportedly, after Johnston perused the shooting script, he tore it up and ordered rushed rewrites. If this was the best they could contrive, no wonder ""JP3"" is so forgettable. Not only did ""The Lost World"" raise the stakes, but it also surpassed the original with its thrills and chills. Clearly, the third time wasn't the charm. ""Jurassic Park 3"" is as pedestrian as ""Jaws 3."" If you've seen the others, you know Laura Dern's cameo at the outset is standard ""Jurassic Park"" practice. In ""The Lost World,"" Malcolm reunited briefly with John Hammond (Richard Attenborough of ""The Great Escape"") and his grandchildren: Timothy 'Tim' Murphy (Joseph Mazzello) and Alexis 'Lex' Murphy (Ariana Richards) in an early scene. Children cannot die in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise. Neither apparently can mother nor fathers. So much for suspense. Like ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Jurassic Park 3 has our desperate heroes plundering piles of dinosaur dung in search of a satellite phone that could serve as their salvation. That stinking satellite phone infuriated me initially when I heard it ring. I figured that some fool had left their cell phone ringer on in the theatre! Nevertheless, Sarah Harding owned a tattered camera bag she called her lucky bag, just as Belly Brennan sorts a similar camera bag. The scene where Tea Leoni hangs from a tree as ravenous raptors leap up at her alludes to the kitchen scene near the end of ""Jurassic Park."" Instead of being jostling about in small recreational vehicles, Dr. Grant finds himself slammed around in the wrecked fuselage of a plane by a dinosaur. This scene lacks the sheer terror of the T-Rex's introduction in ""Jurassic Park"" and doesn't generate the suspense of ""The Lost World"" cliffhanger scene. Billy steals raptor eggs, and the mothers pursue them across Isla Sorna in a variation on ""The Lost World"" heroes that freed an injured T-Rex baby with a broken leg and found its irate mother pushing their motor home over a cliff. ""The Lost World"" T-Rexes subjected the motor home to more hair-raising demolition than the ""JP3"" T-Rex does to the plane. This time around baby Pterodactyls attack a teenager, much as ""The Lost World"" lizards swarmed after a little rich girl. The major revelation here is the raptors can communicate with each other and might possibly have supplanted primates. Wait, didn't those same raptors communicate with each other back in ""Jurassic Park"" in the kitchen scene? ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" definitely weren't for the squeamish, but ""Jurassic Park 3"" should give nobody nightmares. As in the first two entries, the genetically engineered dinosaurs walk tough, howl vividly, and snap up hapless humans in their jaws. Indeed, the visual effects technology has improved exponentially; sadly, the art of scriptwriting has regressed just as much. Unlike Spielberg, Johnston takes neither the plot nor the stakes to a higher level. Moreover, nothing in ""Jurassic Park 3"" matches either the T-Rex gobbling up the lawyer, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero of ""Get Shorty""), in the original or the scenes from ""The Lost World"" where two T-Rexes tore poor Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) apart. Grant calls Ellie when a real dino tries to chomp and/or drown everybody. Hilariously, her young son delays taking her the phone so he can watch his favorite Barney the Purple Dinosaur episode! The out of place Barney scene deflates any suspense or tension that the Site B dinosaur causes as he rips away at a cage housing our heroes. Anybody who thrilled to the first two ""Jurassic Park"" creature features will probably roll their eyeballs in disbelief at the infantile idiocy of ""Jurassic Park 3.""",jurassic park 3 is

1.0,How to sell a movie with its name...,"Spoilers warning :Jurassic Park, the first episode, was simply innovative, amazing, intelligent, and great. The Lost World was, let's say, bad. But this is different from the two first chapters. Let me explain. This is the (very simple and stupid) story of a young boy doing some kind of parachute with a friend of his parents over Isla Sorna (the island where the story of The Lost World happened). But with some amazing coincidences and unpredictable events (do you feel the sarcasm?), they crash on the island. Then, 8 weeks later (that's a long time to survive, on a near island) the parents pay Alan Grant to come with them save their son on the island. Don't you think the story is stupid? Don't you think this is gratuitous reason to go on an island and get eaten by dinosaurs...This is stupid to the extreme...seriously. But, not only they have a crap-head scenario, but they also have special effects that are really not as good as the first two's. I couldn't recognize the raptors, because teh dinosaur models are different and cheaper, and also, the dinosaurs are so fake sometimes, it's evident...the illusion isn't really there. There are new species of dinosaurs, but the only T-Rex you see lasts only one minute. But the most stupid point of the film, making it a possible winner at the Razzies fest, is the NEW intelligence of the dinosaurs...they communicate like humans (they don't speak, but it almost sounds like that sometimes), they look at each other, they trap humans...this is awfully stupid...and especially in the dinosaur fight, one of them kills the other by holding his head and breaking his neck...and why don't they eat the humans they kill? The acting isn't so good, William H Macy is real bad and fake, like Tea Leoni...some awful one-liners, too predictable to be true...really. The action is so brief, you can't enter into it, there is no stress, no suspense...and the movie has a running time of 85 minutes...plain bad. Overall, stupid story, bad acting, sucky scenario, lame action, no plot, no suspense, just a sell-out under the Jurassic Park title. 2/10",how sell movie with its name,spoilers warning jurassic park first episode was simply innovative amazing intelligent great lost world was lets say bad but this is different two first chapters let me explain this is very simple stupid story young boy doing some kind parachute with friend his parents over isla sorna island where story lost world happened but with some amazing coincidences unpredictable events do you feel sarcasm they crash island then 8 weeks later thats long time survive near island parents pay alan grant come with them save their son island dont you think story is stupid dont you think this is gratuitous reason go island get eaten by dinosaurs this is stupid extreme seriously but not only they have crap head scenario but they also have special effects that are really not as good as first twos i couldnt recognize raptors because teh dinosaur models are different cheaper also dinosaurs are so fake sometimes its evident illusion isnt really there there are new species dinosaurs but only t rex you see lasts only one minute but most stupid point film making it possible winner at razzies fest is new intelligence dinosaurs they communicate like humans they dont speak but it almost sounds like that sometimes they look at each other they trap humans this is awfully stupid especially dinosaur fight one them kills other by holding his head breaking his neck why dont they eat humans they kill acting isnt so good william h macy is real bad fake like tea leoni some awful one liners too predictable be true really action is so brief you cant enter into it there is no stress no suspense movie has running time 85 minutes plain bad overall stupid story bad acting sucky scenario lame action no plot no suspense just sell out under jurassic park title 2 10,0.6387335828013794,-0.09676975566806073,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7.0,"Works on the basis that you don't expect something remotely as fascinating as the original, but still hunger for a shallow 90 minute thrill ride. *** (out of four)","JURASSIC PARK 3 / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	""Jurassic Park 3"" is not as good as the first but a whole lot better than the second. It's also the first film in the series that is not based on a novel by Michael Crichton. That's basically ""JP3"" in a nutshell. It's not necessarily a great movie, nor does it break any new grounds of adventure or take many risks, but it does take advantage of all the creative ideas. You will not hear anyone in the audience complain that the movie isn't inventive, because these writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, really have an imagination. 	The story takes place eight years after the incident at Jurassic Park. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) still works as a paleontologist on dinosaur dig sites in Montana with his young assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola). He's offered a good sum of money by a wealthy couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) who want Grant to guild them on a flight over Isla Sorna-also owned by the dinosaur cooperation. Sam agrees, but once over the island, something goes wrong and he's once again stuck on the dinosaur infested territory fighting for his life.  	""Jurassic Park 3"" is complied with stunning brevity. The dialogue is concise and doesn't wonder. The character's relationships are instantly obvious. It's very clear that this film is shorter, cheaper, and more simple than its predecessors. That is not such a bad thing. The second Jurassic Park was terrible-an all star cast placed in situation and situation where they run from big monstrous creatures. Although ""Jurassic Park 3"" is more or less the same formula, it gets sassy and fresh. Eye-popping special effects involve everything from a bird-dinosaur attempting to feed a human to its babies to a massive battle between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a new breed of lizard called Spinosaurus. Some of these scenes do not really work. Amazingly, many succeed. I have various complaints about the movie. There are not enough violent encounters to keep the audiences interested throughout. Unlike the first two films, the dinos in ""JP3"" only eat a handful of characters and they occur in the opening half hour. You can probably guess the characters who meet a graphic demise; anyone who is billed in the film's credits that you have heard of will probably live. I also think the movie needs more thrills. It seems as if the producers are more interested in proving to the audience that these dinosaurs are really smart rather than focusing on lean, clean terror.Regardless of the pictures many problems, during a summer movie season jam-packed with special effects extravaganzas that don't work (""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Fast and he Furious,"" and ""Swordfirsh"" to name a few) finally comes one that does.

7.0,Fun!,"I expected this to be a very bad movie. I mean Jurassic Park III ??? Comon! It has all been done before how can they possibly come up with a new movie with a believable story. But the movie turned out to be actually pretty good.One of the reasons why this movie became successful for me was because of the different approach. ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" took itself very serious and tried to create a somewhat believable story, while Jurassic Park III had far more humor in it and it was obvious that the makers didn't tried to create a breathtaking movie with lot's of tension and a realistic story, but a fun entertaining non-sense movie instead.The story is also better then I expected, at least it's original and it has some nice moments in it. It's a big plus that finally those dinosaur-birds (sorry, don't remember their name) appear in the movie. The raptors are also cooler then ever. They're not as scary as in the first and second movie, but at least they look better in this one. And that goes for all the dinosaurs. There are some more nice new dinosaurs in this one but I won't mention them all.It's great to see Sam Neill return as Dr. Alan Grant and same goes for Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler (although here role is pretty small but yet important) Alessandro Nivola is a great addition to the cast as Billy Brennan. The other characters are more for the comedy elements which works pretty well.So my conclusion: An entertaining movie that is good for a few laughs and a good movie with some nice scene's and better then ever special effects for the dinosaurs.I'm actually looking forward to ""Jurassic Park IV""!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",fun,i expected this be very bad movie i mean jurassic park iii comon it has all been done before how can they possibly come up with new movie with believable story but movie turned out be actually pretty good one reasons why this movie became successful me was because different approach jurassic park lost world took itself very serious tried create somewhat believable story while jurassic park iii had far more humor it it was obvious that makers didnt tried create breathtaking movie with lots tension realistic story but fun entertaining non sense movie instead story is also better then i expected at least its original it has some nice moments it its big plus that finally those dinosaur birds sorry dont remember their name appear movie raptors are also cooler then ever theyre not as scary as first second movie but at least they look better this one that goes all dinosaurs there are some more nice new dinosaurs this one but i wont mention them all its great see sam neill return as dr alan grant same goes laura dern as dr ellie sattler although here role is pretty small but yet important alessandro nivola is great addition cast as billy brennan other characters are more comedy elements which works pretty well so my conclusion entertaining movie that is good few laughs good movie with some nice scenes better then ever special effects dinosaurs im actually looking forward jurassic park iv 7 10,0.6088305562362165,0.21680572572082005,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.25}"
5.0,A True Disappointment,"As problematic as 'The Lost World' may have been, it did expand the horizons of the Jurassic Park universe, 'Jurassic Park III' was a huge step backwards. The characters are sub-standard, the story is lazy and shamefully contrived, and the effects aren't as good as either of the previous movies, almost seeming to be a parody of a Jurassic Park film.The plot, as thin as it is, centres around the rescue of a boy named Eric who ended up stranded on the now restricted Isla Sorna, and the survival of the rescue team led by Alan Grant. Alan is lured to Isla Sorna by seemingly rich businessman Paul Kirby on the promise of cash to fund his dig. The plane lands and Amanda Kirby, Paul's wife, attracts the attention of Spinosaurus which causes the plane to crash and devour members of the crew. The rest of the movie is a series of chase scenes involving the Spinosaurus and the Velociraptors, interrupted by cloying domestic drama between the Kirbys reuniting with Eric and coming back together. The climax itself is unsatisfying, requiring a military deus ex machina that just feels tacked on.In all fairness, Sam Neill does a good job at bringing a jaded Alan Grant to the screen, working with what little he had. But his character is ruined by undoing his arc in the first film about learning to love kids and marrying Ellie, here Ellie is married to another man with two children. The writers could have prepared something special involving Alan and Ellie's relationship and their place in the world with live dinosaurs on the planet; it was insulting to undo all that development. His scenes in the prologue had potential, showing Alan's struggle to keep palaeontology alive and rekindle his love of dinosaurs. But it all amounts to nothing.The film has only a few worthwhile action scenes, specifically the Raptor attacks and the group's encounter with a colony of Pteranodons in a giant aviary, a memorable scene conveyed with an eerie and mysterious atmosphere. Some of the musical cues are melodic and charming, but I yearn for John Williams's talent. At times, the visual effects for the Raptors are actually quite good, but the rest are incredibly rushed and don't allow the audience to soak it in like in the first film. Due to the weak writing and wasted characters there are the many stupid moments throughout the movie. Barely twenty minutes into the film, Alan has a dream about a talking raptor on the flight to Sorna, it's intended to be scary and foreshadow the Raptors' capability of speech but it comes off as childish and goofy. (Real life raptors weren't even capable of human-level speech patterns). The ever annoying Amanda Kirby seems to exist only to scream, bicker and run away, never contributing anything but maudlin or moronic moments. William H. Macy is completely wasted. The rest of the characters are bland and forgettable. Some outright stupid moments include a satellite phone being heard from the belly of a Spinosaurus, said Spinosaur is shown as being able to break a fence designed to contain dinosaurs yet cannot break down a rusty metal door, a ridiculous cameo of Barney (I wish I was joking!!), and a cheap regurgitation of the dino dung scene from the first film.Even the dinosaurs themselves have been ruined; the CGI herbivores are pushed to the background with little screen time, and the carnivores don't behave like real animals, like in the previous films. The animatronics are clunky and the CGI is too obvious. The movie tries to recreate the sense of awe and wonder from the first film, but it feels forced and artificial.The most obnoxious change is the addition of the Spinosaurus. While I accept that it was larger than T-Rex, Spinosaurus was not a rampaging movie monster that hunted human-sized morsels like a serial killer. This leads into the infamous duel between the Rex and the Spinosaur, and it's a problem because the T-Rex was an integral part of the previous films and a childhood favourite. The fight itself was overly brief and anticlimactic. The T-Rex was set up as a predator with both ferocity and nobility, having it dispatched in such a way feels like a cheap shot. It was just a botched attempt to showcase a dinosaur that hadn't earned it's stardom like the Raptors.What frustrates me the most about 'Jurassic Park III' is that there was potential to make up for some or more of the shortcomings of 'The Lost World'. Instead it's the shallowest and the least adventurous film of the entire trilogy, there's too much focus on the domestic drama. While the first two films dealt with themes of science, technology, playing god, and man vs. nature, 'Jurassic Park III' took the franchise away from exploring such themes, choosing to be safe and marketable and lacking in substance.",true disappointment,as problematic as lost world may have been it did expand horizons jurassic park universe jurassic park iii was huge step backwards characters are sub standard story is lazy shamefully contrived effects arent as good as either previous movies almost seeming be parody jurassic park film plot as thin as it is centres around rescue boy named eric who ended up stranded now restricted isla sorna survival rescue team led by alan grant alan is lured isla sorna by seemingly rich businessman paul kirby promise cash fund his dig plane lands amanda kirby pauls wife attracts attention spinosaurus which causes plane crash devour members crew rest movie is series chase scenes involving spinosaurus velociraptors interrupted by cloying domestic drama between kirbys reuniting with eric coming back together climax itself is unsatisfying requiring military deus ex machina that just feels tacked all fairness sam neill does good job at bringing jaded alan grant screen working with what little he had but his character is ruined by undoing his arc first film about learning love kids marrying ellie here ellie is married another man with two children writers could have prepared something special involving alan ellies relationship their place world with live dinosaurs planet it was insulting undo all that development his scenes prologue had potential showing alans struggle keep palaeontology alive rekindle his love dinosaurs but it all amounts nothing film has only few worthwhile action scenes specifically raptor attacks groups encounter with colony pteranodons giant aviary memorable scene conveyed with eerie mysterious atmosphere some musical cues are melodic charming but i yearn john williamss talent at times visual effects raptors are actually quite good but rest are incredibly rushed dont allow audience soak it like first film due weak writing wasted characters there are many stupid moments throughout movie barely twenty minutes into film alan has dream about talking raptor flight sorna its intended be scary foreshadow raptors capability speech but it comes off as childish goofy real life raptors werent even capable human level speech patterns ever annoying amanda kirby seems exist only scream bicker run away never contributing anything but maudlin or moronic moments william h macy is completely wasted rest characters are bland forgettable some outright stupid moments include satellite phone being heard belly spinosaurus said spinosaur is shown as being able break fence designed contain dinosaurs yet cannot break down rusty metal door ridiculous cameo barney i wish i was joking cheap regurgitation dino dung scene first film even dinosaurs themselves have been ruined cgi herbivores are pushed background with little screen time carnivores dont behave like real animals like previous films animatronics are clunky cgi is too obvious movie tries recreate sense awe wonder first film but it feels forced artificial most obnoxious change is addition spinosaurus while i accept that it was larger than t rex spinosaurus was not rampaging movie monster that hunted human sized morsels like serial killer this leads into infamous duel between rex spinosaur its problem because t rex was integral part previous films childhood favourite fight itself was overly brief anticlimactic t rex was set up as predator with both ferocity nobility having it dispatched such way feels like cheap shot it was just botched attempt showcase dinosaur that hadnt earned its stardom like raptors what frustrates me most about jurassic park iii is that there was potential make up some or more shortcomings lost world instead its shallowest least adventurous film entire trilogy theres too much focus domestic drama while first two films dealt with themes science technology playing god man vs nature jurassic park iii took franchise away exploring such themes choosing be safe marketable lacking substance,0.5325129302657394,0.03694326896574089,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.39}"
3.0,They should have trashed the park after Lost World!,"Jurassic Park was great, The Lost World was decent, but his one bites the dust. This movie, although fun at some points, is an overall disgrace to the Jurassic Park film series. It tries to out do its original in an hour and a half and fails miserably. This movie is just one chase scene after another, but without the fun and creativity that was seen in the first and carried over a bit into the second.This movie was a cheap exploitation of a great film. Hopefully, unless film makers can actually try to put the essence seen in the first back into these films, we will stop at three.JP3 rates as a 3/10.",they should have trashed park after lost world,jurassic park was great lost world was decent but his one bites dust this movie although fun at some points is overall disgrace jurassic park film series it tries out do its original hour half fails miserably this movie is just one chase scene after another but without fun creativity that was seen first carried over bit into second this movie was cheap exploitation great film hopefully unless film makers can actually try put essence seen first back into these films we will stop at three jp3 rates as 3 10,0.39117647058823524,0.1102941176470588,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"
3.0,Awful,JP3 stinks terribly. It does not compare at all to the first two. Steven Spielberg had the edge to make two brilliant movies about dinosaurs. This guy has made two successful movies and thats it. Steven Spielberg has made more than ten blockbusters. I dont like E.T. but it is a really successful movie.The first Jurassic Park was an excellent movie. Sure parts of it were boring and could have been five minutes shorter but Jp3 could have been half an hour longer. Out of all three the Lost World is one of my all time favorite movies. The action is so much better than the other two. The Trexes are the best in this movie. Sure there is not many Raptor scenes in the movie but the ones that are in it are awesome. Jurassic Park and Lost World are on my top 100 list. JP3 is far from that list. Jp3 has a great beginning. Its exciting and a little creepy but not that scary. I heard that this movie was supposed to be a huge Thriller. I wasn't thrilled by one second of the movie. I think most of the scenes with the spinosaurus were stupid. I did like that boat scene but it was not my favorite. The raptors were stupid in that movie. No scenes with them were good. The pteranodon scenes were awesome. The best in the movie. But just when it starts to get interesting it ends. Leaving it open for a sequel. Which if it is not directed by Steven spielberg i will not be going.,awful,jp3 stinks terribly it does not compare at all first two steven spielberg had edge make two brilliant movies about dinosaurs this guy has made two successful movies thats it steven spielberg has made more than ten blockbusters i dont like e t but it is really successful movie first jurassic park was excellent movie sure parts it were boring could have been five minutes shorter but jp3 could have been half hour longer out all three lost world is one my all time favorite movies action is so much better than other two trexes are best this movie sure there is not many raptor scenes movie but ones that are it are awesome jurassic park lost world are my top 100 list jp3 is far that list jp3 has great beginning its exciting little creepy but not that scary i heard that this movie was supposed be huge thriller i wasnt thrilled by one second movie i think most scenes with spinosaurus were stupid i did like that boat scene but it was not my favorite raptors were stupid that movie no scenes with them were good pteranodon scenes were awesome best movie but just when it starts get interesting it ends leaving it open sequel which if it is not directed by steven spielberg i will not be going,0.678929539295393,0.20660569105691057,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"
7.0,Final chapter from trilogy that provides exciting and sweeping amusing and entertainment,"This enjoyable third entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills and emotion, deals about archaeologist Alan Grant(Sam Neill) and his pupil archaeologist(Alessandro Nivola).

Young, John Diehl) return to Dinosaurs island looking for their son(Trevor Morgan).When the plane crashes on the island populated by the Dinos, the humans try desperately to escape of the colossal carnivorous . The group is chased through lush jungle by fanged creatures from the cretaceous period and genetically engineered formerly.The Dinosaurs are ,once again, the authentic protagonists, they're again marvellous terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing, combining elements from previous films . Actors give vigorous physical performances dodging the Dinos, this time appear, an impressive Spinosurious fighting against Rex, a giant Dino-birds and , of course, the intimate Tyrannosaurious and Velocirraptor made by means of incredible combination of computer generator-ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and animatronics models- Stan Winston studio-. Simple dialogue and plain tale, the story is more exciting and inventive than second outing, Lost World, though inferior to first entry, Jurassik Park . The film packs a quite potent soundtrack by Don Davis, remaking the classic score by John Williams. Atmospheric and colorful cinematography reflecting the luxurious jungle by Shelly Johnson. The motion picture is professionally directed by Joe Johnston. The film will like to the previous films enthusiastic, but no for small kids by violent, realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals.",final chapter trilogy that provides exciting sweeping amusing entertainment,this enjoyable third entry plenty spine tingler thrills emotion deals about archaeologist alan grant sam neill his pupil archaeologist alessandro nivola grant is deceived by marriage william h macy tea leoni along with mercenaries group michael jeter bruce young john diehl return dinosaurs island looking their son trevor morgan when plane crashes island populated by dinos humans try desperately escape colossal carnivorous group is chased through lush jungle by fanged creatures cretaceous period genetically engineered formerly dinosaurs are once again authentic protagonists theyre again marvellous terrifyingly awesome almost completely convincing combining elements previous films actors give vigorous physical performances dodging dinos this time appear impressive spinosurious fighting against rex giant dino birds course intimate tyrannosaurious velocirraptor made by means incredible combination computer generator ilm industrial light magic animatronics models stan winston studio simple dialogue plain tale story is more exciting inventive than second outing lost world though inferior first entry jurassik park film packs quite potent soundtrack by don davis remaking classic score by john williams atmospheric colorful cinematography reflecting luxurious jungle by shelly johnson motion picture is professionally directed by joe johnston film will like previous films enthusiastic but no small kids by violent realistic gory attacks by monsters animals,0.5762515262515261,0.20412087912087912,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
