7,A Film to be watched by every Parent,"Hindi Medium is an enjoyable and realistic tale which lands a tight slap on the face of a society which considers English as a parameter for judging people, where people are not taken seriously if they don't speak English well and they are made to feel inferior. The dialogues are hilarious and keep you entertained throughout. The plot gets a bit predictable towards the end and the film glorifies government schools, which are looked down upon in our society. A little preachy and over-dramatic towards the end, Hindi Medium strongly drives its point home.My Rating : 3.5/5",film be watched by every parent,hindi medium is enjoyable realistic tale which lands tight slap face society which considers english as parameter judging people where people are not taken seriously if they dont speak english well they are made feel inferior dialogues are hilarious keep you entertained throughout plot gets bit predictable towards end film glorifies government schools which are looked down upon our society little preachy over dramatic towards end hindi medium strongly drives its point home my rating 3 5 5,0.4467643467643467,-0.006791819291819306,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9,Amazing!,"If you ask me to define this movie in one word, I have mentioned it in the title above. This movie is one of those rare and brave attempts that try to explain the social situation rising above melodramas and unnecessary actions.

8,"""Hindi Medium"" is electrifying that boast of enough humor and laugh to keep you entertained","There comes a movie once in a while which is not only thought- provoking but also sends out a great social message. ""Hindi Medium"" is definitely one of it. ""Hindi Medium"" tells the story of a married couple who does every thing under the sun to get their daughter admitted to the most popular school of Delhi. Saket Chaudhary, who gave us some memorable films like ""Pyaar Ka Side Effects"" and ""Shaadi Ke Side Effects"", goes one step further and create a satire on the education system which is very much prevalent in India. The film focuses on Indian parents' obsession who wants to send their kids to the high-profile schools despite exorbitant fees to learn English that will help them to be accepted in the society and land a job in MNC. A dialogue from Irrfan Khan ""If French and German speaks incorrect English, it is still fine but when an Indian does not speak proper English, then that person holds no value in the society. The movie is a laugh-riot and few scenes will definitely bring down the house. The scene at the factory where Irrfan wants to go for a bio-break gets interrupted by his boss is hilarious. Another scene at the Government school where a son of a Tourist guide displays his skills by speaking English, German and even French languages proving that talent has no boundary. Hats off to Saket Chaudhary for bringing something new on the Indian silver screen.The film does have it share of flaws as well. The second half becomes a little drag towards the end and climax becomes little melodramatic. Also, the editing should have been better trimming the film by another 10-12 mins. Art direction and Cinematography is simple which is the essence of story line with an average background score. The screenplay is good but loses somewhere later in the film. The film belongs to Irrfan Khan who carries it on his shoulder. The epitome of talent, Irrfan surprises you with subtle humor which will tickle your funny bone. Watch for him as he has tries to play ""good"" husband"" with perfection. The character played by Saba Qamar will remind you of Sridevi from 1997's blockbuster ""Judaai"" who is lured by elite society of Delhi. Deepak Dobriyal is mindblowing. The actor just adds spark to the film every time he appears on-screen. Amrita Singh does about okay.Overall, ""Hindi Medium"" is electrifying that boast of lot of humor and laugh to keep you entertained.

8,A satire that will sting a lot of modern day Indian parents,"Every now and then the Hindi film industry comes out with a movie like this and you heave a sigh of relief that sensible movies are still being made. In other words, it is not just names that are being used to sell movies. Hindi Medium takes us through the troubles of a couple to get their child into the top 5 elementary schools of New Delhi. While some of the scenes and situations are over-the-top they are intentionally done that way so as to be satirical. However, they are all relatable since each one of us has went through these troubles ourselves or know someone who did. Irfan Khan and his dialogues are hilarious as always. The newcomer, Saba Qamar, also does a decent job. A highly recommended watch for everyone except fighting couples who are debating about which school to put their child in to.",satire that will sting lot modern day indian parents,every now then hindi film industry comes out with movie like this you heave sigh relief that sensible movies are still being made other words it is not just names that are being used sell movies hindi medium takes us through troubles couple get their child into top 5 elementary schools new delhi while some scenes situations are over top they are intentionally done that way so as be satirical however they are all relatable since each one us has went through these troubles ourselves or know someone who did irfan khan his dialogues are hilarious as always newcomer saba qamar also does decent job highly recommended watch everyone except fighting couples who are debating about which school put their child,0.5818013468013468,0.2597811447811448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8,"Hindi Medium, a satire on our education system, is a very relevant film.","Hindi Medium, a satire on our education system by Saket Chaudhary, is a very relevant film. This is his third film after Pyaar ke Side Effects and Shaadi ke Side Effect. It seems that humour is his forte. In Hindi Medium, he takes a dig at our current Education System. These days education has become a business. Children's education has become costlier than many of the professional or vocational courses in our country. Schools have the trend of charging exorbitant fees in lieu of tuition fee, capitation fee, donation, extra-curricular activities' fund etc. 'The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act' or 'Right to Education Act (RTE)' was enforced on 1st April, 2010. When this act came into force, India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right to every child between the ages of 6 and 14. This act does require all private schools to reserve 25% of seats for the children from families of low economical status. But what actually happens with this quota is still under question. This act has many other relevant clauses too in favour of students. It also makes provisions for no donation or capitation fees and no interview of the child or parent for admission. Saket has come up with a brilliant film on this. The film showcases the stress of parents in getting their children admitted into elite schools, and their efforts to manipulate things to get the admission, school management falling prey to bribe, the admission scam, the conditions of the government schools etc. This fact can not be ignored that many of the government schools in our country are underperforming due to lack of facilities, infrastructure support and resources. There is a clear cut demarcation between the English Medium Schools and Hindi Medium Schools. And also, there is a special affinity for English Language in our country i.e. whoever speaks English are supposed to have a 'class'. A person might be very good in his / her mother tongue or Hindi, but being affluent in English only makes that person sophisticated. There is Social Divide between English speaking and Hindi speaking people. This is a mindset, which one needs to ponder upon. Saket certainly is successful in throwing light upon all these issues in a very light-hearted manner.The film begins with a girl - young Mita - coming to a tailor's shop to get a designer dress stitched and young Raj (Delzad Hiwale, Chittagong & Chauranga fame) assures the girl that her dress will be stitched exactly similar to the design she wanted. There starts the love story of Raj and Mita in the backdrop of a beautiful song 'Lafzon ke haseen dhagoon me kahin piro raha hum main huzur' After a period of fifteen years, we get to see that Raj Batra (Irrfan Khan) has grown into 'the Business Tycoon' of Chandani Chowk (Delhi) with a fashion studio. He understands the pulse of the customers. His wife Mita (Saba Qamar) does speak English well whereas Raj doesn't. Raj calls her Mitthu fondly. She is very particular that their daughter Piya (Dishita Sehgal) studies in any one of the top five English Medium Schools of Delhi. They do apply in top five schools. And for this they do shift their base from Chandni Chowk to the posh colony of Vasant Vihar, undergo specialized training for attending interviews, handling questions and speaking English. But unable to find admission through General Quota, when Raj comes to know regarding 25% quota for the students from poor families, he decides to go to slum area along with Mita and Piya so as to clear the inspection. That is where they get good Samaritan neighbours Shyam Prakash (Deepak Dobriyal) and wife Tulsi (Swati Das). What happens thereafter is to be seen. Although there is a drag in certain areas in the second half with certain scenes of the slum, but consistent humour in the screenplay keeps the mood of the film very bright. Also, certain issues raised in the film do not see a closure. The highlight of the film is effortless acting by Irrfan Khan. He is an actor to reckon with. He blends with every character he plays on screen and he adds lot of value to the same. Even after one leaves the theater, his acting remains in heart and mind. Saba Qamar, originally a Pakistani Actress, is also very good, natural and convincing as Mita. Deepak Dobriyal as Shyam Prakash gives a wonderful performance. His expressions are very impressive. Tillotama Shome as career counsellor is very good. Swati Das as Tulsi is also very much noticeable. Rest of the characters Dishita Sehgal, Amrita Singh (as Head Mistress of a School), Sanjay Suri and Neha Dhupia are all good.There are lot of scenes with which one could relate to – be it the parental pressure of getting their children's admissions in good schools, the struggle of the middle class or lower class to be able to provide good education to their children, the social divide etc. There is a scene where Tillotama conveys a dialogue – ""People book me when they are in their first trimester."" Unfortunately, this is a Reality too.Hindi Medium, a satire on our education system, is a very relevant film. It showcases various issues viz. Social Divide between English and Hindi speaking people, the demarcation between government schools and private schools facilities, the school admission scams etc. in a very light-hearted manner. Irrfan Khan, Saba Qaram and Deepak Dobriyal shine in the film through their effortless acting.",hindi medium satire our education system is very relevant film,hindi medium satire our education system by saket chaudhary is very relevant film this is his third film after pyaar ke side effects shaadi ke side effect it seems that humour is his forte hindi medium he takes dig at our current education system these days education has become business childrens education has become costlier than many professional or vocational courses our country schools have trend charging exorbitant fees lieu tuition fee capitation fee donation extra curricular activities fund etc right children free compulsory education act or right education act rte was enforced 1st april 2010 when this act came into force india became one 135 countries make education fundamental right every child between ages 6 14 this act does require all private schools reserve 25 seats children families low economical status but what actually happens with this quota is still under question this act has many other relevant clauses too favour students it also makes provisions no donation or capitation fees no interview child or parent admission saket has come up with brilliant film this film showcases stress parents getting their children admitted into elite schools their efforts manipulate things get admission school management falling prey bribe admission scam conditions government schools etc this fact can not be ignored that many government schools our country are underperforming due lack facilities infrastructure support resources there is clear cut demarcation between english medium schools hindi medium schools also there is special affinity english language our country i e whoever speaks english are supposed have class person might be very good his her mother tongue or hindi but being affluent english only makes that person sophisticated there is social divide between english speaking hindi speaking people this is mindset which one needs ponder upon saket certainly is successful throwing light upon all these issues very light hearted manner film begins with girl young mita coming tailors shop get designer dress stitched young raj delzad hiwale chittagong chauranga fame assures girl that her dress will be stitched exactly similar design she wanted there starts love story raj mita backdrop beautiful song lafzon ke haseen dhagoon me kahin piro raha hum main huzur after period fifteen years we get see that raj batra irrfan khan has grown into business tycoon chandani chowk delhi with fashion studio he understands pulse customers his wife mita saba qamar does speak english well whereas raj doesnt raj calls her mitthu fondly she is very particular that their daughter piya dishita sehgal studies any one top five english medium schools delhi they do apply top five schools this they do shift their base chandni chowk posh colony vasant vihar undergo specialized training attending interviews handling questions speaking english but unable find admission through general quota when raj comes know regarding 25 quota students poor families he decides go slum area along with mita piya so as clear inspection that is where they get good samaritan neighbours shyam prakash deepak dobriyal wife tulsi swati das what happens thereafter is be seen although there is drag certain areas second half with certain scenes slum but consistent humour screenplay keeps mood film very bright also certain issues raised film do not see closure highlight film is effortless acting by irrfan khan he is actor reckon with he blends with every character he plays screen he adds lot value same even after one leaves theater his acting remains heart mind saba qamar originally pakistani actress is also very good natural convincing as mita deepak dobriyal as shyam prakash gives wonderful performance his expressions are very impressive tillotama shome as career counsellor is very good swati das as tulsi is also very much noticeable rest characters dishita sehgal amrita singh as head mistress school sanjay suri neha dhupia are all good there are lot scenes with which one could relate be it parental pressure getting their childrens admissions good schools struggle middle class or lower class be able provide good education their children social divide etc there is scene where tillotama conveys dialogue people book me when they are their first trimester unfortunately this is reality too hindi medium satire our education system is very relevant film it showcases various issues viz social divide between english hindi speaking people demarcation between government schools private schools facilities school admission scams etc very light hearted manner irrfan khan saba qaram deepak dobriyal shine film through their effortless acting,0.479404761904762,0.24605403959336541,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
7,Food for Thought,"Hindi medium is about a businessman and his wife who want their daughter to get admission in the best school of the city. Both of them think that if their daughter goes to a normal government school like they did when they were kids, she will not receive the proper education and most importantly, won't be able to match up with the 'English speaking' children of her age.So they decided that they will do anything to make sure she gets admission in one of the best schools of Delhi. The movie captures the journey of two parents as they move from a high-class society to give their child exposure to a small 1- room apartment in a disease prone area to register for admission as a child of a poor family. It may be too late for the reality to descend on them that these actions of theirs are affecting a lot of other people too.The movie explores the desperation of parents as they go to great lengths to give the best education to their children. Also, it tells us how big institutions can tweak the admission process. In the end, it leaves you with many questions. Is it really worth it? Making your child study in a school where she may never be able to fit? Should English be the only thing distinguishing between who gets admission and who doesn't? Even after focusing this heavy subject, the movie is light. The facts are presented with jokes to make it watchable and even entertaining for the audience. Sometimes, it feels like the film is missing point and extending some not-so-important sequences. This slowed the pace for a while but it picked it up again in the end. Irfan Khan brought his best to the character of a Chandni Chowk Saree salesman who is a concerned father and a loving devoted husband who will do anything for best education of his child, or, as his wife always warns him, keep their child away from drugs as she grows old. Saba Qamar did a fine job but still has a long way to go. The duo posed as a nice on screen couple. Deepak Dobriyal, who portrayed a helping natured hard working factory worker, was fantastic as always. He sure has gathered many accolades for his recent ventures and this film will also add some more. Director Saket Chaudhary, known for directing ""Pyaar ke side effect"", did okay. Music was one plus point, with some gracefully placed new songs accompanied by remixes of some well-known songs. In summary, I would say the movie is definitely worth a watch. So, what it is not a great one, but it sure will give you a lot to think about. In that process, you may talk about it a lot and will also suggest it to others, as I am doing now.",food thought,hindi medium is about businessman his wife who want their daughter get admission best school city both them think that if their daughter goes normal government school like they did when they were kids she will not receive proper education most importantly wont be able match up with english speaking children her age so they decided that they will do anything make sure she gets admission one best schools delhi movie captures journey two parents as they move high class society give their child exposure small 1 room apartment disease prone area register admission as child poor family it may be too late reality descend them that these actions theirs are affecting lot other people too movie explores desperation parents as they go great lengths give best education their children also it tells us how big institutions can tweak admission process end it leaves you with many questions is it really worth it making your child study school where she may never be able fit should english be only thing distinguishing between who gets admission who doesnt even after focusing this heavy subject movie is light facts are presented with jokes make it watchable even entertaining audience sometimes it feels like film is missing point extending some not so important sequences this slowed pace while but it picked it up again end irfan khan brought his best character chandni chowk saree salesman who is concerned father loving devoted husband who will do anything best education his child or as his wife always warns him keep their child away drugs as she grows old saba qamar did fine job but still has long way go duo posed as nice screen couple deepak dobriyal who portrayed helping natured hard working factory worker was fantastic as always he sure has gathered many accolades his recent ventures this film will also add some more director saket chaudhary known directing pyaar ke side effect did okay music was one plus point with some gracefully placed new songs accompanied by remixes some well known songs summary i would say movie is definitely worth watch so what it is not great one but it sure will give you lot think about that process you may talk about it lot will also suggest it others as i am doing now,0.5076853642811089,0.2910573823339781,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8,Hindi Medium- A Subject In Which We Should Score An A+,"First Published On- https://myunwantedreviews.wordpress.com/2017/05/22/hindi-medium-a- subject-in-which-we-should-score-an-a/My mother is a government school teacher. Once in a while, I drop her to her school. The other day I asked her, why do you think the number of kids going to government schools is constantly on a decline? Is the quality of education in government schools so bad? She said, it's not about dropping of education level, but about the parents' wish to send their kids to government schools, or any Hindi Medium school for that matter. They believe that government schools are not capable enough to prepare their kids for the real world.Hindi Medium runs around same premises but it's not limited to that. It is a satire presented in most comic and simplest way possible. This is not just about a couple's struggle to get their child admitted to the school, but about the complete series of events, good or bad, they have to go through. Rampant corruption they have to face and voluntarily or involuntarily become a part of it.This movie is about our obsession with the English language. Because talking in English in India does not just signifies the knowledge of a different language but, unfortunately, also a division of class from the mass. Hindi Medium is a social commentary on the elitist mentality of our society, where we evolved from the caste divide but get into the trap of class divide. A class where having money is not enough, where speaking Hindi is looked down upon, and where kitty parties are held on the basis of your kid's school.The first half of the movie is kind of a situational comedy and considerably more interesting than the second one which feels like drowning in its own goodness. But it has the entry of immensely talented Deepak Dobriyal, who is sharing the screen with Irrfan after fourteen years since Maqbool. His portrayal of 'Shuddh Garib' Shyam is mind blowing. His effortless display of comedy, emotions, and pain in a shorter screen time makes him an excellent actor.Irrfan Khan. Is there anything this man can't do? He is undoubtedly one of the most versatile actors present in Indian Cinema. His comic timing, dialogue delivery, screen presence, everything is a class apart. He puts his heart and soul into the character of Raj Batra, a responsible father, and a good husband.Saba Qamar as Mita has done a really good job. Her portrayal of the character was very controlled. She has to look rich, feel rich, and act rich but at the same time doesn't have to look arrogant. She maintained an aura of a down to earth rich Vasant Vihar lady who is constantly trying to adjust in her new 'posh' locality.There is one more acting credit which deserves to be given is of Tillotama Shome, who, by her brilliant acting make her powerful presence felt. She put life in a character which Indian audience generally fails to notice otherwise.I would not say the movie has a brilliant screenplay but it definitely has some genuinely funny dialogues, which assure some hearty laughs in regular intervals. Even small characters have been given enough chance to make the audience laugh. Music composed by Sachin-Jigar is good, so is the background score by Amar Mohile. As for Saket Chaudhary, this one is his best movie after his previous two 'side effects' and is the one he will be remembered for in a long time.So if not for direction, screenplay or music, this movie is a must watch for its superb performances by the lead as well as the supporting cast.Hindi Medium is a garland woven with uneven beads but it looks and feels beautiful. It is an attempt, not so hard hitting though, but every bit worthy of praise for its genuine and simple nature. It is deserved to be watched by one and all.At the end of it, the movie seems too good to be true, and a little too preachy at the end. But it talks about a subject in which we all need to score an A+.",hindi medium subject which we should score,first published subject which we should score my mother is government school teacher once while i drop her her school other day i asked her why do you think number kids going government schools is constantly decline is quality education government schools so bad she said its not about dropping education level but about parents wish send their kids government schools or any hindi medium school that matter they believe that government schools are not capable enough prepare their kids real world hindi medium runs around same premises but its not limited that it is satire presented most comic simplest way possible this is not just about couples struggle get their child admitted school but about complete series events good or bad they have go through rampant corruption they have face voluntarily or involuntarily become part it this movie is about our obsession with english language because talking english india does not just signifies knowledge different language but unfortunately also division class mass hindi medium is social commentary elitist mentality our society where we evolved caste divide but get into trap class divide class where having money is not enough where speaking hindi is looked down upon where kitty parties are held basis your kids school first half movie is kind situational comedy considerably more interesting than second one which feels like drowning its own goodness but it has entry immensely talented deepak dobriyal who is sharing screen with irrfan after fourteen years since maqbool his portrayal shuddh garib shyam is mind blowing his effortless display comedy emotions pain shorter screen time makes him excellent actor irrfan khan is there anything this man cant do he is undoubtedly one most versatile actors present indian cinema his comic timing dialogue delivery screen presence everything is class apart he puts his heart soul into character raj batra responsible father good husband saba qamar as mita has done really good job her portrayal character was very controlled she has look rich feel rich act rich but at same time doesnt have look arrogant she maintained aura down earth rich vasant vihar lady who is constantly trying adjust her new posh locality there is one more acting credit which deserves be given is tillotama shome who by her brilliant acting make her powerful presence felt she put life character which indian audience generally fails notice otherwise i would not say movie has brilliant screenplay but it definitely has some genuinely funny dialogues which assure some hearty laughs regular intervals even small characters have been given enough chance make audience laugh music composed by sachin jigar is good so is background score by amar mohile as saket chaudhary this one is his best movie after his previous two side effects is one he will be remembered long time so if not direction screenplay or music this movie is must watch its superb performances by lead as well as supporting cast hindi medium is garland woven with uneven beads but it looks feels beautiful it is attempt not so hard hitting though but every bit worthy praise its genuine simple nature it is deserved be watched by one all at end it movie seems too good be true little too preachy at end but it talks about subject which we all need score,0.48195614926384156,0.18192478817478822,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"

9,A gem that will revive your faith in Indian Cinema,"A movie made in India but every person around the world can relate himself/herself to the theme of this wonderful piece of work which is based on the fact that, we live in a world where your class/standard is determined by the language you speak (and not just language by the way) and this movie honestly portrays the challenges faced by those who are discarded from the main stream just on the basis of the language they speak.

7,A charming film despite the shortcomings,"A charming and enjoyable film, indeed. The film, a comedy about a couple who will go to any extent to have their daughter enrolled in the best English school in Delhi, starts with no direction and takes far too long to pick up. However, when it does, it is surprising in how traditional it is in terms of its abundant emotional quotient. From then on, it often resorts to sentimentality, but its heart is in the right place. The second half takes an interesting twist where the couple adopt a poor lifestyle in order to qualify for registration from the back door. This part of the film really strains credulity, but interestingly enough, it is the beginning of the best and most engaging part in the film.The film is a nice commentary on the education system in India, on social classes, on poverty. The most striking quote from the film is said by Deepak Dobriyal: ""Living in poverty is an art"", namely, it needs to be experienced over the course of generations to be understood and dealt with. This, of course, sounds quite harrowing, but the poor neighbourhood is very well portrayed. Actually, the general feel is so humorous and light that many pitfalls can be forgiven. Towards the end, it grows even more sentimental and the final sequences, particularly the main lead's speech at the end of the show, are done in true Hindi film style of yore - very stagy and a little manipulative.Hindi Medium works, it's fun and often quite touching. Even if some parts do not ring true, everything is within the film's wholesome context, and above all, it caters to certain sensibilities which foreigners wouldn't grasp. What really elevates it to another level is doubtlessly Irrfan Khan, whose effortless charisma is the film's trump card. He is a real man and a star, and he is funny and convincing in his renowned minimalism. Saba Qamar is wonderful and grows on you throughout the story. Amrita Singh is excellent; her part is more of a caricature, but she can do hardly wrong. It is obviously Deepak Dobriyal who delivers the film's most moving performance. A charming film with a nice morale it is.",charming film despite shortcomings,charming enjoyable film indeed film comedy about couple who will go any extent have their daughter enrolled best english school delhi starts with no direction takes far too long pick up however when it does it is surprising how traditional it is terms its abundant emotional quotient then it often resorts sentimentality but its heart is right place second half takes interesting twist where couple adopt poor lifestyle order qualify registration back door this part film really strains credulity but interestingly enough it is beginning best most engaging part film film is nice commentary education system india social classes poverty most striking quote film is said by deepak dobriyal living poverty is art namely it needs be experienced over course generations be understood dealt with this course sounds quite harrowing but poor neighbourhood is very well portrayed actually general feel is so humorous light that many pitfalls can be forgiven towards end it grows even more sentimental final sequences particularly main leads speech at end show are done true hindi film style yore very stagy little manipulative hindi medium works its fun often quite touching even if some parts do not ring true everything is within films wholesome context above all it caters certain sensibilities which foreigners wouldnt grasp what really elevates it another level is doubtlessly irrfan khan whose effortless charisma is films trump card he is real man star he is funny convincing his renowned minimalism saba qamar is wonderful grows you throughout story amrita singh is excellent her part is more caricature but she can do hardly wrong it is obviously deepak dobriyal who delivers films most moving performance charming film with nice morale it is,0.5863826232247284,0.304312865497076,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"

7,Family Movie with a social message for everyone out there,Many movies are released every year but only some are so good with a social message that leaves you thinking about our society and their tradition. Hindi Medium is among those movies that reflects the real face of society and their thinking. Importance of education and what parents do to get that status and fame among their friends. Irfan khan never fails to amaze you with his dialogue delivery power. While on the other Saba Qamar has really done a good job better than most of actresses we have seen in past. And the last person that cannot be forgotten is Deepak Dobriyal who has also done a great job as usual.

8,Nice One,"What's GOOD- After a long time here comes a family film which will appeal to everyone.Director Saket Chaudhary's vision of showing a Hypocrite society does work .The story deals with how parents struggle to get their child in a English Medium School.India is suffering from a disease called 'ENGLISH'. It is more of a status symbol than a language.We live in a society where u will be mocked if you are not good in English.The message here is conveyed in a humorous way. The first half simply concentrates on humour.But the last 45 minutes of the movie is on a serious note & to be honest those 45 minutes are the best in a 2hr 30 minutes long film. Of the cast-IRRFAN & SABA QAMAR are brilliant.They are almost perfect as parents who want to send their daughter in a English Medium school. The Best thing in 'Hindi Medium' is the performance of DEEPAK DOBRIYAL. He is PERFECT.I cant even imagine anyone in that role.As a generous poor man, this performance of him was the best supporting performance of 2017. Rest of the cast in supporting role performed ably. The screenplay is very good & the direction by Saket Chaudhary is good.This attempt of Saket is better than his earlier work 'Shaadi ke side effects'.What's Bad-Some scenes involving humour or emotions don't work .But the overall impact of film is very good. Overall-I think every Indian will relate with this film. I m going with 7/10 with one extra star for DEEPAK DOBRIYAL's performance which makes it 8/10.Its a SATISFYING & ENTERTAINING watch.",nice one,whats good after long time here comes family film which will appeal everyone director saket chaudharys vision showing hypocrite society does work story deals with how parents struggle get their child english medium school india is suffering disease called english it is more status symbol than language we live society where u will be mocked if you are not good english message here is conveyed humorous way first half simply concentrates humour but last 45 minutes movie is serious note be honest those 45 minutes are best 2hr 30 minutes long film cast irrfan saba qamar are brilliant they are almost perfect as parents who want send their daughter english medium school best thing hindi medium is performance deepak dobriyal he is perfect i cant even imagine anyone that role as generous poor man this performance him was best supporting performance 2017 rest cast supporting role performed ably screenplay is very good direction by saket chaudhary is good this attempt saket is better than his earlier work shaadi ke side effects whats bad some scenes involving humour or emotions dont work but overall impact film is very good overall i think every indian will relate with this film i m going with 7 10 with one extra star deepak dobriyals performance which makes it 8 10 its satisfying entertaining watch,0.48056776556776565,0.3117016317016317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"

6,Above Average!,"The movie was good but not as good as I expected. The story is basically work done by certain parents in getting admission for their daughter in one of the top school in Delhi. These parents really want their daughter in one of the top schools, for which they are ready to go to any lengths. All that they do are shown the movie.One of the things that they do is move to poor neighborhood. There they find out a poor family who help them out. It showed how great are the heart of poor people. It reminded me of a poor family that helped me and my family, get through the storm when we stayed at Kasara in Maharashtra, just highlighting how big they are when it comes to being human.The only drawback movie has is it does not seem that realistic that the parents would go to such length. To add further, I am still confused why Irrfans family was asked for extra fees before admission and not the poor man's family who helped him.

9,Hindi Medium review,"Hindi Medium is a film directed by Saket Chaudhary. Knowing what Saket has directed previously I had no hopes for the film. But as I saw the trailers for this film, I thought that this a was going to be a great film. And man, it was a great movie.Plot: Raj and Mita struggle to get admission for their daughter into a good school.Story and Direction: The story is very real and mostly simplistic. No gimmicks, high-fi songs, etc... It can be termed as a slice of life kind of film. The scenario of the high society, middle class and lower class is very clearly shown in this film. You can feel for the characters in each and every scene. The film never bores you. The length of the film is also perfect. The only fault with the film I can say is the cinematic liberties that it took. Some of the scenes felt that 'Is this possible??'. Other than that , I can't fault the film in any way.Acting: Irrfan has again proved as to why he is what he is. His comic timing is impeccable. Saba Qamar was also good as the concerned mother. Deepak Dobriyal was great as the poor man. He also got many laughs in me. Amrita Singh was also good. Sanjay Suri and Neha Dhupia in cameos were also good.Favorite Scene: It would obviously be the scene where Shyam Prasad hits the mosquito and shows it to Raj and Mita. That scene was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing in that scene.Music: Sachin-Jigar put together a very nice soundtrack. It doesn't actually add to the run-time of the film, that songs mostly do. I had no problem with the remixed Punjabi tracks since it didn't add to the run-time ('O Ho' was played during a dance number and 'Suit' is played in the end credits). 'Hoor' I would say was my favorite track of the film.Verdict: This again goes to prove that you don't need a lavish budget and songs to make a good movie. A good story with the right cast and crew can also do that. This film is easily one of my favorites that have come out this year.I am giving it a 9/10.",hindi medium review,hindi medium is film directed by saket chaudhary knowing what saket has directed previously i had no hopes film but as i saw trailers this film i thought that this was going be great film man it was great movie plot raj mita struggle get admission their daughter into good school story direction story is very real mostly simplistic no gimmicks high fi songs etc it can be termed as slice life kind film scenario high society middle class lower class is very clearly shown this film you can feel characters each every scene film never bores you length film is also perfect only fault with film i can say is cinematic liberties that it took some scenes felt that is this possible other than that i cant fault film any way acting irrfan has again proved as why he is what he is his comic timing is impeccable saba qamar was also good as concerned mother deepak dobriyal was great as poor man he also got many laughs me amrita singh was also good sanjay suri neha dhupia cameos were also good favorite scene it would obviously be scene where shyam prasad hits mosquito shows it raj mita that scene was hilarious i couldnt stop laughing that scene music sachin jigar put together very nice soundtrack it doesnt actually add run time film that songs mostly do i had no problem with remixed punjabi tracks since it didnt add run time o ho was played during dance number suit is played end credits hoor i would say was my favorite track film verdict this again goes prove that you dont need lavish budget songs make good movie good story with right cast crew can also do that this film is easily one my favorites that have come out this year i am giving it 9 10,0.6111156462585035,0.3559251700680272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9,"One life, a hundred desires!","The apparent difference in outlook in spirituality between the Western and Eastern philosophy is quite visible. The former revolves around its fixation on following preset rules to appease the Maker. In the case of the latter, it appears to be more like an eternal quest. It is a lifelong journey to hunt for the secrets of the Universe. The whole teachings in the Vedanta, Buddhism, Confucianism and the Tao scriptures are towards this end.In simple terms, Eastern cultures are seekers of knowledge. Sometimes, this also became their own undoing. When the Western cultures first hit the Indian shores, the natives slowly neglected their age-old wisdom. They plunged head-long into their newfound obsession of acquiring erudition from the visitors, only to be led astray.This hunger for knowledge has not been quenched after all these years. The world over, Asians, armed with their right discipline and dedication, are slowly but surely making their presence felt once again. In academic, artistic and scientific fields, they are redeeming their rightful places.The movie, 'Hindi Medium' and its spiritual successor, 'Angrezi Medium' (English Medium) are evidence of the length Indian parents would go to ensure that their offspring will get a sound education.In 'Hindi Medium', a nouveau riche couple move into posh housing estate to register their young daughter in a prestigious grammar school. When the daughter failed to make it into the school register, the parents realise that they could still qualify under the quota set aside for the underprivileged students. They move into the most impoverished side of the town masquerading as the urban poor. The unpleasant living conditions, the dodging from the school inspector and the overprotective nature of their neighbours form the basis of this comedic, yet thought-provoking presentation.'Angrezi Medium' (2020) is Irrfan Khan's swansong. Here, he is a single parent of a bright teenage girl. Not wanting to repeat the same mistake of clipping his deceased wife's desire to study, he yearns for his daughter to win the scholarship to study in the UK. Khan also has a nagging legal battle with his family members over his small-time Indian sweets business. The court case goes against his favour. His bad luck, the presiding judge happened to be the husband of the principal of his daughter's school. The daughter's scholarship gets cancelled when Khan verbally abused the judge in a school function. The rest of the story is how Khan, against all the odds, although some of them are unbelievable, still manages to get his daughter enrolled in a university in the UK.",one life hundred desires,apparent difference outlook spirituality between western eastern philosophy is quite visible former revolves around its fixation following preset rules appease maker case latter it appears be more like eternal quest it is lifelong journey hunt secrets universe whole teachings vedanta buddhism confucianism tao scriptures are towards this end simple terms eastern cultures are seekers knowledge sometimes this also became their own undoing when western cultures first hit indian shores natives slowly neglected their age old wisdom they plunged head long into their newfound obsession acquiring erudition visitors only be led astray this hunger knowledge has not been quenched after all these years world over asians armed with their right discipline dedication are slowly but surely making their presence felt once again academic artistic scientific fields they are redeeming their rightful places movie hindi medium its spiritual successor angrezi medium english medium are evidence length indian parents would go ensure that their offspring will get sound education hindi medium nouveau riche couple move into posh housing estate register their young daughter prestigious grammar school when daughter failed make it into school register parents realise that they could still qualify under quota set aside underprivileged students they move into most impoverished side town masquerading as urban poor unpleasant living conditions dodging school inspector overprotective nature their neighbours form basis this comedic yet thought provoking presentation angrezi medium 2020 is irrfan khans swansong here he is single parent bright teenage girl not wanting repeat same mistake clipping his deceased wifes desire study he yearns his daughter win scholarship study uk khan also has nagging legal battle with his family members over his small time indian sweets business court case goes against his favour his bad luck presiding judge happened be husband principal his daughters school daughters scholarship gets cancelled when khan verbally abused judge school function rest story is how khan against all odds although some them are unbelievable still manages get his daughter enrolled university uk,0.4013591269841269,0.061190476190476205,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.49}"
