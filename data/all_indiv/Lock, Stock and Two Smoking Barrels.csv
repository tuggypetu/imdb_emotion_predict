,"The essence of late 90's cinema -- hip, highly stylized, VISUAL","Guy Ritchie's hip, highly stylized 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a truly remarkable film, not only for its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work, but also for its seemingly flawless, puzzle-perfect script/screenplay. While the picture's main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a high-stakes, rigged card game and lose, the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross (more> than once, in some cases) during various illegal pursuits: money, guns, drugs, even revenge. The film is quite violent, both on and off screen, but it's also uniformly humorous throughout. It's important to note that the four central characters (a cook, a card sharp, and a couple of guys who sell ""discounted"" items) are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt; they kill no one. The same applies to the laid-back college boys who ""grow copious amounts of ganja"". The cast is comprised of mostly young, veteran, male actors. In fact, the only female in the film doesn't even speak, though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a bar-owning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid, as usual, it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is first-rate, from the 60's hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of London's underground. The groovy, pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film, creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema (from any period). Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary, stating that it detracts from the story, bogs it down, or pads it; however, the film medium has the luxury of actually ""displaying"" a story for its audience, unlike the written word alone. It's what the medium is all about -- it's VISUAL. Hence, one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to ""brand"" his or her work, in the same way as writers like Cummings, Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. It's hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese to represent it. To this end, Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic, ultra-contemporary camera work incorporates (through a fresh perspective) such devices as slow motion, fast motion, and freeze-frame coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of (and actually expands upon) Martin Scorsese's patented visual stylistics and camera movements, like those found in 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas'. But the similarities with Scorsese's work end there. Critics' endless comparisons of Ritchie's film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' stand mostly unwarranted, as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Ritchie's film is a much more involved, complex, layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantino's films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle's 'Trainspotting' does have a resembling ""feel"" to 'LS&TSB', but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is essential viewing.",essence late 90s cinema hip highly stylized visual,guy ritchies hip highly stylized lock stock two smoking barrels is truly remarkable film not only its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work but also its seemingly flawless puzzle perfect script screenplay while pictures main focus is group lads who invest money high stakes rigged card game lose broader story concerns approximately eight different groups criminals whose paths cross more than once some cases during various illegal pursuits money guns drugs even revenge film is quite violent both off screen but its also uniformly humorous throughout its important note that four central characters cook card sharp couple guys who sell discounted items are interested only acquiring money pay off their enormous debt they kill no one same applies laid back college boys who grow copious amounts ganja cast is comprised mostly young veteran male actors fact only female film doesnt even speak though she handles machine gun fairly well sting appears briefly several scenes as bar owning father figure while his secondary performance is solid as usual it is also unmemorable soundtrack is first rate 60s hits james brown contemporary beats londons underground groovy pulsating music lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with action dialogue film creating theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon cinema any period critics audiences over years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious unnecessary stating that it detracts story bogs it down or pads it however film medium has luxury actually displaying story its audience unlike written word alone its what medium is all about its visual hence one reasons filmmaker chooses such visual displays is brand his or her work same way as writers like cummings hemingway or joyce did with their medium its hard imagine cinema without hitchcock kubrick or scorsese represent it this end ritchie has taken his first step establishing his own brand his energetic ultra contemporary camera work incorporates through fresh perspective such devices as slow motion fast motion freeze frame coupled with narration it is at times reminiscent actually expands upon martin scorseses patented visual stylistics camera movements like those found mean streets goodfellas but similarities with scorseses work end there critics endless comparisons ritchies film with works quentin tarantino danny boyles trainspotting stand mostly unwarranted as these comparisons take away inventiveness originality lock stock two smoking barrels ritchies film is much more involved complex layered work than aforementioned comparisons while tarantinos films are very strong dialogue screenplay editing they often lack creative camera work direction boyles trainspotting does have resembling feel ls tsb but aside its great britain origins there really is no need comparison lock stock two smoking barrels is essential viewing,0.4735322822822823,0.09707582582582586,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Have a butchers...,"I was a total and complete sucker for this film.If I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it. I wouldn't change one damn thing. Not a thing. Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue (""It's been emotional."")Now I don't have much to compare this to, and I've heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas. I've got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.This film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn't drag one bit. The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at ""realism"" - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.I really don't think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing. Yes, I'm raving about it, and while it may not be ""spiritually enriching"" or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.I am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like Quentin Tarantino films or Trainspotting. It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.Can't recommend it enough.",have butchers,i was total complete sucker this film if i were write direct movie about gangsters or crime this would be it i wouldnt change one damn thing not thing everything this film was my eye perfect casting camerawork excellent dialogue its been emotional now i dont have much compare this ive heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily older british crime dramas ive got bunch these my queue rent but i doubt you could make crime film better than this this film oozes with style class dark humor plot twists turns doesnt drag one bit casting characterization is perfect ritchie isnt afraid move cameras around no pretense is really made here at realism ritchie doesnt mask fact that its film he runs with it i really dont think myself as easily impressed i have seen hell lot films my time but this one instantly made my top 10 after only single viewing yes im raving about it while it may not be spiritually enriching or contain any deep sociological content which i actually do look films somehow it still scores as one hell film memorable entertaining stands up well multiple viewings i am bit dismayed see some marketing this film comparing it other things like quentin tarantino films or trainspotting it really does it disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon stands its own two feet if anything it is similar trainspotting tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style cant recommend it enough,0.5290029761904761,0.19883928571428572,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,Guy Ritchie's Hilarious Feature Debut,"This is one seriously funny movie. I've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Guy Ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the London criminal underground in one of his earliest features. The story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. The humor in this movie is sharp and fast-paced. At times, it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick British accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall, it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and double-crosses but the ending satisfies.This film marks the debuts of two of England's coolest new actors: Jason Statham (who went on to do 'Transporter', among other movies) and Vinnie Jones (now a familiar cinema tough guy). Jones is especially good as Big Chris, debt collector/family man. The majority of the cast aren't common faces in America (aside from Sting) but they all have the charisma to keep the audience interested. Another plus is the film's soundtrack, ranging from reggae to 70's soul. It adds to the movie's already laid-back feel.Everyone I've seen the movie with enjoys it (once they get past the thick accents, anyway) so I can say with confidence this is a fun movie. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy and I feel this movie's humor hits more often than it misses. I'd recommend giving this movie a chance at least once and I don't think you'd be disappointed.",guy ritchies hilarious feature debut,this is one seriously funny movie ive probably seen it close 10 times it hasnt gotten old yet guy ritchie brings us hilarious look into london criminal underground one his earliest features story revolves around four friends who become indebted local crime lord after card game goes horribly wrong humor this movie is sharp fast paced at times it becomes little hard keep up with thick british accents cockney rhyming slang but overall it doesnt detract movie movie keeps you guessing as outcome when story becomes complex with multiple lies double crosses but ending satisfies this film marks debuts two englands coolest new actors jason statham who went do transporter among other movies vinnie jones now familiar cinema tough guy jones is especially good as big chris debt collector family man majority cast arent common faces america aside sting but they all have charisma keep audience interested another plus is films soundtrack ranging reggae 70s soul it adds movies already laid back feel everyone ive seen movie with enjoys it once they get past thick accents anyway so i can say with confidence this is fun movie i recommend it anyone looking good comedy i feel this movies humor hits more often than it misses id recommend giving this movie chance at least once i dont think youd be disappointed,0.46336898395721926,-0.003137997623291745,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,"As T.C. said, this movie rocks!","You all may know the story at how Tom Cruise saw this movie at a screening in London, and afterwards said, ""This movie rocks."" Whatever you may think of Mr. Cruise, I happen to agree after watching this film. Although I had trouble following the story at times, it was a lot of fun, and Ritchie managed to juggle all the characters around and keep me interested and compelled to watch. I also didn't have any trouble understanding what the characters were saying, and I think those who blind themselves to films like this by saying, ""Oh, I can't understand them"" lack patience. I also liked all the actors, particularly, of course Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones(one of my few complaints is I would have liked to see more of them in the film). And for a film which feels violent, there's surprisingly little actual violence, which is refreshing. Overall, not a particularly deep film, but a lot of fun.",as t c said this movie rocks,you all may know story at how tom cruise saw this movie at screening london afterwards said this movie rocks whatever you may think mr cruise i happen agree after watching this film although i had trouble following story at times it was lot fun ritchie managed juggle all characters around keep me interested compelled watch i also didnt have any trouble understanding what characters were saying i think those who blind themselves films like this by saying oh i cant understand them lack patience i also liked all actors particularly course lenny mclean vinnie jones one my few complaints is i would have liked see more them film film which feels violent theres surprisingly little actual violence which is refreshing overall not particularly deep film but lot fun,0.4222222222222223,0.06273148148148149,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Seriously addictive movie - The most balanced movie ever made?,"The first time I saw this movie I had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent, but because the actors spoke so damn fast. But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS&2SB. Now she is hooked as well.I have lost count of the number of times I have seen LS&2SB and still cannot put my finger on why I find this movie so good to watch. I suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time. The characters are two-dimensional. The villains are menacing, and yet they are made to look like idiots, and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them. They are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control. Maybe it could be called a satire on true life.The style of this movie is unique, full stop. I cannot think of any movie that can be compared to LS&2SB. Quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Goodfellas', 'Trainspotting' and 'Reservoir Dogs', but I think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match LS&2SB to something.The best description I can think of is 'MTV does a crime comedy', and I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that. Like music videos, it is all non-stop movement and sound. Something is always happening but unlike music videos, not without reason.The humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'. No one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny, but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. I think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with LS&2SB. If you are expecting a 'belly laugh Leslie Nielson, Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, typecasted' type all out comedy, or a serious 'Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, DeNiro typecasted crime thriller, you will find this movie a big let down.My favorite characters are Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood) and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) mainly because their two dimensional over-the-top characters are the most obvious. Big Chris takes his son with him debt collecting, and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and Rory Breaker is the most idiotic drug-lord you could come up with.I haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork, speaker blowing soundtrack, beautifully threaded plot, perfect ending and the grittiest visuals I've seen. You wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here, or 'over head city shots', or incredible special effects. This movie has actors I have never heard of, dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand, buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition, cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards, has probably been made with a budget that most movies in Hollywood use for make-up alone, has no love scenes, or romance or complex relationships, no Oscar-worthy performances, and yet is perfect entertainment.Where our movies normally rely on budgets, this movie works on human talent alone.If any movie deserves a 10 out of 10, then this is it.'And there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'",seriously addictive movie most balanced movie ever made,first time i saw this movie i had difficulty understanding lot dialogue not just because weird accent but because actors spoke so damn fast but despite this i became literally addicted it begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes viewing would go ls 2sb now she is hooked as well i have lost count number times i have seen ls 2sb still cannot put my finger why i find this movie so good watch i suppose most obvious feature this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious humorous at same time characters are two dimensional villains are menacing yet they are made look like idiots good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting rug pulled under them they are all projected as cool yet situation is always out their control maybe it could be called satire true life style this movie is unique full stop i cannot think any movie that can be compared ls 2sb quite few people say that style is mix pulp fiction goodfellas trainspotting reservoir dogs but i think that you would make that kind description only if you are really desperate match ls 2sb something best description i can think is mtv does crime comedy i honestly dont think there is anything wrong with that like music videos it is all non stop movement sound something is always happening but unlike music videos not without reason humor is incredibly sharp yet as matter fact no one is really trying be extraordinarily funny but again it is balance between being menacingly serious funny that humor really flies at you i think that it is this reason that few people are really disappointed with ls 2sb if you are expecting belly laugh leslie nielson jim carrey steve martin typecasted type all out comedy or serious al pacino andy garcia deniro typecasted crime thriller you will find this movie big let down my favorite characters are rory breaker vas blackwood big chris vinnie jones mainly because their two dimensional over top characters are most obvious big chris takes his son with him debt collecting while he beats up someone who owes chastises him swearing front his son rory breaker is most idiotic drug lord you could come up with i havent even mentioned excellent unique camerawork speaker blowing soundtrack beautifully threaded plot perfect ending grittiest visuals ive seen you wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here or over head city shots or incredible special effects this movie has actors i have never heard dialogues that you have rewind replay understand buildings that look as though they have been condemned demolition cars that wouldnt even be seen our scrap yards has probably been made with budget that most movies hollywood use make up alone has no love scenes or romance or complex relationships no oscar worthy performances yet is perfect entertainment where our movies normally rely budgets this movie works human talent alone if any movie deserves 10 out 10 then this is it theres one more thing its been emotional,0.6316643323996265,0.16248832866479926,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,''And there's one more thing...it's been emotional' says one of the Slickest 'Gangster' flicks ever!,"'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of those films that I can watch x number of times and still enjoy it as much as I did in the first viewing. This is pretty much what an action gangster flick should be like. It has all the required ingredients. The action, humour, drama and suspense balance extremely well. Ritchie's writing and direction are excellent as not only does the film keep one at the edge of his/her seat but the characters (including minor ones) are rich. They're over-the-top but that only works for the film. While the bad guys think they're powerful and all, they're actually portrayed as dumb and the good guys think they're clever and have all the answers to their problems when they're actually not so bright. The characters are portrayed as cool yet they end up getting caught in a mess. The film too is somewhat satirical as it reflects a part of life e.g. the closeness between the four friends, the son following the father's (Big Chris's) footsteps. The humour is mostly dark with sharp, witty and funny dialogues and hilarious situations. It all seems a 'natural' part of the story. Shot in DV, the camera-work and use of music is very effective. The film has a raw and gritty look yet the execution of it makes it very stylish. Richie uses the same style in 'Snatch'. He should become an auteur and make more movies of this kind as it is clearly his fort (remember his disastrous attempt at romance with 'Swept Away'?). All the actors, whether it's Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham or more recognized faces like Vinnie Jones and Sting, seem to naturally fit their parts. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of the coolest 'gangster' flicks.

Enter a miscellany of desperadoes and hoodlums who target our four lads.For the first time since 'Pulp Fiction', a movie comes along that breaks the shackles of tedious cloning. This film is entertaining and moves along at a cracking pace. Guy Ritchie's script is a tapestry of well-written characters, sharp dialogue that says what needs to be said and leaves the unsaid as food for thought, and a mesh of sub-plots that interlace together with imagination and expertise.His direction is crisp and inventive allowing the cast of eccentric characters to move about freely while maintaining that erratic edge. In this slick piece of film making, Guy Ritchie denies hackneyed Hollywood trends by scripting no true good-guys just varying degrees of bad ones.This is a terrific movie.

9.0,"Very funny, very witty & very excellent British crime caper.","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is set in London where four close friends Eddie (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemying) & Soap (Dezter Fletcher) all chip in £25,000 to make up the £100,000 entrance fee to a big high stakes poker game held by hard as nails villain & crime boss 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty). Eddie is an expert poker player & figures he can make each of them a clear £100,00 profit, if they play their cards right (ha!). Unfortunately 'Hatchet' Harry doesn't like losing & cheats, Eddie not only loses the £100,000 but actually ends up owing 'Hatchet' Harry £500,000 after borrowing it from him to continue in the game. 'Hatchet' Harry is not the sort of person you owe money to, Eddie & his friends must find a way to raise a half a million pounds in the next four days or start losing their fingers...This English production was written & directed by Guy Ritchie & has already deservedly reached pretty much classic status, in fact it still resides in the IMDb's top 250 films list over ten years since it was originally released & for me it throughly deserves to be there. It's just a wonderfully entertaining, witty, funny, clever British crime caper with bags of personality & at the time it was made originality although in the ten years since it was released many a British film has ripped it off trying to recreate it's success. There are a few things which make Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so brilliant. First it's just so funny, I have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels several times now & I laugh my head off every time, the really funny dialogue, the spot on performances, the hilarious one liners, the use of funny cockney rhyming slang & the things which happen along with the often bizarre situations the character's find themselves in means there isn't a scene that goes by where something funny doesn't happen or there isn't some instantly quotable insult or one liner. Secondly the character's are great, they have real depth & the good guy's are very likable so you root for them while the bad guy's are real nasty pieces of work so as a consequence you don't root for them, just the way it should be. Then there's the plot which at the time was fresh, new, original, clever, witty, full of great twists & turns & there's certainly plenty going on which rather improbably all come together at the end in a somewhat far fetched way but when a film is as entertaining, clever & downright funny as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you just tend to go with it. A brilliantly funny British comedy crime caper, one of my favourite films ever & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Ritchie really injects some style, pace & energy into the film with various tricks which never become gimmicky or intrusive & only help tell a brilliantly story with style, originality & panache. Not only did Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels revolutionise the British crime caper genre with it's story telling but it has also influenced plenty of films since with it's slick editing & visual techniques. There's a fantastic soundtrack too, I really can't think of one bad thing to say about Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which is pretty high praise in itself as I am not easily pleased. There's a fair amount of violence but nothing overly graphic & a lot of it is played for laughs as is the bad language & profanity of which there is a lot. In fact I don't there is a single scene which doesn't involve the use of strong language at some point.According to the IMDb Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of about £960,000 which is simply amazing, a film this good & this stylish for less than a million? Shot on location in & around London Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were the film debuts of both ex footballer Vinnie Jones & Jason Statham who have both done very well off the back of it.

7.0,Good start for Guy Ritchie,"Bacon (Jason Statham), Eddy (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) are lifelong friends. Eddy is the card player. Bacon, and Tom are hustlers.

Harry gives them a week before his muscle Barry the Baptist takes care of them. They decide to rob their drug dealing neighbor. Meanwhile Barry is looking to steal a priceless antique shotgun but it ends up in the hands of the four friends.This is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino and that's not a bad thing. This is Guy Ritchie's full length feature debut. It shows that he has skills but it's not quite as polished as 'Reservoir Dogs'. The accents are quite thick. The comedy doesn't always translate well.

8.0,"Watch this with subtitles, if you can","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels features a lot of local slang and Cockney accents and, while it is far from impossible to comprehend, you will be doing yourself a favour if you follow the dialogue in subtitles. In fact, even the unbearably annoying 'hard-of-hearing' option is welcomed. It follows a group of four very ""working class"" blokes as they try to help their friend Eddie (Nick Moran) get out of an enormous debt he amassed one night, playing high-roller with a local gang-boss that cheated. The lads resort to illegal ways to get the money, like ripping off their pot-selling next-door neighbours.This is a really excellent filmentertaining; funny, exciting, and extremely realistic. The style is gorgeous. In fact, I have nothing bad at all to say about it except that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. You also have to be patient with it. That may have been my problem the first time I saw it because I can remember mixing up quite a few people when not paying attention.. Still, the realism of the situations make up for its occasionally slow pace and dialogue-driven plot. For instance, none of these working-class guys know how to handle a gun when they need to, and the result is hilarious. They're not goofy by any means, but they're just normal guys that struggle with the life of crime that they are forced to turn to in order to repay Eddie's debt.

10.0,Brilliant,"I have watched this film countless times and it is always funny, entertaining and visually appealing. It combines a great story (actually about 8 stories), lush cinematography (a personal must have), and superb dialog. When I first saw it, I thought it was a good rip-off of pulp fiction (a common theme on the message boards), but later you come to realize that this simply is not the case. IMO, it is much more like ""The Usual Suspects"", another great film.The visual appeal puts it in my top three list for this (along with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, and Das Boot).There is no weak character - everyone is perfect and fits into place and has their own role in the whole story. But my personal favorite is Rory Breaker. He manages menacing and humorous at the same time in perfect combination.Favorite lines (from Rory Breaker) ""If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick.

10.0,Pure Bloody Genius,"Guy Ritchie has a skill: the skill to take multi-layered gangster plots, weave them together, and come out with a fabric of the finest quality. I first watched ""Snatch"", which came after this film. Loved it. Watch this film, which had a similar set-up (the interwoven gangster theme). Loved it. As far as I'm concerned, if Ritchie can maintain this level of creativity, he can keep on making these films until the end of time. His characters are so well scripted and the actors so well chosen, there is a three-dimensional quality to this film, as if you can almost taste the sulfur in the shotgun blasts.To describe the plot is difficult, unless we choose one character as the hero and the rest as the anti-heroes... but that's hard to do. While certain people seem to be on our side, they're all equally involved in the plot. Kids playing poker, a porn king who cheats at cards, Big Chris the hired thug, the stereotyped black ganja dealer, Barry the Baptist... all great characters.Another aspect of Ritchie's films is that instead of good vs. evil, he offers us bad versus evil. All the characters do bad things: steal, drink, smoke dope and kill if necessary. But some are simply ""bad"" (people who would be morally upright in a different setting) and others are ""evil"" (no moral code at all, black all the way to the core of their heart). This almost non-dichotomy is probably not unique to Ritchie, but is something he excels in.

,Comedy Noir well done,"I'm not sure whether to call this a black comedy or a comedy-noir. The story is about four working class lads who have each managed to save up 25,000 pounds to spot their card-shark friend for a high-stakes poker game with ""Hatchet"" Harry, the local gangster.Unfortunately, Harry's game is rigged and the four end up owing Harry half a million pounds, with just one week to come up with the cash. What ensues is a set of schemes, counter-schemes, rip-offs, and bad/good luck that demand you pay attention. On several occasions I had to pause the video just to take stock of which gang was planning what.The final thirty minutes of the film, as the plots all collide and overlap, turn set-piece shoot outs into comedic punchlines. The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the film-noir genre.The acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs, this one informs without spoiling the action.

8.0,A British Reservoir Dogs,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is about four London class act stiffs who put their money to a test in a card game until things end up horribly wrong as they owe half a million pounds within a week to come up with the cash. The movie is by all means, enjoyable. The characters are all likable and their sense of humour makes the movie tick up a notch. I found myself laughing a couple times in the film to the jokes. All the actors played their parts pretty well, but my favorite character of the film had to go to Big Chris as Vinnie Jones. He was the most entertaining and how he was always correcting his son if he ever made any mistakes was priceless. The dialogue was really well done by Guy Ritchie, as well as his directing. What I noticed about the movie, was how much it was alike to the 1992 film, Reservoir Dogs. Lock, Stock had colorful characters, robbery that ends up bad, unexpected tragedies, good screenplay as well as directing by one person, and a good sense of humour. All those resemble to Reservoir Dogs, it's not even funny. Overall, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good and entertaining comedy/crime film that shows a good future to Guy Ritchie aka ""The Next Quentin Tarantino"", to many. Although it's not up to par with Reservoir Dogs, I still enjoyed it and will be paying a lot of attention to Guy Ritchie's films.

10.0,"""Lock, Stock"" comes at us with two smoking barrels","""Right! Let's sort the buyers from the spiers, the needy from the greedy and those who love me from the ones who don't"" Bacon (Jason Statham) and Eddie (Nick Moran) work a street crowd with their hot merchandise. Cops. They flee. When the film suddenly crashes into super-slomo, and a hard, street-savvy narration kicks in (Alan Ford's voice) telling us of Bacon's and Eddie's street chicanery on its last legs, we hark back to the opening of *Pulp Fiction* (where Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are dialoguing intriguingly and cooing like lovebirds over coffee in a diner one minute and in the next, suddenly viciously holding up the joint). Like *Pulp*, this Guy Ritchie-penned and directed trash whore promises to be a dialog-luscious film with a rabid style all its own.It is.With a frenetic energy that few films today possess, *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels* is the work of a film-maker who remembers that movies are, first and foremost, Entertainment. Guy Ritchie is Danny Boyle (*Trainspotting, 28 Days Later*) on crank.Along with Statham and Moran, Dexter Fletcher (as Soap) and Jason Flemyng (as ""Tubby"" Tommy) round out the quartet of twenty-something East End street friends who pool their cash to enter Eddie, a card-shark natural, into a life-or-death stakes card game with local gangster and porn king, ""Hatchet"" Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty).Which Eddie, through Harry's cheating, promptly loses.So begins Eddie and the boys' crooked quest to deliver ""half a million knickers"" to Harry before Harry's bulldog, Barry ""The Baptist"" (Lenny McLean) starts claiming their digits as vig.That's the short version. In the final telling, Lock, Stock - filmed with a leached look that makes London look even stinkier and gloomier than it actually is - is a Mobius strip of black comedic robbery and nihilistic bloodletting, shot through a revolving-door of criss-crossing, cross-killing, kill-switching plots.Concurrent with our desperate hero foursome (calling them anti-heroes does not even suffice for their level of ""anti,"" so let's drop the prefix and stop pretending we don't support bad guys), there are the dazed and confused marijuana farmers led by the willowy Winston (Steven Mackintosh), whom we first meet inanely arguing over locking the front gate; there are Eddie's neighbors, a gang of thieves as ruthless as they are inept, led by a chilling sadist, Dog (Frank Harper), whom we first meet as he swipes golf balls off the nose of a victim while machete-ing another hanging upside down; there is a black gang of giants led by a cockney midget with a fashion-challenged 'fro, Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), whose introduction to the story sees him setting a man on fire for insisting he change the pub television channel; then there are the two clueless, low-rent bandits (Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire) who burgle the smoking barrels of the title with plot-twisting consequences; there's Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), a merciless hit-man who is yet intent on raising his son with manners, and a hardened bar owner, JD, who shuns the maelstrom, not for want of street-cred, but because he is miles beyond mustered (played by Sting, as hard as the day he formed The Police).With a source-music soundtrack that swivels effortlessly between savage, scarring guitars to ska figures and traditional Jewish plucking, and slang so rich your ears will gain ten pounds (""not with Liberia's deficit in ya skyrocket,"" ""orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong tiddly in the nuclear sub""), Lock, Stock wends its complex way to a furiously satisfying climax, twists aplenty and a final shot that will renew your faith in creative storytelling like a date with a drunk Hans Christian Andersen.This movie is a modern classic.No matter the Serious Critics denigrating style over substance, this movie - stylistic to a fault  defiantly does not lack for substance. It is no secret that the nature of the medium is *reliant* on style, so it is as silly to say that a movie should lack ""style"" as a rock band should lack ""image""  these are the selling points of the products. Style is an integral aspect of a modern director's toolbox and Ritchie has consciously chosen to present his product this stylishly - and his cup overfloweth with substance too.Yet Ritchie's stylistic verve earns him his share of detractors, some rationally decrying the new breed of crash-cutting, shotgun storytellers, some just too slow-witted to keep up with the swagger of the Ritchies, Tarantinos and Boyles  subsequently, there are only two ways to take this movie: either not at all, or lock, stock and two smoking barrels(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",lock stock comes at us with two smoking barrels,right lets sort buyers spiers needy greedy those who love me ones who dont bacon jason statham eddie nick moran work street crowd with their hot merchandise cops they flee when film suddenly crashes into super slomo hard street savvy narration kicks alan fords voice telling us bacons eddies street chicanery its last legs we hark back opening pulp fiction where tim roth amanda plummer are dialoguing intriguingly cooing like lovebirds over coffee diner one minute next suddenly viciously holding up joint like pulp this guy ritchie penned directed trash whore promises be dialog luscious film with rabid style all its own it is with frenetic energy that few films today possess lock stock two smoking barrels is work film maker who remembers that movies are first foremost entertainment guy ritchie is danny boyle trainspotting 28 days later crank along with statham moran dexter fletcher as soap jason flemyng as tubby tommy round out quartet twenty something east end street friends who pool their cash enter eddie card shark natural into life or death stakes card game with local gangster porn king hatchet harry lonsdale p h moriarty which eddie through harrys cheating promptly loses so begins eddie boys crooked quest deliver half million knickers harry before harrys bulldog barry baptist lenny mclean starts claiming their digits as vig thats short version final telling lock stock filmed with leached look that makes london look even stinkier gloomier than it actually is is mobius strip black comedic robbery nihilistic bloodletting shot through revolving door criss crossing cross killing kill switching plots concurrent with our desperate hero foursome calling them anti heroes does not even suffice their level anti so lets drop prefix stop pretending we dont support bad guys there are dazed confused marijuana farmers led by willowy winston steven mackintosh whom we first meet inanely arguing over locking front gate there are eddies neighbors gang thieves as ruthless as they are inept led by chilling sadist dog frank harper whom we first meet as he swipes golf balls off nose victim while machete ing another hanging upside down there is black gang giants led by cockney midget with fashion challenged fro rory breaker vas blackwood whose introduction story sees him setting man fire insisting he change pub television channel then there are two clueless low rent bandits jake abraham victor mcguire who burgle smoking barrels title with plot twisting consequences theres big chris vinnie jones merciless hit man who is yet intent raising his son with manners hardened bar owner jd who shuns maelstrom not want street cred but because he is miles beyond mustered played by sting as hard as day he formed police with source music soundtrack that swivels effortlessly between savage scarring guitars ska figures traditional jewish plucking slang so rich your ears will gain ten pounds not with liberias deficit ya skyrocket orders aristotle most ping pong tiddly nuclear sub lock stock wends its complex way furiously satisfying climax twists aplenty final shot that will renew your faith creative storytelling like date with drunk hans christian andersen this movie is modern classic no matter serious critics denigrating style over substance this movie stylistic fault defiantly does not lack substance it is no secret that nature medium is reliant style so it is as silly say that movie should lack style as rock band should lack image these are selling points products style is integral aspect modern directors toolbox ritchie has consciously chosen present his product this stylishly his cup overfloweth with substance too yet ritchies stylistic verve earns him his share detractors some rationally decrying new breed crash cutting shotgun storytellers some just too slow witted keep up with swagger ritchies tarantinos boyles subsequently there are only two ways take this movie either not at all or lock stock two smoking barrels movie maniacs visit www poffysmoviemania com,0.4799126661066961,-0.05746484030066121,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"

8.0,And so it began,"It had been quite some time since I first saw this. The beginning of Guy Ritchie and the beginning of Jason Statham. If you watch this after all the movies he has done since, you may be a bit surprised by his role here. But back then, he was not a big shot, quite the opposite was the case. And this movie was quite rough on the edges. While I remembered the humor and comedy, I had forgotten about the grimness at places. About how down and dirty it is sometimes.While maybe some things are meant as fun (like beating up a person in the back of your car for their job/profession) and aside the question if there was a personal agenda of any of the makers of this behind that, the scene and others just feel mean and almost out of place. In stark contrast to something like a machine gun scene that is just funny (even though also quite violent).Maybe it will depend on your own level of what you can take and what you are ok with. Someone like Vinnie Jones is and was infamous - and he shows off why in this movie. Yes he is playing a character ... some might feel he just is himself, maybe dialed up a little bit.The movie was used as bluepring by many when it was made and it made the careeer of quite a few that were involved in this. The impact on the film world cannot be denied, whatever and however you may personally feel about it. And I liked it - flaws and all! Can be watched anytime too",so it began,it had been quite some time since i first saw this beginning guy ritchie beginning jason statham if you watch this after all movies he has done since you may be bit surprised by his role here but back then he was not big shot quite opposite was case this movie was quite rough edges while i remembered humor comedy i had forgotten about grimness at places about how down dirty it is sometimes while maybe some things are meant as fun like beating up person back your car their job profession aside question if there was personal agenda any makers this behind that scene others just feel mean almost out place stark contrast something like machine gun scene that is just funny even though also quite violent maybe it will depend your own level what you can take what you are ok with someone like vinnie jones is was infamous he shows off why this movie yes he is playing character some might feel he just is himself maybe dialed up little bit movie was used as bluepring by many when it was made it made careeer quite few that were involved this impact film world cannot be denied whatever however you may personally feel about it i liked it flaws all can be watched anytime too,0.5004050925925926,-0.014814814814814814,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,"Luck, Irony and Two Old Shotguns","After being in love with ""Snatch"", my cousin and I began to look out for this film and finally we saw it on a bootleg of the imported DVD. That was about 3 or 4 years ago and the last year I saw for the very first time the Region 4 DVD so I get my own copy of the film and enjoyed for the second time. Last week I saw ""The Transporter"" and I decide to enjoy once again this magnificent work so I'm here writing, after a third view, my thoughts about Guy Ritchie's first feature film.The story introduce you this four friends: Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher). They have different ways to get money but finally they decide to enter in a big game. They put together £100,000 to play a card game, taking advantage of the great abilities of Eddie. But they are playing against ""Hatchet"" Harry (P.H. Moriarty) who is a porn king and now they owns him £500,000 and Harry is the kind of man that if you own him you better pay him. I really love how the story makes that you care and, at the same time, feel sorry for the four friends because they put in that card game all of their savings and now they need a real miracle to get the money in only one week. At the same time were are watching this, we also watch some other characters that, if you think first, doesn't have anything related with the four friends but you will see how little is the world. There are many secondary characters but basically there are just group of friends and partners: the drug growers, the criminal neighbors of Eddie, the two guys from the North and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) with his son, Little Chris. And all know Harry and Rory (Vas Blackwood) that are the ""big bosses"". There are two more characters that are the ones that connect everything, specially the second one: Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) and Nick the Greek (Stephen Marcus). This story might look a little complicated with a lot of connected subplots but the way that is shown is just perfect, enjoyable and easy to follow. The style of Guy Ritchie is just so cool, for example the first sequence is just brilliant, and there are many funny situations just as many ironies in the entire story, being the one in the very end the biggest of all.Cast: Just brilliant. Eddie could be the main character and Nick Moran is just great. Jason Statham is great but he has a support role as part of the four friends so he doesn't stand out of the four because the four are a team and are great. As I watched first ""Snatch"" I found here many familiar faces like Vinnie Jones and Alan Ford. The last one has a very small role as the bartender but he is also the narrator with his unique voice. Also Sting appears as Eddie's father making a really good performance and ""the hardest man in Britain"", Lenny McLean, is terrific as Barry.Conclusion: Well for me this is nothing but a brilliant film. Great story, great characters, funny situations with a lot of irony. I mention in this comment many times the film ""Snatch"" and the only reason is because is a similar film, brilliant too so I highly recommend both. In this case ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" deserves a perfect and beautiful 10.",luck irony two old shotguns,after being love with snatch my cousin i began look out this film finally we saw it bootleg imported dvd that was about 3 or 4 years ago last year i saw very first time region 4 dvd so i get my own copy film enjoyed second time last week i saw transporter i decide enjoy once again this magnificent work so im here writing after third view my thoughts about guy ritchies first feature film story introduce you this four friends eddie nick moran tom jason flemyng bacon jason statham soap dexter fletcher they have different ways get money but finally they decide enter big game they put together 100 000 play card game taking advantage great abilities eddie but they are playing against hatchet harry p h moriarty who is porn king now they owns him 500 000 harry is kind man that if you own him you better pay him i really love how story makes that you care at same time feel sorry four friends because they put that card game all their savings now they need real miracle get money only one week at same time were are watching this we also watch some other characters that if you think first doesnt have anything related with four friends but you will see how little is world there are many secondary characters but basically there are just group friends partners drug growers criminal neighbors eddie two guys north big chris vinnie jones with his son little chris all know harry rory vas blackwood that are big bosses there are two more characters that are ones that connect everything specially second one barry baptist lenny mclean nick greek stephen marcus this story might look little complicated with lot connected subplots but way that is shown is just perfect enjoyable easy follow style guy ritchie is just so cool example first sequence is just brilliant there are many funny situations just as many ironies entire story being one very end biggest all cast just brilliant eddie could be main character nick moran is just great jason statham is great but he has support role as part four friends so he doesnt stand out four because four are team are great as i watched first snatch i found here many familiar faces like vinnie jones alan ford last one has very small role as bartender but he is also narrator with his unique voice also sting appears as eddies father making really good performance hardest man britain lenny mclean is terrific as barry conclusion well me this is nothing but brilliant film great story great characters funny situations with lot irony i mention this comment many times film snatch only reason is because is similar film brilliant too so i highly recommend both this case lock stock two smoking barrels deserves perfect beautiful 10,0.5755416666666667,0.25653125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,"A lot like ""Snatch"" but with fewer laughs.","Considering that this film was written and directed by Guy Ritchie, it's certainly not very surprising that it is strongly reminiscent of ""Snatch""--another one of Ritchie's film. Obviously, he did well with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and decided to repeat the formula for his next film. Both have very dark and dry senses of humor, a lot of bad guys (nothing but bad guys), bad language and crude material all wrapped up in an incredibly stylish package. You like one film, you'll like the other. You hate one, you'll hate the other.This film is about several groups of idiot criminals who all converge. There are the incredibly stupid and burn-out drug dealers, the tough guys who plan to rob them AND a third group that plans to rob the second group once they've committed the robbery. In addition, you have some super-scary baddies--super-scary indeed. Who will survive with all these guns, knives and swords being wielded? And, speaking of guns, two of the shotguns used in the robbery MIGHT just be worth more than all the stuff they steal--but the dummies don't even realize it.This film is, above all else, very stylish and weird. The criminals DEFINITELY have odd and quirky personalities but more importantly, the camera-work and edits are very well done--very innovative and they get your attention. It's all very well worth seeing but it's also NOT a film for everyone. Of course, you shouldn't let your kids, your mother or Father Jenkins watch it. But to enjoy it yourself you need a very high threshold for this sort of thing. It certainly AIN'T rated G! However, despite the very harsh language and very adult subject matter, Richie actually doesn't show that much of the violence. It happens--but mostly off-camera.By the way, of the two similar films, I slightly prefer ""Snatch"" simply because it tried harder to be overtly funny--though the nihilistic ending in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was priceless. Also, as I watched the film and heard a bazillion bullets being discharged, it's interesting that no police EVER responded to any of the locations!",lot like snatch but with fewer laughs,considering that this film was written directed by guy ritchie its certainly not very surprising that it is strongly reminiscent snatch another one ritchies film obviously he did well with lock stock two smoking barrels decided repeat formula his next film both have very dark dry senses humor lot bad guys nothing but bad guys bad language crude material all wrapped up incredibly stylish package you like one film youll like other you hate one youll hate other this film is about several groups idiot criminals who all converge there are incredibly stupid burn out drug dealers tough guys who plan rob them third group that plans rob second group once theyve committed robbery addition you have some super scary baddies super scary indeed who will survive with all these guns knives swords being wielded speaking guns two shotguns used robbery might just be worth more than all stuff they steal but dummies dont even realize it this film is above all else very stylish weird criminals definitely have odd quirky personalities but more importantly camera work edits are very well done very innovative they get your attention its all very well worth seeing but its also not film everyone course you shouldnt let your kids your mother or father jenkins watch it but enjoy it yourself you need very high threshold this sort thing it certainly aint rated g however despite very harsh language very adult subject matter richie actually doesnt show that much violence it happens but mostly off camera by way two similar films i slightly prefer snatch simply because it tried harder be overtly funny though nihilistic ending lock stock two smoking barrels was priceless also as i watched film heard bazillion bullets being discharged its interesting that no police ever responded any locations,0.5557679653679654,-0.02630187590187587,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
6.0,entertaining,"For $8 million, this is a fricking monument of 1990's film. The first time I saw it I laughed at most of the jokes and followed the plot with pleasure. That's more than I can say about any number of movies in the 1990's that cost ten times as much to make and starred pricey talent. The editing is clever and cute. The casting is just short of flawless. Of the four principles, only Bacon seemed consistent to me. The minor parts were sometimes spectacular, esp. Big & Little Chris and Barry the Baptist.There are some legitimate complaints about this movie. The big one is that it doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything. It seems like an awful lot of flash and talent to end up saying nothing about anything. But um it's not like Lock, Stock is trying to be anything it isn't, so maybe it's not a valid critique after all. Considering how long Tarrantino's influence has been around, it's a little unfair to call Ritchie on imitating him. There are some similarities  large casts, distinct characters, clever dialogue, rapid shifts in narratives from one string to another and shifting in time, and few other things. I think the problem is that years of dumbing down by Hollywood have almost eliminated all these things. The influence is there certainly, but it would not seem as pronounced if there were any other hugely exposed filmmakers in recent memory that put as much emphasis on dialogue and character besides Tarantino.I haven't watched MTV since the mid-1980's, so the style of Lock Stock and Snatch didn't seem trite to me. Some people I talked to said that the film style was too much like the average car commercial or pop video, which is getting the influence backwards, but I could see how those associations would spoil the experience.",entertaining,8 million this is fricking monument 1990s film first time i saw it i laughed at most jokes followed plot with pleasure thats more than i can say about any number movies 1990s that cost ten times as much make starred pricey talent editing is clever cute casting is just short flawless four principles only bacon seemed consistent me minor parts were sometimes spectacular esp big little chris barry baptist there are some legitimate complaints about this movie big one is that it doesnt really go anywhere or mean anything it seems like awful lot flash talent end up saying nothing about anything but um its not like lock stock is trying be anything it isnt so maybe its not valid critique after all considering how long tarrantinos influence has been around its little unfair call ritchie imitating him there are some similarities large casts distinct characters clever dialogue rapid shifts narratives one string another shifting time few other things i think problem is that years dumbing down by hollywood have almost eliminated all these things influence is there certainly but it would not seem as pronounced if there were any other hugely exposed filmmakers recent memory that put as much emphasis dialogue character besides tarantino i havent watched mtv since mid 1980s so style lock stock snatch didnt seem trite me some people i talked said that film style was too much like average car commercial or pop video which is getting influence backwards but i could see how those associations would spoil experience,0.4519586894586894,0.10304741554741553,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Funny flick. Clever.,"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a funny film that gives new word to ""disorderly"". About a group of low-lifes (Jason Flemying, Nick Moran, Dexter Flitcher) who have to pay a load of money to a mob boss who also runs a porn shop. In this escapade, many funny (and crude) things happen, including a retreival of only 2 guns (and lots of money) and a father criminal and his tag-along son. Clever British crime story from Guy Ritchie who makes his debut as director here. A good time to watch, unless you don't like English people. Sting appears in a few scenes as a bar owner (his role was my favorite).
