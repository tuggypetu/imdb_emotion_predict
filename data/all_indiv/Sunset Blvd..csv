10.0,A true Hollywood horror story,"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday"" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical.

,"""Madam is the greatest star of all.""","Sunset Blvd. could be looked at as a thesis on what fame does to certain people. For Norma Desmond, fame created a fantasy world that forever trapped her. Living alone in that giant house on Sunset, save for her servant Max, Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters, and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis. For Norma, there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life. Of course, no one knows who Norma Desmond is. Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy, to unbridled joy, to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic. He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory. In the end, Joe pays the price for enduring Norma's insanity. As she descends that staircase in the final scene, you can see that she is completely lost in her own world. A world where no one grows old, where she is forever young, and where she is the greatest star of them all. After all, stars never age.",madam is greatest star all,sunset blvd could be looked at as thesis what fame does certain people norma desmond fame created fantasy world that forever trapped her living alone that giant house sunset save her servant max norma whiles away hours planning her magnificent return her fame kept alive by fan letters her hope return kindled by joe gillis norma there is no other life than standing before cameras acting out lives characters that are larger than life course no one knows who norma desmond is gloria swanson gives magnificent performance she runs melancholy unbridled joy complete mental breakdown william holden is ultimate cynic he plays norma like fiddle but gets ensnared her web decaying glory end joe pays price enduring normas insanity as she descends that staircase final scene you can see that she is completely lost her own world world where no one grows old where she is forever young where she is greatest star them all after all stars never age,0.5823214285714287,0.29383928571428564,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.48}"
,Best Performance in Film History: Gloria Swanson,"The plot has been discussed at length in other comments.To me SUNSET BOULEVARD has it all. The comedy is sly, the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress. It's really about the giving up of dreams.Norma's dream of return, held to for 20 years, is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria. That Norma cannot make a comeback in 1950 even with connections to DeMille is sad. The sadness is due to Norma's refusal to accept her aging or the politics of Hollywood that worship youth. It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood (the parade has passed by) but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other old-timers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Faye--still working but not as STARS. The final irony here is that Gloria did make the comeback that Norma couldn't make.Norma has a thing about STARS.... she says at one point... ""the stars are ageless."" Well this is true in a filmic sense. I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup, she is ageless. She is still twenty something. That screen image is forever held up like a bad mirror to the reality of being 50. On another occasion Norma says ""nobody leaves a STAR, that's what makes one a STAR."" True again, but it's not just Gillis who is leaving Norma, her fans have already left. Hence if one is left, one cannot be a STAR.Gillis also gives up his dream (temporarily) of being a writer, Max gives up his dream of directing, and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis. Scary stuff.The film is also about LOVE. Look what these people have done for love: love of another person or love of fame or whatever. Max loves Norma. Norma loves Gillis. Gillis loves Norma and Betty. Betty loves Gillis and Artie. Artie loves Betty. And all of them love Hollywood.Everyone is crushed at the end of this film..... The scene of Max ""directing"" the scene as Norma descends the staircase is one of the all-time great scenes in a film. Norma's final speech, which sums up everything (""there is nothing else""), is devastating. Can she really be insane and make this lucid speech? If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about ""being back"" and ""all those wonderful people out there in the dark"" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).I cannot think of any other film (possibly CITIZEN KANE) that works on so many different levels. And Gloria Swanson gives the greatest performance in film history!",best performance film history gloria swanson,plot has been discussed at length other comments me sunset boulevard has it all comedy is sly drama is epic proportions because its not just story about hollywood or aging actress its really about giving up dreams normas dream return held 20 years is ironic because norma so closely parallels gloria that norma cannot make comeback 1950 even with connections demille is sad sadness is due normas refusal accept her aging or politics hollywood that worship youth its ironic that norma has no place hollywood parade has passed by but demille is still working scenes samson delilah we spot other old timers like henry wilcoxon julia faye still working but not as stars final irony here is that gloria did make comeback that norma couldnt make norma has thing about stars she says at one point stars are ageless well this is true filmic sense i can still watch gloria swanson love sunya or manhandled yup she is ageless she is still twenty something that screen image is forever held up like bad mirror reality being 50 another occasion norma says nobody leaves star thats what makes one star true again but its not just gillis who is leaving norma her fans have already left hence if one is left one cannot be star gillis also gives up his dream temporarily being writer max gives up his dream directing even betty gives up her dream love with gillis scary stuff film is also about love look what these people have done love love another person or love fame or whatever max loves norma norma loves gillis gillis loves norma betty betty loves gillis artie artie loves betty all them love hollywood everyone is crushed at end this film scene max directing scene as norma descends staircase is one all time great scenes film normas final speech which sums up everything there is nothing else is devastating can she really be insane make this lucid speech if shes not insane then she has knowingly killed gillis prevent his leaving her star also shots max blinking away tears as norma descends supposedly into madness also hedda hopper crying are equally as devastating as normas speech about being back all those wonderful people out there dark which course includes us every time we watch film i cannot think any other film possibly citizen kane that works so many different levels gloria swanson gives greatest performance film history,0.5892857142857143,0.08809523809523809,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,Another Billy Wilder masterpiece,"I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films. It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life  when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady. In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood. Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless. There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.--Shelly",another billy wilder masterpiece,i have yet see billy wilder film that i havent loved sunset boulevard is definitely one those films its interesting watch film during different times ones life when i was child watching this film i thought story was good that norma desmond swanson was pretty scary lady my teens college years i appreciated it as certified classic its commentary hollywood now my late 20s early 30s i found it have different impact me i was saddened by desmonds mental illness when she makes her final descent down her staircase utters her famous line as camera pans faces people around her so full pity care her butler ex husband takes make sure shes happy maybe last time her life made more impact me than any other time 20 odd times ive seen this film there are only small handful central characters sunset boulevard they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless there are not lot dated themes this film circle life that is hollywood isnt going be much more evolved 2050 than it was 1950 if you havent seen this film watch it because there is something just about anyone this film shelly,0.5512452107279693,0.15325670498084293,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!,"Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. ""Norma Desmond"" and ""Joe Gillis"" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned ""10,000 midnights ago"". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard (""That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps."" says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naiveté combine to give us one of the most electrifying ""give and take"" between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even ""wax figures"" (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for ""ruining the industry"". The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have ""changed"". They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that ""Valentino once danced on."" There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING: 10 of 10",hollywood myth forever shattered,until 1950 american films were strictly entertainment some deeper than others studio executives were very protective image star making essence everything seemed perfect billy wilder charles brackett d m marshman jr created stunning work art that splits hollywood sign two exposed dream factory what it really is struggle both gain keep notoriety limelight norma desmond joe gillis are at opposite ends this warped hollywood mindset with gillis played by that most cynical actors william holden trying pay rent norma gloria swanson living lie as silent queen whose star burned 10 000 midnights ago how picture with such snide look at industry could come out 1950 is simply mind boggling considering some light fodder that came out hollywood at time it has inspired many modern day disciples such as altmans player sonnenfelds get shorty both which took their vicious hilarious parodies jugular movie capital world sunset blvd is father all socially oriented pictures regarding movies is by far best images this beautiful black white powerhouse are fascinating unforgettable dead writer floating pool eyes wide open looking right at us at beginning eerie pipe organ that plays by breeze middle one most deep dustiest sets ever funeral ceremony dead monkey normas courtyard that must have been one important chimp grandson king kong perhaps says holden delightfully crisp wise voice over holden pulls his car into driveway off boulevard that will change his life forever he is emblem struggle get notoriety he has only few b movies his credit swanson as norma desmond is symbol lost fame has become talk legend what is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself odd way she was actual silent star whose career went down tubes after talkies came about her madness combined with holdens last drop naivet combine give us one most electrifying give take between actors ive ever witnessed both lead parts were passed over by several actors holden was eventually forced into it as contract player how could you pass such script even wax figures as holden calls them buster keaton h b warner anna q nilsson come normas play bridge course being hollywood outcasts themselves after invention sound film some dialogue takes swing at actual movies people gone with wind zanuck menjou this must have brought house down hollywood screening rooms throughout town louis b mayer even condemned billy wilder ruining industry film is sad darkly humorous depicting antics norma who is quite insane holden who is going along with what norma is giving him but has plans his own another wax figure still alive kicking 1950 appears as himself important role cecil b demille who once directed norma gloria back silent heyday tries set her straight telling her pictures have changed they had indeed especially after this searing comment celebrity status i wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem scenes are shot right lot paramount studios even front gate normas mansion is unforgettable piece history gloom with floor that valentino once danced there is so much discuss but little enlighten you how great sunset blvd is without you seeing it just two years later films began crop up with same tainted view hollywood most with varying degrees deception singin rain one all time entertainments quietly had nasty taste its mouth regarding celebrity invention sound movies watch these films closely see skeletons modern hollywood bash films rating 10 10,0.4926149247577818,0.11674654710368997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10.0,"""Mr. Wilder, I'm ready for my close-up""","Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were about the best writing team in Hollywood for more than three decades. ""Sunset Boulevard"" shows the men at the pinnacle of their profession. Billy Wilder directed the film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at a Hollywood that had faded almost a quarter of a century before. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.With the advent of the ""talkies"" a lot of film stars of the silent era lost their privileged positions as the most admired people in movies. When the new generation appeared in the scene, they were more accessible to the fans that flocked to see the new technique in the movies that came out. One of those movies stars, Norma Desmond, lives in the past as she never adapted to the new reality, which is evident in the way she stays out of the scene dwelling in her antiquated castle on Sunset Boulevard.Enter Joe Gillis, the man who never made it into the industry. As a writer, all his screen plays were rejected by the studio machinery because they were not what the heads of the production departments wanted to produce, or just were plain, not interested. Joe Gillis comes into the Desmond mansion by accident and it's an accident he encounters on his way out of it! Tbe egotistical Norma Desmond lives in the her palatial home with Max Von Mayerberg, the loyal servant, who was himself, somebody in the silent era. Norma falls for the young Gillis in ways she never expected, but as a desperate woman she wants to possess what she can't otherwise buy, even a man going through financial bad times the way Joe Gillis is.Billy Wilder got magnificent performances out of the three principals. William Holden had one of the best opportunities of his film career with Joe Gillis, a character he wasn't even scheduled to play, but which Montgomery Cliff handed to him in a silver platter when he refused to appear in the picture! Gloria Swanson, having experienced that old Hollywood, was a natural choice to play Norma, which was perhaps, the crowning role in her distinguished career. Erich Von Stroheim, the great director, himself, is absolutely wonderful as Von Mayerling.We see some of the silent era stars such as Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, Anne C. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, as well as Cecil B. DeMille, the director of Hollywood epics par excellence.The great musical score of Franz Waxman enhances the film. John Seitz black and white photography brings us back to that time. Ultimately, it's the genius of Billy Wilder that keeps things in balance showing a man who understood movies as perhaps the only one that could have directed the classic ""Sunset Boulevard"".",mr wilder im ready my close up,billy wilder charles brackett were about best writing team hollywood more than three decades sunset boulevard shows men at pinnacle their profession billy wilder directed film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at hollywood that had faded almost quarter century before if you havent seen film please stop reading here with advent talkies lot film stars silent era lost their privileged positions as most admired people movies when new generation appeared scene they were more accessible fans that flocked see new technique movies that came out one those movies stars norma desmond lives past as she never adapted new reality which is evident way she stays out scene dwelling her antiquated castle sunset boulevard enter joe gillis man who never made it into industry as writer all his screen plays were rejected by studio machinery because they were not what heads production departments wanted produce or just were plain not interested joe gillis comes into desmond mansion by accident its accident he encounters his way out it tbe egotistical norma desmond lives her palatial home with max von mayerberg loyal servant who was himself somebody silent era norma falls young gillis ways she never expected but as desperate woman she wants possess what she cant otherwise buy even man going through financial bad times way joe gillis is billy wilder got magnificent performances out three principals william holden had one best opportunities his film career with joe gillis character he wasnt even scheduled play but which montgomery cliff handed him silver platter when he refused appear picture gloria swanson having experienced that old hollywood was natural choice play norma which was perhaps crowning role her distinguished career erich von stroheim great director himself is absolutely wonderful as von mayerling we see some silent era stars such as buster keaton hedda hopper anne c nilsson h b warner as well as cecil b demille director hollywood epics par excellence great musical score franz waxman enhances film john seitz black white photography brings us back that time ultimately its genius billy wilder that keeps things balance showing man who understood movies as perhaps only one that could have directed classic sunset boulevard,0.4572141273360785,0.17995459824728116,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,A popular opinion is to believe Joe is a cad BUT...,"... how would you feel if the sexes of the characters were reversed? Suppose it was a woman writer trying to break into Hollywood, completely broke who, due to a flat tire, wanders into that big mansion. Pretty much financially cornered, she agrees to a job reworking some old film star's (let's say John Gilbert lived) script and comeback vehicle and slowly, what independence she has is taken away - her things are moved from her apartment where she is behind on her rent into a room over the garage at the mansion, her host sits by and lets her car be repossessed, she is never paid the promised cash for her work, a bad rainstorm moves her from her room over the garage into a room in the main house where there are no locks on the doors and thus no privacy, and then the seduction. Who would be the cad then?So I think Wilder meant for the audience to sympathize with Joe. Sure he makes some questionable moral moves, but he is to some degree cornered. He would have to get a hand out from somebody to go back to his job that he hates at the copy desk in Ohio, and his pride wouldn't let him. Also, some say he becomes attracted to Norma. He at best is giving her pity sex and at worst duty sex. He looks either revolted or bored every time she touches him.There are just great performances and interesting characters all around. Unpopular opinion here - I never thought Gloria Swanson was a pretty woman, but she had such severe features that she could come across as an attractive yet unhinged woman for age 50 as Norma. Eric Von Stroheim as Max. He was a great director who lets his obsession with Norma delude them both. And then there is Betty Schaefer, the down to earth girl who does the 50s thing and gets engaged to a man the way you would buy a car - she picks something reliable and likeable and omits passion from the equation. And then she finds passion. There could have been a sequel noir with her married to the dull dutiful Artie when she begins to call the mailman by his first name. The postman would only have to ring once in her case. But I digress.This is also a great look at Hollywood and Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. It's too bad we don't have more actual films from Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950.

10.0,A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece,"In Hollywood of the 50's, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched ""Sunset Boulevard"" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever.

8.0,"weird, bizarre, fascinating, great","This movie deserves all the accolades it has gotten here, as well as ""Maltin's"" four stars. It certainly ranks up there as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. Seeing it again only reinforces my opinion that William Holden was one of the truly great actors of the last [!] century. Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck. I don't know if the black & white was an economic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of Joe Gillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMille actually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim and you have an unbeatable combination. Truly one the all-time must-see films, although I don't know how to classify it - film noir? black comedy? Hollywood fable ? horror story? psychodrama?

9.0,"Alright Sunset BLVD, are you ready for your close up?","The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.",alright sunset blvd are you ready your close up,movie is still big its pictures that got small there is nothing like watching sunset boulevard its great movie that need be center attention name after boulevard los angeles this film noir was directed co written by billy wilder who destroy forever iconic hollywood image with his dark tale greed lust everlasting fame film stars william holden as joe gillis unsuccessful screenwriter who happen come upon faded silent movie starlet norma desmond gloria swanson who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams making triumphant return screen william holden is great role as man struggling keep his masculinity i like his moral decision end film serve them right way this movie was indeed william holden comeback film as well as he fallen starlight after 1939s golden boys gloria swanson is scary charming brilliant femme fatale manipulative role she does over act bit but that comes with part shes pretty much playing extreme version herself gloria herself was trying have comeback with this film after number fails films include one with director erich von stroheim 1929s queen kelly art is mirroring real life as erich von stroheim stars as max von mayerling her butler director that discovered her there is even chilling theater scene with all main characters watching film queen kelly erich von stroheim is just amazing this film i have become fan his works i didnt like nancy olson so much as betty schaefer as i felt she was way too chirpy my taste your face shouting acting i do like silent film stars cameos like director cecil b demille buster keaton h b warner anna q nilsson i do like cameo set 1949s demilles samson delilah it makes film seems more real hollywood know that another real life film was really taking place there while characters could had been nearly unlikeable billy wilders comedy charm gives this movie some room breathe i have praise writing its amazing yes some jokes went over my head but film was balance well enough drama comedy not feel overloaded narrative film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted often confusing it does commonly entailing use flashback first person voice over narration im pretty glad they open film with shot swimming pool rather than having two corpses talking each other at morgue i think it does sound stupid so im glad they use dead body swimming pool idea corpse floating pool films opening scene desired image proved difficult achieve problem was resolved by placing mirrors bottom swimming pool filming above underwater shot was pretty impressed at time visual effects are amazing sunset boulevard uses lot high contrast lighting normas house that creates dark shadows that works well lighting setting is show character is suffocating their life norma is ever looking light i love foggy blur that it create when people get near it its symbolism at its best film also contains some german expressionistic element such as oblique vertical horizontal angles some interior shots crew sprinkled dust front camera before filming suggest dirty or unclean house was old nice way photographs were surrounding it look like some odd gothic church house was later used by nicholas rays 1955s rebel without cause it was pretty interesting score was composed by franz waxman was pretty good nothing worth noting compare todays standards it was just ok at best me here are some faults film my opinion narrating goes little bit too long show dont tell plus how do dead men can do narration anyways arent they dead whole blooming gillis betty relationship seem out place as well i know its needed plot but its seem forced i just dont see betty having much interested man she barely sees story was bit influence by real life tragedy mabel normand william desmond taylor which william desmond got shot killed this film marks first time that hollywood was view negative light film theme this movie is that hollywood creates dreams stars then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies other side coin some people are so hungry fame that they are willing do anything shot at it even destroying lives hollywood still love hate film its criticism movie industry its still bit controversial ever today wilder show us real hollywood where few people had success many fails people mustnt starve fame too long else they risk being trapped world their own making world where they become bitter delude,0.4903791030975497,0.12265256588072122,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,Reel Life Gothic,"Every time I go to L.A., which isn't too often, I look at these palm-bemused, once smart stucco facades, and wonder if a Norma Desmond from a later era might be hiding from the world inside them, buttressed by cable TV (AMC or TCM, no doubt), a poodle named FiFi or Sir Francis, walk-in closets full of leopard-print Capri pants that haven't fit in decades, and a world class liquor cabinet that has seen heads of state under the table on a good night. It is because of Sunset Blvd., for certain, that my mind could ever go there. It is one of the most indelible films you will ever see.This film is great for many reasons, not the least of which is because it is Hollywood's first look back at itself. In the milieu of this film, the silent era is only 22 years behind us. The people left behind by the rush to sound can still palpably TASTE the fame, the accolade, that particular past being not so very dim and distant.

10.0,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,"This is such a great film on so many levels I can't really settle on where to begin. It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film's history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note. If that weren't enough, there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era). What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back. To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don't often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): ""...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces"", I'd like to also add that they ""didn't need movies; they had films.""They truly don't make them like this anymore. 10/10",they dont make em like this anymore,this is such great film so many levels i cant really settle where begin it is so beautifully shot that stark black white that only nitrate negative could achieve has witty clever extremely well written script features some best acting films history acrobatically balances main plot subplots with expert precision contains some best characters celluloid has many true life parallels swansons career real life cameos demilles involvement etc is peppered with such great dialogue narration that todays film writers should take note if that werent enough theres even cameo by silent film great buster keaton among others one most appealing aspects this film is how story aging forgotten star is trying recapture bygone era silent film era whats interesting is that now so many years later were looking back at her looking back present day viewers gloria swanson 1950s is long forgotten lost gem experience her own longing 1920s is especially captivating little chilling i might add i dont think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal todays audiences we all know that nothing lasts forever but we dont often consider abandoned participants much like veterans past war response famous swanson line while watching one her silent films we didnt need dialogue we had faces id like also add that they didnt need movies they had films they truly dont make them like this anymore 10 10,0.47277777777777785,0.24120370370370361,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,The Wild Roller-coaster of Fame,"In many ways Sunset Boulevard is like the reverse side of the coin of A Star Is Born. In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom. Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world, she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car, Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations, little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice, he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well, but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air, drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part, but at the last minute he said no, feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden, God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past, Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband. Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it, he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it, but can't leave it. When he does, it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together. Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille, but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him, he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done, but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond. I'm sure Billy Wilder wanted to move on to other projects. Still that would have been a film to see.",wild roller coaster fame,many ways sunset boulevard is like reverse side coin star is born that film we have young vicki lester going through all travails heartache before achieving her goal movie stardom sunset boulevard is reverse star is born has its tragic figure norman maine who commits suicide rather than face being has been sunset boulevard we have character norma desmond who has not taken that route she lacks nothing material world she wisely saved invested her money but acclaim audience is drug she craves shes been at top celebrity roller coaster now is at bottom into her life comes joe gillis quite accidentally fleeing some repo men looking take his car gillis drives into garage what he thinks is deserted mansion it looks pretty run down outside gillis compares it house miss faversham great expectations little knowing how right he was billy wilder was casting genius though some ways he fell into cast he had gloria swanson was not his first choice he approached both mary pickford pola negri desmond role first gloria swanson who actually had made transition sound well but had gone stage radio since her success music air drew experiences many her colleagues at time she was cast sunset boulevard she had radio show out new york bill holden was sheer serendipity originally montgomery clift was do part but at last minute he said no feeling that this was similar part one he played heiress wilder then went through list contract leading men at paramount wilder saw something holden god bless him holden had done whole series what he termed smiling jim roles he was considered amiable non threatening leading man although he had done well role as psychotic killer dark past sunset boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as actor academy award nomination came with acclaim nancy olson erich von stroheim were nominated best supporting player categories as was swanson best actress von stroheim was another inspired choice his is strange part indeed he was desmonds first director silent films left his career behind take care her he was also her first husband sunset boulevard its time with code firmly place was brutal look at sexual needs middle aged woman before holden knows it hes giving up his life as aspiring screenwriter be kept gigolo he doesnt like it but cant leave it when he does it results tragedy nancy olson plays reader at paramount studios where holden is trying sell script she holden had good chemistry after this they did four more films together casting cecil b demille as himself was necessity who could play great demille but demille demille fact was former actor playwright at turn last century his autobiography demille lets us private joke he fact did direct many gloria swansons early silent films pet name he had her was young fella note that when norma desmond comes paramount lot see him he greets her with that same expression note that demille got plug his own film samson delilah which was production at same time it is set that film where swanson demille meet you will never forget finely etched characters sunset boulevard you can see it many times as ive done but if you see it only once you will have it burned your memory especially that last scene before newsreel cameras where swanson loses whatever sanity she has left she descends down stairs her mansion descends into comfort insanity ive often wondered should sequel have been done covering trial norma desmond im sure billy wilder wanted move other projects still that would have been film see,0.4239839762227822,0.1487333354870668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Living In The Past,"The advent of the talkies created possibly the biggest-ever upheaval in the history of Hollywood and the impact it had on the careers of a large number of the industry's popular stars at that time was enormous. Many whose voices seemed unacceptable because they were incompatible with their image or because of a heavy foreign accent, found themselves out of work as did others who were simply unable to adapt to the demands of the new era. Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" provides a fascinating insight into some of the more ruthless and unpleasant facets of the Hollywood system in a style that's witty, cynical and realistic and also features a number of actors whose careers were profoundly affected by the arrival of the talkies.Joe Gillis (William Holden), a struggling Hollywood screenwriter with more debts than he can handle becomes involved in a high-speed chase when he tries to avoid the attentions of a couple of guys who are intent on repossessing his car. When one of his tyres blows out, he swiftly turns into the driveway of a run down mansion and successfully evades his pursuers. After parking his vehicle in the garage, he's surprised that the occupants of the mansion seem to be expecting him. It soon transpires that they'd assumed that he was the mortician who was due to deliver a coffin in which the lady of the house's dead chimpanzee was to be buried. Joe recognises the lady as Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) a former silent movie star.When Norma discovers that Joe's a writer, she seeks his opinion of a script she'd written for her comeback movie (""Salome"") and then hires him to edit her work. In his financial circumstances the offer of this lucrative job is too good to refuse and at her request, he agrees to stay at her mansion to complete the task. Joe recognises that Norma is a delusional has-been who lives in the past and discovers that the fan mail she receives every week is actually written by her devoted butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim). The very wealthy Norma buys Joe expensive new suits and coats and together they watch her old movies a few times each week. Even more bizarrely, on New Year's Eve, she holds a party at which there's an orchestra but no other guests! Joe feels he needs to escape from Norma who's obviously fallen in love with him and so goes to a friend's party instead.Artie Green (Jack Webb) agrees for Joe to stay over at his place and Joe soon gets into conversation with Artie's girlfriend, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen). Joe already knew Betty who worked as a script reader for Paramount and the two of them subsequently start to work together on one of Joe's unfinished scripts. When Norma discovers what's going on, she becomes incensed and determined to bring their association to an end.The most striking feature of ""Sunset Boulevard"" is its sharp dialogue and numerous quotable lines which vary from the purely witty to the deeply sardonic. The fact that these lines are delivered by a screenwriter and a particularly flamboyant retired actress makes their exchanges seem perfectly credible as both characters would naturally have developed a way with words during their careers.The film's opening scene in which Joe is seen dead and face down in Norma's swimming pool is brilliantly shot and the off-beat device of having a dead man narrating the story is typical of the cynicism and dark humour that runs through everything that follows. At this point, when objectively talking about himself, Joe in typical style remarks ""the poor dope. He always wanted a pool.

,very special look at Hollywood,"Not a romanticised view of Tinseltown at all, this Billy Wilder movie was more or less ignored on release - the year that All About Eve took all the awards and the kudos. It is a bitter pill to swallow since it takes a kick at Hollywood's guts and has one of the bleakest endings in the whole of cinema.Joe Gillis, a struggling writer, finds himself in the drive of a Hollywood palazzo when he wants somewhere to hide his car. The house belongs to Norma Desmond, who 'used to be big' in pictures, and Joe gets drawn to Norma and drawn into her weird world of flickering shadows.The acting honours in this movie go squarely to Gloria Swanson, herself a 'star of yesteryear' as Norma, who is superb as the actress living in the past. Not that she plays Norma as exclusively tragic(the scene where she impersonates Chaplin is priceless) but perhaps no one could get to grips with the demands of this part better. William Holden plays Joe, his breakthrough role, and he does the part very well, while Erich von Stroheim plays faded Hollywood director Max von Mayerling (naturally a reflection of himself), and newcomer Nancy Olson plays Betty, a girl too nice to become submerged just yet in dreamland's poison.The script is its moments of OTT-ness, but it is never less than interesting and draws in the viewer to the point when you are with Norma when she visits her old studio and talks of the joy of coming home; you are with Joe and Nancy as they fall in love among the cardboard settings of movie sets; and you are in the hall with Hedda Hopper watching Norma's last descent into madness. The musical version which appeared in the 1990s had the heart and soul of this movie in mind, and was an excellent tribute to it.",very special look at hollywood,not romanticised view tinseltown at all this billy wilder movie was more or less ignored release year that all about eve took all awards kudos it is bitter pill swallow since it takes kick at hollywoods guts has one bleakest endings whole cinema joe gillis struggling writer finds himself drive hollywood palazzo when he wants somewhere hide his car house belongs norma desmond who used be big pictures joe gets drawn norma drawn into her weird world flickering shadows acting honours this movie go squarely gloria swanson herself star yesteryear as norma who is superb as actress living past not that she plays norma as exclusively tragic scene where she impersonates chaplin is priceless but perhaps no one could get grips with demands this part better william holden plays joe his breakthrough role he does part very well while erich von stroheim plays faded hollywood director max von mayerling naturally reflection himself newcomer nancy olson plays betty girl too nice become submerged just yet dreamlands poison script is its moments ott ness but it is never less than interesting draws viewer point when you are with norma when she visits her old studio talks joy coming home you are with joe nancy as they fall love among cardboard settings movie sets you are hall with hedda hopper watching normas last descent into madness musical version which appeared 1990s had heart soul this movie mind was excellent tribute it,0.4497142857142857,0.23923809523809528,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,"Says Holden: ""I sure drove into an interesting driveway...""","WILLIAM HOLDEN really hits his stride in the role of Joe Gillis, the down-on-his-heels writer who just happens to be drowning in debt before he comes upon a secluded and decaying mansion that is about to change his life. Wilder's script gives him plenty of opportunity to shine. His typically witty quip to servant Erich Von Stroheim is: ""I sure drove into an interesting driveway"" (after realizing Swanson intends to hold a funeral for her pet monkey). It's the kind of remark that stays with you through the entire story.Holden inhabits the role so perfectly that we can be thankful Montgomery Clift turned down the role at the last moment. And the screenplay by Billy Wilder provides plenty of other cynical and observant wise cracks that give his character of Joe Gillis such depth, conviction and truth.And, of course, GLORIA SWANSON, as Norma Desmond, in what has to be regarded as her film swansong (she did very little thereafter), is every inch the faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination, inflating her ego with self-important phrases like: ""It's the pictures that got small."" With her cat-like eyes and claw-like hand gestures, she gets every nuance out of a role that is theatrical and larger than life, right up to the fantastic ending. One can almost sense why Andrew Lloyd Webber would fashion this into a terrific Broadway musical.Her meeting with Cecil B. DeMille on the set of a Paramount costume epic is priceless for the way it is written and played. When, at the conclusion of the film, she says: ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille"", it's a truly poignant moment.All of the supporting players are excellent, including NANCY OLSON, as the writer girlfriend that Holden shields from the truth until that final scene where he invites her to come over to the Sunset Blvd. mansion and exposes the sordid truth of his relationship with Swanson.As the man servant who is Swanson's loyal protector and was once Swanson's first husband and director of her early films, ERICH VON STROHEIM easily matches Holden and Swanson with a fine characterization of the patiently devoted butler.Swanson plays the demented star like a more glamorous version of Miss Havisham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, the woman who lived among the cobwebs because of a bitter disappointment when a lover jilted her on her wedding day. And like Miss Havisham, she refuses to deal with the reality of her situation when the going gets rough--as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at the studios any more, they were only interested in her antique auto.Some old time Hollywoodians get some cameos (Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor, especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed, written, directed and acted, this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script, it mixes film noir, black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&W photography, that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration, the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor. Summing up: Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward, eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool, is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note: Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism, disdain and self-loathing. He should have won an Oscar here.",says holden i sure drove into interesting driveway,william holden really hits his stride role joe gillis down his heels writer who just happens be drowning debt before he comes upon secluded decaying mansion that is about change his life wilders script gives him plenty opportunity shine his typically witty quip servant erich von stroheim is i sure drove into interesting driveway after realizing swanson intends hold funeral her pet monkey its kind remark that stays with you through entire story holden inhabits role so perfectly that we can be thankful montgomery clift turned down role at last moment screenplay by billy wilder provides plenty other cynical observant wise cracks that give his character joe gillis such depth conviction truth course gloria swanson as norma desmond what has be regarded as her film swansong she did very little thereafter is every inch faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination inflating her ego with self important phrases like its pictures that got small with her cat like eyes claw like hand gestures she gets every nuance out role that is theatrical larger than life right up fantastic ending one can almost sense why andrew lloyd webber would fashion this into terrific broadway musical her meeting with cecil b demille set paramount costume epic is priceless way it is written played when at conclusion film she says im ready my close up mr demille its truly poignant moment all supporting players are excellent including nancy olson as writer girlfriend that holden shields truth until that final scene where he invites her come over sunset blvd mansion exposes sordid truth his relationship with swanson as man servant who is swansons loyal protector was once swansons first husband director her early films erich von stroheim easily matches holden swanson with fine characterization patiently devoted butler swanson plays demented star like more glamorous version miss havisham great expectations woman who lived among cobwebs because bitter disappointment when lover jilted her her wedding day like miss havisham she refuses deal with reality her situation when going gets rough as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at studios any more they were only interested her antique auto some old time hollywoodians get some cameos buster keaton h b warner which give film added interest even hedda hopper is scene as brusque hollywood reporter all technical details are perfect franz waxmans score has salome like flavor especially toward end when swanson is full throes her delusions expertly photographed written directed acted this is film that has be watched closely fully appreciate every detail with its superior script it mixes film noir black comedy dark melodrama with nice blend shadowy noir b w photography that has that paramount sheen viewer is immediately drawn into story which gets off brilliant start with holdens brittle narration kind that strips all phoniness away any hollywood pretension glamor summing up highly recommended mature adults holdens corpse floating face downward eyes open water lighted swimming pool is stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream swansons brief moment mimicking charlie chaplin is priceless trivia note holdens performance is right target perfect degree cynicism disdain self loathing he should have won oscar here,0.587685760294456,0.2477280308258569,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,She Doesn't Want To Be Alone,"""Sunset Blvd."" is the funniest movie ever made about the saddest of human conditions, loneliness.Struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) bounces around Hollywood like a pinball, flipped at every turn by the big wheels who ignore his attempts to latch onto their world. Only the repo men want his company. Then he finds himself in the mansion of forgotten screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), decked out as a memorial to someone not yet dead. Norma believes the world awaits her return (""I hate that word,"" she says of ""comeback""). In her effort to elude time's heartless march, she abandons sanity and bids Joe join her.Billy Wilder's film is a satire of Hollywood with a nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh's ""The Loved One"" (Norma initially assumes Joe is here to help bury her pet chimp). As a satire it scores points, but it's as a twisted love story that it makes its mark as a cinematic masterpiece. Norma fantasizes about her comeback, but it's her love of Joe that destroys her. Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo, but I think he's always carrying that dislike around, his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that, more than Norma, serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy, both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs, whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop (""As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?"") or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work, letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis, and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness, of course, in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in ""Young Frankenstein,"" she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy, or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again, in her unreleased ""Queen Kelly"") shows a retrained, luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen, it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull, especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her, like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim, a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home), keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe, or addresses her imagined audience, it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo, she most emphatically does not want to be alone, and we can't help but like her for it.""Sunset Blvd."" makes a subtle, brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film, but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting.",she doesnt want be alone,sunset blvd is funniest movie ever made about saddest human conditions loneliness struggling screenwriter joe gillis william holden bounces around hollywood like pinball flipped at every turn by big wheels who ignore his attempts latch onto their world only repo men want his company then he finds himself mansion forgotten screen legend norma desmond gloria swanson decked out as memorial someone not yet dead norma believes world awaits her return i hate that word she says comeback her effort elude times heartless march she abandons sanity bids joe join her billy wilders film is satire hollywood with nod direction evelyn waughs loved one norma initially assumes joe is here help bury her pet chimp as satire it scores points but its as twisted love story that it makes its mark as cinematic masterpiece norma fantasizes about her comeback but its her love joe that destroys her everyone talks about joes self loathing as foregone conclusion his finding himself normas presence turning himself into gigolo but i think hes always carrying that dislike around his self inflicted price failing achieve what he wants life prison loneliness every bit as desolate as normas mansion one might wonder what extent that more than norma serves as his ruin its also marvelous black comedy both tone out out belly laughs whether its joe getting unsolicited advice mens clothing shop as long as lady is paying it why not take vicuna or his narrating how gentle people get with person after hes dead holdens especially great his voice over work letting every line stick with just right amount emphasis no hint actorliness swansons all actorliness course that magnificent way hers which provides so much empathy madcap zaniness film like gene wilder young frankenstein she draws you with her amazing eyes makes you laugh cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts its comic showcase one not known comedy or working sound was norma always this affected glimpse her one her old movies swanson again her unreleased queen kelly shows retrained luminous presence not at all like norma we meet story if this norma played anyone silent screen it would have more likely been nosferatu just watch those hands hers twist pull especially when shes drawing joe deeper her web norma doesnt mean harm joe she just has no idea how real relationships work her like mad max her butler erich von stroheim curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives point home keeping people around is all that keeps her chasm despair when she talks joe or addresses her imagined audience its not with coldness user but real heart soul unlike garbo she most emphatically does not want be alone we cant help but like her it sunset blvd makes subtle brilliant case that staving off loneliness such degree makes sickness all its own im not sure whether or not thats most depressing thing about film but it certainly adds power its singular sting,0.5826430224867725,0.17005208333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,"""Who wants real? Who wants moving?""","With a medium like cinema, which had such a distinct and holistic culture all of its own, it is bound sooner or later to lose itself in nostalgia. Either that or cynical self-parody. Sunset Boulevard is not about the way motion pictures were – it is about the way motion picture people were, and continued to be.Indeed, the style of Sunset Boulevard was the very epitome of modern film-making – voice-over narration, fluid camera-work, crisp cinematography. These contemporary trappings really serve to deepen the contrast and sharpen the disrespectful onslaught upon the olden days. Take the protagonist voice-over, something writers Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett really made an art of. It may often be functional, cutting corners in the narrative or elucidating on screen events, but more often than not it is superfluous to the story, and acts as a kind of enjoyably wry commentary on proceedings. It's a stylistic layer as much as the overstuffed set design and chiaroscuro lighting.Director Billy Wilder is often said (by Ed Sikov for example) to be someone who ""does not call attention to the shot"". On the contrary, he actually constantly grabs us with the images. While he was never fond of obvious trickery, Wilder loves the weirdness of natural effects – such as Swanson's face skull-like in her sunglasses, or the close-up on her spinning parasol which begins the bathing beauties routine. He is great at filling the shot with ""clues"" and reminders, bringing them to our attention at the right moment – such as those holes in the doors where the locks should be, which a line in the dialogue has made us associate with suicide attempts.But this is really a movie about stars, and central to Sunset Boulevard is the performance by Gloria Swanson. It was incredibly brave of Swanson to play such a brazen caricature of the kind of woman she could have become. But she brings all her long-standing talent and the knowledge of experience into the role. Norma Desmond is as much a creation of Swanson as she is of Wilder and Brackett. She has the kind of sleek, animalistic movement of a silent-era vamp, but tinges it with a frank depiction of middle-aged indignity. Her acting may be exaggerated and far from realistic, but remember she is playing a woman for whom life has become an act. Swanson is hammy because hamminess is real for that character. She clearly knew exactly what she was doing and what the pictures was about. Compare that to DeMille, who really had no sense of irony, and it's amazing he agreed to appear here. His performance is assuredly naturalistic (and ironically far better than most of what passes for acting in his own pictures), although that is also perfect for the part he plays here – being himself! Whether or not he had agreed to appear, DeMille would have been a central figure to this story. He was really the sole survivor of the silent era; the only individual – star, producer or director – from that time who was still a top dog. And although Sunset Boulevard sets its sights on the Hollywood of yesteryear, it was really the Hollywood of 1950 that Wilder and Brackett were gunning for. Like Norma Desmond, the post-war industry had passed its heyday and was really living off the receipts of its past glories. The studio system was crumbling, and TV was encroaching on its territory just as sound had encroached on Norma's thirty years earlier. It was now the more modest productions by younger, free-spirited filmmakers – productions like Sunset Boulevard itself – that were beginning to rise to the surface.",who wants real who wants moving,with medium like cinema which had such distinct holistic culture all its own it is bound sooner or later lose itself nostalgia either that or cynical self parody sunset boulevard is not about way motion pictures were it is about way motion picture people were continued be indeed style sunset boulevard was very epitome modern film making voice over narration fluid camera work crisp cinematography these contemporary trappings really serve deepen contrast sharpen disrespectful onslaught upon olden days take protagonist voice over something writers billy wilder charles brackett really made art it may often be functional cutting corners narrative or elucidating screen events but more often than not it is superfluous story acts as kind enjoyably wry commentary proceedings its stylistic layer as much as overstuffed set design chiaroscuro lighting director billy wilder is often said by ed sikov example be someone who does not call attention shot contrary he actually constantly grabs us with images while he was never fond obvious trickery wilder loves weirdness natural effects such as swansons face skull like her sunglasses or close up her spinning parasol which begins bathing beauties routine he is great at filling shot with clues reminders bringing them our attention at right moment such as those holes doors where locks should be which line dialogue has made us associate with suicide attempts but this is really movie about stars central sunset boulevard is performance by gloria swanson it was incredibly brave swanson play such brazen caricature kind woman she could have become but she brings all her long standing talent knowledge experience into role norma desmond is as much creation swanson as she is wilder brackett she has kind sleek animalistic movement silent era vamp but tinges it with frank depiction middle aged indignity her acting may be exaggerated far realistic but remember she is playing woman whom life has become act swanson is hammy because hamminess is real that character she clearly knew exactly what she was doing what pictures was about compare that demille who really had no sense irony its amazing he agreed appear here his performance is assuredly naturalistic ironically far better than most what passes acting his own pictures although that is also perfect part he plays here being himself whether or not he had agreed appear demille would have been central figure this story he was really sole survivor silent era only individual star producer or director that time who was still top dog although sunset boulevard sets its sights hollywood yesteryear it was really hollywood 1950 that wilder brackett were gunning like norma desmond post war industry had passed its heyday was really living off receipts its past glories studio system was crumbling tv was encroaching its territory just as sound had encroached normas thirty years earlier it was now more modest productions by younger free spirited filmmakers productions like sunset boulevard itself that were beginning rise surface,0.4667006802721088,0.19312925170068024,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Right up there with Citizen Kane,"Brilliant film that is easily Wilder's best. A true classic that deserves to be ranked alongside Citizen Kane. And comparing the 2 films in terms of acting, atmosphere, dialog, conflict, symbolism, and theme (to say nothing of depth): Sunset Boulevard surpasses Kane. The ending is unforgettable and ironic:Max gets to direct, Norma makes a ""comeback"" before the cameras, and Joe has a story, his own. Like Kane, Sunset Boulevard begins with the end. The first shot is of the gutter with the film's title printed on the curb,and the first shot of Joe floating lifelessly in Norma's pool shows us he has sunk even lower: the film proceeds to show us how he got there.Sunset Boulevard is about the march of time:what time and technology does to people and what happens to those who don't or can't keep in step. And like Norma, the new Hollywood seems to be leaving Joe behind. The 2 cars in Norma's garage represent an unspoken bond between Joe and Norma; except for those cars the outside world has little use for these two. The finance company wants to repossess Joe's car and Paramount wants to use Norma's for a film.The acting is unsurpassable;the dialog and narration memorable, and the atmosphere in that decaying mansion is palpable. One of those films, like Kane, that improves with repeated viewings. Endlessly brilliant.

8.0,Hollywood & Sunset,"Widely heralded as a classic upon its initial release, the Billy Wilder-Charles Brackett production, Sunset Boulevard, is a superb piece of work in nearly all departments; and yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings. This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. As a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones, notably Erich von Stroheim's butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness, as the insane Norma Desmond, while superficially credible, has no inner life, or even a hint of one, as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo, Joe Gillis, is believable as a hustler but seems, in his narration and occasional asides, to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters, in other words, go through their motions, as the plot dictates; and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at, they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people; an immoral 'moral tale', it sometimes leaves a bad taste.For all its flaws, though, the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is magnificent, larger than life, and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless, and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland, boy next door types, and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far, and made Holden overnight a hot property, and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry, almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and, especially, narration; his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals; and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression, put him immediately into the major leagues. Sunset Boulevard does not in the end tell us more about Hollywood than the Selznick-Wellman A Star Is Born, but it does its job better, with pungent dialogue, brilliant acting and a sense of style rare in movies of the time and unheard of today.",hollywood sunset,widely heralded as classic upon its initial release billy wilder charles brackett production sunset boulevard is superb piece work nearly all departments yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings this is not easy movie love people it are unsympathetic as leading male character is hack screenwriter turned gigolo woman he lives with is mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes this third rate writers ability write her comeback picture neither is amiable sort but he is at least sane though he has understanding decency he never quite achieves it his goal is success that he decieves two women who care him deeply bothers him time time when it is inconvenience but doesnt otherwise seem bedevil him or prey his thoughts as cynical picture postwar hollywood movie is flawless it captures moment when studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at start its decline secondary characters are more likeable than major ones notably erich von stroheims butler yet film is not satisfying portrait mental illness as insane norma desmond while superficially credible has no inner life or even hint one as her demons appear come more her neglect by others than anything do with herself her gigolo joe gillis is believable as hustler but seems his narration occasional asides be brighter wittier than his behavior suggests characters other words go through their motions as plot dictates while they are very interesting what they do or fail at they seem have no life outside story this is movie about hollywood rather than people immoral moral tale it sometimes leaves bad taste all its flaws though movie works like charm even when it is not itself charming as norma desmond gloria swanson is magnificent larger than life every inch former silent movie queen she plays picture her final scene is priceless best shot movie william holden made new career himself thanks sunset boulevard over decade he had been playing rather bland boy next door types his work here was revelation joe gillis was his best performance thus far made holden overnight hot property shortly thereafter biggest male star business his dry almost affectless midwestern delivery dialogue especially narration his mixture good manners ambivilant morals his ability command screen with flicker expression put him immediately into major leagues sunset boulevard does not end tell us more about hollywood than selznick wellman star is born but it does its job better with pungent dialogue brilliant acting sense style rare movies time unheard today,0.5019550342130988,0.1560972629521017,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,The films that SHOULD have won Oscar for Best Picture: 1951,"This was the first of Billy Wilder's work I've even seen, sure I've heard of him, just not seen any of his movies. Made in the fifty's ""Sunset Blvd."" is simply timeless & it's easy to see why this movie of a washed up writer/ turned gigolo to a washed-up has-been actress is rated so highly. A superb indictment of everything that's wrong and distasteful about Hollywood and probably even truer now that it actually was when it was made. This film is also crammed with in-jokes and references that practically beg for multiple viewings. The acting by everyone is perfect & this movie is such a wonder to behold.DVD Extras: Audio commentary with author of ""On Sunset Boulevard: The Life And Times Of Billy Wilder"" Ed Sikov ; Three featureless (""The Making Of Sunset Boulevard""; ""The Music Of Sundet Boulevard"", and ""Edith Head: The Paramount Years"") ;Morgue prologue; ""Hollywood Location"" map;Photo galleries; Theatrical trailerMy Grade: A+",films that should have won oscar best picture 1951,this was first billy wilders work ive even seen sure ive heard him just not seen any his movies made fiftys sunset blvd is simply timeless its easy see why this movie washed up writer turned gigolo washed up has been actress is rated so highly superb indictment everything thats wrong distasteful about hollywood probably even truer now that it actually was when it was made this film is also crammed with jokes references that practically beg multiple viewings acting by everyone is perfect this movie is such wonder behold dvd extras audio commentary with author sunset boulevard life times billy wilder ed sikov three featureless making sunset boulevard music sundet boulevard edith head paramount years morgue prologue hollywood location map photo galleries theatrical trailermy grade,0.49376417233560094,0.2273809523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
