7,Rather enjoyable...,"Initially I sat down to watch the 2022 animated movie ""The Bad Guys"" with very little expectation. Why? Well, because I wasn't sure what I was getting into here, aside from it being an animated movie that my son wanted to watch. But with it being an animated movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to watch it with my son.I will say that writers Etan Cohen, Yoni Brenner and Hilary Winston actually put together a good storyline. Now, I am not familiar with the books that the movie is based on, so how true it is to the source material, I cannot tell you. But I found the storyline in ""The Bad Guys"" to actually be well-written and enjoyable, as well as being entertaining.The character gallery is what worked so well for me here. I really took a liking to the characters in the story right away, and they are as colorful as they are memorable. Not only did they manage to paint a gallery of interesting characters, but they definitely also had a great voice acting cast ensemble to bring the characters to life.The animation and art style used in director Pierre Perifel's 2022 animated movie ""The Bad Guys"" was good. I liked the drawing and art style quite a lot, as it was very dynamic, and had a slight comic book feel to it.The voice cast in ""The Bad Guys"" was nicely cast with some great voice actors on the cast list, with the likes of Awkwafina, Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Craig Robinson, Anthony Ramos and more.If you enjoy animted movies, then you certainly should sit down to watch ""The Bad Guys"". I was genuinely entertained by this animated movie, and it one that I will warmly recommend.My rating of ""The Bad Guys"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",rather enjoyable,initially i sat down watch 2022 animated movie bad guys with very little expectation why well because i wasnt sure what i was getting into here aside it being animated movie that my son wanted watch but with it being animated movie that i hadnt already seen course i opted watch it with my son i will say that writers etan cohen yoni brenner hilary winston actually put together good storyline now i am not familiar with books that movie is based so how true it is source material i cannot tell you but i found storyline bad guys actually be well written enjoyable as well as being entertaining character gallery is what worked so well me here i really took liking characters story right away they are as colorful as they are memorable not only did they manage paint gallery interesting characters but they definitely also had great voice acting cast ensemble bring characters life animation art style used director pierre perifels 2022 animated movie bad guys was good i liked drawing art style quite lot as it was very dynamic had slight comic book feel it voice cast bad guys was nicely cast with some great voice actors cast list with likes awkwafina sam rockwell marc maron craig robinson anthony ramos more if you enjoy animted movies then you certainly should sit down watch bad guys i was genuinely entertained by this animated movie it one that i will warmly recommend my rating bad guys lands seven out ten stars,0.5257839721254356,0.1363651761517615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,"Surprisingly, It's Not That Bad, Guys","LIKES:The Pace: Kid's movies are always entertaining and this movie has all the engaging pieces I like at the speed that is entertaining. Kids will surely love the hasty pace of the film, dazzling you with all the quick paced adventure and comedy that comes with it. Yet, the pace is not breakneck, capable of still giving plenty of time to storytelling and allowing the older audience members to enjoy the movie as well. It really is a fine-balanced movie on this part and wins points for me.The Voice Acting: These actors give me chills at what they can pull out of their vocal patterns, and The Bad Guys crew is loaded with wonderful performances that fit the bill quite well. Sam Rockwell nails the lead role well, and I feel he did a great job playing the conflicted ""hero"" who has a lot of soul searching to find. Marc Maron as Snake is stellar, another loaded gun that has his own turmoil to face, but yet holds the sass and vigor of someone who is ingrained in his ways. The two feel very much like the best friends they portray, and I love the ribbing and vigor they have. As for Awkwafina, a bit more of the prop character, the actress normally loaded with comedy craziness, was actually toned down and respectable, still not too out of her comfort zone, but a much more well-rounded performance. Others hit their marks quite well, and if I had more room, I would go into everyone, but the chemistry between them all is fantastic and really a solid pillar to which this group works.The Character Balance: You've got at least five characters to work into a crime/comedy, and that's not counting a few other characters that have their own involvement in the film. And like a good book, this film does it super well with the characters that they promoted. Each of the animals may not have all the equal time, but they stand out in unique ways, bring their gifts to the table, and provide a meaningful contribution to the film. You, and the younger audiences, will find a character that they absolutely enjoy, and you will get your fill of them in almost every way. The use of each group is fantastic for me, and I appreciate how just about every character had that purpose and meaning to their inclusion.The Comedy: While a bit juvenile at times, the movie's humor is very fun and appropriate for the family. A witty phrase by a guinea pig, the fickle nature of human trends, even just a perfect phrasing that is comedic gold. The Bad Guys uses it all well and mixes things up to stay fresh, exciting, and filled with variety, all while baking it in naturally and not trying to force it in your face. That's right, you don't have to worry about a catchphrase being repeated like crazy, well mostly, and for that, DreamWorks wins the victory for me on the comedy, even if it is not the most mature, clever, or downright unique.' The Plot: Much like a good book, The Bad Guys wins points again for a book adaptation that felt fleshed out, complete, and again fun. The Bad Guys starts off in the simple aspect you expect it to, high adrenaline comedy crime, and boasting about it afterwards. Soon, the plot starts to dig into deeper into other elements, trying to give more insight into the morals and characters and trying to twist the plot into new directions. And yet... they never drop the foundation of the movie, keeping those involvements and making the story wrap together nicely and feel organic. It's engaging, it's fun, and again it works on multiple levels, with a great performance to again amplify the tale to a quality I like.It's Adventure: What do I like highly about this film? It's that it's an adventure film that finally goes back into escaping from the reality of the world, but still teaches a moral lesson. Like the animated films I grew up with, The Bad Guys finally takes me on the adventure and story I like, instead of getting stuck in check boxes and personal issues to make a realistic story. By finally taking a detour back into the world of fun and adventure, the excitement and entertainment stand strong and I had fun watching an animated film. Sure, it's no Oscar tear jerker, but given the style and escape from all the political stuff that's in your face, it excels amazingly in this aspect.The Animation: I know, it does not look real, it does not look fully fleshed out, and you probably have other CGI focused movies that do things better. However, the Bad guys has a nice unique modality that stands out from the usual manners of making animation come to life. The kids book style is really popping, and the way they make the group come to life is sensational for this reviewer. The theft scenes are just an opening, and the movie does a great job pushing the limits of this style and really giving you a comic book meets story mode and I loved almost every second of it. In fact, this might be one of the best action scenes I have seen in a long time, proving again with imagination, some guts, and some balance, you can get excitement back in these movies. Nice work on the style and pizazz with your animation my friends, for it succeeded big time for this reviewer.DISLIKES:Predictable: I did not even know the movie series was based on books, but I have not read them and was still able to decipher all the twists within the first twenty-five minutes. Sadly, the book is not geared for major surprises, it could have used them to spice things up. At the least, they could have avoided the obvious set up that they did, instead of just giving everything away.More Action: With all the things this movie did, I had hoped to see a little more of that factor I really loved. The Bad Guys could have used a few more crime attempts, maybe some plans, or adding a little more of the Ocean's 13 element they were going for. Even some of the less violent oriented moments could have used some more time, but this is relatively minor to the other two elements I wanted in this movie.More Time with Some of The Characters: As I said, the cast of characters have their inclusion, but there seemed to be more they could have done with them in the final project. Perhaps this problem is addressed in the books, but several of the other characters needed time to get their own edge and quirks out, other than just being comedic ploys. Shark in particular was funny and has some moments, but there was a lot more potential to work with to make him more than just the comedic punching bag he is. Piranha and Tarantula have a little more ironing out, but again, there is more there, which might be addressed in future installments.Too Much Revealed in The Trailers: Modern day advertising is both impressive and destructive at the same time. The Bad Guys is one of those moments that gives a lot of the plot away second to the copious number of things they give in the trailer. Though it does not dilute the fun, it did cost me several laughs at the jokes they wanted to hold and in all honesty the surprises they wanted to share. This is probably the biggest thing to take away from the movie for me, but if you avoid the trailers then you are good.The VERDICT:In this case, being Bad is so Good and I really had a wonderful time with this movie and the endeavors they built for us. With great cast, music and voice acting the movie already had the elements to be a decent film, however making a story with good animation really sent this movie to new heights for me. It's got pizazz, it breaks from the realistic movie moments that are the hot trend, and it does it so in a natural style that again was just fun. It's totally worth the trip to the theater to see, or at least to enjoy when it arrives on streaming in a few weeks. Sure, the movie is predictable, lots of things ruining from the trailers and still has some smoothing out to do. Overall, though, I definitely give this movie a big thumbs up and approve the film for so many.My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall 7.5.",surprisingly its not that bad

7,The Bad Guys taught us one thing; never judge a film by its trailer/poster.,"Low expectations were what I had when the trailer first appeared on my phone screen. I wasn't even interested to watch it 'till the end. I would roll my eyes on the animation style, it's not eye-catching nor it is impressive.But damnnnnnnn! I wasn't expecting it to be good. It's a feature animated film filled with genuine laughter, comical characters and an above the par plot.The caper team consists of Wolf, Tarantula, Piranha, Snake and Shark, all of which play a different archetype from one another. This team of 5 is evil and yet, you might find that their personalities are very likable, charming and even approachable. This is the heart of the film, the element that keeps the audience entertained aside from its narrative.Ocean's 8 meets Zootopia, this is what The Bad Guys is. You may find the first heist somewhat similar to the all-women Ocean's. There's the restrooms, kitchen tray trolleys, red-carpet staircases, hackings (pretty much every heist film), red laser traps, all of which resemble strongly with the mega heist of the Met Gala in the said film. I found TBG better than Zootopia, which I PERSONALLY found it to be overrated. However, those who love Zootopia will also enjoy TBG as it implies similitude to it.Running for over 100 minutes, The Bad Guys never stops with its steady pacing, putting audience in an enjoyable ride from start until the end.Lo and behold, you wouldn't expect how many twists they are in this. It's a plot twist on top of another plot twist. Just when you thought, there you go, they have revealed all the twists, the film comes in with another unexpected twist , showing that you have also been deceived by The Bad Guys. When you look back at it, it's amazing that all the twists don't come as a force, but rather it oozes naturally, making it a perfect fit to the whole story.The animation style is better than what I had visualized in my mind. Looking at the trailer, I thought it was mehh, but the pencil-like motion drawings got better as time went on. It took a bit of time to adjust but eventually, I liked it.On the other side of the cell, I believe that TBG should offer a larger team than mere 5 animals. It would have been so much fun, exciting and the stakes would be even higher!All the animal outlaws are excellent however, I must say, I'm a little disappointed with their back stories, because there is almost none to begin with. They did introduce each member in the beginning, but I wanted to know where all of them came from, how they can coexist and walk the earth with humans, and how the group was formed in the first place. I know, I'm aware this is an animated film but what a solid story they could have to an already excellent plot.Rounding up, The Bad Guys is definitely in my top 5 films of 2022 as we almost end the quarter of the year. Let's see what the future has in store for animated films!Verdict: If there is one thing The Bad Guys taught us, it's to never judge a film by its trailer.",bad guys taught us one thing never judge film by its trailer poster,low expectations were what i had when trailer first appeared my phone screen i wasnt even interested watch it till end i would roll my eyes animation style its not eye catching nor it is impressive but damnnnnnnn i wasnt expecting it be good its feature animated film filled with genuine laughter comical characters above par plot caper team consists wolf tarantula piranha snake shark all which play different archetype one another this team 5 is evil yet you might find that their personalities are very likable charming even approachable this is heart film element that keeps audience entertained aside its narrative oceans 8 meets zootopia this is what bad guys is you may find first heist somewhat similar all women oceans theres restrooms kitchen tray trolleys red carpet staircases hackings pretty much every heist film red laser traps all which resemble strongly with mega heist met gala said film i found tbg better than zootopia which i personally found it be overrated however those who love zootopia will also enjoy tbg as it implies similitude it running over 100 minutes bad guys never stops with its steady pacing putting audience enjoyable ride start until end lo behold you wouldnt expect how many twists they are this its plot twist top another plot twist just when you thought there you go they have revealed all twists film comes with another unexpected twist showing that you have also been deceived by bad guys when you look back at it its amazing that all twists dont come as force but rather it oozes naturally making it perfect fit whole story animation style is better than what i had visualized my mind looking at trailer i thought it was mehh but pencil like motion drawings got better as time went it took bit time adjust but eventually i liked it other side cell i believe that tbg should offer larger team than mere 5 animals it would have been so much fun exciting stakes would be even higher all animal outlaws are excellent however i must say im little disappointed with their back stories because there is almost none begin with they did introduce each member beginning but i wanted know where all them came how they can coexist walk earth with humans how group was formed first place i know im aware this is animated film but what solid story they could have already excellent plot rounding up bad guys is definitely my top 5 films 2022 as we almost end quarter year lets see what future has store animated films verdict if there is one thing bad guys taught us its never judge film by its trailer,0.5416666666666665,0.1699596774193549,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.22}"

8,"Fun, character driven movie that works, even if some faults are definitely there","This one, as another reviewer has already said , has wonderfully written characters (obviously - written and performed). It's not original - I couldn't care less - once again: originality as is, is overrated in my personal book. So despite obvious similarities with Zootopia I still enjoyed it wholeheartedly. Some of the plot twists can be spotted miles ahead - it doesn't matter. Once we got to know and like these lovely characters we just want to see the story through and know how it all ended for them. Only problem is - most of the climax of the movie doesn't really make sense. Or to put it simply, think it out carefully and you'll realize - it couldn't happen the way the movie explains it. I'd give it 10 stars if it was making sense. And then again - it's not as important as it could be in other movies.Must add some words regarding the cast. They're all wonderful but I can't avoid special mention for Sam Rockwell, it's not the first time I see him but I can promise from now on - I'll make it my business to notice him; Marc Maron is also superb as snake; Zazie Beetz is always unforgettable, and she does it again, and the exact same thing can be said of Awkwafina.To some it all up - if you don't have a special agenda against fun movies - you'll love this one.",fun character driven movie that works even if some faults are definitely there,this one as another reviewer has already said has wonderfully written characters obviously written performed its not original i couldnt care less once again originality as is is overrated my personal book so despite obvious similarities with zootopia i still enjoyed it wholeheartedly some plot twists can be spotted miles ahead it doesnt matter once we got know like these lovely characters we just want see story through know how it all ended them only problem is most climax movie doesnt really make sense or put it simply think it out carefully youll realize it couldnt happen way movie explains it id give it 10 stars if it was making sense then again its not as important as it could be other movies must add some words regarding cast theyre all wonderful but i cant avoid special mention sam rockwell its not first time i see him but i can promise now ill make it my business notice him marc maron is also superb as snake zazie beetz is always unforgettable she does it again exact same thing can be said awkwafina some it all up if you dont have special agenda against fun movies youll love this one,0.5839285714285714,0.24143282312925168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"

8,Surprisingly good,"I completely agree with the first reviewer: I had low expectation after seeing the trailer, too. But ""The Bad Guys"" turned out to be a very clever movie, well-made, with a sophisticated script, and fast-moving. Most importantly: It's not taking itself too seriously. I mean: A shark as a master of disguise!?I don't know (yet) the books on which this movie is based. Oviously the story is also inspired by the various Ocean's 8/ 11/ 12/ whatever-movies, but it is definitely an over-the-top-version of these caper movies. These movies always tried to be believable; ""the bad guys"" tries to be fun. And it succeeded in that!",surprisingly good,i completely agree with first reviewer i had low expectation after seeing trailer too but bad guys turned out be very clever movie well made with sophisticated script fast moving most importantly its not taking itself too seriously i mean shark as master disguise i dont know yet books which this movie is based oviously story is also inspired by various oceans 8 11 12 whatever movies but it is definitely over top version these caper movies these movies always tried be believable bad guys tries be fun it succeeded that,0.5752314814814814,0.13078703703703703,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10,A Return to Form from DreamWorks!,"The new DreamWorks film seems very ambitious and something that I have never seen from them before, which is crazy, so it's based on the wonderful book series by Aaron Blabey, along with a all star cast and directed by Pierre Perifel who worked on the Bilby short from the studio, most of their recent films have either been fun or mediocre, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World was the last DreamWorks film that was amazing with everything else in between being just not as strong and even forgettable, but with this there's definitely a lot of hype surrounding this film from the way it looks and the wacky sense of humour and I am very excited about this, I did read a few of the book in preparation for this film, so I saw it yesterday at a early preview or ""see it first"" if you will and..... no joke, this is the best DreamWorks film in years, I'm not kidding, this is exactly what I wanted and this is what I missed about their writing and style, so let's talk about it!The biggest praise I can give to this film is the animation is quite mind blowing (no pun intended), it seems to take inspiration from the likes of Spider-Verse, Mitchells Vs. The Machines, Zootropolis and even Captain Underpants too, it's stylistic, it's bright, fast, with so much great attention to detail, along with superb characters designs since the bad guys look so unique and expressive in all the right ways, it has the zany cartoon effects too, the animation really takes advantage of cell shading, but it also makes the characters stand out as being memorable and funny as well, all the characters are fantastic, I loved all of them my favourites would Be Mr. Wolf (Sam Rockwell) Mr. Snake (Marc Maron) Diane (Zazie Beetz) and Professor Marmalade (Richard Ayoade), even the minor characters one are funny as heck, but it's thanks to the cast who brings these characters to live in a unique way!, Sam Rockwell is just charming as Mr. Wolf, Richard Ayoade is always a pleasure hearing his voice in anything, the rest like Anthony Ramos, Awkwafina, Craig Robinson and more are all great and have distinct personalities, heck a lot of them are almost identical to the original source characters, the score by Daniel Pemberton is really outstanding in many ways by how cool and easy on the ears it is, of course he did the score for Spider-Verse so it makes sense to bring him to compose the music for this film, along with a soundtrack that I very much dig, the story maybe the same ol' villain might be hero story like Megamind or Despicable Me, but this at least tries to do it differently and even the conclusion is very satisfying!, so the filmmaking with this story is incredible, this film is the definition of laugh out loud, every moment and joke was funny, even the toilet humour was unique and purposeful to stand out and actually be funny, while also having a nice heart to it, I mean the bad guys are doing good after all, along with a few good twists even the ones you know will eventually come, the action is incredible and so much fun to watch along with creativity also, it's what anyone would want in a film like this!, although with a few changes, it still keeps some elements of the book afloat which is really nice with some nice references too.Guys what else can I say but this is nothing short of fantastic, the Bad Guys is the best DreamWorks film in a looooong time, it's definitely return to form in terms of well-written DreamWorks films!, it's stylistic, hilarious, new, unique, fun, visually wonderful and captures the spirit of the book rather well while bringing new elements to the world of the Bad Guys that'll make it more and more unique, along with excellent music and a strong cast of characters, I don't have any complaints at all, it's a perfect film for the family to watch, if you are a fan of the studio, see it today since it's early previews in the UK are still going or next week when it officially hits UK cinemas over here very soon, some of the other countries will have a wait a bit longer but it'll be worth it in the end, this is my favourite animated film of the year and one of the best films of the year also!, I'm happy to see a DreamWorks film that isn't in any way mediocre or boring, I loved this film so that I hope to see more of this and not more sequels, also Trolls related media.I'm happy to give The Bad Guys a 10/10!",return form dreamworks,new dreamworks film seems very ambitious something that i have never seen them before which is crazy so its based wonderful book series by aaron blabey along with all star cast directed by pierre perifel who worked bilby short studio most their recent films have either been fun or mediocre how train your dragon hidden world was last dreamworks film that was amazing with everything else between being just not as strong even forgettable but with this theres definitely lot hype surrounding this film way it looks wacky sense humour i am very excited about this i did read few book preparation this film so i saw it yesterday at early preview or see it first if you will no joke this is best dreamworks film years im not kidding this is exactly what i wanted this is what i missed about their writing style so lets talk about it biggest praise i can give this film is animation is quite mind blowing no pun intended it seems take inspiration likes spider verse mitchells vs machines zootropolis even captain underpants too its stylistic its bright fast with so much great attention detail along with superb characters designs since bad guys look so unique expressive all right ways it has zany cartoon effects too animation really takes advantage cell shading but it also makes characters stand out as being memorable funny as well all characters are fantastic i loved all them my favourites would be mr wolf sam rockwell mr snake marc maron diane zazie beetz professor marmalade richard ayoade even minor characters one are funny as heck but its thanks cast who brings these characters live unique way sam rockwell is just charming as mr wolf richard ayoade is always pleasure hearing his voice anything rest like anthony ramos awkwafina craig robinson more are all great have distinct personalities heck lot them are almost identical original source characters score by daniel pemberton is really outstanding many ways by how cool easy ears it is course he did score spider verse so it makes sense bring him compose music this film along with soundtrack that i very much dig story maybe same ol villain might be hero story like megamind or despicable me but this at least tries do it differently even conclusion is very satisfying so filmmaking with this story is incredible this film is definition laugh out loud every moment joke was funny even toilet humour was unique purposeful stand out actually be funny while also having nice heart it i mean bad guys are doing good after all along with few good twists even ones you know will eventually come action is incredible so much fun watch along with creativity also its what anyone would want film like this although with few changes it still keeps some elements book afloat which is really nice with some nice references too guys what else can i say but this is nothing short fantastic bad guys is best dreamworks film looooong time its definitely return form terms well written dreamworks films its stylistic hilarious new unique fun visually wonderful captures spirit book rather well while bringing new elements world bad guys thatll make it more more unique along with excellent music strong cast characters i dont have any complaints at all its perfect film family watch if you are fan studio see it today since its early previews uk are

7,An animation gem!,"So, it looks to me that the Bad Guys was influenced by the anime Lupin the third. Makes perfect sense, so many animated movies and series are. Sam Rockwell's Big Bad Wolf is a total play on this. Although I did notice that Disney's Seeing Red has a similar look so it looks like anime is getting even more intergraded in everything. I'm good with it!The actual story is by the numbers. These animated features love the idea of teaching children to think outside the box and rising above what the world thinks you are, in a movie that's story arch could not have been more obvious if they tried, but that animation was so good that I'm too focus on it to care.It's a good ensemble cast of characters. The Wolf, the Shark, the Tarantula (Played by Awkafina, a fav in this movie, just really cute), the Parana, and the Snake. It was a good crew and it's kind of great how the character and the voices all gel together.But really, I can't stop talking about the animation. Its realty worth it to watch things unfold.

10,"I love this film, and a great family film.","The laughs are easy and breezy at the beginning of ""The Bad Guys,"" and the animated comedy's sun-baked vibe radiates Southern California cool. A wolf named Wolf and a snake named Snake enjoy snappy banter at a retro L. A. diner, having the kind of conversation they've probably had countless times over their years of friendship. They push and pull, jostle and tug, all in good-natured fashion. Then they get up, stroll casually across the street, and rob a bank. Pierre Perifel, making his feature directing debut, lays all of this out in one long, single take, instantly drawing us in to these characters and this world. It's an extremely familiar set-up, a subgenre unto itself: hyper-verbal thieves charm us into coming along for the ride and rooting for them to pull off their biggest heist yet. This is a furry, scaly version of Quentin Tarantino or Elmore Leonard-or at least, that's what it aspires to be. But it's a clever change to see such a story told in animated form with a star-studded voice cast including Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Zazie Beetz, and Awkwafina. This opening scene of ""The Bad Guys"" is its strongest, and it offers great promise. But the wise-cracking, fast-talking energy that was once so buoyant grows increasingly strained as the story evolves and reaches its frenzied conclusion. Based on the kids' graphic novel series by Aaron Blabey, ""The Bad Guys"" follows a group of fun-loving criminals who lean into their rap as the villains of the animal kingdom for thrills and profit. Wolf (voiced by a smooth Rockwell) is their charismatic leader, with unmistakable shades of Danny Ocean. (In case the similarities weren't obvious, he repeatedly gets compared to George Clooney.) Snake (a gravelly, earthy Marc Maron) is the cranky but loyal safecracker. Shark (Craig Robinson) is the enthusiastic master of disguise, but the amusing running bit is that it's always totally obvious he's a shark. But the midsection feels saggy and the early zip and swagger wear thin. Still, there are some useful notions here about second chances and redemption, as well as upending people's perceptions to emerge as the best possible version of yourself. Sounds facile, but the script handles these themes with some intelligence. At the very least, ""The Bad Guys"" encourages kids not to judge a book by its cover-and maybe even read an actual book about these characters afterward.",i love this film great family film,laughs are easy breezy at beginning bad guys animated comedys sun baked vibe radiates southern california cool wolf named wolf snake named snake enjoy snappy banter at retro l diner having kind conversation theyve probably had countless times over their years friendship they push pull jostle tug all good natured fashion then they get up stroll casually across street rob bank pierre perifel making his feature directing debut lays all this out one long single take instantly drawing us these characters this world its extremely familiar set up subgenre unto itself hyper verbal thieves charm us into coming along ride rooting them pull off their biggest heist yet this is furry scaly version quentin tarantino or elmore leonard or at least thats what it aspires be but its clever change see such story told animated form with star studded voice cast including sam rockwell marc maron zazie beetz awkwafina this opening scene bad guys is its strongest it offers great promise but wise cracking fast talking energy that was once so buoyant grows increasingly strained as story evolves reaches its frenzied conclusion based kids graphic novel series by aaron blabey bad guys follows group fun loving criminals who lean into their rap as villains animal kingdom thrills profit wolf voiced by smooth rockwell is their charismatic leader with unmistakable shades danny ocean case similarities werent obvious he repeatedly gets compared george clooney snake gravelly earthy marc maron is cranky but loyal safecracker shark craig robinson is enthusiastic master disguise but amusing running bit is that its always totally obvious hes shark but midsection feels saggy early zip swagger wear thin still there are some useful notions here about second chances redemption as well as upending peoples perceptions emerge as best possible version yourself sounds facile but script handles these themes with some intelligence at very least bad guys encourages kids not judge book by its cover maybe even read actual book about these characters afterward,0.5694019933554817,0.14760243632336656,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"

8,I knew you were good,"While it feels like it was made for children and the plot is rather straightforward.. this movie has style in spades. Choreography, Camerawork and Visuals are simply the best part! With action scenes that are worth repeat-watching, and a touch of hand-painted flare here and there to bump it up a notch. I was impressed with how creative it gets.While lagging a tad behind, the execution and development of the story is what makes it worth watching. It's energetic, has good pacing, sound mixing/editing, and a decent message. Though, in the hands of a different studio, and with lesser action.. I can see the movie not working.The dialogue in particular, and some characters feel lacking and undercooked.. Doesn't help that I, personally, didn't quite feel the Talent behind voices. Aside from Richard Ayoade, Marc and Zazie.. what you hear didn't really match the movie, and it felts a little awkward. As if you can constantly notice the layer on top, like you would a dub. It's not bad, it's just not good. Maybe I'll check the Spanish version later. Anyway, Awkwafina in particular! Who continues to get roles where her ""talent"" is wasted and someone else (if given the chance, considering the ""small"" role, ha) would do a MUCH better job.But very importantly.. the start and ending are great. They pay off what they presented, and in a good way.Watch for the kids, watch for the action.. and enjoy.PS: I can already see the sequel, with a certain Foxy character.",i knew you were good,while it feels like it was made children plot is rather straightforward this movie has style spades choreography camerawork visuals are simply best part with action scenes that are worth repeat watching touch hand painted flare here there bump it up notch i was impressed with how creative it gets while lagging tad behind execution development story is what makes it worth watching its energetic has good pacing sound mixing editing decent message though hands different studio with lesser action i can see movie not working dialogue particular some characters feel lacking undercooked doesnt help that i personally didnt quite feel talent behind voices aside richard ayoade marc zazie what you hear didnt really match movie it felts little awkward as if you can constantly notice layer top like you would dub its not bad its just not good maybe ill check spanish version later anyway awkwafina particular who continues get roles where her talent is wasted someone else if given chance considering small role ha would do much better job but very importantly start ending are great they pay off what they presented good way watch kids watch action enjoy ps i can already see sequel with certain foxy character,0.4751221001221002,0.20184065934065937,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
6,Not bad... get it?,"Please forgive that terrible joke. This is a pretty good family movie with a great cast and fun story.

The supporting cast all bring something to the table. Awkwafina continues to shine as a voice actor, although with a much smaller role (she killed it in Raya and the Last Dragon).The only reason I didn't like this more is the comedy. It's not bad. It's mostly amusing. But I only laughed out loud a few times. By contrast, Sonic and Sonic 2 are PG family movies that had me cracking up, although it might not be fair to compare when they had GOAT Jim Carrey.I had a decent time with this movie although I don't see myself revisiting it.
