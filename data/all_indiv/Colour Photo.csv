8,Emotional& touching movie,"I really liked this movie, its different from the telugu movies ive seen before. The underlying topic(colourism) is a really important one, embedded in a romantic love story in the 90s. Especially the main characters were drawn out well& were interesting , except for the brother of the girl( he was potrayed as a narcissistic, mysoginistic and controlling psychopath, but for my taste his character was over the top and his motives quite immature). I also liked the dialogues, they were really thoughtful and deep, and encouraging the viewer to think about them, but at the same time you had really funny punchlines. The cinematography was astonishing ! and the music was fitting perfectly into the film. What i didnt like was the ending because it kind of feels misplaced and maybe encourages the youth to do things, which will harm them, instead of finding better solutions to deal with hardships in life ( by the way the high cigarette consum was also critical). The topic spoken about is important, but it would have been more brave and even groundbreaking, if the woman had been darker and the men fairer, because colourism affects woman much more than men.( but this is a minor aspect ) Otherwise a really touching movie, with amazing perfomances especially from the main character ( its the first movie after a long time, which made me cry) :)",emotional touching movie,i really liked this movie its different telugu movies ive seen before underlying topic colourism is really important one embedded romantic love story 90s especially main characters were drawn out well were interesting except brother girl he was potrayed as narcissistic mysoginistic controlling psychopath but my taste his character was over top his motives quite immature i also liked dialogues they were really thoughtful deep encouraging viewer think about them but at same time you had really funny punchlines cinematography was astonishing music was fitting perfectly into film what i didnt like was ending because it kind feels misplaced maybe encourages youth do things which will harm them instead finding better solutions deal with hardships life by way high cigarette consum was also critical topic spoken about is important but it would have been more brave even groundbreaking if woman had been darker men fairer because colourism affects woman much more than men but this is minor aspect otherwise really touching movie with amazing perfomances especially main character its first movie after long time which made me cry,0.6236868686868685,0.3462626262626262,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.36}"

6,East Man Color Story as Colour Photo,"The story and the idea of elevating the racism in rural areas around late 90s wasnt a unique story..there have been numerous stories coming our way since east man color times. Finally what i wanted to say is, colour photo isnt a story untold during its time. Just that its retro love story it doesnt necessarily sell. It should have its selling point. And having said that.. it had huge resemblance with Pariyerum Perumal which released in tamil in 2018. Chandini and viva harsha stood out for their performances. Certainly they have rroved that they both has the potential to perform. Suhas has done well but his character arc wasnt consistent, its the flaw in writing i guess, because he had his moments of being confident unlike pretending to be one like in proposal scene. That ending would have been a heartbreaking one in 1999(according to timeline used in movie) but it wasnt the same(for me atleast) and I was in the exact state how deepu reacts to her dads death but at the same time if it doesnt end that way, it would have given the vibe of pariyerum perumal so we had nothing else to take this. But it did address some issues genuinely and didnt tried to polish the bad consequences of love which were prevailing during late 90s. I wish director doesnt get carried away with the appreciations this film gets and correct his flaws in writing for his next. Its not a bad one, its not very good.

9,Vibrant and Painful,"It was 2016, when I came across a Marathi movie #Sairat. It was a roller-coaster ride filled with emotions throughout its runtime. The impact of caste and class on the love world, left me perplexed. It impacted me on a level that I never imagined.Colour Photo had similar impact in me; the movie made me laugh and smile, as much as it made me cry! Though both the movies deal with love affair amidst caste issues, they are true to their own background. That's what make it special.#Suhas as Jayakrishna carries the movie on his shoulders, with his non-dramatic portrayal of a young college lad. After an impressive performance in #UmaMaheswaraUgraRoopasaya, he stamped his presence in this movie as well. It will be curious to see him portray a variety of roles in future.Though the screenplay had enough space for puns from our Bala yesu (Child Christ!), the supporting characters could've been backed up by better performances. There were situations where the plot was about to change directions, but the screenplay tried its best to get it back on track.The editing pattern caught my attention throughout, using windows to convey the emotions of the contrasting worlds of the lead. Combined with the background score, they helped us in getting glued to our screens without much hassle.The YouTube gang of #ChaiBiscuit getting on to make a mark on the big screen, is a massive step ahead in Telugu Cinema. I hope many young talents can follow their suit up the ladder. As said by Hriday Ranjan of Film Companion South, these people really developed the negatives of their industry into a beautiful colour photo!Overall, the Colour Photo movie is definitely a welcome move for the Telugu Cinema industry and I hope it will be appreciated by everyone alike.
