9.0,Unforgettable and Heartbreaking Bleak Tale of Friendship and Loneliness,"In 1976, in Australia, the misfit and outcast eight-year old girl Mary Daisy Dinkle lives in Mount Waverley with her alcoholic shoplifter mother Vera Lorraine Dinkle that is addicted in Sherry and her absent father Noel Norman Dinkle that works in the Earl Grey Factory attaching strings in the teabag and spends his leisure time in his hobby - taxidermy. Mary has absolutely no friends and is teased by her schoolmate Benny Clifford. She has a complex because of her brown birthmark in the forehead and she adores her favorite cartoon The Noblets that she watches with her rooster Ethel and condensed milk. Meanwhile, in New York, the lonely forty-four year-old Max Jerry Horowitz has Asperge Syndrome and trouble to sleep and is obese since he eats chocolate hot-dogs to compensate his anxiety. He frequently goes to the Overeaters Anonymous Meeting. Max does not have any friend, only the invisible Mr. Ravioli, and also loves The Noblets. His life goals are to have a friend, Noblets and chocolate. One day, Mary picks Max address out of an American phone-book and she decides to write to him to ask from where babies come in America. Along their lives, they become pen pals and their unusual friendship oscillates due to the anxiety attacks of the unstable Max.""Mary and Max"" is an unforgettable and heartbreaking bleak tale of friendship and loneliness. The story is bittersweet and witty, with an ironic black humor and provokes the most conflictive emotions in the viewers, funny in a moment, and depressive in the other. The excellent animation follows the dark style of Tim Burton and the screenplay is a profound insight in human behavior.

8.0,Refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved.,"In Australia in 1976, a young girl named Mary (voiced by Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely child looking for a friend. She lives with both her parents but her mother is a chain smoking drunk and a thief and her father, who works in a factory putting the strings on teabags, would rather spend time with his collection of dead birds. Mary remains curious about life and finds the address of an American living in New York. She writes him a letter to become his pen pal. The recipient is Max (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a severely overweight Jewish hypochondriac and full-time no-hoper. Gradually, as they send each other letters, Mary and Max's relationship develops and we begin to learn more about their past and their heartache and insecurities of being alone.Following the short animated film, Harvey Krumpet, director Adam Elliot has constructed his first full feature claymation picture, displaying as much skill as many of the major mainstream studios. The film has been immaculately designed, with many tiny details and features placed into the sets, all of which would have taken many countless hours to mould. The lighting and colour scheme too are significant to the unique look of the film, ranging from highly saturated to almost entirely black and white, to reflect the self-depreciative and sometimes gloomy tone of the narrative. It is a film made of great patience and craftsmanship.Yet the strongest asset of the film is the humour of the screenplay. Whereas many mainstream animated films such as Shrek and The Incredibles adopt a great deal of hilarity from their pop culture references, Elliot has an eye for the simpler things in life. From the way Mary and Max share their eating habits of chocolate hot dogs, to how Max describes his past jobs, including a street cleaner and a member of the Communist Party, the humour of the film remains truly original, bizarre and often very witty. Elliot excels in his ability write about the most normal things and then turn them on their heads, or degrade his miserable characters in the most hilarious way. Yet there are moments of poignancy too, such as where Mary describes her difficulty at school as she is teased for the birthmark on her forehead, that provide the film's screenplay with a subtext - no matter how simple – about isolation and the need for friends.The use of Barry Humphries' voice over to convey much of the story is initially highly annoying and intrusive. In the opening scenes it feels overly used and distracting from the story and the detail of the scenes. Gradually though, as the film moves from its opening exposition, the voice over is used slightly less and its scarcity achieves the storybook quality and poetry that it deserves. Barry Humphries reads his lines beautifully. The rest of the voice actors too are splendid. Philip Seymour Hoffman is again in fine form, adding a slight accent to his voice and the decision to model his voice with a character of a similar physique fits nicely. He is quickly become one of the most diverse actors in the world. Bethany Whitmore as the young Mary is equally impressive too and her voice has a real innocence about it. Toni Collette and Eric Bana also have much smaller roles too. It is a well thought out voice cast and while some of the minor characters verge on grotesque, there is still a real sweetness about this film that carries it.Elliot has described his film as being suitable for everyone. This is rather optimistic. I don't know how particularly young children, who have been conditioned by the more mainstream animated titles, would appreciate the film. It is extremely funny for the most part, but there is also a real sense of gloom around these characters that might not be as appealing to children. And towards the end, the film, despite being well under two hours, begins to lose a bit of momentum as the characters wave in and out of their depleted lives. Perhaps the films message of learning to live with your flaws and accepting the path life has given you is something that children, even if they don't entirely understand now though, needs to be seen anyway. Regardless, it remains a mostly sharp and funny film that many will find refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved.",refreshing engaging given home grown talent involved,australia 1976 young girl named mary voiced by bethany whitmore is lonely child looking friend she lives with both her parents but her mother is chain smoking drunk thief her father who works factory putting strings teabags would rather spend time with his collection dead birds mary remains curious about life finds address american living new york she writes him letter become his pen pal recipient is max philip seymour hoffman severely overweight jewish hypochondriac full time no hoper gradually as they send each other letters mary maxs relationship develops we begin learn more about their past their heartache insecurities being alone following short animated film harvey krumpet director adam elliot has constructed his first full feature claymation picture displaying as much skill as many major mainstream studios film has been immaculately designed with many tiny details features placed into sets all which would have taken many countless hours mould lighting colour scheme too are significant unique look film ranging highly saturated almost entirely black white reflect self depreciative sometimes gloomy tone narrative it is film made great patience craftsmanship yet strongest asset film is humour screenplay whereas many mainstream animated films such as shrek incredibles adopt great deal hilarity their pop culture references elliot has eye simpler things life way mary max share their eating habits chocolate hot dogs how max describes his past jobs including street cleaner member communist party humour film remains truly original bizarre often very witty elliot excels his ability write about most normal things then turn them their heads or degrade his miserable characters most hilarious way yet there are moments poignancy too such as where mary describes her difficulty at school as she is teased birthmark her forehead that provide films screenplay with subtext no matter how simple about isolation need friends use barry humphries voice over convey much story is initially highly annoying intrusive opening scenes it feels overly used distracting story detail scenes gradually though as film moves its opening exposition voice over is used slightly less its scarcity achieves storybook quality poetry that it deserves barry humphries reads his lines beautifully rest voice actors too are splendid philip seymour hoffman is again fine form adding slight accent his voice decision model his voice with character similar physique fits nicely he is quickly become one most diverse actors world bethany whitmore as young mary is equally impressive too her voice has real innocence about it toni collette eric bana also have much smaller roles too it is well thought out voice cast while some minor characters verge grotesque there is still real sweetness about this film that carries it elliot has described his film as being suitable everyone this is rather optimistic i dont know how particularly young children who have been conditioned by more mainstream animated titles would appreciate film it is extremely funny most part but there is also real sense gloom around these characters that might not be as appealing children towards end film despite being well under two hours begins lose bit momentum as characters wave out their depleted lives perhaps films message learning live with your flaws accepting path life has given you is something that children even if they dont entirely understand now though needs be seen anyway regardless it remains mostly sharp funny film that many will find refreshing engaging given home grown talent involved,0.5539746364746364,0.1925670163170163,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8.0,Mary & Max - wonderfully unique and personal animation,"There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",mary max wonderfully unique personal animation,theres constant stream animated films these days but mostly theyre either glossy hollywood product pixar dreamworks or japanese anime adults wanting something different we have wait likes nightmare before christmas waltz with bashir persepolis or aardmans films turn up mary max is one these films that comes as complete departure all others both visual storytelling style sticks mind because it i wont repeat plot here so ill just mention few pros cons cons are obvious some people will be put off by almost constant narration which took me while get used rather numerous calamities lot more than youd expect if you thought this was just kids film sadness within some these peoples stories its actually little surprising that film got made without people financing it demanding script that was more tailored appeal wider audience what we get is something that feels whole lot more personal than higher profile animated films it feels personal therefore real explanation is that it was written life by director who has real feeling sympathy people who dont quite fit into world feel alienated or are misunderstood by others mary was partly inspired by directors own childhood theres little bit toni collettes muriel heslop thrown i suspect max is also based real person hes been pen friends with but so far has never met person way film handles his aspergers syndrome just feels different how youd normally see such issue handled screen theres constant stream humour ironic black childish i really enjoyed small perfect touches growing up australian suburb 70s 80s depiction grey new york as it appears easily frightened max animation is constantly joy watch i highly recommend seeing it big screen where it can be properly appreciated all its hand made glory,0.4683236621534494,0.15240490006447455,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,lovely oddball and admirably complex,"Coming from Australia, Mary and Max is one of these few films you'll remember all your life. This amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in Australia and an aging Jew from New York. It's unbelievable what a precisely structured narrative this is. Director-writer Adam Elliot blends odd scatological, yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations to a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the past few years. The fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. The movie was 5 years in the making and this is visible in its every frame. Elliot masterly captures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. Most importantly though, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. Due to its serious themes and dark tone, Mary and Max is an adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts. It happens to be more contemplative, and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. Calling Elliot's movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly not an overstatement.",lovely oddball admirably complex,coming australia mary max is one these few films youll remember all your life this amazing claymation touches upon unlikely friendship between two pen pals young girl living australia aging jew new york its unbelievable what precisely structured narrative this is director writer adam elliot blends odd scatological yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations splendid effect creating one best tragicomedies past few years fact that its form claymation only helps enhance uniqueness whole experience movie was 5 years making this is visible its every frame elliot masterly captures motion endlessly creative manner most importantly though his lovably oddball characters are well developed admirably complex with all their awkward traits quirks due its serious themes dark tone mary max is adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts it happens be more contemplative intelligent mimicking real life with all its ups downs calling elliots movie extraordinary piece art is certainly not overstatement,0.5625270562770563,0.12882094757094756,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10.0,"After seeing his previous films, I just had to watch this one...","Having already watched several of Adam Elliot's other films (""Harvey Krumpet"", ""Brother"", ""Cousin"" and ""Uncle""), I felt a strong compulsion to watch ""Mary and Max"". After all, these other films were wonderful and very original and you find yourself hooked when you watch them--though you probably won't know why. Now, with Elliot's latest film, I have a chance to finally watch a feature-length version of his wonderful and very strange work.The film begins in Australia and concerns a very lonely girl named Mary. Her parents are completely inept at parenting and mostly she entertains herself. One day, on a lark, she rips a name out of an American phone book and writes to a ""M. Horowitz""--telling him about herself as well as asking him where babies come from in America. As Max Horowitz is a socially inept odd-ball, his response to her strange letter is amusing to say the least. And, through their ensuing letters to each other they become friends--an 8 year-old girl and a 40+ year-old man and the film consists of showing each writing and narrating their letters. Where this bizarre business goes, you'll just need to see for yourself. However, without spoiling the film, I can safely say that I never, ever could predict where the film would go next!! Like all of Adam Elliot films, the film is just plain odd--with a delightful strangeness you can't help but like. And, even more than his shorter films, you can't believe how much time and effort he took to make this movie. It's amazing....really. And, fortunately, his work is totally unique and inventive. Aside from his previous shorts, I've never seen anything like it--and I am pretty sure you'll feel the same way if you try this delightfully strange film. Just don't try to understand or make sense of it...it might just make your brain explode. Oh, and do NOT watch it if you are feeling depressed. Although it's got lots of funny moments, the film is VERY, VERY dark--so much so that you should think twice before watching it. And, although the film looks like a kids movie, I would probably think twice before showing it to young kids.",after seeing his previous films i just had watch this one,having already watched several adam elliots other films harvey krumpet brother cousin uncle i felt strong compulsion watch mary max after all these other films were wonderful very original you find yourself hooked when you watch them though you probably wont know why now with elliots latest film i have chance finally watch feature length version his wonderful very strange work film begins australia concerns very lonely girl named mary her parents are completely inept at parenting mostly she entertains herself one day lark she rips name out american phone book writes m horowitz telling him about herself as well as asking him where babies come america as max horowitz is socially inept odd ball his response her strange letter is amusing say least through their ensuing letters each other they become friends 8 year old girl 40 year old man film consists showing each writing narrating their letters where this bizarre business goes youll just need see yourself however without spoiling film i can safely say that i never ever could predict where film would go next like all adam elliot films film is just plain odd with delightful strangeness you cant help but like even more than his shorter films you cant believe how much time effort he took make this movie its amazing really fortunately his work is totally unique inventive aside his previous shorts ive never seen anything like it i am pretty sure youll feel same way if you try this delightfully strange film just dont try understand or make sense it it might just make your brain explode oh do not watch it if you are feeling depressed although its got lots funny moments film is very very dark so much so that you should think twice before watching it although film looks like kids movie i would probably think twice before showing it young kids,0.5143037518037518,0.19507305194805194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"

8.0,"Witty, well observed and wondrous","I went into this film at the Berlinale with mixed feelings. I knew that Adam Elliot's shorts were great but frankly the last few years haven't been great for Australian films and a number of short filmmakers have made disappointing first features.But right from the opening frame, this film shattered any of my doubts. It's so refreshing to see a film told with such a strong unique vision and pulled off so effortlessly. This is made even more remarkable not only as it's made using stop motion animation but also because of the characters and subject matter it tackles.Mary is an 8 year old outcast living in the suburbs of Melbourne. On a whim, she chooses a name at random in a phone book and sends off a letter asking about life on the other side of the world. The letter is received by Max, an overweight depressive in his 40's living in New York, suffering from Aspergers Syndrome. A friendship is born as the pair exchange letters over the next 20 years. offering each other support, advice and the chance to see life through another set of eyes.While the world is painted in gloomy hues of brown and grey and the characters lead bleak lives, the genius of the script is that the characters never wallow or feel sorry for themselves. The tone is kept humorous and balanced allowing us to be moved by the characters as they stumble through life but also laugh at their foibles and observations of the world they struggle to fit into. Not since Muriel's Wedding has Australia produced so fine a comedy with such rich detail and I probably got even more laughs out of this.My only criticism of the film would be some of its music particularly its use in one key scene of the Humming Chorus (already used so memorably in the finale of Heavenly Creatures). It meant that in a critical moment I was thinking of Kate Winslet up to no good instead of connecting with Mary & Max. But this is more a personal concern and if that's the weakest thing about the film, it's doing pretty well. I hope this film is seen by the wide audience it so richly deserves.",witty well observed wondrous,i went into this film at berlinale with mixed feelings i knew that adam elliots shorts were great but frankly last few years havent been great australian films number short filmmakers have made disappointing first features but right opening frame this film shattered any my doubts its so refreshing see film told with such strong unique vision pulled off so effortlessly this is made even more remarkable not only as its made using stop motion animation but also because characters subject matter it tackles mary is 8 year old outcast living suburbs melbourne whim she chooses name at random phone book sends off letter asking about life other side world letter is received by max overweight depressive his 40s living new york suffering aspergers syndrome friendship is born as pair exchange letters over next 20 years offering each other support advice chance see life through another set eyes while world is painted gloomy hues brown grey characters lead bleak lives genius script is that characters never wallow or feel sorry themselves tone is kept humorous balanced allowing us be moved by characters as they stumble through life but also laugh at their foibles observations world they struggle fit into not since muriels wedding has australia produced so fine comedy with such rich detail i probably got even more laughs out this my only criticism film would be some its music particularly its use one key scene humming chorus already used so memorably finale heavenly creatures it meant that critical moment i was thinking kate winslet up no good instead connecting with mary max but this is more personal concern if thats weakest thing about film its doing pretty well i hope this film is seen by wide audience it so richly deserves,0.5561757391544625,0.12653357281016855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.45}"

9.0,And you thought Dial-up was slow....,"A couple of claymation misfits who are worlds apart, form an unlikely dialog, in a pre-Internet age where it takes weeks to get a reply.There is a growing trend amongst publishers and in Hollywood, where the writer is strongly urged to rather show the story rather than tell it. This is fine for certain works, especially action films, but I personally believe that the aforementioned edict is a steaming pile of moronic dribble. People are more than intelligent enough to garner rich satisfaction from being provided a story in any form as long as the story itself holds interest. Its worked fine for all the classics in literature, most of which are still being read in droves, but many believe that audiences are stupid and need to shown everything and must capture their attention in the first five seconds. Indeed, most manuscripts are rejected based upon their first page, a ridiculous scenario.In this case, there is much in the way of telling via the voice-over of the wondrous Barry Humphries and yet the visuals provide us with an extra layer on information, working with the voice-over rather than being hindered by it. Occasionally it goes on too long, but Adam Elliot is incredibly brave in wanting to tell this story his way. Aside from stylistic similarities to his earlier shorts, he has remained true to himself. He thanks a lot of people in regards to his script; its clear he has made the effort to get it right, proving the basic notion in screen writing, is to get right on the page first folks.

10.0,It's a genuine celebration of the value of difference.,"Oscar winning (and proudly gay) animation artist Adam Elliot's acclaimed clay-mation feature film ""Mary & Max"" is astoundingly rewarding wonderful entertainment on the big screen. It's an intriguing tale, starting in the mid seventies, of the ongoing true friendship of two long distance pen-pals, younger Mary in rural Australia and older Max in the rat-race of New York City. A significant element of the story involves Max's experience of living with Asperger Syndrome, knowing painfully full well that he senses the world in a radically different way to most. I've never seen any other project deal so honestly and powerfully with that condition. It's a genuine celebration of the value of difference.There's lots to laugh and think about - and the attention to detail is staggering.

,Escapes its Poo-Faced Limits,"Gosh, another Australian project that knows what it is and successfully escapes itself.The story is about a girl with structural limits: appearance, family, attitude.The media is stop motion, which brings its own structural limits. These are severe limits, because they straddle what we know as real and what we accept as fantasy. How to work with this? The choices a filmmaker makes in this medium are fascinating.Jan Svankmajer presents the result as moving museum art, dynamic dioramas. He can be too precious in that Eastern European way that produces needlework that frightens. Tim Burton, and Henry Selick (""Coraline,"" ""James and the Giant Peach"") pretend we are looking at illustrated books the way a child would. Nick Park treats the medium the way Walt Disney would, as a simple extrapolation from Donald Duck via way of Pixar. These guys decide not to tackle the simple fact that it is near impossible to elicit real emotion via this form.Only the Quay Brothers and Christiane Cegavske (""Blood Tea and Red String"") make the commitment to create worlds by allowing the characters to inhabit them in a way that inhabitants are worldcreators. They affect a bizarre Victorian metaphors but this is because Lewis Carroll is the genius of this technique and not because the era has any intrinsic advantage. There are powerful and worldchanging moments in these works. But the viewer is asked to make a commitment that few will.All lucid stop-motion filmmakers face this set of decisions about how to overcome the limits of the medium. If you are writing a story while struggling with this, what is foremost in your mind? Especially if you are Australian, is a society that for some reason is introspective in art? You will produce a ""folded"" story: one where the subject of the story reflects the form of the story. We have a girl in Australia who is obsessed with a successful TeeVee show, also stop motion. It is her fantasy world, the movie within the movie. She faces many challenges in simply surviving. She has a pen pal, and successfully writes her way out her limits, first by writing a book about her viewer's physiological limits. (More about this in a minute.) And then by getting a genuine expression of emotion from him in the form of a complete set of figures from the inner film. She triumphs, has child (all this is pretty overt folding) and finally visits the world of her pen pal to discover that she not only affected him, but was effectively his whole emotional life. The medium is mastered.The two actors chosen are among our very few who understand folded characterization.This half of the project is fascinating in the normal way that these nested, introspective things are, and is worthwhile. But it is the other half that is amazing.Mary is our filmmaker, and Max our viewer. Us.Half of the problem a filmmaker faces is the limits of her medium, and the other half the limits of the viewer. Most of us are emotional cripples, not inclined to work with an artist in a contract of world-building. We are afraid. Max is a citizen of the most urban and sophisticated city on the planet (in contrast to Mary's remote outpost). But he has Asberger Syndrome and is incapable of reading and processing emotion. This characterizes us viewers pretty well; our movie experiences are often exercises in avoiding truth. I found it rare and thrilling to see it explicit in this nested work, which is superficially sweet but essentially damning.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",escapes its poo faced limits,gosh another australian project that knows what it is successfully escapes itself story is about girl with structural limits appearance family attitude media is stop motion which brings its own structural limits these are severe limits because they straddle what we know as real what we accept as fantasy how work with this choices filmmaker makes this medium are fascinating jan svankmajer presents result as moving museum art dynamic dioramas he can be too precious that eastern european way that produces needlework that frightens tim burton henry selick coraline james giant peach pretend we are looking at illustrated books way child would nick park treats medium way walt disney would as simple extrapolation donald duck via way pixar these guys decide not tackle simple fact that it is near impossible elicit real emotion via this form only quay brothers christiane cegavske blood tea red string make commitment create worlds by allowing characters inhabit them way that inhabitants are worldcreators they affect bizarre victorian metaphors but this is because lewis carroll is genius this technique not because era has any intrinsic advantage there are powerful worldchanging moments these works but viewer is asked make commitment that few will all lucid stop motion filmmakers face this set decisions about how overcome limits medium if you are writing story while struggling with this what is foremost your mind especially if you are australian is society that some reason is introspective art you will produce folded story one where subject story reflects form story we have girl australia who is obsessed with successful teevee show also stop motion it is her fantasy world movie within movie she faces many challenges simply surviving she has pen pal successfully writes her way out her limits first by writing book about her viewers physiological limits more about this minute then by getting genuine expression emotion him form complete set figures inner film she triumphs has child all this is pretty overt folding finally visits world her pen pal discover that she not only affected him but was effectively his whole emotional life medium is mastered two actors chosen are among our very few who understand folded characterization this half project is fascinating normal way that these nested introspective things are is worthwhile but it is other half that is amazing mary is our filmmaker max our viewer us half problem filmmaker faces is limits her medium other half limits viewer most us are emotional cripples not inclined work with artist contract world building we are afraid max is citizen most urban sophisticated city planet contrast marys remote outpost but he has asberger syndrome is incapable reading processing emotion this characterizes us viewers pretty well our movie experiences are often exercises avoiding truth i found it rare thrilling see it explicit this nested work which is superficially sweet but essentially damning teds evaluation 3 3 worth watching,0.5543241167434715,0.1538709677419355,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Unforgettable,"One of my favourites of 2009, Mary and Max is a truly unforgettable film in all respects. The clay animation is just gorgeous with all the characters well modelled and the colours done in atmospheric shades, and gives a nostalgic and unique feel to it, and the music is beautiful and heart-breaking. The characters add a lot to the film as well, the title characters are sweet, emphatic and engaging, with Mary very cute and Max endearing in his own way, and the audience sympathises with them and their predicaments, while the writing is both funny and poignant and the haunting, affecting and personal story packs a real emotional punch on its own and is thematically quite deep. The voice work is top notch, Barry Humphries provides a both amusing and gentle narrative and Toni Collette(Bethany Whitmore as the younger Mary) and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are brilliant as Mary and Max. What made Mary and Max other than the superb direction and gentle pacing was the adept mix of hilarious humour and poignant drama, there is evidence of both and both are done wonderfully.

8.0,You got to love Mary And Max,"Mary and Max are two individuals which are poles apart from each other, live in separate continents and have an age difference of more than 30. But there is something which makes them care about and think about each other. It is the great relation of friendship. We hear that our best friends are those who accept us along with our faults and shortcomings. Mary and Max are the best examples of that. Mary is a 8 year old girl from Australia and Max is a 40 somewhat obese guy from New York. Both have some things common such as they have no friends, love a particular Cartoon and have the fetish for Chocolate. They interact with each other through letters which reveals to the viewer their life story .Sorry, if I missed to mention that this is an animated movie - Not ordinary but clay animation. It is somewhat difficult to emote through clay animation but this movie does not suffer from that. The movie is filled with dark, satirical humor but you never feel offended by it. Along with it, it has it's 'cry buckets' moments which really move you. I will certainly call it a very matured animation movie by a newbie director.

10.0,An animated life,"In 2004, Adam Elliot took home Oscar gold with his animated short film Harvie Krumpet, a film about the life of a simple man named Harvie Krumpet who tries to learn as much as he can about life. He used stop motion animation, a form of animation that is most commonly linked with TV Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. The film is somewhat grim, funny, and heartfelt, something that this type of animation is rarely scene with.Five years later, Elliot comes back with his first feature film Mary and Max. As impressed as I was with Harvie Krumpet I was doubly impressed with this one. He uses the same style of animation only this time his skills are much more precise, detailed, and effective. He tells the story of Mary Daisy Dinkle, a young girl living in 1970s Australia who has no friends except for her pet rooster and favorite television show. One day she decides to reach out across the world to someone who might be her friend. She finds a New York City phone book picks out a random name: Max Jerry Horovitz.Max lives alone in his apartment with his one eyed cat and pet fish (who he needs to constantly replace). He is an overweight, middle aged man with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism. He too has no friends and is in need of some companionship, although he is somewhat afraid of the outside world and strangers. He finally decides to write her back, and the two begin their friendship across the sea.The film is comprised of narration, by Barry Humphries, and voice over from Mary and Max reading their letters, voiced by Bethany Whitmore as younger Mary, Toni Collette as older Mary, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Max. Their letters and the in between narration is hysterical and incredibly clever. I like the little tidbits we are given like the way Mary's mother drinks her sherry and how Max eats chocolate hot dogs, his own recipe. They make the characters more interesting.Elliot creates a vivid world filled with right and wrong. He uses colors to define the two different continents, giving Australia brown and earthy tones while New York is black, white, and everything in between, with the exception of a red pompom that Mary sends Max. Much like their separate worlds, they both blend in as if no one else would notice them. These characters are simple, average people who go the distance to make their lives a little more comfortable. It's sublime to see these characters grow up through the years and age and learn. We become so attached.There is so much to love about this movie. The quirky little one liners to the incredibly detailed and well done stop motion animation. Each character has clearly defined features, unique movement, and like so many stop motion pieces, there is nothing jumpy or out of place about the animation. It is smooth, coherent, and compelling to watch. As impressive as it is the writing is just as good. You really get a feeling for these characters through the narration and their writing. If there was some way you could help them out you would. They are just so lovable.This is one of the best films I have seen this year. It's a wonderful film aimed at a more mature audience. I don't know if it can compete with Disney and Pixar's Up, but I wouldn't be surprised to see this at least get a nomination from the Academy, as it has already been honored at this year's Berlin International Film Festival. It's a great achievement when a film can make you feel so happy the entire way through.",animated life,2004 adam elliot took home oscar gold with his animated short film harvie krumpet film about life simple man named harvie krumpet who tries learn as much as he can about life he used stop motion animation form animation that is most commonly linked with tv christmas specials like rudolph red nosed reindeer film is somewhat grim funny heartfelt something that this type animation is rarely scene with five years later elliot comes back with his first feature film mary max as impressed as i was with harvie krumpet i was doubly impressed with this one he uses same style animation only this time his skills are much more precise detailed effective he tells story mary daisy dinkle young girl living 1970s australia who has no friends except her pet rooster favorite television show one day she decides reach out across world someone who might be her friend she finds new york city phone book picks out random name max jerry horovitz max lives alone his apartment with his one eyed cat pet fish who he needs constantly replace he is overweight middle aged man with asperger syndrome form autism he too has no friends is need some companionship although he is somewhat afraid outside world strangers he finally decides write her back two begin their friendship across sea film is comprised narration by barry humphries voice over mary max reading their letters voiced by bethany whitmore as younger mary toni collette as older mary phillip seymour hoffman as max their letters between narration is hysterical incredibly clever i like little tidbits we are given like way marys mother drinks her sherry how max eats chocolate hot dogs his own recipe they make characters more interesting elliot creates vivid world filled with right wrong he uses colors define two different continents giving australia brown earthy tones while new york is black white everything between with exception red pompom that mary sends max much like their separate worlds they both blend as if no one else would notice them these characters are simple average people who go distance make their lives little more comfortable its sublime see these characters grow up through years age learn we become so attached there is so much love about this movie quirky little one liners incredibly detailed well done stop motion animation each character has clearly defined features unique movement like so many stop motion pieces there is nothing jumpy or out place about animation it is smooth coherent compelling watch as impressive as it is writing is just as good you really get feeling these characters through narration their writing if there was some way you could help them out you would they are just so lovable this is one best films i have seen this year its wonderful film aimed at more mature audience i dont know if it can compete with disney pixars up but i wouldnt be surprised see this at least get nomination academy as it has already been honored at this years berlin international film festival its great achievement when film can make you feel so happy entire way through,0.552581369248036,0.1834889904334349,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Great Movie,"I thought this movie was very well made. I can relate to Max's character, as i work with people who have Asperges Syndrome. The creator showed the audience what it is really like, in society, to have a mental disability of this kind. The use of gray colour with a splash of red when showing the scenes with Max, was very effective, and give the audience the sense of what Max was feeling. I saw this movie with work colleagues who also work with children with this disorder, and we were all curious to see how this disorder would be shown. We were all very pleased. This movie shows the audience what people with asperges syndrome go through in day to day life, and how they don't understand things that most people would. As well as how they do/do not cope with some issues.This movie is not for children. It is quite sad, but with some really funny parts. and for those who live in Melbourne, especially, you will understand some of the references.I give this movie 10/10.After 5 years in the making it is definitely worth watching",great movie,i thought this movie was very well made i can relate maxs character as i work with people who have asperges syndrome creator showed audience what it is really like society have mental disability this kind use gray colour with splash red when showing scenes with max was very effective give audience sense what max was feeling i saw this movie with work colleagues who also work with children with this disorder we were all curious see how this disorder would be shown we were all very pleased this movie shows audience what people with asperges syndrome go through day day life how they dont understand things that most people would as well as how they do do not cope with some issues this movie is not children it is quite sad but with some really funny parts those who live melbourne especially you will understand some references i give this movie 10 10 after 5 years making it is definitely worth watching,0.63,0.2477575757575757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,"Sublime film of warmth, humour and power","In this cinematic era of computer animation, the art of claymation (for which hand-moulded figurines are painstakingly photographed one frame at a time) is slowly dissolving. Aardman Studios (the guys behind Wallace and Gromit) seem to be the only ones who still possess the patience required to continue the practise into the 21st Century. It's therefore refreshing to witness the Australian film Mary and Max (the feature film debut of Adam Elliot, who won an Oscar for his short film Harvie Krumpet), which was created using this claymation method to tell a bizarre, sweet and mature story. Tremendously inventive, clever, hilarious and wise, Mary and Max is a sublime movie of warmth and compassion about life's dissonances. The animation is superb, the characters are endearing, the humour is abundant, and it honestly and thoroughly explores several topical themes. If American Beauty director Sam Mendes collaborated with Aardman Animations, the product would be something like Mary and Max.Based partly on Elliot's own life experiences, Mary and Max is a feature about two people leading a mundane existence on the fringe of society; finding solace only in their heartfelt pen-pal letters to each other. Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced by Bethany Whitmore and Toni Collette) is a chubby, friendless 8-year-old living in the suburbs of Melbourne with her neglectful parents. One day, Mary randomly selects a name from the Manhattan phone book and writes a letter to him. She chooses Max Horovitz (Hoffman); a severely obese 44-year-old Jewish man with Asperger's Syndrome living in the chaos of New York City. It turns out they have a lot in common - beyond loneliness and a complete lack of friends, they share a love of chocolate and a TV show called The Noblets. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, with their friendship surviving more than the average diet of life's ups and downs.There's plenty of playful narration (almost constant) courtesy of Aussie legend Barry Humphries which gives the film the feel of a children's tale, but Mary and Max is not for kids. The movie doesn't shy away from covering an array of mature, confronting issues, such as depression, sexuality, suicide, obesity and mental illness. Unlike most mainstream movies in which friendship saves the day and everybody is happy, Mary and Max is unmistakably dark - both physically dark, and dark in its depiction of reality. Max is never able to lose weight, and Mary can never escape the shadow of her parents. Mary eternally resides in her brown-tinged Melbourne suburb, while Max's New York City is depicted as a grey metropolis whose only bright colours are those that come from Mary (a red pompom, for instance). The predominantly colourless and ominous cityscape of NYC is clearly symbolic of Max's melancholy, mental distress and isolation. The ending in particular underlines the film's dark disposition; showing that in real life there may be happy middles, but happy endings are almost non-existent. But despite this, Mary and Max is by no means a highly depressing venture; it's a cinematic delight, with its downbeat content matched by constant laughs, a super- abundance of heart, and several deeply moving moments. Somehow, all of this is squeezed into an 85-minute timeframe, which at times feels longer due narrative simplicity and the occasional pacing issues. This is probably to be expected, however, as Elliot has only previously worked on shorts.Even though a mere claymation short could take up to a year to create, old-school animators such as Adam Elliot and his team display a palpable affection for this approach. Mary and Max spent a total of five years in the making, with six dedicated animation teams working under Elliot's direction in a converted factory in Melbourne, and each team creating an average of 4 seconds of footage per day. A huge kudos to Adam Elliot and his claymation team for creating such a vivid, picturesque world here, with the grim landscape evoking a film-noir feel. Every one of the characters, created from plasticine, is intricately and lovingly detailed. The detail does generate the illusion that we're watching a computer-animated movie, yet the painstaking claymation process affords a look, feel and soul that has yet to be replicated through computers. One must have patience and passion to undertake a stop-motion feature of such scale, and these are two qualities Adam Elliot infinitely exerts.Another tremendous pleasure of Mary and Max is the voice cast; a cornucopia of vocal talent from across the globe. Without a doubt, Philip Seymour Hoffman has proved one of the most versatile actors of recent years with his exceptional vocal work (Capote, anyone?), and he's virtually unrecognisable here. This is, of course, the true essence of voice acting - a viewer should not be given the chance to focus on the actor providing the voice, but instead the character they are voicing. Meanwhile Bethany Whitmore is effortlessly endearing as the young Mary, and Toni Collette is pitch-perfect as Mary in her later years.Through an immense artistry as well as an evident maturity emanated by the makers, Mary and Max affirmatively and genuinely answers a potent question: is there someone for everyone? In adulthood, we understand that we're born into our families but choose our friends, and the 20- year friendship between these two vastly different yet curiously similar individuals proves the theory. Adam Elliot's ambitious first feature- length claymation movie is an absolute delight, merging witty laughs with heartfelt emotion to generate this genuinely moving slice of animation. Mary and Max is, at least for this reviewer's money, the best animated motion picture of 2009 (yes, better than Up). After the terrific Harvie Krumpet and now this, it's clear Elliot is a highly talented filmmaker one should keep an eye on in future years.",sublime film warmth humour power,this cinematic era

8.0,Touching,"Because of some of the crass bits early on, I was a little worried that this was going to be a little too dark for my taste, but it turned out to be quite a touching portrait of loneliness and those with Asperger's. To feel isolated in the world, and yet to have an improbable friend in a pen-pal you've never met - just to know they're out there and to hear from them as you trundle through life - the connection is meaningful and beautiful. The film is also visually striking, and I loved the voices from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Colette.",touching,because some crass bits early i was little worried that this was going be little too dark my taste but it turned out be quite touching portrait loneliness those with aspergers feel isolated world yet have improbable friend pen pal youve never met just know theyre out there hear them as you trundle through life connection is meaningful beautiful film is also visually striking i loved voices phillip seymour hoffman toni colette,0.6,0.3125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Moving story of two misfits is one of the best films of 2009,"Its been 24 hours since I've seen Mary and Max and find I've been deeply affected by the film. Its the story of a little girl who needs to know somethings so she writes a letter to a random person in America only to connect with an sweet man with some decided peculiar ways. What happens after that is a series of ups and downs that happen over the course of 20 years. A unique film its possibly the best animated film from 2009, and its one of the best films of the year. Rarely has a film left me so emotionally moved, certainly there are even fewer that have made me feel this way many hours after the fact. I feel as though I'm carrying the characters and emotions around inside me. And in a way I'm at a loss for words. A beautifully animated film with dialog that is witty and wise and wonderful, this is a marvelously made film. However its the characters where it shines. All of the characters, even if they are somewhat cliché, are painfully real. We know someone like everyone of them. Your heart goes out to them and is carried by them because they are so real. Its the characters we remember and we return to and who carry the film even as the second half gets messy. A masterpiece.",moving story two misfits is one best films 2009,its been 24 hours since ive seen mary max find ive been deeply affected by film its story little girl who needs know somethings so she writes letter random person america only connect with sweet man with some decided peculiar ways what happens after that is series ups downs that happen over course 20 years unique film its possibly best animated film 2009 its one best films year rarely has film left me so emotionally moved certainly there are even fewer that have made me feel this way many hours after fact i feel as though im carrying characters emotions around inside me way im at loss words beautifully animated film with dialog that is witty wise wonderful this is marvelously made film however its characters where it shines all characters even if they are somewhat clich are painfully real we know someone like everyone them your heart goes out them is carried by them because they are so real its characters we remember we return who carry film even as second half gets messy masterpiece,0.5682539682539683,0.33896329365079364,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.43, 'Fear': 0.21}"
