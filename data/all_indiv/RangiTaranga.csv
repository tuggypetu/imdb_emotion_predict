10,RangiTaranga - Definitely a colorful wave!,"There are horror movies which offer mainly jumpscares and there are some which will be haunting even after the movie. And then there's this new wave called RangiTaranga – which offers brilliant jump-scares and leaves you haunting even after you come out of the theatre. Not many movies can do that. RangiTaranga doesn't stick to one genre. Director Anup bhandari has played with the genres according to the neatly written and twisted but brilliant screenplay.The good news is Rangitaranga satisfies all kinds of audience be it frolic seeking janata or experience seeking world cinema followers. While normal audience can soak in the brilliant BGM and the creepy scares with frequent twists, the latter who can appreciate the technicality and the writing of the movie! There are actually more than one story to this movie. The main plot is about the haunted house 'Kamaruttu' and the theories and mysteries surrounding it! Like other movies even this had a similar format but interesting thing about this is the premise. It's surely something new to our audience and there's a lot of detail involved. And the director establishes some really good things and characters in the premise that keeps you thinking. Another story is about Gautham(Nirup bhandari) and Indu(Radhika Chetan) who come to Kamaruttu for a different purpose. And they have their own dark past to worry about. And the final arc is about Sandhya(Avanthika Shetty) looking for a writer called Anashku, who also heads to the same place.The purposes of these main characters, the mystery surrounding the place, their dark past and how these arcs connect together forms the main crux of the plot. Anup Bhandari has cautiously tried to narrate all these stories with a gripping screenplay and he has pulled it off brilliantly. Right from the first scene, the movie starts to cast its spell on the audience.The first half is mainly about introducing the characters,establishing the premise, providing clues and ending with a great twist while the Second half caters to revelations and connecting all the loose ends! Frequent twists keep the viewers intriguing till the end.Some scenes are really spine chilling, thanks to the amazing BGM by Ajaneesh Loknath who is definitely the third hero to this movie.Technically the movie is just perfect and they have not compromised anywhere. Cinematographers Lance Kaplan and David Williams should take a bow. The light setting, the camera angles are different and it uplifts the movie to a whole new level. People often confuse rich visuals with richly spent visuals but this movie defines what rich visuals and cinematography is. And the scares wouldn't have been this extremely effective if it wasn't for the editing! It is perfectly done most of the time! The pure Kannada lyrics for all the songs by Anup Bhandari is one more plus point to this movie. They are mostly situational.Coming to the performances, Nirup Bhandari looks good and for a debut he does a good job but should have done better in a few sequences. The two lead actresses are another great find after Nabha(Vajrakaya) & Priyanka(Ganapa). Avanthika gets to shine more than Radhika and they were great in their roles. Ananth Rao plays a good intimidating cop and other supporting actors do their job well. And there's another important character called KaaLinga Bhat played by Sai Kumar. After Kalpana he comes back with a brilliant role to play. His dialogue delivery, his presentation and his variation in acting is exceptional. There are minor negatives – Some dialogues lacked the feel and punch while a few questions are left unanswered, maybe they weren't relevant to the main plot nevertheless it's easily one of the strongest content dependent movie to come in the recent times after Krishna Leela.",rangitaranga definitely colorful wave,there are horror movies which offer mainly jumpscares there are some which will be haunting even after movie then theres this new wave called rangitaranga which offers brilliant jump scares leaves you haunting even after you come out theatre not many movies can do that rangitaranga doesnt stick one genre director anup bhandari has played with genres according neatly written twisted but brilliant screenplay good news is rangitaranga satisfies all kinds audience be it frolic seeking janata or experience seeking world cinema followers while normal audience can soak brilliant bgm creepy scares with frequent twists latter who can appreciate technicality writing movie there are actually more than one story this movie main plot is about haunted house kamaruttu theories mysteries surrounding it like other movies even this had similar format but interesting thing about this is premise its surely something new our audience theres lot detail involved director establishes some really good things characters premise that keeps you thinking another story is about gautham nirup bhandari indu radhika chetan who come kamaruttu different purpose they have their own dark past worry about final arc is about sandhya avanthika shetty looking writer called anashku who also heads same place purposes these main characters mystery surrounding place their dark past how these arcs connect together forms main crux plot anup bhandari has cautiously tried narrate all these stories with gripping screenplay he has pulled it off brilliantly right first scene movie starts cast its spell audience first half is mainly about introducing characters establishing premise providing clues ending with great twist while second half caters revelations connecting all loose ends frequent twists keep viewers intriguing till end some scenes are really spine chilling thanks amazing bgm by ajaneesh loknath who is definitely third hero this movie technically movie is just perfect they have not compromised anywhere cinematographers lance kaplan david williams should take bow light setting camera angles are different it uplifts movie whole new level people often confuse rich visuals with richly spent visuals but this movie defines what rich visuals cinematography is scares wouldnt have been this extremely effective if it wasnt editing it is perfectly done most time pure kannada lyrics all songs by anup bhandari is one more plus point this movie they are mostly situational coming performances nirup bhandari looks good debut he does good job but should have done better few sequences two lead actresses are another great find after nabha vajrakaya priyanka ganapa avanthika gets shine more than radhika they were great their roles ananth rao plays good intimidating cop other supporting actors do their job well theres another important character called kaalinga bhat played by sai kumar after kalpana he comes back with brilliant role play his dialogue delivery his presentation his variation acting is exceptional there are minor negatives some dialogues lacked feel punch while few questions are left unanswered maybe they werent relevant main plot nevertheless its easily one strongest content dependent movie come recent times after krishna leela,0.49730808782532937,0.24481418964177581,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10,A great thriller movie we had been waiting for!,"It's been a while since I saw a Kannada thriller movie. And, this movie exceeded all my expectations. Kudos to the entire team who gave us such a brilliant movie. This is not exactly a non-linear storyline but, the way Anup Bhandari has taken it is really fantastic apart from couple of goofs. What's a movie without any goofs and continuity misses? Newcomers Nirup Bhandari, Radhika Chetan and Avantika Shetty delivered top notch acting too. And Sai kumar, a round of applause to you Sir! As a thriller, it keeps the audience engaged with every scene and guessing every moment of the movie. Instead of the two quick songs in the second half, the director could've concentrated on going easy on two different story lines. Apart from these and extra spooky effects, this movie did a great job for a thriller genre! Ajaneesh Loknath did an excellent job for the BGM(Didn't find much of UK's BGM similarity though). Stunning DOP by Lance Kaplan and William David. Overall, I'd go with 4.5 out of 5 stars. Must watch for the Kannada movie fans.",great thriller movie we had been waiting,its been while since i saw kannada thriller movie this movie exceeded all my expectations kudos entire team who gave us such brilliant movie this is not exactly non linear storyline but way anup bhandari has taken it is really fantastic apart couple goofs whats movie without any goofs continuity misses newcomers nirup bhandari radhika chetan avantika shetty delivered top notch acting too sai kumar round applause you sir as thriller it keeps audience engaged with every scene guessing every moment movie instead two quick songs second half director couldve concentrated going easy two different story lines apart these extra spooky effects this movie did great job thriller genre ajaneesh loknath did excellent job bgm didnt find much uks bgm similarity though stunning dop by lance kaplan william david overall id go with 4 5 out 5 stars must watch kannada movie fans,0.5037499999999999,0.26875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10,A wonderful journey,"I was desperately waiting to watch this movie and I wanted to catch up on first day itself (managed it but 15 mins late to the cinema hall). The first half has more of thriller and the story start to unfold with the mystery at the interval. The second half starts with uncovering the mystery and lots of twists and turns in the story that keep you at the edge of the seat. The songs are rich and neatly shot, two songs almost back to back could have been avoided in second half (the pace somewhat loses there). The investigative part is good and keeps you guessing between super-natural things (guddada bhoota, angaraka, bramha rakshasa) and someone doing it for a reason. The climax is neatly shot and Sai Kumar performance is amazing especially at the climax fight!

10,Brilliant movie. Must watch!,"The movie definitely lived up to the hype. Brilliant, it was just brilliant! Acting, story, screenplay, music, scenery, and most importantly, the mystery - everything helped in making it a gripping movie that kept us at the edge of our seats throughout.When the movie reaches the climax, and you get a hang of everything, you can almost hear that collective sigh of relief from everyone - for the mystery, that kept everyone speculate among each other for more than two hours, that was finally revealed, and for the happy realization that the money paid for the movie was pretty damn worth it. Could have shortened the movie a little bit, and this is possibly the only thing one would find, if they dig deep to find a negative about the film.What are you waiting for? Go watch RANGITARANGA.

10,An Excellent Horror and Suspense Thriller,"I saw the movie First day First show. I had high expectations for this movie when i saw the trailer. I fell in love with the Cinematography in trailer itself. The film didn't let me down, There are few Horror-Suspense movies in Kannada like ""Aparichita"" ""Shhh"" and this is one of those movies. Those who would want to see a movie which doesn't has crap love story which other movies focus on so much that they go out of the story line. Love story should be a part of movie not the whole movie.Most of the actor and director of this movie are newcomers and they have done an excellent job with this movie. I would say please go watch this movie in theater itself to get that thrilling experience and encourage them.The best part of the whole movie is the Cinematography which was the plus point and makes you not move your eyes away from screen. Go for it guys watch it. To those guys who like movie having over-fighting where all of them fly 5 feet from ground so called as ""mass"" this is not for you.",excellent horror suspense thriller,i saw movie first day first show i had high expectations this movie when i saw trailer i fell love with cinematography trailer itself film didnt let me down there are few horror suspense movies kannada like aparichita shhh this is one those movies those who would want see movie which doesnt has crap love story which other movies focus so much that they go out story line love story should be part movie not whole movie most actor director this movie are newcomers they have done excellent job with this movie i would say please go watch this movie theater itself get that thrilling experience encourage them best part whole movie is cinematography which was plus point makes you not move your eyes away screen go it guys watch it those guys who like movie having over fighting where all them fly 5 feet ground so called as mass this is not you,0.5405555555555557,0.3015497076023392,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.25}"
5,"Everything wrong in ""Rangitaranga"" in 1000 words or less.","This review is Personal opinion of a Common film Goer.First off the good points: Cinematography is brilliant in most places. It was let down at few places(like Harini falling into well, etc..).BGM is apt and beautifully provided.LYRICS for all the songs 10/10.Saikumar's acting and screen presence just carried the script forward and is the saving grace for the film.This being said I would like to say few points about the movie which just drops the movies standards drastically(reverse exponential).1) Wrong Casting - Hero somehow forgot that acting is all about emoting. Dead expression throughout the movie. Zombies in some RPG games give better expressions than the hero. It gets even more evident when co stars are doing a good job and his expression is a dud. All he did was smoke some 50 odd cigarettes in the movie. Coming up next is the first heroine(the killer).Though she was far better in emoting than the Hero, probably due to the directors request or to not make the hero look bad she was not giving the right expressions and there was a disconnect. She definitely did not act like a 8 month old pregnant lady. The second heroine(the reporter) on the other hand did give some expressions here and there and it felt she could have essayed the role of the first heroine. The directors cameo in the Heroine's flashback creates confusion as to whether it is the hero who is in the flashback.(Marriage song seq. n thereafter).He could have easily casted some other actor for this role and avoided this.2) Unnecessary twists/turns throughout/Poor storyline - Twists and turns in the movie should be provided to fit the story. ""Rangitaranga"" felt like the story was revolving around these forcefully written twists and turns. 3) Heroine commits a murder and no one even cares what happened after that??!!!!4)Hero loses memory in the accident. What happened to his family/friends? No one even tried to find out what happened to him ??Did he live/die?? Forget it. The Heroine(reporter) who was so so deeply in love with the hero does not even try searching for him?? OK just imagine she ""ASSUMES"" he is dead. When you meet a person after 5 years whom you so dearly loved and presumed dead, what would the reaction be?? Just a faint suspicion??She doesn't even have a drop of tear in her eye??Forget about love.Finally when Harini's dairy is read she remembers ""OH S**T!!"" I have to cry now. This is were the scripts weakness is openly visible.5)Saikumar's role gets psycho only during particular month of the year and for his luck he finds pregnant ladies during this time to kill. Rest of the year he is a cool person leading a normal life.d)Kamarottu is such a small place and even though the police cannot catch the Hero and Heroine going about freely in their car.6)Flashback scene: Hero's bike and Heroine's Audi car meet with an accident. The Audi is in flames and the bike just has a broken rear view mirror. Worst still heroine jumps out of the Audi miraculously and saves herself. At least could have used a Nano/Maruthi 800 to make it believable to the audience.7) Harini just assumes that Hero will lose his memory after the accident and spins a story that she is his wife. Such a huge gamble pays off well for her and she ends up escaping getting convicted for murder and lives a happy life thereafter.8)What was the point of Hero writing novels in the name of ""ANASHKU"". Was it the heroines plan to avoid detection? I mean a normal author would any day want to know his readers and be famous.9) Saikumars character clearly sees a guy(with clothes in hand) escaping the house when he comes home. Even then he assumes a skinny guy like Angara who is nowhere built like the person who escaped is the guy his wife is having an affair.10)The doctor easily accepts and tells that he has nothing to do with death of ""Anasuyya"" even without the slightest of persuasion by the main lead. 11)Dialogues are a huge letdown.Heroine asking hero to get a monkey tattoo on hand as representation of father was a new down in dialogue writing.12)Some Song sequence(Yakshagana song) felt like it was just fitted in the storyline and did not go along with the sequence.(adding to it the hero ruining Yakshagana in that song :X :X)13) The Yakshagana makeup made for the Hero could have made for Saikumar's role as it would have added more value to the scene.(Climax scene Saikumar's forehead looked void on the big screen). 14) Records in the police station are so neatly arranged and easily accessible. Yeah they just keep all the records in order so that anyone can access it hassle free. Deaths are happening in village at the same time every year and police don't crack the pattern. While our hero does it with Élan.Even though ""Rangitaranga"" brings new wave in Kannada film industry it is high time directors stepped up and avoid loopholes making cult movies which would propel the fame of Kannada films to its previous glory.Audience also needs to be responsible enough while praising movies as this is the image it creates throughout India/World and what our films are about. Praising a movie for its attempt is completely different from calling it a cult movie. With a little bit of effort in preproduction work,this could well have been a CULT movie like Lucia, Ulidavaru Kandathe, Jatta.PS: Have watched this movie 5 times and the audience are restless to get out of the theater due to various factors of the film. Still the movie garners 87% rating in book my show and 9.5 rating on IMDb. Mind = Blown.

3,Good first half but second half is confused tale telling,"Positives --------- 1. Cinematography mostly well done 2. Captured beautiful natural sceneries as well as some of the rich cultural heritage of Southern India through film lenses 3. Very interesting first half and the special ending at intermission made me wondered if it can surprise me similarly to the ""Sixth sense"" movie. 4. Good acting from - Karthi Rao kordale (Rafiq), Nirup Bhandari (Siddhartha or Gautham), Radhika Chetan (Harini or Indu), Arvind Rao (Inspector)Negatives --------- 1. Complex ideas were mixed and made the second half of the film a potpourri masala - ideas such as bhoota (almost a equivalent to ghost) bungalow, serial killer, memory loss, change of identities, sand mafia etc. all were mixed, grinded and confused 2. Some songs were unnecessary. Some songs such as Kele Cheluve could even brought out more of the cultural heritages 3. Some actors were given a south canara roles but did not fit their character to it (including the language) - bit disappointed with Kalinga bhatta, School Master etc. played be veteran actors 4. Some dialogue errors - e.g. in the first half, hero tells the police that he lost his wife since two days and then few minutes later he says that he last saw her on the previous evening. 5. Some characters had no significance - such as Pandu & his wife. Should have brought Pandu with the journalist to Kamarottu. 6. Second half story leads to several unrealistic lines : i) After the car accident how some one can so easily change identities and survive for so many years ii) How the bhoota, apparently a one man show manages to scare people in the car like a ghost (has the ability to appear & disappear). Even for the first scene, how this one man knows a pregnant lady is traveling through these roads in the night alone, especially when she landed up in this road because she mistakenly took a different diversion. (does this criminal has super natural powers to know all this in advance?) iii) How in such a small village of Kamarottu, the hero and his journalist friend can roam around freely for many days when the police is hunting for them. iv) How one murderer of 11 people mostly pregnant women in a small village escape for 12 years when every one knows the killing screams were heard from the kalinga's ancestral property v) Not sure who tells the audience the incident of killing of Angara. Anusuya bhat and Angara were dead and Kalinga bhat does not disclose his crimes. vi) The haunted home has little to do with acts of the serial killer, so unnecessary mixing of elements leads to confusion vii) There is also a cultural error - At times it felt like yakshagaana and bhoota (or thaiyyam)concepts seems to have mixed.All these made me feel that the story was stitched in short pieces and the overall flow and reality checks were lacked.With respect to other Kannada films I can rate this as 4 to 5, but in the global film standards it can be rated between 2 to 3.It is a brave effort from the director and the cast and I would be very happy to see the improved efforts in their next projects with respect to reality checks, overall flow to rectify the mistakes of the current project. It will be useful to think each character and its cultural background and psychological state while depicting it. The film may not need many characters but if the ones depicted are made real it appeals a lot (here Rafiq was so naturally played that it connected with the audience immediately).The film made me to believe Kannada film has the capacity to go in the right direction.Thank you",good first half but second half is confused tale telling,positives 1 cinematography mostly well done 2 captured beautiful natural sceneries as well as some rich cultural heritage southern india through film lenses 3 very interesting first half special ending at intermission made me wondered if it can surprise me similarly sixth sense movie 4 good acting karthi rao kordale rafiq nirup bhandari siddhartha or gautham radhika chetan harini or indu arvind rao inspector negatives 1 complex ideas were mixed made second half film potpourri masala ideas such as bhoota almost equivalent ghost bungalow serial killer memory loss change identities sand mafia etc all were mixed grinded confused 2 some songs were unnecessary some songs such as kele cheluve could even brought out more cultural heritages 3 some actors were given south canara roles but did not fit their character it including language bit disappointed with kalinga bhatta school master etc played be veteran actors 4 some dialogue errors e g first half hero tells police that he lost his wife since two days then few minutes later he says that he last saw her previous evening 5 some characters had no significance such as pandu his wife should have brought pandu with journalist kamarottu 6 second half story leads several unrealistic lines i after car accident how some one can so easily change identities survive so many years ii how bhoota apparently one man show manages scare people car like ghost has ability appear disappear even first scene how this one man knows pregnant lady is traveling through these roads night alone especially when she landed up this road because she mistakenly took different diversion does this criminal has super natural powers know all this advance iii how such small village kamarottu hero his journalist friend can roam around freely many days when police is hunting them iv how one murderer 11 people mostly pregnant women small village escape 12 years when every one knows killing screams were heard kalingas ancestral property v not sure who tells audience incident killing angara anusuya bhat angara were dead kalinga bhat does not disclose his crimes vi haunted home has little do with acts serial killer so unnecessary mixing elements leads confusion vii there is also cultural error at times it felt like yakshagaana bhoota or thaiyyam concepts seems have mixed all these made me feel that story was stitched short pieces overall flow reality checks were lacked with respect other kannada films i can rate this as 4 5 but global film standards it can be rated between 2 3 it is brave effort director cast i would be very happy see improved efforts their next projects with respect reality checks overall flow rectify mistakes current project it will be useful think each character its cultural background psychological state while depicting it film may not need many characters but if ones depicted are made real it appeals lot here rafiq was so naturally played that it connected with audience immediately film made me believe kannada film has capacity go right direction thank you,0.3881197334901038,0.06817313345091124,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.34}"

With a wonderful story as the spine, the movie has some impeccable technical work. Amazing direction, crisp editing, music, songs and BGM helps the flow.

Slick editing and mixing, the dairy script as the border of the flashback scenes are a nice touch. Very good (sometimes mature) acting by the debutant(e)s. The girls are not just oomph and acting scared, but adding value to every scene. Could have chosen more local actors like the adorable driver Rapeeqk :) for the teacher and postmaster roles.

6,Revival of cult classic Guddada Bhootha.,"Rangitaranga (Kannada) is a much decent and an unusual film, probably stands out from the regular trash made in Sandalwood. The plot which draws inspiration from the cult Kannada series ""Guddada bhoota"" (by Sadanand Suvarna) is cleverly written and is bound to impress for folks who like to see the twists and turns. Whilst most films suffer at the execution level Rangitaranga is surprisingly neat, thanks to the cinematography of William David and Lance Kaplan and background score of Ajaneesh Loknath. The choice of bringing in the DOPs from abroad seems to have created a magical feel. The frames are pretty good and most of the shots are smooth flowing. The background score by Ajaneesh suits the mysterious feel that is much needed for the film and the climax score bit is brilliant. Radhika is brilliant and its good to see that Anup has really helped her getting her to do her best. Nirup playing the main protagonist has really taken the risk. It is a difficult role to play at least for a debut. Though he struggles with his mannerisms he reminded me much of Ajay Devgan in his earlier days. Nirup has some great eyes which he seems to have put into use. The role itself has many shades that its hard to put him under any sort of usual buckets that we have. Hope his work gets noticed and we get to see more of him. Avantika is probably the weakest when it comes to the main characters but she fits in and has performed well. But there is some strange feeling about her dialogue delivery. You will get to know when you probably watch the film. Sai Kumar plays a role which is very different from his usual forte but its hard to say if anyone else would fit that role. Out of the main characters his is the only one character which is native to the region the narrative takes place and the Dakshina Kannada accent seems to have taken a beating, something that needed some thoughts on. The first half of Rangitaranga goes real good and during the intermission it does put you into thinking mode. However there is a drop as the second half begins, as the narrative gets into a catch up mode going onto flashbacks with back to back songs. Most narratives have this problem of the tempo going down in the beginning of the second half and probably the lengthy flashbacks could have been crisp to keep the experience graph at the same level. Though there are considerably some significant amount of continuity issues in terms of shots which come over there are many things to catch on that these nuances tend to get forgotten. the edits seem to have some issues. There is a problem when you place two scenes side by side , a scene in the night time followed by a shot during the day and again night. This creates a jarring effect and your brain does not digest such transition unless something more important is fed to fade that though out. Some of the characters really do not have much to do with the main plot could have easily be chopped off to shorten the runtime. Rangitaranga does have this shortcomings and could have gotten much better however as a whole the experience what it has to deliver is put across. Its definitely good to see in a new team pitching in the industry which is haunted by big budget boredom remakes. If you are aware of the experience of goosebumps then i got it around thrice and twice during the ""Dennana Dennana""",revival cult classic guddada bhootha,rangitaranga kannada is much decent unusual film probably stands out regular trash made sandalwood plot which draws inspiration cult kannada series guddada bhoota by sadanand suvarna is cleverly written is bound impress folks who like see twists turns whilst most films suffer at execution level rangitaranga is surprisingly neat thanks cinematography william david lance kaplan background score ajaneesh loknath choice bringing dops abroad seems have created magical feel frames are pretty good most shots are smooth flowing background score by ajaneesh suits mysterious feel that is much needed film climax score bit is brilliant radhika is brilliant its good see that anup has really helped her getting her do her best nirup playing main protagonist has really taken risk it is difficult role play at least debut though he struggles with his mannerisms he reminded me much ajay devgan his earlier days nirup has some great eyes which he seems have put into use role itself has many shades that its hard put him under any sort usual buckets that we have hope his work gets noticed we get see more him avantika is probably weakest when it comes main characters but she fits has performed well but there is some strange feeling about her dialogue delivery you will get know when you probably watch film sai kumar plays role which is very different his usual forte but its hard say if anyone else would fit that role out main characters his is only one character which is native region narrative takes place dakshina kannada accent seems have taken beating something that needed some thoughts first half rangitaranga goes real good during intermission it does put you into thinking mode however there is drop as second half begins as narrative gets into catch up mode going onto flashbacks with back back songs most narratives have this problem tempo going down beginning second half probably lengthy flashbacks could have been crisp keep experience graph at same level though there are considerably some significant amount continuity issues terms shots which come over there are many things catch that these nuances tend get forgotten edits seem have some issues there is problem when you place two scenes side by side scene night time followed by shot during day again night this creates jarring effect your brain does not digest such transition unless something more important is fed fade that though out some characters really do not have much do with main plot could have easily be chopped off shorten runtime rangitaranga does have this shortcomings could have gotten much better however as whole experience what it has deliver is put across its definitely good see new team pitching industry which is haunted by big budget boredom remakes if you are aware experience goosebumps then i got it around thrice twice during dennana dennana,0.46422094245623646,0.2238599227569816,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"

4,Brilliant concept ruined by mediocre acting and direction,"The movie caught my attention when I saw the ""Sold Out"" board hung in front of DRC Cinemas counter in Mysore and oh yes, I wanted to watch this movie badly as it has been quite a while since new plots had emerged in Kannada cinema. I let out a gasp when I saw the yellow figure peering from the rear-view mirror of the car stuck in the rain, and I knew I was all set for an amazing movie experience. It did deliver everything I had expected, till the introduction of Arvind Rao after which everything just fell apart.What I liked:Brilliant concept of keeping the audience guessing in the first half, definitely an edge of a seat experience. Good acting by both the female protagonists. Chilling BGS. Loved Rafiq's natural acting. What I did not like:The main lead was a huge letdown, I kept wishing that there should have been an experienced actor is his place for such a nice concept. The hurry to throw in a stunning climax at the end leads to many unanswered questions and irrelevant scenes related to the first half of the movie. There is no time to emotionally connect to the characters; especially the one Harini has with the guy who keeps stalking her, he is seen in one scene in a song and then he is dead, poor guy. Too many songs in the second half.
