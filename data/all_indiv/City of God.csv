10.0,A Brazilian masterwork,"Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be ""entertained"". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.Overall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox",brazilian masterwork,such amazing film that deserves accolades acclaimed hype its garnered one best foreign language films there is one best films personally seen recently after long time being my see list but taking while get round it due being so busy going through difficult phase perhaps city god is not everybody it is not some audience members idea being entertaining is pretty unflinching uncompromising challenges viewer it does with that being said superlative job bringing those qualities life there are others including myself who judge films by what they set out do rather than just wanting be entertained there are many hugely entertaining films while there are others that are clearly intended be things other than entertainment either are deep character studies deliberate mood pieces poignant dramas shouldnt be denounced because stereotypical views what film should be like city god is very well made with some stunning hard hitting images even if budget is not high or enormous its all audaciously shot edited with lot gritty atmosphere sense tension music fits well has some haunting moments without being intrusive while fernando meirelless direction particularly visual style is superb story is not hard follow with lots provoking thought tension emotion while action is positively explosive frighteningly brutal designed with real meticulousness no way either does it glamorise crime gives unflinching view gangland rivalry provoking comparisons martin scorsese goodfellas alexandre rodrigues leandro firmino da hora are fabulous their roles carry film their compellingly real characters adeptly overall masterwork 10 10 bethany cox,0.5277600327600329,0.12571457821457824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Gangs of Rio,"If you're unlucky to be born into a socially, economically and racially isolated community that has poverty, crime, drugs and violence as its everyday realities, the odds are stacked incredibly high against you. It literally takes so much effort, strength, struggle and plain ol' good fortune to simply avoid becoming a gangster, let alone do anything more with life. Most who find themselves in the situation described above never even enter this fight and out of those that do - only the rare ones succeed.""City of God"" depicts this conundrum masterfully. In a Rio slum called Cidade de Deus we meet character after character that has the right idea, knowledge and courage to get out but somehow always ends up being pulled right back into this vicious circle. Becoming a hoodlum in Cidade de Deus isn't just a fringe career option for disenchanted rebels and social outcasts - it's the main industry.The images of gun toting pre-teen killers are very disturbing and Meirelles uses them relentlessly to underscore just how hopeless and frighteningly predetermined life is for these kids. Many of them can't read or write but already know how to use a gun and kill without remorse. In a particularly harrowing scene, local drug lord Ze Pequeno or Lil' Ze (Leandro Firmino da Hora) exacts revenge on a disobedient gang of 9 and 10 year olds by incapacitating two of them and forcing one of his own kid soldiers, as initiation of sorts, to choose which one of the two he wants to kill. Faced with death, one of the kids starts crying crocodile tears; suddenly all the bravado is gone and he is shown for what he truly is - a desperately misdirected infant.'If only these people had more options....' is the sentiment reinforced with every gruesome event. Of course, this lifestyle comes a little more naturally to some than to others. Ze Pequeno, for example, from an early age when he was known as Dadinho / Lil' Dice shows a considerable lack of aversion to blood and death. In another aptly choreographed scene so that we don't know what exactly happened until much later, he more than 'holds his own' alongside much older gangsters during a motel stickup. Also on hand is a colourful palette of characters. From our narrator Buscape / Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) whose ticket out of the slum is his love of photography over to people like laidback Bene / Benny (Philippe Haagensen), followed by Ze's fierce rival Cenoura / Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele) or good guy turned bad (although it's not so simple) Mane Galinha / Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge) we see a multidimensional, pulsating, alive community that seems in need of a strong, sustained outside push to finally stop chasing its own tail and get out of this destructive cycle.",gangs rio,if youre unlucky be born into socially economically racially isolated community that has poverty crime drugs violence as its everyday realities odds are stacked incredibly high against you it literally takes so much effort strength struggle plain ol good fortune simply avoid becoming gangster let alone do anything more with life most who find themselves situation described above never even enter this fight out those that do only rare ones succeed city god depicts this conundrum masterfully rio slum called cidade de deus we meet character after character that has right idea knowledge courage get out but somehow always ends up being pulled right back into this vicious circle becoming hoodlum cidade de deus isnt just fringe career option disenchanted rebels social outcasts its main industry images gun toting pre teen killers are very disturbing meirelles uses them relentlessly underscore just how hopeless frighteningly predetermined life is these kids many them cant read or write but already know how use gun kill without remorse particularly harrowing scene local drug lord ze pequeno or lil ze leandro firmino da hora exacts revenge disobedient gang 9 10 year olds by incapacitating two them forcing one his own kid soldiers as initiation sorts choose which one two he wants kill faced with death one kids starts crying crocodile tears suddenly all bravado is gone he is shown what he truly is desperately misdirected infant if only these people had more options is sentiment reinforced with every gruesome event course this lifestyle comes little more naturally some than others ze pequeno example early age when he was known as dadinho lil dice shows considerable lack aversion blood death another aptly choreographed scene so that we dont know what exactly happened until much later he more than holds his own alongside much older gangsters during motel stickup also hand is colourful palette characters our narrator buscape rocket alexandre rodrigues whose ticket out slum is his love photography over people like laidback bene benny philippe haagensen followed by zes fierce rival cenoura carrot matheus nachtergaele or good guy turned bad although its not so simple mane galinha knockout ned seu jorge we see multidimensional pulsating alive community that seems need strong sustained outside push finally stop chasing its own tail get out this destructive cycle,0.559640768588137,0.11397034252297408,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Stunning - in every sense of the word,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesn't reach the 30's and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Goodfellas"", but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed.",stunning every sense word,cidade de deus seems have lot praise imdb boards with good reason too it simply is my opinion one best contemporary films ever made based true events characters who live overlooked poverty stricken slums shadows rio de janiero where life expectancy doesnt reach 30s drug dealers are kings tale city god its myriad characters is told by rocket young man who struggles make something his life other than wind up another victim drugs or gang wars not only are characters city god absolutely fascinating also very endearing but also convincingly acted by groups young unknown actors stoies are well told at times funny at others brutally shocking cinematic style film gives nod tarantino with some clever time jumping freeze framing texts indicating another chapter film every sense bit brazillian pulp fiction or goodfellas but with its own unique flavour it city god is marvel highly recommended film watch but not recommended over sensitive or easily distressed,0.6482190476190476,0.22752121212121212,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,"Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling","Do not be fooled by the coy charm of the promotional poster. The image of the girl shyly leaning over to kiss the cheek of a bare-backed boy on golden sands drenched in sunlight represents an ideal that many residents of the City of God strive for, but few achieve. The rewards are all too tangible: The football, the music, the heady culture of samba and carnival joie de vivre is never far away, but escaping from the slums of Rio is a little more complicated than sloping off to the beach for the afternoon. The City of God is a raging maelstrom of violence, drugs and gang warfare, and its inhabitants are indoctrinated in the way of the gun from an early age.Fernando Meirelles' film (based on a true story) is a breathtakingly convincing interpretation of life in the notorious Rio favela. Using hundreds of real-life slum children to supplement a superb central cast and shooting entirely around the dusty streets and abject poverty of the neighbourhood, Meirelles charts the history of the area through the narration of Rocket, a peaceable soul with journalistic aspirations who is entirely at odds with the mayhem around him.Rocket explains how the slum was used as a dumping ground for all Rio's undesirables in the 1960s. Despite a population of criminals and ne'er-do-wells, the early part of the film is an homage to plucky underdog cheeriness and community spirit. Rocket's brother is a member of the 'Tender Trio', a dashing group of bandits who go about brandishing pistols and holding up gas trucks like latter day highwaymen. Despite an elegant notoriety, the Trio's crimes tend to yield less than impressive fiscal reward, so they plan a heist on a motel-cum-knocking shop in an attempt to up the ante. It goes badly wrong. The gang's lily-livered tendencies mean they make a sharp exit at the first sniff of trouble but, unbeknownst to them, their lookout, unhappy with his passive role in proceedings (as bored nine-year-old little brothers are wont to be), strolls into the motel and fires at will, chortling psychotically as each hooker and john crumples to the floor.The kid in question is L'il Dice, a chubby Arnold-out-of-Diff'rent-Strokes lookalike with an insatiable lust for mayhem. The motel incident marks a shift in emphasis for the City of God and the following years see the slum descend into chaos as L'il Dice (later renamed L'il Ze) builds a narcotics empire by ruthlessly eliminating the competition. The streets become a recruiting ground for drug dealers and gang lieutenants. Small children (or 'runts' as they are affectionately known) come to see guns and criminal activity as the only viable rungs up the status ladder. 'I smoke, I snort, I've killed and robbed - I'm a man,' one prepubescent boy states defiantly.The film culminates in all-out war between L'il Ze's bunch of hoodlums and an idealistic group of insubordinates who throng behind the handsome Knockout Ned after he stands up to Ze's cruel regime. Meirelles is careful not to lionise Ned. Turning him into a hero figure would, I suppose, have romanticised a bitter and essentially futile conflict. Rocket, caught in the middle of the hostility highlights the ultimate irony: 'By the end, after years of fighting, nobody could remember how it all started,' he says. The war becomes the way of life in the favela. Being affiliated to one of the gangs gives the street kids credibility and, more importantly, access to weapons. Before long, guns are being handed out like lollipops, and the runts are running about excitedly firing their new 'toys' indiscriminately. It is the ultimate in power without responsibility.In their breathless exaltations, many reviewers have dubbed City of God 'Brazil's answer to Goodfellas'. It is a comparison that may be sound in terms of structure  Meirelles has certainly mastered Scorsese's canny editing and daring method of chronicling events over long periods of time  but overall this is a different beast. It is more of a Lord of the Flies with AK-47s. The most alarming aspect of all is the shocking lack of parental presence.This is essential in conveying the choices these street children have (or rather don't have). L'il Ze and his barbaric ilk become all these poor, impressionable little tykes have to aspire to. In short: they don't stand a chance  a fact sharply illustrated in one particularly distressing and almost unwatchable initiation scene where a young gang recruit is required to murder a cornered infant in order to appease his older colleagues.But Meireilles does not let this base, visceral tone swamp his movie. In Rocket he has an inspirational protagonist  the perfect foil to the madness and despair. His coming of age scenes where he bashfully attempts to flirt with girls and lose his virginity; and the sequence where he and his mate resort to petty crime only to bottle out when their intended victims turn out to be 'way too cool' to rob are the glue that holds the drama together. Without the light relief this would be intense and depressing fare.As it is, City of God is a triumph of story-telling: Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling, it is cinema of the very highest order.Do not miss it.10/10",magnificent gut wrenching utterly compelling,do not be fooled by coy charm promotional poster image girl shyly leaning over kiss cheek bare backed boy golden sands drenched sunlight represents ideal that many residents city god strive but few achieve rewards are all too tangible football music heady culture samba carnival joie de vivre is never far away but escaping slums rio is little more complicated than sloping off beach afternoon city god is raging maelstrom violence drugs gang warfare its inhabitants are indoctrinated way gun early age fernando meirelles film based true story is breathtakingly convincing interpretation life notorious rio favela using hundreds real life slum children supplement superb central cast shooting entirely around dusty streets abject poverty neighbourhood meirelles charts history area through narration rocket peaceable soul with journalistic aspirations who is entirely at odds with mayhem around him rocket explains how slum was used as dumping ground all rios undesirables 1960s despite population criminals neer do wells early part film is homage plucky underdog cheeriness community spirit rockets brother is member tender trio dashing group bandits who go about brandishing pistols holding up gas trucks like latter day highwaymen despite elegant notoriety trios crimes tend yield less than impressive fiscal reward so they plan heist motel cum knocking shop attempt up ante it goes badly wrong gangs lily livered tendencies mean they make sharp exit at first sniff trouble but unbeknownst them their lookout unhappy with his passive role proceedings as bored nine year old little brothers are wont be strolls into motel fires at will chortling psychotically as each hooker john crumples floor kid question is lil dice chubby arnold out diffrent strokes lookalike with insatiable lust mayhem motel incident marks shift emphasis city god following years see slum descend into chaos as lil dice later renamed lil ze builds narcotics empire by ruthlessly eliminating competition streets become recruiting ground drug dealers gang lieutenants small children or runts as they are affectionately known come see guns criminal activity as only viable rungs up status ladder i smoke i snort ive killed robbed im man one prepubescent boy states defiantly film culminates all out war between lil zes bunch hoodlums idealistic group insubordinates who throng behind handsome knockout ned after he stands up zes cruel regime meirelles is careful not lionise ned turning him into hero figure would i suppose have romanticised bitter essentially futile conflict rocket caught middle hostility highlights ultimate irony by end after years fighting nobody could remember how it all started he says war becomes way life favela being affiliated one gangs gives street kids credibility more importantly access weapons before long guns are being handed out like lollipops runts are running about excitedly firing their new toys indiscriminately it is ultimate power without responsibility their breathless exaltations many reviewers have dubbed city god brazils answer goodfellas it is comparison that may be sound terms structure meirelles has certainly mastered scorseses canny editing daring method chronicling events over long periods time but overall this is different beast it is more lord flies with ak 47s most alarming aspect all is shocking lack parental presence this is essential conveying choices these street children have or rather dont have lil ze his barbaric ilk become all these poor impressionable little tykes have aspire short they dont stand chance fact sharply illustrated one particularly distressing almost unwatchable initiation scene where young gang recruit is required murder cornered infant order appease his older colleagues but meireilles does not let this base visceral tone swamp his movie rocket he has inspirational protagonist perfect foil madness despair his coming age scenes where he bashfully attempts flirt with girls lose his virginity sequence where he his mate resort petty crime only bottle out when their intended victims turn out be way too cool rob are glue that holds drama together without light relief this would be intense depressing fare as it is city god is triumph story telling magnificent gut wrenching utterly compelling it is cinema very highest order do not miss it 10 10,0.599763579674294,0.06389661925376214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,"Shocking, Stylish & Brutal Story","Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it.This also is one of those ""based on a true story"" films which makes it even more shocking, if its mostly true. The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs.

10.0,One of the best unseen foreign films,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.The characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is ""Lil' Dice's"" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.The City of God is a world you don't want to visit, it won't be featured on a post card, and it's said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it's violent temptation. More importantly, it's about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it's worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.You see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition.",one best unseen foreign films,i have seen this movie only recently 2005 its easily one better foreign films i have seen actually its probably just about one best films i had ever seen characters really make this movie come alive with each their compelling personalities shining though backdrop oppressive conditions constant violence one thing which clearly comes mind is lil dices ear ear smile so vivid yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil city god is world you dont want visit it wont be featured post card its said be city ignored by god himself this movie makes you feel uncomfortable puts you edge your seat you are right into middle city you too are caught up its violent temptation more importantly its about triumph human spirit against all odds this movie effect is fast paced hard follow with added stress subtitles over portuguese but its worth it fact really adds impetuous impulsive undertones movie addition quintessential brazilian music blending into film like well made caprahina makes it feel authentic like italian music god father you see flaws these men played out almost fatalistic nature hated greed futility it all we see ourselves our own flaws our own condition,0.5064965986394556,0.12333333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Cidade De Deus,"The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God. The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket. The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component. The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons. The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation. And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here. The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker. Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script. This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction. However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed. The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic. But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles, has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing. Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses. Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses. As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath. Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does. The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality. But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior. The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject. Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them. As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person. Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film. Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to. This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros. Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies. In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect. Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed. The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far. Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.

,One of my top 10,"I have made an effort to watch all the movies in IMDb's top 100 rated list. As of now, I'm looking for a place where the DVD for Sunset Blvd. is (currently at #30). But this movie is one of the movies I've seen that's on the list. And I find it an amazing film (currently #5 on my top 10 list). What I enjoy about this film is the visual look of the film, but also the way the director puts you in the story. At the end of the film you have become friends with just about everyone in the film, even though some of the characters are very despicable people. The violence hits you in the chest like a load of bricks sometimes, especially when you recognize that many of the kids involved in the violence are right around 10 or 11, but you also realize that this reflects the culture of the slum these kids live in.Gangster films always seem to make for good dramas (e.g. the Godfather, Goodfellas), where the culture of evil almost always triumphs as the dominant character. This film is no different, but it shows the life of children in places where bribery and corruption reigns supreme. It also shows the bravery of many of these people when even the government won't stick up for them.If you're thinking of starting to watch some foreign language films, this is a good place to start. It is a classic IMO among films made in languages besides English. I did find that the subtitles in this film were done rather poorly (they displayed on my DVD player at the wrong times and it took a few plays to figure out who was saying what.) But I think the film itself is a truly great film.",one my top 10,i have made effort watch all movies imdbs top 100 rated list as now im looking place where dvd sunset blvd is currently at but this movie is one movies ive seen thats list i find it amazing film currently my top 10 list what i enjoy about this film is visual look film but also way director puts you story at end film you have become friends with just about everyone film even though some characters are very despicable people violence hits you chest like load bricks sometimes especially when you recognize that many kids involved violence are right around 10 or 11 but you also realize that this reflects culture slum these kids live gangster films always seem make good dramas e g godfather goodfellas where culture evil almost always triumphs as dominant character this film is no different but it shows life children places where bribery corruption reigns supreme it also shows bravery many these people when even government wont stick up them if youre thinking starting watch some foreign language films this is good place start it is classic imo among films made languages besides english i did find that subtitles this film were done rather poorly they displayed my dvd player at wrong times it took few plays figure out who was saying what but i think film itself is truly great film,0.487095238095238,0.17054978354978353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Sprawling crime masterwork from Brazil,"Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.The film follows the misadventures of various, almost feral children as they attempt to eke out an existence and then a living as they grow up in a Rio de Janeiro slum in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The central narrator isn't a gangster at heart; all he wants is to become a photographer and yet he's caught up time and time again in the violence surrounding his drug-dealing friends. Particularly good is Leandro Firmino as Li'l Ze, a psychotic hood who becomes a gang leader and who thinks nothing of having kids executed if they dare so much as get in his way.The direction is top notch, with Fernando Meirelles employing hand cameras on more than one occasion, so that this has a vivid, on the street look to it. The editing is slick and sleek, the music fits the action perfectly, and almost every actor seems to fit his or her role like a glove. I'm trying to think of things to criticise, but there's nothing, really: the story drew me in, got me interested in finding out what happened to the characters, and before I knew it a good two and a half hours had gone by while I sat back and was lost in this film's world. Of course, it's a tremendously violent movie, unflinching in its depiction of violence against children, and one of the most hard-hitting films I've witnessed, so not for those who prefer family-friendly fare; but if you're up for it, this just might be one of the best, most realistic crime films ever made.",sprawling crime masterwork brazil,wow what great movie id heard plenty about this low budget brazilian gangster film before i got around seeing it when it showed television middle night but i was fully prepared be disappointed many times film has been hyped up so much that its let down when i finally see it but not so this one city god is tremendous film masterpiece fact many ways its like lower budget more realistic version classic gangster films made by likes martin scorcese guy ritchie many places it equals heights those two directors at top their game film follows misadventures various almost feral children as they attempt eke out existence then living as they grow up rio de janeiro slum 60s 70s 80s central narrator isnt gangster at heart all he wants is become photographer yet hes caught up time time again violence surrounding his drug dealing friends particularly good is leandro firmino as lil ze psychotic hood who becomes gang leader who thinks nothing having kids executed if they dare so much as get his way direction is top notch with fernando meirelles employing hand cameras more than one occasion so that this has vivid street look it editing is slick sleek music fits action perfectly almost every actor seems fit his or her role like glove im trying think things criticise but theres nothing really story drew me got me interested finding out what happened characters before i knew it good two half hours had gone by while i sat back was lost this films world course its tremendously violent movie unflinching its depiction violence against children one most hard hitting films ive witnessed so not those who prefer family friendly fare but if youre up it this just might be one best most realistic crime films ever made,0.4787037037037037,0.19927248677248674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.17}"

Although I have not been into any ""favella"" (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.The style and the look remind you a little bit of a documentary, just to make things scarier/real. It fully achieves it's goal. The ""actors"" (the director mostly used people who really live or lived in Brazilian ghetto) are superb too. And since the story is well written and told, there is nothing more you could wish for.

10.0,The Other (Sad) Side of the Wonderful City of Rio de Janeiro,"The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepaguá, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons. This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family. I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God"")",other sad side wonderful city rio de janeiro,story begins present days barbecue party slum cidade de deus with some bandits chasing chicken then teenager called buscap alexandre rodrigues tells story cidade de deus main characters movie z pequeno ben cenoura etc since they were kids this movie takes place cidade de deus set buildings originally built 60s poor persons originated big flooding rio some slums 60s this area was isolated without any infrastructure nowadays with construction boom it is located close barra da tijuca jacarepagu very valuables zones rio de janeiro city is surrounded by slums where situation presented film is reality thousands thousands honest poor persons this movie is remarkable screenplay direction performance cast everything works perfectly frantic camera looks like documentary today dvd was released brazil i bought it i have just watched it with my family i really can imagine reaction foreigners watching this sad side rio de janeiro it is strange because person who does not live rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates some aspects however this is our reality lost bullets robberies violence is part our day by day life by other hand same person may think that life rio stinks again it is not true my city like golden coin has two sides heads tails if you can afford you have wonderful places live but unfortunately great part population lives slums like ones showed this movie lack perspective life children unemployment ridiculous salaries lack education lack faith all these factors contributes formation next generation drug dealers bandits traffic offers positions kids like showed this movie end even when grown ups are arrested or murdered there is bunch children occupy spot sad social problem but true my vote is ten title brazil cidade de deus city god,0.5183823529411764,0.07749554367201428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,"""One of the best films you'll ever see!""--Roger Ebert, does it live up to the hype?","The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence. The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all. 10/10, A+Would also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru",one best films youll ever see roger ebert does it live up hype,film revolves around city god favela or ghetto rio de janeiro brazil horrifying area where drug dealers run community where children killing children is not uncommon occurrence story begins with early stages city god 1960s showing where many problems stem extreme poverty overcrowding etc here early stages favela we meet our main characters along with supporting cast story revolves mainly around two characters living favela rocket lil ze how they take two different paths through life rockets dream is become photographer escape city god while lil ze becomes powerful gang leader drug dealer film offers unflinching look at gang life city god as it follows favela through three decades 60s 70s 80s shows how violence just spirals into more violence with disturbingly high amounts violence favela most involving teenagers children direction cinematography editing are all oscar worthy cinematography is some best i have ever seen with very visceral jerky feel very reminiscent saving private ryan editing is very frantic which makes you feel like you are streets city god direction is flawless seamlessly blending many elements story film was definitely one best films i have ever seen story direction cinematography editing acting all add up make excellent movie that i would recommend all 10 10 would also recommend bus 174 carandiru,0.5093888888888889,0.2629343434343434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.47}"
7.0,Excellent and violent film based on real events,"The movie deals about children and adolescent factions in the impoverished Favelas , Rio Janeiro , for 1960 and 1970 years . And it centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by means of the photography . The final confrontation among the motley gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody . In the motion picture there are shocks , emotion , sex , violence and a little bit of social criticism . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and that's why it isn't boring but it results to be enjoyable . The picture is similar other film from 1981 : ¨Pixote¨ (Hector Babenco) that was likeness in atmosphere and showing the delinquent vagrants . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of juvenile paupers and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro city , where teens and children become into burglars and assassins . The movie was not actually shot in Cidade De Deus slum as it was too dangerous ; it was shot in a neighbouring , less dangerous área . Principal actors' interpretation is outstanding , in spite of most are newcomers . All of the amateur actors were recruited from Favelas (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, and a couple of them actually lived in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) itself . Fernando Mereilles direction is awesome and stylish , he even has been hired by Hollywood to make lavish films . The motion picture had an Oscar nomination and obtained a lot of success at box office around the world . The movie is produced by Walter Salles , the best director and production manager from Brazil .The film is rated ¨R¨ for crude murders and sex and isn't apt for boys , only for old people (+18) , neither squeamish. The flick will appeal to social drama and thoughtful films lovers . Rating: 7/10.

,An unsparing portrait of a sociopathic generation,"""After the first death, there is no other"" - Dylan ThomasIn Brazil there are 120 million people. 50% of them are under 21. 28 million of them live below the lowest standards set by the International Children's Rights Agency of the United Nations. Last year 7,000 boys from 12- to 22-years old died in shootings. This is the background for the disturbing Brazilian film, City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund. City of God is a ""favela"" (government housing project) on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro where the Brazilian government dumped undesirables and homeless in the 1960s. The film is based on real events described in a novel by Paulo Lins, who lived in the project for thirty years and spent ten years researching the events. It is an unsparing portrait of a sociopathic generation, where manhood is determined by who can kill the most. When a child is ridiculed for being too young to join one of the gangs, he replies, ""I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man."" The film traces the favela's history over the span of three decades, showing how its children first became petty thieves, then drug dealers, and finally cold-blooded murderers. To make the film, 2,000 children who lived in the City of God were auditioned and 200 were chosen to go to acting workshops where they improvised the scenes. It is narrated by Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who survived the gang warfare and has since become a photographer for a local newspaper. The picture opens with the sharpening of knives and an adrenalized chase scene involving gangsters, guns, a runaway chicken and Rocket coming face to face with the feared gang leader L'il Zé (Leandro Firmino da Hora). It then flashes back to the more sedate 1960s, where three friends, Goose, Shaggy, and Clipper, known as the ""Tender Trio,"" engage in small time robberies and use their guns only to threaten. The remainder of the film is divided into chapters, each depicting different characters and time periods, each extending the violence until it reaches manic proportions.One of the most disturbing scenes involves the holdup of a brothel and the murder of its patrons. A nine-year old named Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) is told to wait outside while the Tender Trio robs the customers. He is told to shoot a window if the police come; instead, however, he goes on a killing spree with a big smile on his face, massacring the patrons in the middle of their lovemaking. The second chapter contains the most gut-wrenching scene of all, when L'il Zé, pursues a gang of ""runts"" who are disobeying his rules, cornering two of the small boys in an alley. He gives a gun to a member of his gang known as Steak-and-Fries (Darlan Cunha), telling him to prove his manhood by killing one of the smaller boys. The two boys start crying, allowing us to witness the real fear beneath the bravado. Yet the madness and violence keeps building from there.City of God is essentially a horror story that hits you with a punch to the solar plexus. It is very powerful, but also desensitizing in its high-tech stylization and dizzying special effects. It becomes so fixated at simulating a cocaine high by jumping from one character to another with breakneck speed that, unlike the 1981 Brazilian film Pixoteby Hector Babenco, it often fails to allow full comprehension of the human aspect involved. Yet the film deserves praise for its honesty in tackling an issue most of us would rather avoid. In the process, it has uncovered the natural raw energy of children, with no place to use it except in self-destruction. It leaves me to wonder how this energy could be harnessed against a system that encourages and perpetuates this cycle of violence.",unsparing portrait sociopathic generation,after first death there is no other dylan thomasin brazil there are 120 million people 50 them are under 21 28 million them live below lowest standards set by international childrens rights agency united nations last year 7 000 boys 12 22 years old died shootings this is background disturbing brazilian film city god directed by fernando meirelles k tia lund city god is favela government housing project outskirts rio de janeiro where brazilian government dumped undesirables homeless 1960s film is based real events described novel by paulo lins who lived project thirty years spent ten years researching events it is unsparing portrait sociopathic generation where manhood is determined by who can kill most when child is ridiculed being too young join one gangs he replies i smoke i snort ive killed robbed im man film traces favelas history over span three decades showing how its children first became petty thieves then drug dealers finally cold blooded murderers make film 2 000 children who lived city god were auditioned 200 were chosen go acting workshops where they improvised scenes it is narrated by rocket alexandre rodrigues who survived gang warfare has since become photographer local newspaper picture opens with sharpening knives adrenalized chase scene involving gangsters guns runaway chicken rocket coming face face with feared gang leader lil z leandro firmino da hora it then flashes back more sedate 1960s where three friends goose shaggy clipper known as tender trio engage small time robberies use their guns only threaten remainder film is divided into chapters each depicting different characters time periods each extending violence until it reaches manic proportions one most disturbing scenes involves holdup brothel murder its patrons nine year old named lil dice douglas silva is told wait outside while tender trio robs customers he is told shoot window if police come instead however he goes killing spree with big smile his face massacring patrons middle their lovemaking second chapter contains most gut wrenching scene all when lil z pursues gang runts who are disobeying his rules cornering two small boys alley he gives gun member his gang known as steak fries darlan cunha telling him prove his manhood by killing one smaller boys two boys start crying allowing us witness real fear beneath bravado yet madness violence keeps building there city god is essentially horror story that hits you with punch solar plexus it is very powerful but also desensitizing its high tech stylization dizzying special effects it becomes so fixated at simulating cocaine high by jumping one character another with breakneck speed that unlike 1981 brazilian film pixoteby hector babenco it often fails allow full comprehension human aspect involved yet film deserves praise its honesty tackling issue most us would rather avoid process it has uncovered natural raw energy children with no place use it except self destruction it leaves me wonder how this energy could be harnessed against system that encourages perpetuates this cycle violence,0.3764854242979243,0.03302577630702631,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,The Best Film Ever Made,"Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, ""The Godfather"" reigns supreme as number one, while ""City of God,"" or more appropriately, ""Cidade de Deus,"" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to ""Crash."" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, ""City of God"" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and ""The Godfather"" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, ""City of God."" What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as ""explosive"" for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match ""City of God"" for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the ""City of God"" itself. Characters float in and out, with the ""out"" part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the ""coolest hood in the City of God."" There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a ""please"" or ""thank you."" Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes.",best film ever made,before anyone says anything hear me out according imdb top 250 list godfather reigns supreme as number one while city god or more appropriately cidade de deus is at number 17 slot but compare two is like comparing arnold schwartzenegger movie crash they are just too different but me while francis ford coppollas 1972 film is rightly considered masterpiece city god is more memorable packs bigger punch that godfather has had 30 more years under its belt gather its legendary status its english which sadly makes lot difference now city god what rush fernando meirelless masterpiece is film behold many critics have described films as explosive punch they pack or unflinching reality subject matter but there has been no film i have ever seen that can match city god energy it has so much energy that instead unfolding it throws itself at you all at once leaving everything else be done afterwards actors dont act they dont have time they just are everything is done such extreme its surprising that meirelles manages make none it sensationalistic or exploitative some people will tell you that this film is chronicle two drug lords while there is some truth that plot if one could call it that is better described as chronicle city god itself characters float out with out part frequently involving bang or more likely series them characters are given background only if when they are needed like i said theres really no time develop subtly nuanced performances film moves with such breakneck energy that do so would only slow it down there are only few characters that really matter rocket alexandre rodrigues is our window into hellish slums result isnt voyeuristic instead rocket is more like guide albeit with only narration addressing audience hes normal teen with interests girls particularly angelica alice braga sex aspirations be photographer but his main goal is simply survive each day also note is li ze who we see growing up with taste violence as kid kids shoot kill people just as frequently if not more so than adults his increasingly drug addled brain his ambition makes him more frightening by minute only one who keeps him grounded relatively under control is benny phellipe haagensen coolest hood city god theres some truth that statement as spoken by rocket hes shed brightness this hellish city though hes no goody two shoes finally there is lil zes rival knockout ned seu jorge who has films most notable character changes but this is fernando meirelles movie he throws everything he can think then some references tarantino are abound there are probably more but meirelles takes energy level up so high that theres no room even please or thank you desaturated colors constantly moving camera loud noises upbeat soundtrack which is films saving grace becoming too grim its all here people may not agree with me that this is best film ever made thats okay i respect that but make no mistake its unforgettable 130 minutes,0.5608205542103847,0.16240382028517622,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Phenomenal,"There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.There are so many reasons why 'City of God' is compelling, but besides its stylish and flashy cinematography and brutally realistic script, the pacing of the film is unrelenting. Not one time did I check the clock to see how far along we were in the film, even though I was on a time constraint. From start to finish, Meirelles gives us a solid yet exciting film. Of course, since I had no idea it was based on real events, 'City of God' became that much more intriguing, especially when, during the closing credits we see actual news footage of some of the primary characters, and we can see how closely the film mirrored actual events.With a film like 'City of God' it is nearly impossible to convey why it is an excellent film because it is just seamless and well done in so many ways.All I can do is recommend the film to pretty much anyone who is looking for a good story and a great presentation.

,The Three-Body Problem,"Spoilers herein.The first choice a modern filmmaker has to make is deciding who is the camera. Everything flows from that decision, inheriting already maturing visual vocabularies for each path chosen. It's very hard to be novel today: most interesting projects come from careful integration of a novel eye with a novel narrative stance - parallels, time reversals, untrusted narrators, etc. But here is something new, thanks to the creative incubator of Brazilian TeeVee commercials, one of the more vital pockets of popular art around.In this case, we have three characters: a narrator/photographer, a dancer, and a `pusher' who literally pushes the linear logic each step at a time. Each of these is represented by a camera philosophy (and accompanying editing style) which are mixed up helter-skelter. The most obvious is the notion of the `running camera' which sometimes looks at the road or away as it moves in frenzy.This is interspersed with a rhythmic camera. This camera (Benny's eye) is the one that permeated most: it is reasonable yet hedonistic. In the first few seconds, we are introduced to these two in masterful composition: the observing, recording chicken who subsequently runs with a following POV. This is mixed with the aggressive logic of rhythm. If opening shots are promises, this is a strong promise. Over time, the third eye is folded in, literally a folding of linear stories. Each is tightly linear until it hits a node, then goes off on a tangent or a new direction usually paralleling something already seen. Garrison Keiller is the master practitioner of this sort of storytelling; not chopped Clancey-style; not shuffled Tarantino-like; but direct until hitting a capricious nexus, then direct again.All three are shooters. The story is irrelevant: kids killing kids, albeit sometimes viscerally. The characters are literally disposable. The experience is nominally about the place, but it is really about how we are shown the place. I do not think this will reinvent film like a few projects have (from Welles, Tarkovsky, Greenaway, Kurosawa, even recently Luhrmann) but it is a visual adventure worth taking and a fresh experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",three body problem,spoilers herein first choice modern filmmaker has make is deciding who is camera everything flows that decision inheriting already maturing visual vocabularies each path chosen its very hard be novel today most interesting projects come careful integration novel eye with novel narrative stance parallels time reversals untrusted narrators etc but here is something new thanks creative incubator brazilian teevee commercials one more vital pockets popular art around this case we have three characters narrator photographer dancer pusher who literally pushes linear logic each step at time each these is represented by camera philosophy accompanying editing style which are mixed up helter skelter most obvious is notion running camera which sometimes looks at road or away as it moves frenzy this is interspersed with rhythmic camera this camera bennys eye is one that permeated most it is reasonable yet hedonistic first few seconds we are introduced these two masterful composition observing recording chicken who subsequently runs with following pov this is mixed with aggressive logic rhythm if opening shots are promises this is strong promise over time third eye is folded literally folding linear stories each is tightly linear until it hits node then goes off tangent or new direction usually paralleling something already seen garrison keiller is master practitioner this sort storytelling not chopped clancey style not shuffled tarantino like but direct until hitting capricious nexus then direct again all three are shooters story is irrelevant kids killing kids albeit sometimes viscerally characters are literally disposable experience is nominally about place but it is really about how we are shown place i do not think this will reinvent film like few projects have welles tarkovsky greenaway kurosawa even recently luhrmann but it is visual adventure worth taking fresh experience teds evaluation 3 4 worth watching,0.41747429653679663,0.13495806277056277,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.54}"
9.0,"In terms of movie-making, there's nothing like it.","City of God (2002)A broiling, gruesome, vivid, unforgiving submersion in the drug and crime world of a Rio de Janeiro barrio. You want to just say wow wow wow, it's so violent and awful, and yet the filming and acting, wow again, it's virtuosic and artful. On that most visceral level, there is no faulting a film with this kind of cinematic integrity.Questions start to rise by the last hour, however. In terms of the subject, you wonder, could it be so? Is life so apparently run by children with guns? Where are the older thugs, where are all the kids who aren't criminals, on and on? You come to realize this is a hugely partial view. That's okay, for sure--it's a movie--but it then draws attention to its own need for violence. You will never see so many people ruthlessly, heartlessly, even laughingly murdered, point blank, by children, on and on and on. This makes the movie awesome and awful, both. As a narrative story, it needs, it demands, greater complexity, and maybe, even if it's basically fiction, greater truth.On this level, the movie begins to depend on its energy to succeed. It has energy to spare, for sure, both in the acting, and in the camera-work, both of which are nothing short of unbelievable. But there is a lack, oddly enough with all these ""types"" of young men and boys, of actual ""character."" Where is some sense of the psychology behind so many of these people. Yes, the mood, the interactions, the scenes taken whole, the groups and even the confrontations leading (usually) to murder, all are filled with human depth. But the individuals seem largely to be types of people, not digging into their motivations and their inner states of mine. Maybe that's asking too much.I've seen the movie twice now, and twice I got anxious half way through because it was mostly kinetics and film-making on crack. And it really is astonishing stuff. But as with Slumdog Millionaire, the fractured and imaginative mise-en-scenes would mean so much more with deeper understanding of the human elements involved.A masterpiece, with some large chinks in its armor.",terms movie making theres nothing like it,city god 2002 broiling gruesome vivid unforgiving submersion drug crime world rio de janeiro barrio you want just say wow wow wow its so violent awful yet filming acting wow again its virtuosic artful that most visceral level there is no faulting film with this kind cinematic integrity questions start rise by last hour however terms subject you wonder could it be so is life so apparently run by children with guns where are older thugs where are all kids who arent criminals you come realize this is hugely partial view thats okay sure its movie but it then draws attention its own need violence you will never see so many people ruthlessly heartlessly even laughingly murdered point blank by children this makes movie awesome awful both as narrative story it needs it demands greater complexity maybe even if its basically fiction greater truth this level movie begins depend its energy succeed it has energy spare sure both acting camera work both which are nothing short unbelievable but there is lack oddly enough with all these types young men boys actual character where is some sense psychology behind so many these people yes mood interactions scenes taken whole groups even confrontations leading usually murder all are filled with human depth but individuals seem largely be types people not digging into their motivations their inner states mine maybe thats asking too much ive seen movie twice now twice i got anxious half way through because it was mostly kinetics film making crack it really is astonishing stuff but as with slumdog millionaire fractured imaginative mise en scenes would mean so much more with deeper understanding human elements involved masterpiece with some large chinks its armor,0.5680593711843712,0.07066163003663004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.37}"

It's not like these guys are playing themselves 100% I'm sure the actor of Lil Ze is not a real psychopath. The way City of God is shot makes it feel real, like a documentary, and it is kind of beautiful. The storytelling is clever, and the use of shots is also very clever.

8.0,The gangs of Rio,"Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out! At least in this film they outshot you big time. Watching this film is difficult at times. The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it.Director Fernando Meirelles has an eye for realism and detail. The most disturbing thing about City of God is the fact that the killers are children playing adult games before they can be children. It is a well known fact that these kids' gangs created terror, not only in the favelas where they lived, which was unfortunate, but they mugged, robbed and just plain terrorized the big cities in Brazil. News about street children being shot in the streets of Rio or Sao Paolo were perceived as criminal because of the ages, but one can get a clearer picture in this film by coming to the realization these same children were killing real grown ups and getting away with murder.The only problem I had with this film is with the English subtitles. Sometimes, one doesn't know who's who. To make matters worse, the principal character grows from a young boy into a photographer who looks like a small boy himself. The plots and subplots are somehow hard to follow at times. The great accomplishment for the director is that he never preaches. He shows the world what went on at that particular time. The realism is extended to the way we see in gory details the corpses of the slain gang members. If Hollywood would have presented scenes that are so hard to take as these, many would be criminals would have been able to see first hand what bullets do to human beings: they kill!",gangs rio,quentin tarantino eat your heart out at least this film they outshot you big time watching this film is difficult at times violence is such degree viewer has problem seating through it director fernando meirelles has eye realism detail most disturbing thing about city god is fact that killers are children playing adult games before they can be children it is well known fact that these kids gangs created terror not only favelas where they lived which was unfortunate but they mugged robbed just plain terrorized big cities brazil news about street children being shot streets rio or sao paolo were perceived as criminal because ages but one can get clearer picture this film by coming realization these same children were killing real grown ups getting away with murder only problem i had with this film is with english subtitles sometimes one doesnt know whos who make matters worse principal character grows young boy into photographer who looks like small boy himself plots subplots are somehow hard follow at times great accomplishment director is that he never preaches he shows world what went at that particular time realism is extended way we see gory details corpses slain gang members if hollywood would have presented scenes that are so hard take as these many would be criminals would have been able see first hand what bullets do human beings they kill,0.5056122448979591,-0.03681972789115646,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
