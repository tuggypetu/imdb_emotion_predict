9.0,I adore this movie,"I don't always have much use for ""cute,"" as it often dribbles over into ""cutesy,"" but this movie had almost the perfect amount of cute. Siddharth won my mind and sympathy in _Rang De Basanti_, one of the best movies ever made by anyone, anywhere. Here he made me giggle and relive the giddiness of new affection.It took me a little while to warm up to Genelia D'Souza, but her character was so flawlessly, honestly bubbly that her enthusiasm became contagious.The movie includes a plea for honoring traditions and taking them into account while also allowing for change. It urges balance and moderation on everyone's part.My high school students read _Romeo and Juliet_. This year, I plan to show a brief clip of _Bommarillu_ to show the widespread knowledge of those characters and to make the point that arranged marriages are neither a thing of the past nor a way for parents to punish the young adults in their lives. I'm glad I bought this movie (an original copy---no bootlegs for me!); I will watch it frequently.",i adore this movie,i dont always have much use cute as it often dribbles over into cutesy but this movie had almost perfect amount cute siddharth won my mind sympathy rang de basanti one best movies ever made by anyone anywhere here he made me giggle relive giddiness new affection it took me little while warm up genelia dsouza but her character was so flawlessly honestly bubbly that her enthusiasm became contagious movie includes plea honoring traditions taking them into account while also allowing change it urges balance moderation everyones part my high school students read romeo juliet this year i plan show brief clip bommarillu show widespread knowledge those characters make point that arranged marriages are neither thing past nor way parents punish young adults their lives im glad i bought this movie original copy no bootlegs me i will watch it frequently,0.5954924242424243,0.3333664772727272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,"Individuality, Love and Family!!","Bommarillu (House of Toys) is the story of a young man (portrayed fantastically by Siddharth) who lives with his parents and faces an identity crisis as his overly protective father takes care of everything for him. When all the little details of his life are taken care of, he has nothing but a sense of emptiness left in him.When he meets this happy go-lucky girl (played to perfection by Genelia D'Souza) who does anything and everything she wishes without constraints, he gets inspired and loves her dearly. He comes to terms with his own life and the things he misses, mostly his individuality. The rest of the story is how he convinces his family, especially his father about his state d'affaire and wins her over.The casting has been excellent. Siddharth, Genelia, Prakash Raj, Jayasudha, Srinivasarao Kota suit well for their respective roles, especially in the scenes that require strong emotions. These scenes have been presented in a good manner. The music of the movie is a great asset.On the whole, the movie is not just your average romantic comedy, but a pleasing mixture of human emotions, drama and romance.9/10",individuality love family,bommarillu house toys is story young man portrayed fantastically by siddharth who lives with his parents faces identity crisis as his overly protective father takes care everything him when all little details his life are taken care he has nothing but sense emptiness left him when he meets this happy go lucky girl played perfection by genelia dsouza who does anything everything she wishes without constraints he gets inspired loves her dearly he comes terms with his own life things he misses mostly his individuality rest story is how he convinces his family especially his father about his state daffaire wins her over casting has been excellent siddharth genelia prakash raj jayasudha srinivasarao kota suit well their respective roles especially scenes that require strong emotions these scenes have been presented good manner music movie is great asset whole movie is not just your average romantic comedy but pleasing mixture human emotions drama romance 9 10,0.5808333333333333,0.2964583333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,"Johnny Johnny, yes papa..","A very beautiful story with a lots of comedy. I went for the movie just to kill some time. But what I got was a nostalgic happiness.The movie is basically a simple story of a over protective rich father and a modern day son who wants to be happy with self-dependence. When son wants a simple T-shirt, the father gives him a Louis Philippe shirt. In the course the son looses his individuality.This is a very emotional movie, but never lost its pace because of the sublime comedy. Siddharth's acting was excellent.

8.0,Much better than what I had expected...,"Bommarillu is the story of Sidhu's(Sidharth) struggle in dealing with a controlling father.Life moves along manageable well till the point where he gets engaged to a girl of his father choice and then goes on to meet the girl of his dreams,Hasini (Genelia).Sidhu who had been rebelling from within until then,finally finds a reason to bring out the rebel who had been hiding within him all along.The movie moves at a steady pace and keep the viewer interested at all junctions.Lead performance by Sidharth and Genelia are commendable though Genelia occasionally stumbles from sweet to sappy.The supporting cast does a decent job but I found Prakash Raj a little tiring as he does the same thing he does in every movie with the tapping-forehead-with-four-fingers-thing.Strong points for the movie include:- 1.Squeaky clean script:-Its thekind of squeaky clean that u can watch this movie sitting next to your maths professor without flinching.The lead pair rarely make bodily contact except for some dance moves.No double meaning jokes,no exposing,no innuendo of any sort.Kudos to the director for his effort to keep it this clean.2.Story&Direction:-The approach is the same,but at least the story is different.the characters of Sidhu and his father are well fleshed and their portrayal is commendable.It would have been easy to dismiss Sidhu for being a wuss without a spine if it wasn't for the directors effort in showcasing the emotions that lurk withing a man without freedom.3.Genelia:-The whole script rests on her likability.And she does her job pretty well.Sometimes she does stumble on the line between sweet and sappy, but she finds her balance pretty fast.4.Music:-Another great job by the talented Devi sri Prasad.Engaging and fun.Weak points:- 1.The comedy track is weak.2.Kota Srinivas rao and Jayasudha are wasted.They do provide strength to the cast but they are too talented to be offered that little.3.Occasionally over sweet script but they are minor glitches and overall don't effect the movie to a great extent.Bottomline:-A very good movie to be enjoyed with the entire family.If this movie doesn't break records,it will certainly run in theaters for a long time.",much better than what i had expected,bommarillu is story sidhus sidharth struggle dealing with controlling father life moves along manageable well till point where he gets engaged girl his father choice then goes meet girl his dreams hasini genelia sidhu who had been rebelling within until then finally finds reason bring out rebel who had been hiding within him all along movie moves at steady pace keep viewer interested at all junctions lead performance by sidharth genelia are commendable though genelia occasionally stumbles sweet sappy supporting cast does decent job but i found prakash raj little tiring as he does same thing he does every movie with tapping forehead with four fingers thing strong points movie include 1 squeaky clean script its thekind squeaky clean that u can watch this movie sitting next your maths professor without flinching lead pair rarely make bodily contact except some dance moves no double meaning jokes no exposing no innuendo any sort kudos director his effort keep it this clean 2 story direction approach is same but at least story is different characters sidhu his father are well fleshed their portrayal is commendable it would have been easy dismiss sidhu being wuss without spine if it wasnt directors effort showcasing emotions that lurk withing man without freedom 3 genelia whole script rests her likability she does her job pretty well sometimes she does stumble line between sweet sappy but she finds her balance pretty fast 4 music another great job by talented devi sri prasad engaging fun weak points 1 comedy track is weak 2 kota srinivas rao jayasudha are wasted they do provide strength cast but they are too talented be offered that little 3 occasionally over sweet script but they are minor glitches overall dont effect movie great extent bottomline very good movie be enjoyed with entire family if this movie doesnt break records it will certainly run theaters long time,0.5158283730158729,0.187485119047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10.0,It's Love. It's Magic,"A few months ago my cousin elder brother who is 10 years older suggested me to watch a telugu film with a weird name, 'Bomarillu'.The suggestion was heard and then forgotten. But one random day I came across Genelia Deshmukh's instagram video and suddenly the name flashed in my mind so I googled it. On discovering that it has 8.2 imdb rating, I instantly grew a strong desire to watch this film.I downloaded this cinema and from here on now I'll just pour in my emotions of how much I have loved this film This is simply a beautiful, magical film. To describe it in words would be to devoid it of its' magic.The cast is cute and both the lead just grows on you to the point that you fall in love with them. Genelia, a typical bollywood watcher would agree, had her moments with films like 'Jane Tu Ya Jane Na' and 'Tere Naal Love Ho Gya'. Any guy would be drawn to her by her cuteness and she has a very fresh and happy personality that never fails to steal your heart.But oh god! Bomarillu would make you fall for her head over heels. Her character Hasini is an angelic beauty.And there are these brilliant moments in the film. The way the first time Siddu & Hasini meets. You are taken into a magical world with the background music and the originality of that scene is purely divine. It will forever remain with you.Then when Siddu goes to her college to introduce himself and she reverts:Anthena??Inkem Kavali??Veelaithe nalugu maatalu Kudirithe cup coffeeI have enquired some telugu friends, and in their words, this particular scene was the go-to romantic opening line for an entire generation.And now the scene which I have binge-watched a thousand times.Bus stops...Hasini comes out, walks towards SidduShe cutely delivers her mixed feelings and without clarifying returns to her busAnd then all the girls shout ""Senior Sir.... Hasini Loves You""My heart skipped a beat with the music and the whole set-up.Oh I wish I was a 25 year youth in 2006 in Andhra and could have watched this film then..The songs, (and I don't know telugu), are a treat to the ears. I have learned Apudo Ipudo and wish someday I can sing this for someone.But one thing that this movie is not, is simply a love story, NO.This movie is a journey of a typical BOY.This movie shows when does a BOY become a MAN. The tussle between an over-protective father and a two-faced son is a real conflict that most of the boys can relate to.Thank You to the whole team of Bomarillu for creating such a marvel.15 years I've gone without realizing such a brilliant film has existed. But I'm glad I'm in the right age to watch this film.It's shows Love is Magic. It heals everything.Hasani character can make anyone fall in love.

7.0,"A perfect rom-com drama for Indian Audience with great performances of Siddharth, Genelia and Prakash Raj.","Bommarillu (2006) : Brief Review -A perfect rom-com drama for Indian Audience with great performances of Siddharth, Genelia and Prakash Raj. Rom-coms were running riot in 90s as youth audience started loving the new style of storytelling with freshness in the characters. Bollywood had many trendsetting films then but in 2000s decade it became repetitive and then there came telugu cinema to show something new with old formulas with a film like Bommarillu. A young man falls in love with an over-friendly girl and then realizes that he has to push back against his domineering father if he wants to find true happiness and love. If you remember, this story is bit similar to DDLJ but instead of girl's father here it was about persuading a boy's Father. Of course, there are many other things too but i won't spoil everything here. Bommarillu is a very engaging film with plenty of humourous gags. It's a comedy of perfect situations with no intentional methods and that's why it feels organic and fresh. Siddharth plays a boy whom you can easily relate to. A naive guy who never talked to girls meets a talkative girl who is friends with everyone. Genelia portrays an energetic, happy-go-lucky and cheerful girl whom you will fall in love with instantly. She is too sweet to handle at some moments. Prakash Raj as a strict and over possesive father is a Treat to watch. Apart from these three, the supporting cast is also very good. Bommarillu is little bit lengthy but thankfully it's a very entertaining film so you don't actually realise when three hours passed. Direction wise it could have pushed the things a bit higher but it's okay because this Rom-com genre isn't very intelligent one to use skillful technique. Keeping everything simple and audience friendly matters the most and that's Bhaskar has done perfectly with Bommarillu. Overall, a splendid flick with repeat value.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",perfect rom com drama indian audience with great performances siddharth genelia prakash raj,bommarillu 2006 brief review perfect rom com drama indian audience with great performances siddharth genelia prakash raj rom coms were running riot 90s as youth audience started loving new style storytelling with freshness characters bollywood had many trendsetting films then but 2000s decade it became repetitive then there came telugu cinema show something new with old formulas with film like bommarillu young man falls love with over friendly girl then realizes that he has push back against his domineering father if he wants find true happiness love if you remember this story is bit similar ddlj but instead girls father here it was about persuading boys father course there are many other things too but i wont spoil everything here bommarillu is very engaging film with plenty humourous gags its comedy perfect situations with no intentional methods thats why it feels organic fresh siddharth plays boy whom you can easily relate naive guy who never talked girls meets talkative girl who is friends with everyone genelia portrays energetic happy go lucky cheerful girl whom you will fall love with instantly she is too sweet handle at some moments prakash raj as strict over possesive father is treat watch apart these three supporting cast is also very good bommarillu is little bit lengthy but thankfully its very entertaining film so you dont actually realise when three hours passed direction wise it could have pushed things bit higher but its okay because this rom com genre isnt very intelligent one use skillful technique keeping everything simple audience friendly matters most thats bhaskar has done perfectly with bommarillu overall splendid flick with repeat value rating 7 10 by,0.5971000088347027,0.3987801484230055,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,Excellent Love Story,"Hi I am Deepakkumar Rupnar. I am fan of Sidharth. Actually I don't know Telgu, but I like telgu movie. When i watched this movie first time i didn't get more, then i downloaded this movie with English strip. then i fully enjoyed. I saw often Bommarilu. A very beautiful story with a lots of comedy. I went for the movie just to kill some time. But what I got was a nostalgic happiness.The movie is basically a simple story of a over protective rich father and a modern day son who wants to be happy with self-dependence. When son wants a simple T-shirt, the father gives him a Louis Philippe shirt. In the course the son looses his individuality.This is a very emotional movie, but never lost its pace because of the sublime comedy. Siddharth's acting was excellent. Prakash Raj was good in the role of the father. Frankly speaking, I hated the acting of Genelia. The dubbing for her was the worst.I truly enjoyed this movie.",excellent love story,hi i am deepakkumar rupnar i am fan sidharth actually i dont know telgu but i like telgu movie when i watched this movie first time i didnt get more then i downloaded this movie with english strip then i fully enjoyed i saw often bommarilu very beautiful story with lots comedy i went movie just kill some time but what i got was nostalgic happiness movie is basically simple story over protective rich father modern day son who wants be happy with self dependence when son wants simple t shirt father gives him louis philippe shirt course son looses his individuality this is very emotional movie but never lost its pace because sublime comedy siddharths acting was excellent prakash raj was good role father frankly speaking i hated acting genelia dubbing her was worst i truly enjoyed this movie,0.5297047619047618,0.24100000000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
6.0,Cute for that era.,"When I had watched it when it was first released, I had absolutely loved it, the characters, the music, the comedy, and of course the storyline was so heartwarming and loveable. But re-watching it today made me release how overhyped this movie actually is. It idolises stalk culture and has a unrealistic plot-line. Who in the right mind will allow some random girl who your son loved to stay in the house without knowing if her parents gave her the permission. It is illogical and definitely fictional. The female characters are as usual down-played and not given much importance until the end and the character of Hasini tends to get annoying sometimes, no one can be this naive and child-like. Genelia although pulls off this character with ease and Prakash Raj's versatility is commendable although it does fall under one of Sidharth's relevant but weak roles of the past. Like I said, perfect watch for the audience at that time but it can't be considered as a classic but definitely worth a one time watch with family.",cute that era,when i had watched it when it was first released i had absolutely loved it characters music comedy course storyline was so heartwarming loveable but re watching it today made me release how overhyped this movie actually is it idolises stalk culture has unrealistic plot line who right mind will allow some random girl who your son loved stay house without knowing if her parents gave her permission it is illogical definitely fictional female characters are as usual down played not given much importance until end character hasini tends get annoying sometimes no one can be this naive child like genelia although pulls off this character with ease prakash rajs versatility is commendable although it does fall under one sidharths relevant but weak roles past like i said perfect watch audience at that time but it cant be considered as classic but definitely worth one time watch with family,0.5317271352985639,0.06532501889644747,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
6.0,Watch it for Good Acting and Music,The movie doesn't have much to offer in terms of entertainment. It's an average movie with good performances from the entire star cast.

6.0,A memorable movie,"+ Background score: Pretty good. Blends in perfectly with the mood of the movie.+ Climax: Surprising and brilliantly done.+ Direction: Brilliant style of storytelling.First half: Pretty slow throughout.The movie begins with the introduction of David Ibrahim (Prithviraj) who is from the Crime Branch SID and currently under suspension. Prithvi stumbles across two strangers, Vinu and Shan, on the night of Christmas Eve in a freak accident and offers to admit them to the hospital. One of them, Vinu goes missing from the hospital and is later found dead in what is claimed to be a suicide. Offering to help the other distressed friend, Shan, David traces the life of Vinu backwards and finds several interesting revelations in the last 7 days of Vinu's life. As he digs deeper he finds out that Vinu and his group of 4 friends including Shan accidentally crossed paths with a mafia gang operating a fake currency note network causing all the issues. As the film proceeds to the climax to find out who the real killer of Vinu is and to find a solution to the Mafia which continues to pursue Shan, one is in for a real surprise for the way things turn out. David uses his police identity sparingly to extract information from others and puts the pieces together in the puzzle to find out why Vinu committed suicide and why he was involved in the mysterious activities in the past 7 days leading upto his death.The first half of the movie is slow while the second half compensates for it. Prithviraj comes up with a superb performance yet again. He is aided well by the entire supporting cast. Background score from Deepak Dev is very impressive and apt for the thriller genre that this movie belongs to. The overall movie is dark as an overtone of things yet to come. The highlight of the movie surely is the climax which will surely hit you in a way you never see it coming. Several things in the movie are very implicit and you come out of the theater with a lot of questions. The director effectively conceals information in several scenes to prod the audience to think and arrive at conclusions. Only if one thinks and discusses about the movie even after coming out of the theater, will the viewer completely understand why things happened the way they happened and appreciate the sheer intellect that has gone into the making of this story. While it is totally agreeable that the conclusion is one of the most intellectual and unexpected twists to come in movies of this category, what works against the movie is precisely the same style of story telling which keeps too many things implicit. The film challenges the spectator to think too much on his own by not revealing a bit too much. Unless one is interested in thinking on why the story is so, one might end up thinking that the film was illogical and pointless in the first place. Prithviraj has one more movie to add to his list of memorable movie. He continues to solidify his reputation as a bankable and stupendous actor.Even if you might feel a little bored with the pace at which things move in the first half, stay patient till the end of the movie. It will surely leave you with a smile on your face as it totally deceives you.",memorable movie,background score pretty good blends perfectly with mood movie climax surprising brilliantly done direction brilliant style storytelling first half pretty slow throughout movie begins with introduction david ibrahim prithviraj who is crime branch sid currently under suspension prithvi stumbles across two strangers vinu shan night christmas eve freak accident offers admit them hospital one them vinu goes missing hospital is later found dead what is claimed be suicide offering help other distressed friend shan david traces life vinu backwards finds several interesting revelations last 7 days vinus life as he digs deeper he finds out that vinu his group 4 friends including shan accidentally crossed paths with mafia gang operating fake currency note network causing all issues as film proceeds climax find out who real killer vinu is find solution mafia which continues pursue shan one is real surprise way things turn out david uses his police identity sparingly extract information others puts pieces together puzzle find out why vinu committed suicide why he was involved mysterious activities past 7 days leading upto his death first half movie is slow while second half compensates it prithviraj comes up with superb performance yet again he is aided well by entire supporting cast background score deepak dev is very impressive apt thriller genre that this movie belongs overall movie is dark as overtone things yet come highlight movie surely is climax which will surely hit you way you never see it coming several things movie are very implicit you come out theater with lot questions director effectively conceals information several scenes prod audience think arrive at conclusions only if one thinks discusses about movie even after coming out theater will viewer completely understand why things happened way they happened appreciate sheer intellect that has gone into making this story while it is totally agreeable that conclusion is one most intellectual unexpected twists come movies this category what works against movie is precisely same style story telling which keeps too many things implicit film challenges spectator think too much his own by not revealing bit too much unless one is interested thinking why story is so one might end up thinking that film was illogical pointless first place prithviraj has one more movie add his list memorable movie he continues solidify his reputation as bankable stupendous actor even if you might feel little bored with pace at which things move first half stay patient till end movie it will surely leave you with smile your face as it totally deceives you,0.511318407960199,0.19060945273631835,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.25}"
