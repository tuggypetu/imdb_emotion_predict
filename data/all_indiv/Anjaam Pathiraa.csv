8,A very neat murder mystery thriller.,"This is definitely a worth watching murder mystery thriller. The thrilling tone is maintained right from the beginning till the end.At first, some initial scenes may give an impression that the movie would become goofy as it progresses. But it doesn't. It maintains the amount of seriousness and logic one expects out of such movies.There is absolutely no digression from the main story. No songs. No super star heroism. No melodrama.The plot is one hell of a one. Keeps us really engaged.Coming to acting, Kunchacko Boban did his part of a psychologist neatly. Then there is a stellar performance from Unnimaya Gopan. There are other excellent performances which cannot be told without it being spoilers.Music really elevates the scenes and thrills to another level. The camera work was good even though it could have been made better. The editing was very good.If there are flaws, they are all minor ones. Even though the story/plot is clearly the winner here, some parts in the beginning of the second act made the plot go slow. But it soon gets compensated as the movie goes forward. It can also be said that the last few scenes had some minor problems with logic. But it doesn't really compromise on the thrills and suspense.Another minor problem was the character of Sreenath Bhasi. He comes as a young techie. The character is one in which Bhasi has got typecasted. His presence was mainly to give some comic relief. Such a character's presence cannot actually be justified. But it doesn't really affect the whole movie. Just a minor flaw. Maybe they didn't have the confidence to make the film without any comic relief.The dialogues at some points felt a bit artificial. But for the most part they were good.All these minor problems are just nitpicking. If you want to see a murder mystery thriller movie with a very good plot, you definitely need to see this.",very neat murder mystery thriller,this is definitely worth watching murder mystery thriller thrilling tone is maintained right beginning till end at first some initial scenes may give impression that movie would become goofy as it progresses but it doesnt it maintains amount seriousness logic one expects out such movies there is absolutely no digression main story no songs no super star heroism no melodrama plot is one hell one keeps us really engaged coming acting kunchacko boban did his part psychologist neatly then there is stellar performance unnimaya gopan there are other excellent performances which cannot be told without it being spoilers music really elevates scenes thrills another level camera work was good even though it could have been made better editing was very good if there are flaws they are all minor ones even though story plot is clearly winner here some parts beginning second act made plot go slow but it soon gets compensated as movie goes forward it can also be said that last few scenes had some minor problems with logic but it doesnt really compromise thrills suspense another minor problem was character sreenath bhasi he comes as young techie character is one which bhasi has got typecasted his presence was mainly give some comic relief such characters presence cannot actually be justified but it doesnt really affect whole movie just minor flaw maybe they didnt have confidence make film without any comic relief dialogues at some points felt bit artificial but most part they were good all these minor problems are just nitpicking if you want see murder mystery thriller movie with very good plot you definitely need see this,0.42305291005291007,0.17994179894179899,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.46}"

9,A special treat for anyone who loves crime mystery/thrillers,"After a long time (read 'after Drishyam'), Malayalam film industry has produced yet another gem of a crime thriller. The story is about an aspirong criminologist who gets involved with the police in catching a serial killer who goes about killing policemen one by one. It is also said to be inspired by true events.Right from the first shot itself, the director wastes no time in putting the characters & plot into motion. With each passing scene, you're drawn deeper into the mystery of the killers, who they & what do they want. The pacing is immensely good, the dialogues are realistic & crisp, the editing is superb & the background score is chilling enough. The visuals are powerful & borderline spooky at times. All the actors are in fine form & convince us enough to invest all our attention into the plot. In the first half, there literally isn't one single moment where you're not thinking 'What's next?'. Credit goes to the script writers for writing a gripping plot that keeps you engaged throughout the movie. The mystery unravels well & is quite satisfactory in the end.The movie isn't without its cons. The regular usage of the term 'psychology' in the movie isn't validated as the director chooses not to explore much in that direction in the second half. This causes discrepancies in the thought process in the first half amd second half of the movie. Also, the second half gets a tad bit dragged because it carries the burden of revealing all the answers to the questions it raises in the first half. Apart from this, the movie is an excellent crime thriller & a MUST WATCH",special treat anyone who loves crime mystery thrillers,after long time read after drishyam malayalam film industry has produced yet another gem crime thriller story is about aspirong criminologist who gets involved with police catching serial killer who goes about killing policemen one by one it is also said be inspired by true events right first shot itself director wastes no time putting characters plot into motion with each passing scene youre drawn deeper into mystery killers who they what do they want pacing is immensely good dialogues are realistic crisp editing is superb background score is chilling enough visuals are powerful borderline spooky at times all actors are fine form convince us enough invest all our attention into plot first half there literally isnt one single moment where youre not thinking whats next credit goes script writers writing gripping plot that keeps you engaged throughout movie mystery unravels well is quite satisfactory end movie isnt without its cons regular usage term psychology movie isnt validated as director chooses not explore much that direction second half this causes discrepancies thought process first half amd second half movie also second half gets tad bit dragged because it carries burden revealing all answers questions it raises first half apart this movie is excellent crime thriller must watch,0.4009319112260288,0.15602240896358535,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"

From now on, probably most of the investigation/killer movies are going to be benchmarked based on this one.

7,A gritty tale,"I am marvelled at South's ability to churn out quality thrillers one after another. Anjaam Pathira (The Fifth Midnight) is the latest Malayalam film to be a part of this bandwagon.The story is about a shadowy serial killer who targets Cops!!! After a string of gruesome killings, Kochi Police DCP Catherine (Unnimaya) upon the advice of ACP Anil (Jinu) ropes in criminal psychologist Anwar Hussain (Kunchako) to help them crack the case. Together they begin the hunt for the perpetrator who employs brutal and unique methods for committing the murders.I have always believed grit is the most vital component of a thriller. The moment you lose the tempo, the story is bound to lose the edge. This is where the movie scores brilliantly. Writer Director Midhun Manuel Thomas renders a taut tale where we come across ghastly crimes, compelling scenes and sharp twists & turns at every crucial juncture. This engaging treatment which doesn't allow the tone to slack off is the movie's strongest asset. Yes there are flaws. There are certain minute details which call for an explanation (the figurine story, the burning incident hypothesis). English dialogues appeared a bit contrived. There are a few cliches which could have been avoided.But Anjaam Pathira overall remains a riveting tale of suspense where the right elements are combined in apt proportions. There are horrific crimes, startling revelations and a good backstory. One can't help drawing a parallel to the Tamil movie Ratsasan (The Devil). While Ratsasan had a more interesting plot development, Anjaam Pathira's ending is better fleshed out.You will love it.",gritty tale,i am marvelled at souths ability churn out quality thrillers one after another anjaam pathira fifth midnight is latest malayalam film be part this bandwagon story is about shadowy serial killer who targets cops after string gruesome killings kochi police dcp catherine unnimaya upon advice acp anil jinu ropes criminal psychologist anwar hussain kunchako help them crack case together they begin hunt perpetrator who employs brutal unique methods committing murders i have always believed grit is most vital component thriller moment you lose tempo story is bound lose edge this is where movie scores brilliantly writer director midhun manuel thomas renders taut tale where we come across ghastly crimes compelling scenes sharp twists turns at every crucial juncture this engaging treatment which doesnt allow tone slack off is movies strongest asset yes there are flaws there are certain minute details which call explanation figurine story burning incident hypothesis english dialogues appeared bit contrived there are few cliches which could have been avoided but anjaam pathira overall remains riveting tale suspense where right elements are combined apt proportions there are horrific crimes startling revelations good backstory one cant help drawing parallel tamil movie ratsasan devil while ratsasan had more interesting plot development anjaam pathiras ending is better fleshed out you will love it,0.6312807881773399,0.09568965517241379,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.23}"
6,A respectable effort,"Anjaam Pathira wasn't half bad. It was very gripping until the last 20 minutes. Despite some bad casting, a feminist character that adds nothing to the movie and a ridiculous ending, the film was gripping throughout. No Malayalam movie in the last one year has held my attention like Anjaam Pathira did.The film was really intriguing until the last thirty minutes. There are some nice twists.

7,Anjaam Pathiraa joins the ranks of Memories and Mumbai Police ; a superb taut thriller.,"For those who wondering why i gave Anjaam Pathiraa a 7 after describing the film as beyond excellent, the reason lies in the fact that Malayalam film industry, although one of the best in the country, haven't had that many crime thrillers that we can boast about. Drishyam might be your response, but hey that's just one.Kunchacko Boban delivers yet again a Kunchacko Boban performance. Sreenath Bhasi was the most natural out of the cast ; shines as always. Indrans. Oh Indrans. He delivers a spine-chilling monologue for the film, which is quite unusual for malayalam films. If you're missing the 'monologue-esque' opening of Anjaam Pathiraa, you are missing the best scene of the film. Other performances, although average, never made me pull out of the atmosphere the film had set.The film has its drawbacks. I'm just admitting it right away. It's not the 'perfect' crime thriller and partly the reason why critics are gonna hit on this film. I can see the 3/5 ratings a mile away (hey TOI). It's a better film than what those 3/5 reviews may make you think the film is, but it's not something that you should build your inner hype train for.I'm not gonna stretch this review, just gonna say that Midhun Manuel Thomas did a full 180 from his previous semi-disaster flick Argentina Fans Katoorkadavu.

8,"Capsule Review: Anjaam Pathiraa / A Well-Made, Tight Thriller / 8 Stars","The tense atmosphere of Anjaam Pathiraa (Fifth Midnight), thanks to the brilliant background score by Sushin Shyam and the overall production setup, is what makes it a gripping thriller worth enjoying while sitting at the edge of your seat without having the luxury to pay a visit to the washroom. Because if you choose to do so (or to get the popcorn), the intended impact will be lost. Midhun Manuel Thomas must have envisioned it that way as he wrote a mystery about a possible killer and police procedural involving the killings. More than the underlying themes that are related to crime, it is the procedural involving cops and other investigative elements (where Kunchacko Boban plays a criminologist) that keep you hooked, and makes this mystery thriller a unique affair for Mollywood consumers. There's enough going on here and with a crisp acting performance and sufficient attention to details, I can easily call Anjaam Pathiraa one of the best films to come out this year. We don't get such thrillers often. If you have the ability to pass certain forgivable issues with the plot, the dialogue delivery, and occasional mishaps involving placement and timing of humour, this is going to be a treat.

7,I honestly couldn't understand why some people clapped at the end.,Its a very decent movie to be honest. Nothing spectacular. Nothing worth clapping about. What worked in the movie for me is that they didnt force in any unnecessary family drama into the movie. An inept director would have probably tried to do that. How does the serial killings affect Kunchacko Boban and his wife and kid. The emotional turmoil they experience. Thankfully they stay away from precisely that kind of TV soap melodrama in this movie. So consequentially there are no dull moments in this movie.Another thing that worked for me is that there were no inept donkeys in the cast. Generally when they make a movie with such a big cast they will inadvertently cast a few donkeys who cannot act to save their lives. I mean there is no Al Pacino in there but they are all good or atleast competent.They could have probably worked out a more plausible plotline on how they ultimately track down the killer but it is what it is.

10,A beautiful thriller.,"Yes, you read it right. This is a beautiful thriller. I thank Midhun Manuel Thomas for this splendid experience.This is one of the best scripts in Mollywood without a doubt and arguably the best thriller in several years, since Drishyam probably.The story follows the way most serial killer movies go, but the discoveries that the investigators go through would keep us glued to the screens, without compromising on the tension level.The detailing in this story, even in art direction (example: in the final scene, viewers who noticed would understand) is wonderfully done. Issues are there of course but which movie doesn't, and it's a common thing in thrillers. But i can say with certainty that most loopholes one would find would be solved by some analysis of scenes or with further viewing, like how it happened to me. Midhun has tried his best to include everything as possible in the runtime of less than 2 and a half hours.That's another best part of the movie - the editing. You would find no unnecessary cuts, no flash or additional fluff that had plagued Indian thrillers for year. There's no unnecessary scene in the movie which deviates from the main plot. It sticks to the point till the end, which is a great thing for the audience.Performances are awesome. Be it the lead Kunjacko Boban who has delivered a brilliant performance as the obsessive psychologist who comes to terms with the reality of investigations, or be it the minor characters that appear in the latter half - everyone has given their best.Cinematography is good. Use of red lighting in several scenes was clever. The background score may remind you of several other movies, but was very well placed throughout the movie.What a start to the decade! I watched it second time just for the experience and for confirming several things. Would definitely recommend to everyone, as it definitely doesn't disappoint.",beautiful thriller,yes you read it right this is beautiful thriller i thank midhun manuel thomas this splendid experience this is one best scripts mollywood without doubt arguably best thriller several years since drishyam probably story follows way most serial killer movies go but discoveries that investigators go through would keep us glued screens without compromising tension level detailing this story even art direction example final scene viewers who noticed would understand is wonderfully done issues are there course but which movie doesnt its common thing thrillers but i can say with certainty that most loopholes one would find would be solved by some analysis scenes or with further viewing like how it happened me midhun has tried his best include everything as possible runtime less than 2 half hours thats another best part movie editing you would find no unnecessary cuts no flash or additional fluff that had plagued indian thrillers year theres no unnecessary scene movie which deviates main plot it sticks point till end which is great thing audience performances are awesome be it lead kunjacko boban who has delivered brilliant performance as obsessive psychologist who comes terms with reality investigations or be it minor characters that appear latter half everyone has given their best cinematography is good use red lighting several scenes was clever background score may remind you several other movies but was very well placed throughout movie what start decade i watched it second time just experience confirming several things would definitely recommend everyone as it definitely doesnt disappoint,0.47318452380952386,0.32693452380952376,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.49}"

8,2020 starts with a bang in mollywood,"Aadu director Mithun Manuel Thomas comes with a psychological investigation thriller called anjaam paathira. A serial killer targets random police officers by abducting, torturing and killing them. Criminologist Anwar Hussain comes in help for investigating these crime along with the police. Will he be able to find the killer? You know he will. Plot is simple. Screenplay is tight enough to grip you. Direction is superb. Coming to performances, kunchacko boban doesn't have a larger than life image due to which there wasn't any need to give him distinct features like sethuramayar or make him adventurous like sherlock holmes. He's shown as a common man with wife and child. It was a cakewalk for him. The best came from sreenath bhaasi as the hacker with witty punch liners. Jinu Joseph who we usually see in Amal neerad films gets a meaty role here. Unnimaya comes in a different avatar and I feel her voice is dubbed. Matthew Thomas has now become a lucky charm I think. Nowadays if story takes place in idukki then jaffar idukki will always be there. Indrans had a great cameo and sharafudeen did his best in a limited screentime. If Hollywood has Hans Zimmer then mollywood has sushin Shyam. He again brings a chill on your spine after virus. Shyju Khalid's cinematography was very good and editing was adequate. But drawback of the film is it's usual pattern in screenplay and predictability. That Amazon scene and metro scene I could easily guess. And one would feel what was the need for Dr benjamin to create an elaborate serial killing plot when his target was only two cops.

8,Cinematic intelligence and reliability of Anjaam Pathiraa easliy beats overhyped crime-thrillers like Ratsasan and Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru.,"Anjaam Pathiraa (2020) : Brief Review -Cinematic intelligence and reliability of Anjaam Pathiraa easliy beats overhyped crime-thrillers like Ratsasan and Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru. This review is not written to talk about the storyline, loopes and acting, you can easily judge those elements after watching the film. My main purpose to write this brief review is to differentiate the cinematic intelligence of this film from other highly acclaimed thrillers. I am not gonna take all the thrillers into comparison, just couple of popular ones. Let's take Ratsasan first, yes it's a great thriller, a Classic actually but don't overhype it by calling it 'Best Ever' or 'Best Of All Time', at least when you haven't seen thrillers of 'All Time'. Even Ratsasan has got loopes, it has flaws in the dramatic climax, it has cheap tactics and execution used there but people who don't understand cinematic intelligence and rather goes gaga over fictional thrilling elements simple overlook it. The same problem was there with Dhuruvagal too, don't tell me you didn't notice couple of loopes and some low grade frames there. Let's just understand that the writing is a different aspect altogether, that's on paper work which is done off screen and it's the on screen aspects which shows you a cinematic gem. Anjaam Pathiraa is that Cinematic gem with high range knowlege of framework and top quality execution. It's not that this film has got no loopes, it has, but that's not a problem, it happens with 99.99% films. It's about getting cinematic tactics right and how? On a level, i mean. Midhun Manuel Thomas doens't lose a single cinematic aspects untied, his framework, his skills to use background music, his narration style, his grasp over the storyline and especially the reliability of the basic motive everything is Superlative that easily defeats all the best known crime thrillers. Watch it and understand it, if you don't get it then I'm sorry, you can continue watching other films with your immature sense of cinema.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",cinematic intelligence reliability anjaam pathiraa easliy beats overhyped crime thrillers like ratsasan dhuruvangal pathinaaru,anjaam pathiraa 2020 brief review cinematic intelligence reliability anjaam pathiraa easliy beats overhyped crime thrillers like ratsasan dhuruvangal pathinaaru this review is not written talk about storyline loopes acting you can easily judge those elements after watching film my main purpose write this brief review is differentiate cinematic intelligence this film other highly acclaimed thrillers i am not gonna take all thrillers into comparison just couple popular ones lets take ratsasan first yes its great thriller classic actually but dont overhype it by calling it best ever or best all time at least when you havent seen thrillers all time even ratsasan has got loopes it has flaws dramatic climax it has cheap tactics execution used there but people who dont understand cinematic intelligence rather goes gaga over fictional thrilling elements simple overlook it same problem was there with dhuruvagal too dont tell me you didnt notice couple loopes some low grade frames there lets just understand that writing is different aspect altogether thats paper work which is done off screen its screen aspects which shows you cinematic gem anjaam pathiraa is that cinematic gem with high range knowlege framework top quality execution its not that this film has got no loopes it has but thats not problem it happens with 99 99 films its about getting cinematic tactics right how level i mean midhun manuel thomas doenst lose single cinematic aspects untied his framework his skills use background music his narration style his grasp over storyline especially reliability basic motive everything is superlative that easily defeats all best known crime thrillers watch it understand it if you dont get it then im sorry you can continue watching other films with your immature sense cinema rating 8 10 by,0.42003117913832194,0.1366298185941043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,One hell of a movie,"It's a remarkable crime thriller like never before. The cat and mouse game is well portrayed from start to end without losing its intensity even for a minute, the movie is really gripping. Many people have been correlating this to Ratsasan, I have to say towards the end it's one step ahead of it. Just don't miss this, especially crime-thriller fans. I don't wanna say much about this movie, u should experience in cinema.",one hell movie,its remarkable crime thriller like never before cat mouse game is well portrayed start end without losing its intensity even minute movie is really gripping many people have been correlating this ratsasan i have say towards end its one step ahead it just dont miss this especially crime thriller fans i dont wanna say much about this movie u should experience cinema,0.6416666666666667,0.25833333333333336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.56, 'Fear': 0.0}"
6,One time watchable.,"Anjaam Pathiraa is sometimes engaging. There are a few edge of the seat moments. Sreenath Bhasi was fun. Kunchako Boban barely holds it together. Not an excellent perfomance. The movie often tries to be different. It tries to keep distance from conventional hero vs serial killer patterns and the clichéd ""now it's personal"" twist (?) thanks to writer, director Midhun Manual Thomas. But the third act of the movie is not at all satisfying. All the hype the first and second acts built collapses miserably. In a nutshell, Anjaam Pathiraa is a good attempt. But it's just an okayish movie. Malayalam industry will need to wait more to get an excellent serial killer movie.",one time watchable,anjaam pathiraa is sometimes engaging there are few edge seat moments sreenath bhasi was fun kunchako boban barely holds it together not excellent perfomance movie often tries be different it tries keep distance conventional hero vs serial killer patterns clich d now its personal twist thanks writer director midhun manual thomas but third act movie is not at all satisfying all hype first second acts built collapses miserably nutshell anjaam pathiraa is good attempt but its just okayish movie malayalam industry will need wait more get excellent serial killer movie,0.46265664160401004,0.09774436090225565,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7,Deviated mold from Midhun.,I was surprised because I can't expect this kind of shift from Midhun Manuel Thomas. I laughed a lot through his early works and it's quite sure that he wants to get out from that label of making humor oriented subjects. This is enough. So brilliant work for a director more than a writer from Midhun. He made it exceptionally throughout each and every corner with a thrilling mode of drive. Nice one and expecting more from you like this.,deviated mold midhun,i was surprised because i cant expect this kind shift midhun manuel thomas i laughed lot through his early works its quite sure that he wants get out that label making humor oriented subjects this is enough so brilliant work director more than writer midhun he made it exceptionally throughout each every corner with thrilling mode drive nice one expecting more you like this,0.676068376068376,0.432051282051282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
