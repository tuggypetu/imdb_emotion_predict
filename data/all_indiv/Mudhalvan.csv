10,Read and u'll know how good it is!!!,"You all may find this review to be a little exaggerated but that is exactly the truth. Nothing but the truth. I have to say, till this date, except for a few exceptions like the movies by Shyam Benegal or Satyajit Ray or for that matter, Satya and Khamoshi, Sholay, Angoor and a few others, I haven't seen such a DIFFERENT and THOUGHT PROVOKING, PRAISE INVOKING AND MARVELLOUS movie as Mudhalvan.It is and will remain an eye-opener for all those in the Indian film industry who have been experimenting with the same love formula umpteen number of times and in effect, producing some of the most sensationally boring love stories of all times (Example: Kaho..Naa Pyar Hai). Hitting us like a bullet, the plot moves swiftly, never leaving any time to think. The story and screenplay, by Shankar himself, deserve mention for being creative, complete and utterly enjoyable to watch.Shankar deserved an award for making this movie with such style and technique, while also keeping the story and other aspects in mind.Pros. Award winning direction, dialogues, script, music, background music, cinematography, first-rate performances by Arjun, Manivannan, Raghuvaran and above all, the super climax, and excellent song picturization.Cons. Manisha, who looks too flabby and old in some scenes",read ull know how good it is,you all may find this review be little exaggerated but that is exactly truth nothing but truth i have say till this date except few exceptions like movies by shyam benegal or satyajit ray or that matter satya khamoshi sholay angoor few others i havent seen such different thought provoking praise invoking marvellous movie as mudhalvan it is will remain eye opener all those indian film industry who have been experimenting with same love formula umpteen number times effect producing some most sensationally boring love stories all times example kaho naa pyar hai hitting us like bullet plot moves swiftly never leaving any time think story screenplay by shankar himself deserve mention being creative complete utterly enjoyable watch shankar deserved award making this movie with such style technique while also keeping story other aspects mind pros award winning direction dialogues script music background music cinematography first rate performances by arjun manivannan raghuvaran above all super climax excellent song picturization cons manisha who looks too flabby old some scenes,0.5166666666666666,0.1467013888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10,Brilliant,"One of the earlier Shankar thrillers and also one of his better ones. This movie is under-rated on IMDb. The popularity of this movie is reflected by the fact that it forms the basis for Shankar's latest movie, Anniyan, which isn't nearly as good as Mudhalvan. Not only is the movie thought provoking but also sheer fun to experience. Thats how all movies should be and thats what makes Shankar so special. Even though Raghuveran is a familiar face, he plays his role as the villain very convincingly. Manisha was however, pretty pointless and added just for the sake of having a romantic angle in the film. Arjun is the only actor whom Shankar has cast two times and this is without doubt, his best movie and performance ever besides gentleman. Each of Shankar's movies usually has a unique hero or first timer.",brilliant,one earlier shankar thrillers also one his better ones this movie is under rated imdb popularity this movie is reflected by fact that it forms basis shankars latest movie anniyan which isnt nearly as good as mudhalvan not only is movie thought provoking but also sheer fun experience thats how all movies should be thats what makes shankar so special even though raghuveran is familiar face he plays his role as villain very convincingly manisha was however pretty pointless added just sake having romantic angle film arjun is only actor whom shankar has cast two times this is without doubt his best movie performance ever besides gentleman each shankars movies usually has unique hero or first timer,0.6528822055137846,0.2977443609022556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9,A film with a sincere message. Rarity in Indian films.,"The movie has its usual cinematic moments. But, the message comes from the heartfelt anguish.

10,Not as good as Indian but still excellent,"If I had'nt seen this movie before seeing the same director's Indian/Hindustani which had released 3 years earlier, I may not have been so very impressed. While Mudhalvan represents an excellent movie by itself, the director had already produced a movie which was simply much bigger and better, earlier, which thus takes expectations a bit higher.One of the subjects handled in Mudhalvan, namely caste-based politics and vote banks, is very important. If it were'nt for the running time, I think that the same subject should have been explored further. I also did'nt appreciate Arjun in the movie, reducing the caste nos to 4, instead of eliminating caste based reservation in totality? I guess caste based politics have a hand even in movies. See some vijaykanth movies if you want more on that subject.This movie is without a shadow of a doubt, Arjun's best performance in his career. While it may not be Shankar's best, it is again without doubt, one of Shankar's better movies and a must watch.",not as good as indian but still excellent,if i hadnt seen this movie before seeing same directors indian hindustani which had released 3 years earlier i may not have been so very impressed while mudhalvan represents excellent movie by itself director had already produced movie which was simply much bigger better earlier which thus takes expectations bit higher one subjects handled mudhalvan namely caste based politics vote banks is very important if it werent running time i think that same subject should have been explored further i also didnt appreciate arjun movie reducing caste nos 4 instead eliminating caste based reservation totality i guess caste based politics have hand even movies see some vijaykanth movies if you want more that subject this movie is without shadow doubt arjuns best performance his career while it may not be shankars best it is again without doubt one shankars better movies must watch,0.5324561403508773,0.4019298245614035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10,Groundbreaking in Tamil cinema...,Needless to say this is one of shankar's magnum opus back in the days at the dawn of the millenium. a thought provoking innovative storyline that deserves lot of praise and credit. The technical values production and music by AR Rahman are simply one of the best. down south.One of the highlights is the sharp 35mm cinematography by KV anand at its finest follows a creative ad style nuance with quick cuts and zoom in effects. The story screenplay follows continuously throughout the film keeping u at the edge of the seat. AR Rahman's music needs no mention here as again the maestro has given us his finest tunes.The real star of the film was veteran Raghuvaran who played the corrupt politician role in a perfect manner. All the other subcasts did justice to their roles. Anyone will be truly amazed by the ending climax scene and what it meant to the protagonists.A truly trendsetter movie.,groundbreaking tamil cinema,needless say this is one shankars magnum opus back days at dawn millenium thought provoking innovative storyline that deserves lot praise credit technical values production music by ar rahman are simply one best down south one highlights is sharp 35mm cinematography by kv anand at its finest follows creative ad style nuance with quick cuts zoom effects story screenplay follows continuously throughout film keeping u at edge seat ar rahmans music needs no mention here as again maestro has given us his finest tunes real star film was veteran raghuvaran who played corrupt politician role perfect manner all other subcasts did justice their roles anyone will be truly amazed by ending climax scene what it meant protagonists truly trendsetter movie,0.5314021164021164,0.14185185185185184,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,An awesome movie,"The movie is an excellent movie , one of the best dynamic movies of Shankar. It is the movie which clearly explains how politics should be and what sort of people should come to politics. The way in which Arjun traps raguvaran in the movie will take u to the real thrill. The steps that he takes after getting into the post as a single day CM(which is an entirely new concept.. hats off to Shankar) are really great and makes us think how good it will be if its the reality. Though, Manisha koirala will not play an important role in the movie, her role will be important in songs. Vadivelu's acting and comedy with 'Poda Panni' will make everyone laugh. In total, one of the best movies credited for Direction Skills!!",awesome movie,movie is excellent movie one best dynamic movies shankar it is movie which clearly explains how politics should be what sort people should come politics way which arjun traps raguvaran movie will take u real thrill steps that he takes after getting into post as single day cm which is entirely new concept hats off shankar are really great makes us think how good it will be if its reality though manisha koirala will not play important role movie her role will be important songs vadivelus acting comedy with poda panni will make everyone laugh total one best movies credited direction skills,0.5199269480519481,0.4353084415584416,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.17}"
9,Musical hit,"The movie revolves around how educated youngsters could make a change in politics..Apart from the plot , its the music which holds the movie perfectly..The way how director emotes the story was perfect..

5,"Good Intentions, But Executed Haphazardly","Mudhalvan, directed by the renowned S.Shankar and with a background score composed by A.R. Rahman, would appear to be an awesome movie on paper. After watching it, I can say that Shankar had good intentions to crudely showcase the level of corruption + prejudice present within South Indian cities and communities at the time. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. So, what was good and what derailed this film?Pros:Performances: Arjun performs aptly, displaying the perfect ""no- nonsense"" attitude when dealing with the issues present at hand and also subtly handling his relationship with Thenmozhi. Raghuvaran is decent as the villain in the movie, delivering his lines with a pinch of harshness and irritation. Songs/BGM: Songs are hella nice. Kudos to A.R. Rahman for crafting such a nice background score. Cons:Performances: Koirala is wasted. The romance angle is completely unnecessary, as she doesn't really play a super substantial role in the film after her introduction (which is very good btw). Vadivelu is annoying as hell. I don't understand what Shankar was thinking when crafting this character. Everyone else was strictly average.Screenplay/Story: Solid message, but haphazard screenplay. Too many songs coupled with the ""superhero"" abilities of Arjun in this film, which takes away some of the realism that Shankar was trying to shoot for. The second half is a drag, as it is basically a useless fight between the corrupt politicians and Arjun. But that's a fairly standard feature in Tamil films, so I can't blame Shankar too much for falling into that trap.Cinematography/Editing: Action scenes + special effects were generic (to be expected from that time). Some scenes in the beginning went by too fast. As stated earlier, scenes dragged on in the second half. The movie needed to be shot crisper and tighter.Overall: 5.5/10. Watch it for its message and Arjun's performance.",good intentions but executed haphazardly,mudhalvan directed by renowned s shankar with background score composed by r rahman would appear be awesome movie paper after watching it i can say that shankar had good intentions crudely showcase level corruption prejudice present within south indian cities communities at time however movie did not meet my expectations so what was good what derailed this film pros performances arjun performs aptly displaying perfect no nonsense attitude when dealing with issues present at hand also subtly handling his relationship with thenmozhi raghuvaran is decent as villain movie delivering his lines with pinch harshness irritation songs bgm songs are hella nice kudos r rahman crafting such nice background score cons performances koirala is wasted romance angle is completely unnecessary as she doesnt really play super substantial role film after her introduction which is very good btw vadivelu is annoying as hell i dont understand what shankar was thinking when crafting this character everyone else was strictly average screenplay story solid message but haphazard screenplay too many songs coupled with superhero abilities arjun this film which takes away some realism that shankar was trying shoot second half is drag as it is basically useless fight between corrupt politicians arjun but thats fairly standard feature tamil films so i cant blame shankar too much falling into that trap cinematography editing action scenes special effects were generic be expected that time some scenes beginning went by too fast as stated earlier scenes dragged second half movie needed be shot crisper tighter overall 5 5 10 watch it its message arjuns performance,0.47533972125435536,0.0865969802555168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"
6,Political drama,Every south Indian chills about shankar's film. Though this film seems to be novel work but lacks some basics regarding politics. Always shankar takes lot of attention on photography. He might have studied something about the current political strategies.Music is by A.R. Rahman. We can't criticize about his talent. Manisha koyirala doesn't suit very well in this film.The director has to show what really politics is?? Simply showing how one can do crazy things in a single day is ridiculous. Of course every one in the country has a vision to make their country corrupt free.Only music and photography part of the film is commendable. Rest of the things are crazy and simply ridiculous. Last but not least I am very much impressed by Raghuvaran's action.,political drama,every south indian chills about shankars film though this film seems be novel work but lacks some basics regarding politics always shankar takes lot attention photography he might have studied something about current political strategies music is by r rahman we cant criticize about his talent manisha koyirala doesnt suit very well this film director has show what really politics is simply showing how one can do crazy things single day is ridiculous course every one country has vision make their country corrupt free only music photography part film is commendable rest things are crazy simply ridiculous last but not least i am very much impressed by raghuvarans action,0.5465608465608466,-0.02156084656084655,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
4,Rather average film making renders the (good) message weak.,"** SPOILERS **A man is challenged to run the state for a day and he takes up the challenge and attempts to fix the mother of all problems (corruption) in just a day. He then becomes the chief minister and tries to run a clean government in spite of hardships. The message is that it IS possible to run a corruption free government.The message is tainted because of the super human qualities attributed to the hero. He is able to survive a gang attack after his challenge day as the CM. He personally ""takes care"" of a rowdy gang by fist fighting with them while the cops look over (in awe, should I add). Is there director trying to say that an average man without martial arts knowledge is incapable of running a clean government?The plot does move swiftly but is punctuated by the pace-breaking song and dance sequences. Tell me how Shusmitha Sen's cameo adds to the message or to the entertainment. It's just a waste of time.This is a Bond movie with 007 promoted to be the head of state. If you like action movies with grand guignol violence scenes, this is for you. Hey, you can even convince yourself that it's worth your time. This movie is average and instills in the audience that it is possible to provide a good government for the people but you have to be very good at self defense as opposed to be selfless.The good things are powerful performances by Raghuvaran and Manivannan. The minuses begin with Manisha and Arjun (the poor guy is just acting out his part) and some put-a-bag-over-me type canned embarrassing scenes involving Arjun's mom and dad.4 out of 10",rather average film making renders good message weak,spoilers man is challenged run state day he takes up challenge attempts fix mother all problems corruption just day he then becomes chief minister tries run clean government spite hardships message is that it is possible run corruption free government message is tainted because super human qualities attributed hero he is able survive gang attack after his challenge day as cm he personally takes care rowdy gang by fist fighting with them while cops look over awe should i add is there director trying say that average man without martial arts knowledge is incapable running clean government plot does move swiftly but is punctuated by pace breaking song dance sequences tell me how shusmitha sens cameo adds message or entertainment its just waste time this is bond movie with 007 promoted be head state if you like action movies with grand guignol violence scenes this is you hey you can even convince yourself that its worth your time this movie is average instills audience that it is possible provide good government people but you have be very good at self defense as opposed be selfless good things are powerful performances by raghuvaran manivannan minuses begin with manisha arjun poor guy is just acting out his part some put bag over me type canned embarrassing scenes involving arjuns mom dad 4 out 10,0.5191025641025641,0.1789102564102564,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
