6.0,"Great concept, mediocre execution","A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how na√Øve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to ""fix"" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.",great concept mediocre execution,tough one rate it certainly has entertainment value but its frustrating that it could have been so much better one hand concept bringing villains other spidermen alternate universes is fantastic it was great see some these characters again there is so much star power cast here special effects are wonderful other hand there is quite bit bloat as well im all character development non action scenes action movies but too often these moments were poorly written bogged film down i have say i didnt care how na ve tom hollands version spider man was either i could never buy concept that he would try fix villains before sending them back their own universes this seemed asinine me how that would stop them dying where they came was mystery too there are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted dr strange getting trapped by some quick spidey math or boring peter parker his friends their college admission drama good grief give me more green goblin willem dafoe less ned leeds goofy sidekick,0.47740429505135396,0.055695611577964536,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Phenomenal conclusion,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.",phenomenal conclusion,spider man no way home is phenomenal conclusion trilogy hollands best outing as spidey yet starts off fun safe familiar then becomes extremely emotional satisfying full great callbacks love letter all things spider man tom holland gives incredible lead performance once again reliably charming likeable but with lot more emotional heft this time around zendaya jacob batalon both have perfect chemistry with holland are also incredible their own ways benedict cumberbatch reaffirms why hes such good doctor strange with his excellent dry wit gravitas all returning villains give strong performances but willem dafoe is definitely standout performance with unsettling terrifying presence jon watts direction is superb action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around theres few homages styles previous iterations some gorgeous imagery its also perfectly paced with none its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due strong momentum established early cg is extremely impressive with only few weak spots music by michael giacchino is fantastic nice balance themes previous iterations use hollands iconic motifs which are slightly altered ways that work as well as few new additions that are beautifully epic,0.6070040022870211,0.2871640937678674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
5.0,"I consider myself to be a big fan of Marvel and definitely of Spider-Man, but something wasn't right about this film","Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be ""cured""(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like ""yeah this guy sucks"" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.",i consider myself be big fan marvel definitely spider man but something wasnt right about this film,awful movie plot sucked had awful pacing humour dialogue were subpar like octopus joke they couldnt think anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didnt save this poorly written film one bad dialogue scene was when 3 spider men where making jokes about tobeys organic webs which was just awkward humorless add that tobey saying that my back joke norman osborn repeating im something scientist myself just why film could never decide whether its comedy or dark action movie this movie certifies that tom holland is worst spider man with great power comes great responsibility mcu spider man lacks that hes had 6 movies still acts like inexperienced immature not independent not smart acts like rookie whole plot started because he couldnt think alternative get him his friends college so he got doctor strange go make spell so that everyone will forget that peter is spider man also doing it without his friends consent course with peter being doofus he is he messes up spell which causes multiverse collide theres reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him one spider mans best traits is his quick thinking it was so inevitable that after messing up spell he decides go talk headteacher college placement same scene where doctor octopus appears youd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains far home but no he does it again which caused aunt mays death it could have been avoided if he had just sent them home but no they needed be cured which is odd because lizard was cured amazing spider man it just made him look sappy too disney like thinking he can change their fate its also not smart invite dangerous villains into your house with non superhero family member there how could he trust them that quickly when you see it you find it hard feel bad peter because youre like yeah this guy sucks emotional scenes this movie were pretty awful especially how long stretched mays death was they still tried exchange jokes had her standing up right before dying also re wording uncle bens infamous line which sounded wrong family member deaths are always before character becomes hero so doing it after feels cheap it wasnt even basic superhero bad luck just spider man not thinking straight marvel really need new writers especially comedic department because theyve released 4 bad movies this year tv show that messed up timeline just like no way home did theyve also ruined spider mans character by not properly developing him just throwing him into avengers drama they are cash grabbers only adding him because he is popular it will get movie ticket sales up no way home is one few movies that make me wish villains had won reason is that plot armour spider man was too strong like when geometry was somehow answer get out mirror dimension green goblin was right about his morality getting better him overall this movie was just overhyped over budgeted nostalgia bait spider man is real antagonist this film always puts people danger no reason,0.5446677660963374,-0.03220813577956433,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Somehow better than Endgame,"It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.",somehow better than endgame,its hard discuss this movie not get into spoilers because biggest moments this movie necessitate ruining several big reveals i loved that not everything was trailer i successfully avoided reading too much about film which helped my enjoyment this was first movie ive seen theater since halloween kills so risk covid 19 all its variants didnt keep me away biggest movie year this movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes movie so let me break down my opinion movies can be anything you want them be there is equal room high end oscar contender as there is junk low end world that i live places where godfrey ho jess franco bruno mattei make their home what else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers no small amount sound fury so yeah this is 27th marvel cinematic universe movie you know you dont have watch these movies hollywood world is still making something everyone but crowd pleasing moments two biggest ive heard years are when captain america lifted mjolnir when one characters arrived this film literally explosion happiness joy audience that has weathered so much last two years isnt that why movies exist make us feel something no movie that i have seen theater nearly decade has elicited that emotional outburst you know it brought true joy my heart so i didnt feel silly expressing my emotions whether they were happy when certain legal professional made his presence known or sadness dr stranges final words peter parker spider man has always lived by lesson that with great power comes great responsibility hes character informed every incarnation by great loss that he was at fault lifetime making up that mistake yet spider man no way home presents us with something new great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies at times working make them better people not just punching them into oblivion fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke me someone usually given mad revenge schemes years grudges even when doing right thing ends up hurting you you still can do right thing these are big concepts comic book spectacle this movie does what all great films should its stuck my mind since i saw it i wanted some time away it before i wrote this spider man is story bully grown up moving past way he was treated often finding those bullies flash thompson eddie brock become if not friends certainly no longer enemies this also gets into marvel idea multiverse connected web other realities where small differences disney set this up with what if this idea will form heart doctor strange multiverse madness but main part this story remains refreshingly human midst big ideas strange science concepts like how magic works look i dont have sell you these movies they make so much money that theyre critic proof but i do want you consider that even if you hate superhero movies even if you think there are too many them consider your favorite film series what if you had more than three original star wars films they all were progressively better what if last jason freddy or hellraiser movie was so much better than original what if james bond got more human more relevant more real as world around him became even stranger thats whats happening here its amazing im triple vaxxed beyond fastidious about mask wearing personal space rarely if ever leave my movie basement this isnt political statement viruses dont have politics if you think they do you can kindly never read another word that i write,0.46684650072150047,0.22121762265512265,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,"A franchise in decline, and this meta nonsense doesn't help","I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post ""Into the Spider-verse"" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was ""really, we're going there?"" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.",franchise decline this meta nonsense doesnt help,i was already concerned about spider man no way home when i walked into theater one could say i was expecting be disappointed i kind hate idea delving too deep into multiverse because i think it muddles things too much defies internal logic most stories sure enough that was something i felt while watching this film this movie cannot hold up even tiniest bit analysis because it creates plot holes that you can drive freight train through its kind sad because there were some moments movie that i genuinely loved but all i can think about days later are myriad questions that im left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense my other big problem with spider man no way home is not really fault movie but more society we live today living internet focused culture we are bombarded by ads news stories that relate things that interest us since ive shown my love all things mcu past course i see plenty things crossing my radar about upcoming films i was able avoid watching any trailers this movie which i thought would help but by merely catching headlines casting rumors i could foresee every surprise they built into it course any logical mind could put two two together once guest appearances start so i suppose this isnt movie that is going blow away audiences with its surprises as i said though my disappointment is quite frustrating because i also found many aspects no way home so satisfying they wrapped up some story elements nicely this might have contained some best acting any marvel movie particular i found zendaya so surprisingly strong i was almost able ignore her lack character motivation some key moments she wasnt only person film that behaved stupidly fact central premise film is built horrible idea aunt may that seems altruistic but lacks any 4th dimensional thinking which i would expect genius like peter parker but smart people being dumb is catalyst entire story as even dr strange doesnt seem think anything through past peters initial request no way home is easily most meta spider man movie ever made which is kind shocking say post into spider verse world its catering most die hard fans world but its more nod fans spider man movies i was always huge fan multitude spider man comic books when i was collector but ive typically struggled with his portrayal films so giving all these nods things that came before tom holland took over role big screen falls bit flat me one things i loved about this iteration character is that it avoided cliches saved us so much traditional spider man origin story but this movie back pedaled became copy copy copy this return cliche also sucked some emotion out key moments as any fan character should know same old tropes by now i almost got emotional at end because great acting performances but big emotional moment earlier film did nothing me as all i could think was really were going there there are some good laughs film although i wonder how well it will hold up rewatch i will rewatch this film as i do with all mcu movies but i think at this point spider man no way home sits as my least favorite franchise fact im at point right now where im questioning if i will keep being diehard fan everything mcu churns out this film wasnt what id call complete failure but im concerned mcu is getting closer one those perhaps endgame should have been exactly what title implies,0.5198155019583591,0.10761511216056671,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.24}"
4.0,Nonsense And Nostalgia,"Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the ""jokes"", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.",nonsense nostalgia,review by kamal ki dont think this film was written well it had already established spider man characters with no involvement with stark but still failed at making toms peter any better than he was when under tony starks mentorship this movie was not good no amount nostalgia saved it me it had pacing issues example movie skimmed past peters whole identity exposed moment chucked daredevil meaningless cameo as nobody seemed truly care that as blind man he was able catch brick chucked through window he was literally just there fanservice not well written one rest movie is pointless as by end they just reverse everything by sending spider men villains back their world after course seemingly retconning plots previous spider man movies by curing villains who were taken before they met their demise therefore their fights with spider man end lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards end original battles so peter parkers wouldnt experience key character development progression their stories this usual mcu fashion film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit but mostly fall flat awful humour which is constantly blurted out after or during serious moments because writers simply couldnt leave us without jokes two whole minutes constant tonal shifts because jokes peters just felt like they needed be there toms peter bad writing at its finest yes this whole movie couldve been avoided if peter just listened doctor strange man who actually knows magic consequences messing spells up but nope he has be stupid when he is supposed be smart strange was literally best character entire film just being only one with working braincell overall i found this movie quite bad nothing about it made me want rewatch it i have been feeling this with mcu movies recently like black widow shang chi i will continue watch spider man movies just because my love character but i will most likely continue think mcus portrayal character is worst even though tom hollands acting is great,0.517572463768116,-0.05548654244306414,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.36}"

6.0,Definitely one for the fans...,"Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of ""Spider-Man"" in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",definitely one fans,right well i am by no means fan superhero movies but i will watch them when given chance why solely entertainment purposes because marvel studios does make rather impressive movies now dont they indeed that is also why i opted sit down watch 2021 movie spider man no way home here 2022 actually my family went watch spider man no way home back 2021 when it was out cinema but i didnt go as i dont think superhero movies are worth ticket admission cinema so instead i opted watch it when it became readily accessible at comforts my home writers chris mckenna erik sommers actually put together wholesome enough storyline here this movie sure it was watchable enjoyable outstanding or memorable no not so much but then again i am not overly keen whole superhero genre but spider man no way home did provide me with entertainment 148 minutes that movie ran it was actually fun enough watch various spider men come together screen fight villains previous movies all over again nostalgia perhaps but at same time sort lazy writing when you think about it visually then spider man no way home was phenomenal but then again that is what marvel studios excel at isnt it spider man no way home certainly has impressive cast list with lot big names i mean you have tom holland andrew garfield tobey maguire as spider man then you have jamie foxx willem dafoe alfred molina rhys ifans thomas haden church return reprise their former villainous roles movie also have likes talents such as j k simmons marisa tomei jon favreau such cast list as well it was nice though see that writers were taking many previous movies franchise with grain salt some times throughout course movie with puns snazzy dialogue hinting at referencing previous movies spider man no way home definitely is pleasing movie fans superhero movies spider man general my rating spider man no way home lands six out ten stars,0.4380900167084378,0.1659722222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.23}"

No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D.

In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman.

Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions.

6.0,"A good, not great movie.","This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.",good not great movie,this is best film marvel has released this year shang chi was only ok venom sequel was atrocious black widow was so so eternals was bland most part what makes this one work is cast but story really when examined is weak last movie put writers corner while revealing silly idea really peters identity world he goes doctor strange without thinking about what he really wants ends up typical spider man fashion screwing everything up so also usual spider man style by trying fix things up he totally messes up further end this costs him lot while this movie starts out well middle is dull why should peter care about beings alternate realities by fixing them did he erase events those films making spider men those realities unnecessary peter loses everything due his listening aunt may whos advice is illogical gets her killed well i can say this was best hollands trilogy but it still isnt spider man 2 few sides molina garfield maguires returns were best part this movie those three steal every single scene theyre dafoe was good as norman but i could have done without electro sandman who added little story while others are falling over themselves gushing over this i think i may be suffering superhero fatigue,0.42492784992784993,0.04392135642135642,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.2}"

10.0,Homeless and restless,"There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones!

10.0,An Epic Film That Really Delivers,"Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character Tom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters Zendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story The story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script MCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style The film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.",epic film that really delivers,finally biggest film spider man no way home has hit cinemas i had go see it as early as possible now i have watched it here is my review film premise film sees spider mans secret identity revealed he tries get doctor stranges help fix things but this leads some unwanted visitors other universes cause problems both them main character tom holland has played spider man while now me this is his best performance role you really see how he has grown this film shows real depth character how he has kind grown up into this crazy world he doesnt have much rest film it really pushes holland impress majority his scenes i thought he was great really making spider man top hero mcu supporting characters zendaya plays mj i was just really happy see dynamic between her peter this film despite everything that goes they are pretty strong couple it is just nice comic book film have relationship that feels natural without overpowering main plot benedict cumberbatch reprises his role as doctor strange he is really good i really like how despite being hero he has more mature different viewpoint spider man he adds some really interesting parts film plays unique role progress story spider man as character jacob batalon is back as ned he is much better then role he played far home he is just fun character that supports peter he is way more involved with spider man that improves his character so much marisa tomei is back as aunt may again she is more involved this time out is just really great person holland bounce off dynamic just really works makes their relationship feel very real willem dafoe alfred molina jamie foxx reprise their roles as green goblin doctor octopus electro dafoe molina are great really flourish their roles but surprise is foxx as max dillon electro he is so much better then he was amazing spider man 2 i am glad he got given this 2nd chance here story story is really great i was worried with all multiverse elements that focus could have been taken off character arc spider man but it nails this element peter has real arc it develops incredibly well me was real highlight it is obviously great seeing returning villains they are treated with respect their characters are further explored ending feels deserved because you are so invested it feels really earnt script mcu films often get criticised their scripts including too much humour them but i actually think balance is really handled well here yes there are funny moments here but me they didnt outweigh serious darker parts film style film looks great actions scenes are all really fun seeing mcu spider man going against villains other franchises works very well allows some fun sequences pacing film is also really good despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long i honestly believe that there isnt really any filler here which is impressive feat overall overall spider man no way home is epic film that really lives up hype i am possibly still buzzing because i have just watched film but i cant find too much fault this is spider man fans dream film anybody will find this film plenty fun rating 10 10,0.46476190476190493,0.2656944444444444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.32}"
