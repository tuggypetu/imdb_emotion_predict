4.0,Ten things about Fallen Kingdom,"1) It's bad. I didn't like Jurassic World, but this is worse. It's got broad characters, lackluster set-pieces, a noisy score and the kind of script which should be punishable by throwing its writers to sharks. At least Jurassic World, mediocre as it was, had the good sense to copy the first Jurassic Park. Fallen Kingdom foolishly imitates The Lost World instead, with a semi-watchable first half on the island and an abysmal last act with dinosaurs wreaking havoc back to civilization.Kudos to the late John Hammond for building his park on a volcanic island. Also, I hate to ask but, since it's a plot point that dinosaurs will face extinction (again!) if they are not rescued from Isla Nublar... what happened to Isla Sorna (Jurassic Park 2 and 3)? There were dinosaurs on it as well. I'm sure some novelization or website makes up a lame excuse, but the movie doesn't.2) Stop overcomplicating blockbusters. Jurassic Park featured a smart sci-fi premise, but the actual plot had an elegant simplicity to it. Fallen Kingdom is the opposite, dumb but convoluted, tossing in betrayals, cloned little girls and evil corporations selling dinosaurs to warlords.3) Speaking of that, enough with the ""dinosaurs as military weapons"" nonsense! This is a concept which appealed to all of us when we were kids (""I want to ride a T-Rex! With a rocket launcher mounted on its back!""), but you cannot have War Dinosaurs in anything that wants to be taken seriously by adults.You know why Navy SEALs don't have trained lions? Why no army breeds rhinos to ride them into battle? Because nobody in modern warfare would spend millions for a huge beast which would be an economical and logistical nightmare to raise, train, feed and manage, especially when a random enemy soldier could blow it to smithereens with a 100 $ grenade. Someone should tell writer Colin Trevorrow that war elephants aren't a thing anymore, while firearms and explosives are.Note that the dinosaur boogey of this movie, the Indoraptor, is so ineffectual that it repeatedly fails to kill its unarmed preys in the endless climax. Some infallible weapon: there is a scene where three characters are pinned under a tree and the Indoraptor manages to... scratch one of them in the knee before they escape. You know what could have killed them more efficiently than your War Dinosaur? One guy with a pistol!By the way, the Indoraptor is trained to attack targets after you point a laser at them and emit an audio cue. Wait a second - if you are already pointing a gun with a laser beam at someone, can't you just PULL THE TRIGGER? It's a 30 cents bullet versus a 30 millions dinosaur. Bad guys, do your math.4) Fallen Kingdom assumes you are really, really interested in Blue, the Chris Pratt-trained Raptor from Jurassic World. This is understandable, since Owen's relationship with his Raptors was one of the few bits from the previous film which at least felt novel. However, the script retcons Blue into a sympathetic, heroic creature which displayed diligence and empathy since it was young; funny, I recall her killing several innocents in the previous movie and attacking Chris Pratt himself with no provocation in their first scene.5) Since we mention Pratt: much like Jurassic World, this movie doesn't know how to use him. Pratt is ideally cast not as a badass, but as someone who *thinks* is a badass - a character who is capable but still out of his league. He works so much better as a slightly comedic, self-deprecating protagonist than as a tediously infallible, dead-eyed action figure.His Owen never changes. There is more character development implied with a small prop in Jurassic Park (the Raptor claw Grant uses to scare a kid at the beginning and then throws away after bonding with Tim and Lex) than in all Owen's scenes in Fallen Kingdom.6) Howard is inoffensive but unremarkable as Claire: she is just kind of there, blandly good-looking, doing no damage but adding little value, like a lettuce in a sandwich. Her two sidekicks (Scared Nerd and Tough Latina) are insufferable though.(By the way, how is Claire not rotting in jail as the aftermath of Jurassic World? She is directly responsible for the dozens of casualties there, poorly handling the Indominus' escape and refusing to evacuate the island. She must have one hell of a lawyer.)7) Poor Rafe Spall, a competent actor (see The Ritual, a much better monster movie), plays Greedy Corporate Guy, an antagonist so flat and obvious that I was disappointed he didn't get an Evil Laugh Scene... you know, he throws his head back and bellows ""Bwahaha!"" while the camera cranes up.I love how Rafe Spall builds a containment facility for dinosaurs under James Cromwell's mansion. Cromwell plays Old Sick Naive Rich Guy. Sorry, I don't care how old, sick and naive you are: you have no excuses if you don't realize someone is HIDING DINOSAURS IN YOUR BASEMENT. Really, Trevorrow? Is this some kind of spoof?8) CGI is fine but overused. It's a visually busy movie.I'll give them credit for making the Indoraptor more visually distinctive than the Indominus. At least they sort of splashed some yellow on it.9) While Bayona's direction is competent (certainly better than this script deserved), I didn't care for most of the set-pieces. Remember how Spielberg took his sweet time with the T-Rex breakout or the Raptors in the kichen? Here most action beats are over right after they begin (the Baryonyx, the Carnotaurus...). There is no build-up, no crescendo. It's the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation.It's not just a matter of screentime though; the Dilophosaurus appeared in the first film for two minutes and is more memorable than any of the new creatures here. You have to do something creative and unique with your movie monsters. For example, the bunker attack could have been carried out by any carnivore; if you wanted a Baryonyx (which was possibly a semi-aquatic predator like the Spinosaurus), why not put it in the sinking gyrosphere scene?I did enjoy the prologue with the T-Rex and the Mosasaurus, although... why would the Jurassic World engineers build a giant door which allows the Mosasaurus to reach the ocean? What kind of scenario were they envisioning where the escape of the humongous sea monster would be a positive outcome?I mean, come on. I'm not usually a nitpicker, but this movie seems to be trolling anyone giving it a minimum amount of thought. A plot hole doesn't automatically ruin a story, but the cumulative effect of all this nonsense conveys a staggering lack of thought and care.10) The silly ending sets up another sequel. I guess we'll finally get the inevitable War Dinosaurs.*sigh*4/10To people asking ""What were you expecting in a film about dinosaurs?"", I answer: ""Something maybe not on par, but at least in the same league as Jurassic Park, one of my favorite movies of all time"".",ten things about fallen kingdom,1 its bad i didnt like jurassic world but this is worse its got broad characters lackluster set

3.0,Life doesn't find a way....,"Three years after the destruction of the Jurassic World theme park, Owen Grady and Claire Dearing return to the island of Isla Nublar to save the remaining dinosaurs from a volcano that's about to erupt. They soon encounter terrifying new breeds of dinosaurs, whist uncovering a conspiracy that threatens the entire planet.....I was so happy with Jurassic World when released in 2015. It somehow caught some of the magic that was so crucial to the ground breaking first movie. So despite the maundering trailers, the poor one sheets, and an air of excitement that seemed as sparse as when JP3 was released, my expectations were pretty high for this.And why shouldn't they have been? Here we have a great director, the chemistry between Pratt and Howard made JW much more than just a reboot to a much loved masterpiece.But no, this has to be one of the most disappointing films not just of this summer, but of any summer since that magical one of 1993. It just takes everything that worked with JW, and extracted it and added elements that just made the film almost unbearable to endure. Yes, the efects are amazing, and the opening scene is decidedly quite effective, but when we get to the charachters proper, you can see the lack chemistry that was so important in the last chapter.Pratt looks bored on the verge of saying 'Am I the biggest star in the world yet?', and Howard is resorted to nothing more than a bolshy babysitter for the children in the film.The film has a gothic element to it toward the final act, when we meet Jones and his prehistoric auction. But one couldn't help but hark back to 2008's 'Taken' where we see Neeson compelling his next victim to bid for his daughter.It's a crying shame that the film goes for the lazy route and resorts to nothing but the cast running away from clouds of smoke and panicking dinosaurs.And if you didn't already know, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen Goldblum's appearance.A turgid, lazy film, easily one of the worst of the year.",life doesnt find way,three years after destruction jurassic world theme park owen grady claire dearing return island isla nublar save remaining dinosaurs volcano thats about erupt they soon encounter terrifying new breeds dinosaurs whist uncovering conspiracy that threatens entire planet i was so happy with jurassic world when released 2015 it somehow caught some magic that was so crucial ground breaking first movie so despite maundering trailers poor one sheets air excitement that seemed as sparse as when jp3 was released my expectations were pretty high this why shouldnt they have been here we have great director chemistry between pratt howard made jw much more than just reboot much loved masterpiece but no this has be one most disappointing films not just this summer but any summer since that magical one 1993 it just takes everything that worked with jw extracted it added elements that just made film almost unbearable endure yes efects are amazing opening scene is decidedly quite effective but when we get charachters proper you can see lack chemistry that was so important last chapter pratt looks bored verge saying am i biggest star world yet howard is resorted nothing more than bolshy babysitter children film film has gothic element it toward final act when we meet jones his prehistoric auction but one couldnt help but hark back 2008s taken where we see neeson compelling his next victim bid his daughter its crying shame that film goes lazy route resorts nothing but cast running away clouds smoke panicking dinosaurs if you didnt already know if youve seen trailer youve seen goldblums appearance turgid lazy film easily one worst year,0.6743296602387513,0.11074839302112029,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,The Weakest of the Series,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)** (out of 4)With the remaining dinosaurs about to be killed off by an active and large volcano, activist Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) agrees to take a mission back to the island to try and save them. She talks Owen (Chris Pratt) into going with her but soon they are forced to make some decisions about the dinosaurs and especially when they realize that they've been double crossed.JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM isn't the bomb that some are making it out to be but at the same time there's no question that it's the weakest film in the series and that's really too bad because there was an interesting story here that director J.A. Bayona just couldn't reel in. It's really too bad because this very well could have been the best of the series but the lackluster direction and lack of suspense really ruined it.I thought the best stuff happened on the island when our leads must try to rescue the dinosaurs as well as survive the volcano. I really enjoyed the scenes dealing with the volcano and I must admit that I think the film would have been much better had it stayed on the island. It unfortunately heads back to land and we get into the second half of the film that deals with poachers and an auction sale of the dinosaurs. The entire third act just didn't work for me due to a number of reasons.I understand movies like this need the viewer to follow the ""suspension of disbelief"" but to me this only works when what you're watching keeps you glued to the screen. You're so caught up in what's going on that your brain doesn't think about some of the things that you are watching. If you're bored with what you're watching, as I was with this film, then you mind starts to wonder and you start picking apart what you're seeing. I mean, how did all of these dinosaurs fit into this one mansion? Wouldn't their weight destroy this place? There are countless other examples where I was just rolling my eyes.Pratt and Howard are in good form but it's Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) who steals the picture playing bad as only he can. He was certainly very entertaining and I'd say he easily stole the film. As you'd expect the CGI was wonderful looking as was the score and cinematography. Technically speaking the film was good for what it was.However, the problem remains that the direction was rather lackluster and the lack of any real suspense just killed things. I really didn't think the second portion of the story worked and at the end of the day there's no question that this is a very flawed film that is also the least entertaining of the series.",weakest series,jurassic world fallen kingdom 2018 out 4 with remaining dinosaurs about be killed off by active large volcano activist claire dearing bryce dallas howard agrees take mission back island try save them she talks owen chris pratt into going with her but soon they are forced make some decisions about dinosaurs especially when they realize that theyve been double crossed jurassic world fallen kingdom isnt bomb that some are making it out be but at same time theres no question that its weakest film series thats really too bad because there was interesting story here that director j bayona just couldnt reel its really too bad because this very well could have been best series but lackluster direction lack suspense really ruined it i thought best stuff happened island when our leads must try rescue dinosaurs as well as survive volcano i really enjoyed scenes dealing with volcano i must admit that i think film would have been much better had it stayed island it unfortunately heads back land we get into second half film that deals with poachers auction sale dinosaurs entire third act just didnt work me due number reasons i understand movies like this need viewer follow suspension disbelief but me this only works when what youre watching keeps you glued screen youre so caught up whats going that your brain doesnt think about some things that you are watching if youre bored with what youre watching as i was with this film then you mind starts wonder you start picking apart what youre seeing i mean how did all these dinosaurs fit into this one mansion wouldnt their weight destroy this place there are countless other examples where i was just rolling my eyes pratt howard are good form but its ted levine buffalo bill silence lambs who steals picture playing bad as only he can he was certainly very entertaining id say he easily stole film as youd expect cgi was wonderful looking as was score cinematography technically speaking film was good what it was however problem remains that direction was rather lackluster lack any real suspense just killed things i really didnt think second portion story worked at end day theres no question that this is very flawed film that is also least entertaining series,0.43700148809523803,0.07260664682539685,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,Worst Thing I've Ever Seen,"What should be tackle first, the annoying millenials who mouth off to a veteran soldier, because surprise surprise, he's a corporate baddie, or the hammer-to-the-head speech that permeates through Jeff Goldblum's just-give-me my damn Jurassic money blank soulless joyless face. This movie is terrible. Not tolerably terrible. Awful. Poorly made, laughable situations, and the silliest set up from a Frankenstein of other movies done better. Who is this J.A. Bayona tool? He's dumb. That's for making me suffer through terrible dialogue and a dino-blood transfer.Volcano going to destroy the park/world where the two dummies harnessed the power and wonder of dinosaurs. Oh no we have to save them!! Enter Claire Dearing. You remember the one who was fleeing for her life? Now runs a cause to protect them. Incidentally, you dummies who wrote this...the Pteradactlys were shown at the end...couldn't they leave the island whenever. Seriously, this is dumb road we're going down. Except, a former business partner/dreamer of John Hammond wants to preserve them. So he funds this excursion. By the way, here's a skeezy looking caretaker of the estate Eli Mills, to deal with the logistics whilst he is bedridden. Yep.I'm not going to waste any more time with this joyless garbage only that it is dumb beyond words. There was a moment, wait...I have to tell this because it's so dumb...where Clair and some annoying Millenial they had tag along because he's a computer geek, are stuck in the travel orb, which falls into the ocean. Our hero, Owen Grady first attempts to shoot out the glass, yes...he does this. Then he surfaces, I think...hard to say, and comes back with...a knife! Yes, a knife, and prys the door loose.

8.0,BIG MISTAKE,"You would think by now that crazed scientists meddling with Mother Nature would realize that thing are more than likely not going to turn out as they planned. In the very first film character Ian Malcolm warned them that they were messing with things best left untouched. But no one seems to listen.As a matter of fact in JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM the film opens with Malcolm (again played by Jeff Goldblum) offering that same warning once more. At the end of the last film, JURASSIC WORLD, the concept of a theme park filled with dinosaurs once again crumbled with the dinosaurs attacking and people dying. Isla Nubar, the island where it took place, was left to the dinosaurs and those that survived left. Here we are a few years later with a volcano about to erupt on the island and activists are trying to save the dinosaurs.Leading that cause is Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) who worked on the island and survived. Not wanting these creatures to return to extinction she pleads her case to anyone who will listen. That would include Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), a billionaire and ex-friend of the park's original creator John Hammond. With the help of his right hand man Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) he plans on rescuing the dinosaurs at his expense. He does so to honor his friend and to please his granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon). They need Claire for two reasons. The first is her handprint for security reasons. The second is to recruit Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). It seems Blue, the velociraptor, has evaded them and they know he is the only one who can bring her in. He argues, relents and the next thing you know the two of them along with two other members of Claire's group are on a plane headed for Isla Nubar. When they arrive things aren't quite what they expected. The team in place is not just scientists but mercenaries led by Ken Wheatley (Ted Levine). Trying to work together his men bypass Owen's demand to back off when he finds Blue and they tranquilize the dinosaur and Owen as well, leaving him behind for the lava coming down the mountain. Claire and one of her group are left behind as well, only the doctor among them kept on hand to insure Blue survives. It's a double cross and the saving of the dinosaurs is not the intent of this group. Their safety is important for one reason only, their survival until they can make it back to the mainland at Lockwood's mansion. Crosses and double crosses follow and soon the real reason for their rescue is learned. Fortunately Owen, Claire and her friends have survived, made it onboard with the dinosaurs and may be able to save them from the plans in store for them.Like the films in the series before this one the main eye candy here is the dinosaurs. The ability of CGI has boomed since the first film released in 1993. Not only are the dinosaurs that amazed all of us when first seen on board, like the brontosaurus, the geneticists have once more created a new dinosaur that is more dangerous than the last one they created. Ever notice they only create killing dinosaurs and never a cute little dinosaur? The effects with the dinosaurs aren't the only ones to witness either. The destruction of Isla Nubar via volcano, the dinosaurs that were left behind and the effects of the flowing lava also create some stunning and disturbing visuals.Perhaps the only thing skimped on in this film is the lack of character development. Certainly after the last film we know the two leads but what about the rest? They're given short shrift here and we get to know them in bits and pieces which are few and far between. Even Goldblum in his return to the franchise is only on hand for a brief moment at the beginning and in voice over towards the end. Lockwood is glossed over as well and clues about his granddaughter are nowhere to be seen. But this is a summer blockbuster type film and the important things are the dinosaurs, explosions and action sequences. Trust me when I say this film has plenty of those. They more than compensate for the lack of character development. The freshness of the movie is beginning to wear thin but it still provides a solid piece of entertainment that many will enjoy. Will I watch it a second or third time? Yeah, I think I will. Maybe a marathon weekend. A theme party. The movie is a lot of fun and will fuel the imaginations and nightmares of children who watch and give parents a good bit of action. I highly recommend this one for watching this week and down the road as well.",big mistake,you would think by now that crazed scientists meddling with mother nature would realize that thing are more than likely not going turn out as they planned very first film character ian malcolm warned them that they were messing with things best left untouched but no one seems listen as matter fact jurassic world fallen kingdom film opens with malcolm again played by jeff goldblum offering that same warning once more at end last film jurassic world concept theme park filled with dinosaurs once again crumbled with dinosaurs attacking people dying isla nubar island where it took place was left dinosaurs those that survived left here we are few years later with volcano about erupt island activists are trying save dinosaurs leading that cause is claire dearing bryce dallas howard who worked island survived not wanting these creatures return extinction she pleads her case anyone who will listen that would include benjamin lockwood james cromwell billionaire ex friend parks original creator john hammond with help his right hand man eli mills rafe spall he plans rescuing dinosaurs at his expense he does so honor his friend please his granddaughter maisie isabella sermon they need claire two reasons first is her handprint security reasons second is recruit owen grady chris pratt it seems blue velociraptor has evaded them they know he is only one who can bring her he argues relents next thing you know two them along with two other members claires group are plane headed isla nubar when they arrive things arent quite what they expected team place is not just scientists but mercenaries led by ken wheatley ted levine trying work together his men bypass owens demand back off when he finds blue they tranquilize dinosaur owen as well leaving him behind lava coming down mountain claire one her group are left behind as well only doctor among them kept hand insure blue survives its double cross saving dinosaurs is not intent this group their safety is important one reason only their survival until they can make it back mainland at lockwoods mansion crosses double crosses follow soon real reason their rescue is learned fortunately owen claire her friends have survived made it onboard with dinosaurs may be able save them plans store them like films series before this one main eye candy here is dinosaurs ability cgi has boomed since first film released 1993 not only are dinosaurs that amazed all us when first seen board like brontosaurus geneticists have once more created new dinosaur that is more dangerous than last one they created ever notice they only create killing dinosaurs never cute little dinosaur effects with dinosaurs arent only ones witness either destruction isla nubar via volcano dinosaurs that were left behind effects flowing lava also create some stunning disturbing visuals perhaps only thing skimped this film is lack character development certainly after last film we know two leads but what about rest theyre given short shrift here we get know them bits pieces which are few far between even goldblum his return franchise is only hand brief moment at beginning voice over towards end lockwood is glossed over as well clues about his granddaughter are nowhere be seen but this is summer blockbuster type film important things are dinosaurs explosions action sequences trust me when i say this film has plenty those they more than compensate lack character development freshness movie is beginning wear thin but it still provides solid piece entertainment that many will enjoy will i watch it second or third time yeah i think i will maybe marathon weekend theme party movie is lot fun will fuel imaginations nightmares children who watch give parents good bit action i highly recommend this one watching this week down road as well,0.4300558261183262,0.08268023989898989,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"
1.0,Save your money,"I am truly shocked at all the people who have given this movie a 9 or 10, just plain surprised at anyone who give it more than a 3. Makes me wonder about the ratings system on IMDB because these people can't possibly have enjoyed this movie.It started out okay but quickly went down hill. A once dormant volcano on Isla Nublar is starting to erupt. I guess John Hammond didn't give that a thought when he built Jurassic Park. So now our heroes have been summoned by Hammond's one time partner to save the dinos. Only he's oblivious to what is really going on. The head ""bad"" guy wants to bring the dinosaurs, not to a supposed sanctuary like he told our heroes but to this castle in Northern California where they have strong cages in the basement. There's an auction with some caricatures of bad guys, a granddaughter who is not what she appears (although I suspected it rather quickly) and the usual action sequences from all the other JP's included the T-Rex who saves our heroes once again. Anybody recall how much noise the T-Rex made in the first couple of scenes in the original? However from the middle of the first one, they apparently have taken ninja training as they show up out of nowhere.I felt a little sad for the dinosaurs left on the island as the volcano was exploding but that is the only emotion other than boredom I felt in this movie.

2.0,So bland. Tonally uneven. No memorable character moments. Awful.,"Its as much of a non-film as I can remember. Somehow, Spielberg made a cup of water and the sound of footsteps far more suspenseful and engaging than anything in this movie. The dinosaurs are just sort of... there. Same goes for Chris Pratt, who features in scenes but only mildly forwarding the story with a few rescues or whatever. There are some cringe-worthy moments - firing a gun underwater to break glass, everyone being submersed but having perfect hair/makeup after, a horribly acted young girl who has the most shoe-horned and pointless subplot ever (as well as a nonsensical, cringe inducing climactic line). So much of the story makes no sense, a hybrid dino is basically produced and supposedly trained to follow laser sighting overnight. Yet has no buildup, suspense or point whatsoever. The whole thing is stranger than a David Lynch movie. Its like a string of bland cutscenes to a dull videogame.",so bland tonally uneven no memorable character moments awful,its as much non film as i can remember somehow spielberg made cup water sound footsteps far more suspenseful engaging than anything this movie dinosaurs are just sort there same goes chris pratt who features scenes but only mildly forwarding story with few rescues or whatever there are some cringe worthy moments firing gun underwater break glass everyone being submersed but having perfect hair makeup after horribly acted young girl who has most shoe horned pointless subplot ever as well as nonsensical cringe inducing climactic line so much story makes no sense hybrid dino is basically produced supposedly trained follow laser sighting overnight yet has no buildup suspense or point whatsoever whole thing is stranger than david lynch movie its like string bland cutscenes dull videogame,0.6204861111111111,0.03090277777777776,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.48}"

2.0,Another Lost World,"I suppose kudos to the great volcano effects, but this was filmed in Hawaii, perhaps too soon.I understand the original reboot/remake came out three years ago, but this fifth Jurassic movie felt so rushed, it might as well been part of the Star Wars Universe. I'm certain this fallen kingdom's script was written in under a weekend and never edited.So, you liked the nostalgia from Jurassic World? Well, let's shove an unwanted ten times more down your throat. You like environmental messages? I believe you still have room to shove more down your throat. And you love that young, Spielberg-type comic relief that'll ensure laughs even in the tensest of times? Oops, sorry, the ""comic relief"" in this movie is criminally unfunny.""Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. And I'm gonna be there when you learn that,"" predicts Dr. Ian Malcolm from The Lost World: Jurassic Park. And, boy was he right, in many different ways, but in regards to bad ideas, take the volcano.You seriously built the second park on a potentially island-ending volcano? Or was that just a convenient plot device for Part V...oh. Never mind.The fourth Jurassic movie ripped off the first one, so naturally, the fifth installment would rip-off the second Jurassic sequel. It's all about the same characters tricked into going back to the island they barely survived previously and the most obvious evil businessmen who want to take the dinos off the island.I spent a good 60% of this movie viciously shaking my head at actions/reactions that would surely never happen and even going as far as to say outloud, ""Nope. Nope. Nope."" I understand you should have to suspend your disbelief for a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs, but I'm talking about the impossible stunts, simple physics and increasingly dumb mistakes no human would make but these characters did oh so frequently.This movie was so horribly written, edited and paced, overlong to the point 20-30 minutes could've been cut, darker and yet more dumbed down for kids and not a single character stood out or had an ounce of chemistry with each other. Oh, okay, I'll give the character of Zia Rodriguez some credit. I did like her character.And I loved the special effects in the first third, which is what you would've seen in the trailers. It's just the last two-thirds that progressively fell-apart with the worst message to give. In fact, I kept refuting that dumb environmental decision and added that to my head-shaking exercise throughout.Well, I can say, if you're impressed with what you saw in the trailer, come, stay for the first third and just leave then. Nothing else is worth staying for.***Final thoughts: Can't believe I'm saying this, but Jurassic Park III is no longer the worst movie in the franchise. While III was terrible, this one is incomprehensible.

9.0,I'm As Surprised As You Are...The 2nd Best Jurassic Park Film To Date,"It's very much worth noting that I absolutely hated the original Jurassic World. Colin Treverrow's 2015 reboot suffered from undeveloped and uninteresting characters, a lack of emotional stakes, hideous CGI and, above all, a distinct lack of any style or atmosphere. So how is it, pray tell, that its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, is one of my favorite films of the year and my 2nd favorite film in the franchise, surpassing even the 1993 Steven Spielberg classic? (For my money, nothing beats Spielberg's terrible and beautiful cautionary tale of nature, The Lost World: Jurassic Park) Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the rare modern franchise reboot with identity, sole and purpose, the rare reboot that genuinely succeeds with flying colors in re-capturing the lightning in a bottle that made the original great. It's not rehashing the original film and condescending the rest of your franchise legacy with awful meta humor like Halloween (2018), it's forging your own unique identity and breathing new life into the series. And Fallen Kingdom does that wonderfully.If you asked me to describe any of the characters in the original Jurassic World beyond their one-note personality quirks, I'd come up completely blank. If you were to ask me to describe the characters in Fallen Kingdom, however, I could go on forever. Claire Dearing is the Dr. Frankenstein of the film; passionate, proactive and blinded by her own ambitions, hubris and sense of righteousness. Her entire reputation, everything she's grown into since the events of Jurassic World, any chance she has at personal redemption for the lives lost on Isla Nublar 3 years ago, hinges on her saving the animals she once viewed as nothing more than corporate assets. She is driven by her emotions (Particularly her deep seated personal guilty), passions and code of ethics rather than merely plot convenience or cold, unconditional logic as was the case in the original Jurassic World. This makes her character far more relatable and human and her errors in decision making a lot more forgivable and understandable. Her arc from self-tortured and arrogant martyr to willing and humble hero is handled with a surprising degree of subtlety that not many critics have given her credit for. Owen Grady also benefits from a stronger characterization in Fallen Kingdom, we get to see more of his relationship with Blue and understand why and how he formed such a strong relationship with her. Fallen Kingdom does an excellent job establishing Owen as a man outside of and uncomfortable with the civilized world, exhausted with the pretensions and self righteousness of his fellow human beings. The honesty, trust and unconditional love he's shared with Blue since birth means the world to him and his love for her is the one thing he has left that's truly worth fighting for. Because the cast is playing actual characters this time around rather than merely hollow archetypes, the performances improve tenfold. Bryce Dallas Howard is allowed to be confident, fervent and passionate in her vocal delivery. Chris Pratt is allowed to be emotionally vulnerable and nuanced in his facial acting.Even the dinosaurs have more character here than they had in Jurassic World; Blue's mini-arc of feeling distrust and abandonment from Owen to repairing their broken relationship is certainly more character development than any terrible lizard of Jurassic Park movies prior and the Indoraptor has both an odd sense of tragedy and unique, slasher villain-esque aesthetic that give her a real sense of identity that the Indominus Rex lacked.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom possesses possibly the most striking and memorable aesthetic of any Jurassic Park film to date. The tone feels deliciously Gothic horror inspired with some beautifully chilling and dark imagery that really captures the feeling of terror and majesty held in the Crichton books. In an age where so many Hollywood blockbusters are so unbearably dull in their visuals, Fallen Kingdom retaining the style of a Gothic monster movie is as refreshing as it is gorgeous to take in. Also, it's definitely worth mentioning than the effects have improved significantly from Jurassic World, in large part due to the combination of CGI and animatronics and the darker pallete.Finally, I wish to discuss the film's ending and the character of Maisie, both of which have been under heavy scrutiny and both of which I loved. Isabella Sermon is one of the most endearing, ranged and talented child actresses I've seen since Danielle Harris and she does a phenomenal job handling her character's slow and methodical unraveling or her traumatizing origins. Maisie also brings real weight to the film's ethical question and a legitimate argument for why humanity shouldn't let the dinosaurs die. Maisie's creation as a clone was by all means unethical. However, this does not mean that killing or abandoning her would be the responsible decision to such an ethical mistake. This is why Maisie has to be the one to set them free into the world; she understands the ethical mistake behind their creation, but also that the murky ethical circumstances behind them is not necessarily their fault. She has an empathy for these creatures that none of the other humans do. The dinosaurs in Fallen Kingdom having much more in the way of characterization and personality already established the foundation for this argument and Maisie makes that argument all the more difficult to answer.If you had told me a year ago that I would be praising a Jurassic World sequel as the 2nd best in the entire franchise, I would have called you crazy. But, lo and behold...Here we are. I love this film to the point where I could defend it for hours. I love the themes, I love the performances, I love the characters, I love the effects. I loved it. I loved it. I'll keep saying it if you want me too.",im as surprised as you are 2nd best jurassic park film date,its very much worth noting that i absolutely hated original jurassic world colin treverrows 2015

9.0,"This movie gets the most crap and the hate for it, it is solid decent action sci-fi film my second favorite in the franchise","This movie gets the most crap and the hate for it, it is a solid decent action sci-fi film so what's the problem? It is a decent film I love the film. I would put it in my second favorite Jurassic Park film in the franchise. I know I am going to get a lot of hate because it is not a rant. In my opinion it is a good film I love it, if you hate the film is your opinion I have no problems with the film, but it is an improvement over Jurassic World I hated that film. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard returns and they are decent I love them in the film so much.When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.I enjoy the practical effects, the explosions, the acting, the story and the action. I love the CGI effect for the raging volcano This is a faster paced film it goes fast around. I enjoyed the film it was entertaining and I wasn't bored with it. I understand the story, the twist and what they try to do with the film. I got this movie on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it, I enjoy the film it is a guilty pleasure of mine. Call it whatever you want it I love it.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady was decent and really a good hero, he does good performance, he has more stuff to do than in the first one. Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing was one hot mama who showed emotions and she cared about dinosaurs and a rescue mission. She wasn't annoying she was fine and entertaining. I like Bryce Dallas Howard because she was in Spider-Man 3 as Gwen Stacy and I have enjoyed her performance more than Emma Stone in The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. I enjoy Ted Levine in this movie he was in Joy Ride and The Hills Have Eyes remake and I enjoy his performance to be a bad guy. I enjoyed Isabella Sermon as Maise little girl she wasn't annoying I liked her. Rafe Spall was awesome as Eli Mills the villain he was practically like Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) from Aliens who wanted a profit of capturing aliens while Mills try's to get rich by selling a live dinosaurs.CGi are better than in the previous movie and gets criticism for trying something different. At least this movie did not copy the first one or other movies like Jurassic World did. I love the first Jurassic Park to death it is the best one in the franchise by a novel who directed Steven Spielberg. I love Jurassic Park III and this one. Directed was by J. A. Bayona who made a good direction. I enjoy the film I would put the film between Aliens and Deep Rising the opening sequence is a really horror aspect, you see a man been eat by a sea monster. Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow wrote a script for the film and they did a good job Colin Trevorrow previously directed Jurassic World so I respect him.I love the idea the rescuing dinosaurs from raging volcano I thought was better idea then the Jurassic World did. The rescue mission was a ploy and Claire and Owen must try to save the dinosaurs from been sold on a black marked. The problems and dumb idea was the cloning little girl that was stupid and bad idea. Of course the T Rex- Veloceraptor blood transfusion was a bad idea too.My favorite scenes are in which Indoraptor hunts Owen and Maise throughout the mansion they are both on the roof but Claire shows up and distracts Indoraptor and of course Blue Velociraptor comes and saves them, kills prototype Indoraptor I loved that in the film. Jeff Goldblum has a cameo scene in the beginning of the film as Ian Malcolm and on the end of the film I don't mind him. BD Wong as Dr. Wu is also back as the bad guy he does a solid job. I love Claire and Franklin in an abandoned gyro-sphere to flee from the pyroclastic flow, but falls into the ocean that scene scared me because I thought they could have died for real. Excellent scene in the movie one of my favorites.I watch this movie twice in the row now, I know it is not perfect film it is not the greatest movie or the best one ever, I know it is stupid but I love it. I enjoy the film it is my second favorite film in the franchise.

7.0,An action packed entertainment,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is an Sci-fi action adventure movie directed by J. A. Bayona and stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, James Cromwell, Toby Jones and Isabella Sermon.The plot of the movie might be repetitive and nothing fresh is been offered in terms of story but still with good execution and strong CGI makes the movie quite watchable and entertaining.This time a volcano has got active on Isla Nublar a group of people are chosen to save the dinosaurs from extinction.Acting is great and Chris Pratt again shines in his role of Owen Grady the velociraptor handler and you will start liking him more and more. Bryce Dallas and Rafe Spall were equally impressive, Justice Smith and Daniella irritates in some scenes.Screenplay is predictable but still entertains, the director has been successful in getting sympathy for dinosaurs irrespective of their type and how brutal they can be because they have been created due to the greed of human.The CGI of the movie is certainly praiseworthy.

8.0,"More dinosaurs, Opie's hot daughter, Dracula's castle and Indiana Jones","""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" (2018) revolves around Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Chris Pratt) leading a team back to Isla Nublar to save several species of dinosaurs after an active volcano threatens all life there. The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that's not the way it works out.My title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) vibe more so than the other movies. The reference to Dracula's castle is due to the fact that the entire second half takes place at a cool, gothic chateau in Northern California and there's a scene with a genetically-enhanced raptor acting like Dracula.Curvy Bryce is just stunning throughout and easily blows away any other woman in the series. Meanwhile Pratt seriously upped his game as leading action hero (I wasn't overly impressed with him in the previous film, although I didn't dislike him either). At the end of the day I'd have to rank this installment as my favorite, followed by the original 1993 movie and 2015's ""Jurassic World.""The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and England/Scotland.GRADE: A-/B+",more dinosaurs opies hot daughter draculas castle indiana jones,jurassic world fallen kingdom 2018 revolves around claire bryce dallas howard owen chris pratt leading team back isla nublar save several species dinosaurs after active volcano threatens all life there plan is relocate dinosaurs new island sanctuary but thats not way it works out my title blurb pretty much says it all this fifth film franchise i mention indiana jones because movie has raiders lost ark 1981 vibe more so than other movies reference draculas castle is due fact that entire second half takes place at cool gothic chateau northern california theres scene with genetically enhanced raptor acting like dracula curvy bryce is just stunning throughout easily blows away any other woman series meanwhile pratt seriously upped his game as leading action hero i wasnt overly impressed with him previous film although i didnt dislike him either at end day id have rank this installment as my favorite followed by original 1993 movie 2015s jurassic world film runs 2 hours 8 minutes was shot hawaii england scotland grade b,0.4995510662177329,0.10072951739618406,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.43}"

So this film comes off the island by boat then things take a turn for the worst this is wear the films turns on its head which is fabulous becasue it goes all dark and genuinely scary in parts and you will jump in scenes with the new hybrid I like what the new director done here JA bayona he made a film thats clausterphobic in nature. blue also steals parts of this film to there is a stalking hybrid indoraptor and with Ben lockwoods granchild her she steals the show in this part as she figures out mills plan and there is an auction of dinos of sorts a new army to build so plan and freedom is the ultimate word her so with life finding away to the freedom of the dinos can they co exist this is what the next film theme will be put this one is huge and the fans of the jurrasic film will love this but none fans wont . this is worth the watch and 2hrs long stay for end credits ,but is not great but the young star in this one is for the future instalments.enjoy its a great summer blockbuster.",their world is under extinction level threat by losing their kingdom conspiracy transpires that will disrupt their evolution life can they survive,what can we say about this one its middle film trilogy so theyre holding story theyre bringing gap classic worldwide third instalment so while this is just bringing back dinos world well this one is just flipping terrific with twist this has bond style rex opening see what happened three years last hybrid indominus rex so we have this time new one called indorapter cleaver dino just like ones first jurassic park we have cameo jeff goldblum character doctor malcom so we have build up this one where volcano is awake scientist are working escape plan animals island so owen claire round up team launch rescue mision sorts this part film has every one action hero mode so we have elli mills funding this mission hammonds mansion forest but all is not what it seems here as mission goes south quite litterly so this film has beaten heart at center so this film comes off island by boat then things take turn worst this is wear films turns its head which is fabulous becasue it goes all dark genuinely scary parts you will jump scenes with new hybrid i like what new director done here ja bayona he made film thats clausterphobic nature blue also steals parts this film there is stalking hybrid indoraptor with ben lockwoods granchild her she steals show this part as she figures out mills plan there is auction dinos sorts new army build so plan freedom is ultimate word her so with life finding away freedom dinos can they co exist this is what next film theme will be put this one is huge fans jurrasic film will love this but none fans wont this is worth watch 2hrs long stay end credits but is not great but young star this one is future instalments enjoy its great summer blockbuster,0.43366161616161614,0.052070707070707066,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"

8.0,Jurassic world fallen kingdom,"It's probably too late to mention this, but do NOT watch the trailers. They spoil way, way too much. Many of the movie's best sequences, or at least fragments of them, are shown in the trailers. Several times I found myself thinking while watching the movie, ""I know where this is going because I saw a clip in the trailer.""Now I'll give a quick plot overview of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.After witnessing the carnage, chaos and death that ensued during the theme park's meltdown in the last movie, you may be wondering why any human would ever set foot on the island again. It's a very reasonable thought.In brief, all the dinosaurs on the island are going to become extinct after the island's volcano erupts. Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, right? Just let nature correct the mistake humans made in bringing back the most dangerous predators to ever exist. While we're thinking about the volcano, I'm also curious about why the founders of the park ever chose to build on an island with an active volcano that could wipe out all nearby life. Seems like poor planning. Also poor planning, is endangering human lives with a rescue mission to an island with an erupting volcano.Against all logic, operation: Save the dinos has its supporters. An animal protection group, headed by a less steely and less robotic Clair Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard), convinces a billionaire to fund a mission to rescue the dinosaurs.But, oh no! The team needs help tracking Blue, the last surviving raptor. Cue raptor trainer extraordinaire Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Those two are joined by a paleo-veterinarian (apparently a real thing) and an annoying tech guy who is afraid of absolutely everything, including bugs and planes. As you can imagine, he does not hold up well around dinosaurs.I'm not sure why the scaredy-pants character was ever written into this movie. He's meant to provide comic relief, but isn't that why Chris Pratt is here? Pratt is actually funny, and he's wasted in this movie, relegated to a puppet of a character, who showcases none of the charismatic cool he demonstrated in the prior film.Beyond the obvious character development flaws, there is one unavoidable issue: I don't agree with their mission. How can I root for these heroes if they're doing something indisputably foolish? I love animals, but these particular animals have killed countless humans and will surely kill more. I cannot support risking more human lives for this mission.That's not the movie's only problem. For one, the directing is spotty. A few sequences will wow the viewers, as long as they haven't already seen these clips in the trailers. Director J.A. Bayona has a background in horror that becomes evident in this movie. He creates dingy lighting and makes clever use of shadows as dinosaurs approach their victims. When the dinosaurs fully reveal themselves, Bayona knows to focus the camera on teeth, claws and eyes--the scariest parts of the creatures.Some of the action is legitimately scary. Other times, it's cartoonish. One scene in particular feels like something you would see in Scooby-Doo.The issue with the action, other than being occasionally cartoonish, is how often in leans on callbacks to past Jurassic movies. Sure, the concepts are fun and well-executed, but we have seen them all before.Here we are at the fifth movie in the franchise, and the filmmakers are clearly out of fresh ideas. They're banking on fans flocking to see the movie solely because it has dinosaurs. I demand something more from my movies, and you should too.",jurassic world fallen kingdom,its probably too late mention this but do not watch trailers they spoil way way too much many movies best sequences or at least fragments them are shown trailers several times i found myself thinking while watching movie i know where this is going because i saw clip trailer now ill give quick plot overview jurassic world fallen kingdom after witnessing carnage chaos death that ensued during theme parks meltdown last movie you may be wondering why any human would ever set foot island again its very reasonable thought brief all dinosaurs island are going become extinct after islands volcano erupts nature is clearly trying tell us something right just let nature correct mistake humans made bringing back most dangerous predators ever exist while were thinking about volcano im also curious about why founders park ever chose build island with active volcano that could wipe out all nearby life seems like poor planning also poor planning is endangering human lives with rescue mission island with erupting volcano against all logic operation save dinos has its supporters animal protection group headed by less steely less robotic clair deering bryce dallas howard convinces billionaire fund mission rescue dinosaurs but oh no team needs help tracking blue last surviving raptor cue raptor trainer extraordinaire owen grady chris pratt those two are joined by paleo veterinarian apparently real thing annoying tech guy who is afraid absolutely everything including bugs planes as you can imagine he does not hold up well around dinosaurs im not sure why scaredy pants character was ever written into this movie hes meant provide comic relief but isnt that why chris pratt is here pratt is actually funny hes wasted this movie relegated puppet character who showcases none charismatic cool he demonstrated prior film beyond obvious character development flaws there is one unavoidable issue i dont agree with their mission how can i root these heroes if theyre doing something indisputably foolish i love animals but these particular animals have killed countless humans will surely kill more i cannot support risking more human lives this mission thats not movies only problem one directing is spotty few sequences will wow viewers as long as they havent already seen these clips trailers director j bayona has background horror that becomes evident this movie he creates dingy lighting makes clever use shadows as dinosaurs approach their victims when dinosaurs fully reveal themselves bayona knows focus camera teeth claws eyes scariest parts creatures some action is legitimately scary other times its cartoonish one scene particular feels like something you would see scooby doo issue with action other than being occasionally cartoonish is how often leans callbacks past jurassic movies sure concepts are fun well executed but we have seen them all before here we are at fifth movie franchise filmmakers are clearly out fresh ideas theyre banking fans flocking see movie solely because it has dinosaurs i demand something more my movies you should too,0.46324314574314573,0.039581529581529586,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.48}"
