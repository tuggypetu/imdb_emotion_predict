10.0,Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.10/10",lets see world through eyes forrest gump,ive made about 20 films 5 them are pretty good tom hanks forrest gump is one best movies all time guaranteed i really just love this movie it has such special place my heart performances are just so unforgettable never get out your head characters i mean actors turned into them thats what got me lines are so memorable touching sometimes hilarious we have forrest gump tom hanks not sharpest tool box his i q is right below average scores but his mama sally field believes that her boy has same opportunities as anyone else lets forrest know that theres nothing that could hold him back as boy he is put into braces his legs since he has crooked back really doesnt have too many friends when he gets school bus his first day school no one will let him sit next them this scene is so heart breaking until you hear little angels voice you can sit here if you want jenny forrests best friend crush she looks so incredibly innocent you love her because her forrest are like peas carrots but we find out that there is extremely unfortunate side her life she has father thats always kissing touching her her sisters forrest just assumes that its fathers love since he doesnt have dad that could show him that its wrong forrest jenny together walk every day school when these kids start throwing rocks at forrest calling him stupid jenny just tells forrest run forrest run he miraculously breaks braces off his legs run like wind blows forrest meets many celebrities his life that just happened be there elvis presley visited his house before hitting it big president kennedy honored him with all american football award president johnson who honored him with medal honor his actions vietnam president nixon which forrest happens discover problem water gate hotel because some people seem be flashing lights around john lennon through talk show talk about his medal honor forrest meets some interesting people along way too that are even better than these celebrities combined bubba his vietnam war friend who dreams owning shrimp boat one day was born with big gums he is just so wonderful charming wont stop talking about shrimp luteniet dan leader forrests army vietnam who gets saved by forrest during huge attack looses his legs as result luteniet dan was by far my favorite character he has so much pride wants die vietnam due his family history tradition dying every single american war he forrest make quite pair course theres jenny very tragic figure she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that forrest loves her some ways you cant blame her really she was obviously abused i think she felt that forrest was too good her or that he couldnt really give her love she wanted robin wright what beautiful wonderful actress this movie is incredible should be seen by everyone i am not kidding forrest gump is remarkable movie inspires everyone its not just about someone stupid who happens be great places historic events just because being right place at right time this story is beautiful will inspire everyone go distance see world like forrest did will never give up their dreams 10 10,0.5457875457875458,0.2650824175824175,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"

10.0,A beautiful fable for now and the future,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!",beautiful fable now future,i believe everyone has right their opinion about films or other topics however lot comments i have read about this film i do not think many got gist message author film maker this film is great modern fable fable dictionary is defined as brief fictitious story that teaches moral there are many morals defined this film but foremost is integrity simple goodness i have half brother who grew up southern u s one occasion we were discussing this film he said he felt it portrayed southerners as dimwitted i disagreed with him informed him that author himself was native southerner setting is central this story that it lets tale unfold tying factual events with fable before us film is wonderfully directed by robert zemeckis film is his opus is acted by great cast all levels children who were forrest gump gump jr by haley joel osment say what you want but i feel tom hanks deserved oscar award gary sinise is synonymous with lt dan whenever you hear those words sally fields is loving dutiful mother her challenging situation mykelti williamson as bubba gives you real sense story that gump had genuine friend he moves you with his character words dont grasp full performance robin wright penn as jenny jennys tenderness pain are palpable as exhibited by wright i feel that much gumps appeal is his downright sense doing right thing regardless people situations around him we see that this film that being case maybe we all wish we could be just little more like that trying maintain innate goodness not trade offs we often make as we go down lifes highways movie has it all too drama comedy it challenges societal norms as well then there are almost endless quotes movie that have slipped into everyday speech they are too numerous say at this point one toppers me movie is when forrest is quandary about life wondering as lt dan said we all have destiny his mom says it is where we are all just floating around like feather wind forrests character terms it very well with this quote i think it is little bit both my experiences life it does appear be that way so if you have not seen movie see it soon you are real treat if you did not like it give it try again hopefully you will see it great story it is,0.4916900093370683,0.23600606909430444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Purity and innocence retained,"I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",purity innocence retained,i have seen this movie easily half dozen times i find that beauty film is how forrest gump not only shares his innocence purity with others including audience he also manages retain that innocence purity through some very difficult times as viet nam veteran college graduate late sixties i could course personally relate various periods that forrest gump endures i would only mention that skillful seamless blending music action period costume was enthralling yet it was so perfectly understated that forrest gumps travels through thirty five years stormiest most meaningful years american history only became clearly defined viewer even more so than well known chocolates quote as metaphor life i felt that remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable most us,0.5325,0.09416666666666669,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.69}"

10.0,Contemporary classic: one of my all-time faves,"FORREST GUMP (1994) **** Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson. Brilliantly directed and inspiring comic drama about the truly extraordinary life and times of mentally challenged Forrest Gump (Hanks in the best role of his career won his second Best Actor Oscar in back-to-back winning roles), a simple, honest, and decent man whose childlike innocence is his lucky charm through his altering experiences that span the past two decades flawlessly. Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects by Industrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous. Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when it finally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}- watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love of his life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee) superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also an Academy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle.

9.0,Dropping My Keys,"I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen. I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, ""Hey, Boo,"" the fob goes flying.The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain.

10.0,Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.,"Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, ""The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump."" How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",tom hanks delivers astounding performance as forrest gump,starring tom hanks robin wright gary sinise sally field this was flat out one best movies 1994 it won best picture reason along with few other academy awards i think one tag lines movie was world will never be same once youve seen it through eyes forrest gump how true movie is basically one simple mans journey through life what journey movie opens with forrest hanks sitting at bus stop waiting go see jenny wright after being apart her years who is jenny you ask well get that minute forrest strikes up conversation or two with people that come wait bus with him or more accurately he keeps talking regardless whether anybody is listening or not movie plays out as flashback with forrest taking us through all major events his life narrating them flashback starts when forrest is little boy about six years old or so just at about age where he should be starting school we get take look at forrests childhood as he gets leg braces straighten out his back as his momma field fights does few other things get him into public school as he meets first time love his life jenny he meets her way school sitting next her bus they strike up friendship immediately eventually we progress point where forrest jenny are high school we travel along with forrest as he makes it onto football team gets go college forrest jenny never date but hes always there protect her anytime he thinks shes trouble he rushes rescue ready beat ever loving snot out anyone who even looks at his jenny wrong i think one my favorite scenes movie is when someone is dumb enough slap jenny film goes slow motion forrests eyes go wide he starts charging at this guy like runaway locomotive has striking force one too watching him beat crap out that guy is hilarious as forrest grows up goes through school college army vietnam tour becomes ping pong celebrity shrimp boat captain eventually one richest men out there he also gets take few stops history as filmmaker gives us his own spin how he thinks history would have happened if forrest gump were there he gets meet president three times hes man who exposes watergate scandal hes at school doors when governor george wallace tries get some negroes into white school so so forth its really funny way they manipulate historical footage insert forrest into events past this is truly great movie youd be fool miss it bottom line 4 out 4 own this movie,0.46432900432900426,0.13147727272727272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Beautiful film,"Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox",beautiful film,forrest gump i think is beautiful film never too schmaltzy but there are some genuine tearjerkers like forrest at jennys grave cinematography is stunning costumes are lovely scenery is gorgeous music is also very calm relaxing perhaps adding tone this film screenplay is well crafted story is simple but what made this movie was its simplicity it never tries be too complex is consequently moving acting is just as impressive whilst tom hankss accent is little awkward places my only real criticism this movie he gives truly remarkable performance though i do think morgan freeman deserved oscar more shawshank robin wright gives possibly best performance her career sally field is very dignified as forrests mother scene stealer though is gary sinise as lieutenant dan very moving insightful performance overall extremely good movie i will admit i wasnt sure whether i would like it but simple answer is this i do 9 10 bethany cox,0.6031269841269843,0.3281,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Pure Charm,"Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous.

10.0,Quite possibly the best movie ever made.,"I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing. Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most ""action,"" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more.

Maybe sometime in the near future there will be a disclaimer and someone giving this context. But until then, you have to be educated enough yourself to understand and comprehend certain things. And you have to have a certain sense of humor to dig all the coincidences that Gump comes across at. It's alike a marathon through many landmarks of the short US history we have behind us.

10.0,The Hand Of An Unseen Providence,"When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different. The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clichés.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it.""",hand unseen providence,when tom hanks won his first oscar philadelphia 1993 film received total five nominations his second oscar forrest gump came film that received more than double that nominations awards if forrest gump did nothing else it solidified hankss credentials as serious actor he would never be doing imitations his bosom buddies character films again it also among other awards also won best picture best director robert zemeckis richly deserved film is huckleberry finn like its canny observations coming man who had iq we are told 75 but as forrest also tells us stupid is as stupid does forrest with hand unseen providence comes out lot better than some clever people he meets life watching film once again it occurred me that mark twain if he couldnt have written this himself would have loved way zemeckis handled character forrest gump beauty huckleberry finn secret its success is that twain got into mind child who recorded all events around him child without too much education what zemeckis did was get hanks into child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped any veneer pretense which hanks observes people around him events that shape america himself eisenhower reagan there are two prominent female parts forrest gump one is robin wright who plays abused child julie as adult she is forrests love best friend she takes different path life one she chose with more deliberation than hanks their fates though eventually entwined are radically different second major female role is another two time oscar winner sally field who now is playing matronly parts far cry gidget flying nun she gives forrest maxims he lives by crisis they turn out be more than sound bite clich s another award that forrest gump won is special effects award it didnt win was gary sinise role lieutenant dan taylor forrests commanding officer vietnam thats something that does not compute because special effects were show gary sinise as double amputee with both legs lost vietnam its some amazing bit work no doubt about it but honor it without sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous sinise is educated one who curses fate that happened him but end by just going with flow he does prosper end sinise lost that year best supporting actor category martin landau ed wood but i think sinises performance has had more lasting impact those americans who serve our country it certainly has gary sinise has devoted great deal his life earned treasure bring entertainment our overseas troops iraq afghanistan wherever becoming successor bob hope that regard hes gone further than that though setting up foundations help civilians both countries contributing numerous charities dealing with war its aftermath doing that my humble opinion gary sinise has become one great americans our brand new millenia lot more than just actor hes forever now known as lieutenant dan end though film belongs tom hanks who joined with spencer tracy as only two male actors win back back oscars best actor hanks fascinates us guides us through this film when were done weve seen something very special if you dont believe me about how good forrest gump is then watch it few minutes see if youre not sucked like forrests mama says films like life which is like box chocolates you never know what youll get until you open it,0.4802119837834124,0.2538368377654092,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,why such a low rating???,"What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that ""if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death."" I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world.

10.0,The zen of Forrest Gump.,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.",zen forrest gump,this is powerful yet charming movie fun its special effects profound how it keeps you thinking long after its over like others ive seen this movie more than once one comment ive never heard is that forrests simplicity is almost zen like i should read novel get authors intention i remember some people preferring book complaining that no one at academy awards gave him any credit but rather than implication that you should do what youre supposed do believe god youll win end i see it as zen like i e living moment not having expectations or particular cravings other than his loving jenny so he ends up just stumbling into all major historical events time granted he achieves this only because he doesnt have brains think otherwise actually have expectations but so many our problems are because we do have higher intellect desires which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing we love our cats dogs same simplicity always being moment theres line movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or its combination both it is something mull over long time,0.5175983436853002,0.15628881987577642,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...,"... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or ""destiny"" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made. Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us ""You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!"" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it.",role innocence positive thinking thus success,seems be theme this film forrest gump has iq 70 is being raised by single mom lives remote part deep south where there are few opportunities has legs that require that he wear braces as child sounds like recipe sad tale or at least slow death mediocrity right no instead because forrest isnt really bright enough realize situation he is he simply does what hes told do or what occurs him be right thing at time succeeds due lack self doubt hes told run he becomes star crimson tide all american when recovering war wound hes taught ping pong winds up competing at global level china itself he promises his dying friend bubba that hell go ahead with their plans become shrimp boat captain his brand seafood products becomes household name all along way he never learns lessons life that tend make rest us cynical gumps childhood sweetheart jenny starts out with high aspirations she wants be like joan baez fight world peace instead she winds up disillusioned drug addicted near suicide before age 30 she doesnt have forrests childlike innocence this leads her self doubt ultimately failure also fate or destiny as film calls it is not her side one big way her own father molested her as child which couldnt help but play role decisions she made now gump does have bunch coincidences his side call it destiny if you will storm that beaches every shrimping vessel gulf mexico but his example but most cases this is just story man going through life without self doubt that little voice that tells rest us you cant do that what are odds youll fail make safe choice me this is what this film is about i think everyone sees something different it i highly recommend it as it is truly one kind i remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film probably because they didnt understand it,0.45377136021872866,0.04784489633173844,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.44}"

9.0,Life is like a box of chocolates. You never truly know what you're gonna get. Forrest Gump is amazing!,"Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet.",life is like box chocolates you never truly know what youre gonna get forrest gump is amazing,based 1986 novel by winston groom same name forrest gump is about simple man named forrest tom hanks whom with low i q who goes through life accidentally being present at many historic moments while building success himself however never getting with his true love jenny curran robin wright which mostly seems be only thing that is eluding him without spoiling movie too much this feel good financial blockbuster was indeed one my favorite movies 1990s i still quote act out rewatch this movie even with downer tragic ending this film has i just cant help loving it despite film changing lot source material like gumps core personality size i kinda like that hes not autistic savant my opinion it would be too jarring it would be really too odd unrealistic see him play chess while being astronaut while people still thinking that hes idiot i kinda like that film primarily focuses first eleven chapters novel before skipping ahead end book middle part book is truly outrageous with gump fighting off cannibals becoming pro wrestler that was way too out there be taken seriously careers he got film seems more grounded with reality his character story addition skipping some parts novel film adds several aspects gumps life that do not occur novel such as his needing leg braces as child his run across united states those changes really did help film lot this movie was also well shot by robert zemeckis it made great use its locations i also love use cgi techniques make it look like tom hanks was some archive footage with various historical figures most visual effects this film were pretty impressing at time yet i just wish voice dubbing was little better it doesnt really match well with movement long dead historical figures lips while movie does have lot profanity sex nudity drug use violence pg 13 i think it somewhat works with rebellions style 1960s i also dig film soundtrack great use many well known artists 1950s 1960s its really does fit with that era time also original music that alan silvestri made film was also beautiful it fits some well film not only did that work but acting was outstanding tom hanks was amazing as title character other hands this dim witted guileless southern drawling simpleton hero could had turn into bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype instead hanks makes fictional character gump seem like real person with real motives feelings he really did deserve oscar despite what some critics make say about his performance even supporting cast was well done i love all characters ranging bubba blue mykelti williamson mrs gump sally fields i even kinda like jenny even when writers made her somewhat horrible selfish trouble person who leaves gump with kid that grew up be haley joan osment one his first movie roles then who can ever forget lt dan taylor this was gary sinise finest role character development that they gave him was heart breaking yet hopeful i love his redemption story film has this ignorance is bliss philosophy it that makes movie fun watch satire contemporary values during americas mid 20th century accomplishments is truly funny historic zelig style jokes are mostly hit than miss funny i also like how ambiguous forrests story as some people believe that he might be unreliable narrator who whitewashing american history yet i dont think its as racist or sexist as some people think it is film is lot more positive than that forrest is represented what is innocence good about world he has this out right decency about himself he helps his friends if theyre need even if some them take advanced his hospitality forrest gump is also surprisingly spiritual story well told lot people has stated out relationship between forrest jenny echoes relationship hosea gomer old testament which return is about relationship between god man hints white feather that floats through forrests life movie is about question whether we are masters our own fate or path predetermined destiny another thing interesting is how some people has been noted see some political interpretations which i kinda have disagree with while it seem like gump follows very conservative lifestyle jennys life is full counter cultural embrace complete with drug usage promiscuity antiwar

,Tom Hanks' best performance,"This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero. Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful.",tom hanks best performance,this awesome movie is about innocent man who represents how world should be hes loyal humble honest he would never cheat or lie he does everything with good heart reaches success at most important tasks life only america he could live such interesting life meet elvis presley president kennedy john lennon he goes vietnams war he does everything following his heart he becomes american hero gary sinise is great american actor his best performance too he served vietnam with forrest was also hero protecting his men fighting his country all all this is must see movie everyone specially non americans so we can enjoy american culture icons as well as learn some american history which is very useful,0.45644841269841274,0.36320165945165944,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,An Amazing Movie,"I saw this movie in the theaters back in 1994. When it was released on VHS I obtained that version. I've watched the movie about once every two years since then. This is an amazing movie in any number of ways. One big way it amazes me, is the way which it, as a simple and guileless little story, like a feather wafting in the breeze, nevertheless evokes raw rank hatred and eyeball-bulging, forehead vein-popping, spittle-spewing vitriol from liberals and so-called ""intellectuals"" who are absolutely certain that, like a guided missile, it is seeking them out, intentionally, personally, to insult them with rightwing thoughts and ideas, and by a nitwit character no less. Hahahaha. As if.So let's first thing pop that little pea right out of the shooter. Let's dispense with the bilge of this movie being some kind of sub rosa rightwing plot. Puh-leeeze. This is a mainstream Hollywood production. Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, and Robin Wright Penn are all known Hollywood lefties, liberal devotees who would take the pipe long before allowing themselves to be associated with or be used by anything akin a rightwing movie, let alone be openly and voluntarily involved in making one. Bottom line, this is not a political movie. This is not a movie which is making any kind of political or social statements in any respect. People who think it is doing any of that are just working way too hard over-thinking it all. Period. It's odd because it's really not all that complicated of a thing to understand. Which leads directly to another amazing thing about this movie: it is amazing the way the simple little message the movie is actually sending just sails right over so many people's heads. Amazingly they just don't get it, and based on the comments here they still aren't getting it 14 years later and counting. So if you fall into that category let me help you out.What is the message of Forrest Gump? Stripped to its purest essence, this movie is about loyalty and devotion, particularly to the ones in our lives we love and care about. These are the human values being reinforced. Loyalty. Devotion. Forrest Gump embodies loyalty and devotion. To his mama. To his good best buddy Bubba. To the love of his life, Jenny. To his leader, Lt. Dan. And in the end to Forrest Jr. One by one and all together Forrest sticks by and takes care of his family, friends, and loved ones. This is the thread running through the entire story. This is what carries Forrest to all of the remarkable places he goes along the way.The use of a mentally challenged man as the leading man is a conceit, used to illustrate the point that loyalty and devotion are the most important things in life, trumping everything else. It drives home the point that nothing else really matters anywhere near as much. Indeed, it drives it home with blunt force. Maybe it drives it home too hard for such a simple little point. Maybe this is where the movie's detractors get themselves side-tracked. There are a number of other amazing and remarkable things about this movie. The performances. The special effects. The almost poetic simplicity of the story and the way it is told. See it for all this and more, but please, don't over-think it.",amazing movie,i saw this movie theaters back 1994 when it was released vhs i obtained that version ive watched movie about once every two years since then this is amazing movie any number ways one big way it amazes me is way which it as simple guileless little story like feather wafting breeze nevertheless evokes raw rank hatred eyeball bulging forehead vein popping spittle spewing vitriol liberals so called intellectuals who are absolutely certain that like guided missile it is seeking them out intentionally personally insult them with rightwing thoughts ideas by nitwit character no less hahahaha as if so lets first thing pop that little pea right out shooter lets dispense with bilge this movie being some kind sub rosa rightwing plot puh leeeze this is mainstream hollywood production robert zemeckis tom hanks sally field robin wright penn are all known hollywood lefties liberal devotees who would take pipe long before allowing themselves be associated with or be used by anything akin rightwing movie let alone be openly voluntarily involved making one bottom line this is not political movie this is not movie which is making any kind political or social statements any respect people who think it is doing any that are just working way too hard over thinking it all period its odd because its really not all that complicated thing understand which leads directly another amazing thing about this movie it is amazing way simple little message movie is actually sending just sails right over so many peoples heads amazingly they just dont get it based comments here they still arent getting it 14 years later counting so if you fall into that category let me help you out what is message forrest gump stripped its purest essence this movie is about loyalty devotion particularly ones our lives we love care about these are human values being reinforced loyalty devotion forrest gump embodies loyalty devotion his mama his good best buddy bubba love his life jenny his leader lt dan end forrest jr one by one all together forrest sticks by takes care his family friends loved ones this is thread running through entire story this is what carries forrest all remarkable places he goes along way use mentally challenged man as leading man is conceit used illustrate point that loyalty devotion are most important things life trumping everything else it drives home point that nothing else really matters anywhere near as much indeed it drives it home with blunt force maybe it drives it home too hard such simple little point maybe this is where movies detractors get themselves side tracked there are number other amazing remarkable things about this movie performances special effects almost poetic simplicity story way it is told see it all this more but please dont over think it,0.49066534558337843,0.18107247943313518,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,"""I just felt like running"".","For anyone who grew up in the turbulent Sixties, ""Forrest Gump"" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. While Tom Hanks' character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. Some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns Gump's tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before Forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of Fortune Magazine. Life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind.I got a kick out of Forrest's string of brushes with greatness - the way he taught Elvis how to shake his hips, his unquestioning response to LBJ's inquiry about his war injury, and the way his war time experience inspired John Lennon to write 'Imagine'. There was also that ingenious sequence in which he meets President Nixon, then inadvertently tips off the Watergate scandal. However the most understated and easiest reference to miss was the clever homage paid to the 1969 film ""Midnight Cowboy"", when Forrest wheels Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise) across busy city traffic, and is narrowly missed by a taxi cab. Lt. Dan's response was ""Hey, I'm walkin' here"", just the way Ratso Rizzo did in that earlier film. All that with the 'Everybody Talking at Me' movie theme seamlessly woven in as so many songs of that era were utilized with other aspects of the story.For Forrest Gump, life is not a pretentious path to wealth or fame, but a never ending quest to learn and be a productive human being. Not to mention finding one's own true love. For Forrest, life long friend Jenny (Robin Wright) represents an unfulfilled ideal, one he accepts into his heart while still a young schoolboy and nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood. For her part, Jenny represents a youthful quest for experiencing life to the fullest, only to make a series of wrong choices that lead her to the brink of suicide. It's fitting that Jenny eventually realizes what Forrest knew all along, that they were made for each other even if outward appearances seemed to dictate otherwise.I've seen this film only a couple times in the past, thinking it was good, but only considering it for it's entertainment value. I guess one of the benefits of getting older is the insight one gains with experiencing life a day at a time and steady as she goes. My viewing of the picture today gave me a greater appreciation for the subtleties offered in the film, and leads me to believe the world would be a better place if there were a little more of Forrest Gump in all of us.",i just felt like running,anyone who grew up turbulent sixties forrest gump delivers clever blend nostalgia mixed with uniquely creative view history as experienced by presumed be simpleton while tom hanks character recalls his life with slow tangy drawl he variously entertains educates host passengers waiting next bus their intended destination some ignore him some show interest one even scorns gumps tale getting rich shrimping business only depart before forrest has chance pull out his copy fortune magazine life can be like that those unwilling listen learn casting doubt instead exploring truth keeping open mind i got kick out forrests string brushes with greatness way he taught elvis how shake his hips his unquestioning response lbjs inquiry about his war injury way his war time experience inspired john lennon write imagine there was also that ingenious sequence which he meets president nixon then inadvertently tips off watergate scandal however most understated easiest reference miss was clever homage paid 1969 film midnight cowboy when forrest wheels lieutenant dan gary sinise across busy city traffic is narrowly missed by taxi cab lt dans response was hey im walkin here just way ratso rizzo did that earlier film all that with everybody talking at me movie theme seamlessly woven as so many songs that era were utilized with other aspects story forrest gump life is not pretentious path wealth or fame but never ending quest learn be productive human being not mention finding ones own true love forrest life long friend jenny robin wright represents unfulfilled ideal one he accepts into his heart while still young schoolboy nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood her part jenny represents youthful quest experiencing life fullest only make series wrong choices that lead her brink suicide its fitting that jenny eventually realizes what forrest knew all along that they were made each other even if outward appearances seemed dictate otherwise ive seen this film only couple times past thinking it was good but only considering it its entertainment value i guess one benefits getting older is insight one gains with experiencing life day at time steady as she goes my viewing picture today gave me greater appreciation subtleties offered film leads me believe world would be better place if there were little more forrest gump all us,0.5841463414634146,0.18546747967479676,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.46}"
