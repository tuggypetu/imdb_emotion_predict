10.0,Don't Forgo Fargo,"Boy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. ""You're darn tootin',"" they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time. In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, ""Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW."" It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. ""Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he?"" Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it ""ought to be really cold tomorrow."" Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a niveous white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, ""Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are."" (A perfect day!) There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands.""Fargo"" is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD. It's an original and refreshingly adult picture.

10.0,The Best Effort From A Number Of People,"I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.About the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure ""black comedy."" It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.Both William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three ""are a trip."" Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, ""Marge Gunderson,"" elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband ""Norm"" (John Lynch).You have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in ""Carl Showalter"" (Buscemi) and ""Gaear Grimsrud"" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances ""Mike Yanagita"" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.So, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi.",best effort number people,i didnt see this theater but saw it first week it was out rental have enjoyed it ever since fact i probably enjoy this more each time i view it its sick movie though make no mistake about that however it holds strange fascination probably because odd characters about story first it is not true story as indicated movie thats lie its fictional kidnapping turned into murder story with few bloody scenes lots profanity most it by steve buscemi comedy yup this is pure black comedy its dark humor mixed with parody about way scandanavian people upper midwest supposedly speak both william h macy frances mcdormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents those two buscemi are lead characters all three are trip macy is hilarious best character here my opinion more i watch this film funnier he gets its also best role i assume ever mcdormand who was never star before or since this movie her character here marge gunderson elevates this movie just another modern day sick crime movie original its nice see wonderful husband wife relationship too as is shown here with her husband norm john lynch you have this clean old fashioned lady cop mcdormand middle road bungling car salesman macy two extreme low life killers carl showalter buscemi gaear grimsrud peter stormare all combining make this story mixture not only people but genres other minor characters are strange too led by one marges old high school acquaintances mike yanagita steve park add that some equally bizarre music slow violins you have this unusual story that brings out morbid fascination us viewers so i guess what i am saying is this movie truly is original best film coen brothers have ever made maybe rest roles ever three main actors mcdormand macy buscemi,0.48856636271529885,0.1887386018237082,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,One of Those Rare Gems in the Cinema,"With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as ""Fargo"". It's one of those films that you just have to see. William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day. I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film. ""Fargo"" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved. In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies. 5 stars out of 5.",one those rare gems cinema,with all sorry films these days it is good see movie as funny wicked dramatic utterly demented as fargo its one those films that you just have see william h macy gives oscar nominated performance as car salesman who hires two thugs one know it all know nothing other demented psychopath kidnap his wife so that he can keep half ransom her well off father needless say nothing goes right brainerd sheriff frances mcdormand oscar winning role comes save day i wont give anything away because material is too good tell those who havent seen this inventive film fargo was ranked 100 greatest films list 1996 it was well deserved this age by numbers film making this film was refreshing flashback risk taking style that made 1970s such great decade movies 5 stars out 5,0.7516106442577031,0.22415966386554623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.21, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.25}"
7.0,Cold-hearted,"The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it.",cold hearted,coen brothers fargo is nearly great film beautifully shot blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention genre this is film where remote mid western city minneapolis plays same role as new york normal crime story hub civilisation vice where hero is woman heavily pregnant happily married woman at that chief villain car salesman absolutely no slickness whatsoever final irony most action doesnt even take place fargo but even more obscure town brainerd yet i found it hard love this film at brief moments depicting relationship policewoman marge played superbly by frances mcdormaid her husband it feels astonishingly tender yet at others it feels as if it is simply making fun strange folks outer america with wacky accents absurdly stoical demeanour combination deadpan acting frankly silly plot excess sometimes works sometimes doesnt above all else perhaps fargo lacks beating heart while nearly moving nearly funny theres part this film that refuses commit itself that prefers hold back mock not just its subjects but also idea that film should take itself seriously coens are widely celebrated as among best film makers our age but watching their films i usually end up wondering whether irony is not slightly over rated virtue fargo looks lovely weird has wry outlook all its own but it wont make you laugh out loud or cry if it wasnt called masterpiece i might almost like it,0.5322967772967774,0.13728956228956224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Thank's a bunch for this one,"Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie.

10.0,My favourite Coen brothers movie,"The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority – if not all – of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.Things begin small and gradually build up to a blood-spattered climax, propelled by tons of originality and irregularity which propels this past most similar genre fare. Frances McDormand deservedly got an Oscar for her excellent performance as the pregnant cop, but William H. Macy is equally good as the nervous car salesman whose life spirals out of control. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are also brilliant as the two psychotic criminals who begin by kidnapping and end in  well I'll leave it for you to find out.

,You're darned tootin'!,"""What'd this guy look like anyway?"" ""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'."" ""Uh-huh. In what way?"" ""Just a general way."" In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan Coen's finest film. Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski. But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation with Gaear and the wood-chipper. Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced, intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H. Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing the interview!"" Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior, and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife. If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a half this movie has to show you.",youre darned tootin,whatd this guy look like anyway oh he was little guy kinda funny lookin uh huh what way just general way that interplay between brainerd mn police officer witness discussing criminal investigation you have one your principal pieces dialogue what is considered by many be joel ethan coens finest film course you can draw comparisons others theyve made such as blood simple raising arizona even barton fink big lebowski but fargo illustrates coen brothers takes plot art drama more succinctly emotionally than any those others here you have set memorable if not always likable characters plot that goes clunky chaotic most unspoiled manner jerry lundegaards stilted conversation with gaear carl bar fargo at beginning movie only occasion which movie specifically shows you fargo n d marge gundersons confrontation with gaear wood chipper frances mcdormand deservedly won oscar playing well balanced intelligent pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward methodology investigation bizarre goings william h macy gives true one two punch playing frenetically charged fearful end inept used car salesman trying most remarkable manner make money two best scenes movie are two occasions which marge questions jerry about brainerd murders car his lot being involved i couldnt imagine actress doing better job seriously but comically exclaiming hes fleeing interview notable among actors as well are steve buscemi peter stormare playing carl gaear two hit men hired by jerry help him con his father law out money theres comic brilliance watching stormare silently grimace at buscemis violent but gregarious behavior buscemi shines being able play most out control all characters movie kristin rudr d also stands out playing jean lundegaard jerrys haplessly kidnapped wife if you can appreciate intelligent look at not always so intelligent life this planet youll enjoy little more than hour half this movie has show you,0.6147619047619048,0.23958333333333343,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,Paul Bunyan territory,"Joel Coen the director of ""Fargo"", proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. ""Fargo"" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.The supporting cast of ""Fargo"" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.""Fargo"" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen.",paul bunyan territory,joel coen director fargo proves he is one our best directors with this tale deception murder told style that takes humorous turns action fargo is one best american films nineties joel coen working together with his brother ethan have made pictures that will be viewed as classics as time will tell their movies are always excellent way spend some time because they always manage deliver even films that arent popular with public lot what makes this film work is amazing casting feat coen brothers achieved giving frances mcdormand william h macy two our best film actors prominent presence it marge gunderson ms mcdormand is one best creations coen brothers have produced same can be said william h macys take pathetic jerry lundergaard idiotic man who sets things motion film ms mcdormand mr macy have only one scene together yet one wouldnt even think about other actors playing these roles supporting cast fargo is joy watch steve buscemi peter stormare make two most enjoyable bad guys memory these two scum bags are joke anyone his right mind wouldnt entrust either carl or gaer hit job john carroll lynch plays norm stoic man who is married marge harve presnell is good as wade gustafson atmosphere created by coens work well we are constantly reminded deep winter seasons area where action takes place they have given their characters local flavor even hear them talk would take us that region country fargo is joy watch thanks joel ethan coen,0.4465367965367965,0.2786075036075036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,I'd score this a 10/10 and is an American film masterpiece.,"Fargo (1996) is a movie I recently watched again on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a group of kidnappers executing a paid job for a scammer of sorts. As some eccentrically behaved local detectives start investigating a recent murder conducted by the previously referenced kidnappers, the entire kidnapping may get blown up. This move is directed by the amazing Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars William H. Macy (Shameless), Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs), Kristin Rudrüd (Drop Dead Gorgeous), Frances McDormand (Nomadland) and John Carroll Lynch (Zodiac). The storyline for this is so interesting and contains intricate characters, sub plots and primary plot. There's so much depth in every aspect of this movie you get fascinated by every facet, and both the good and bad guys. Loved how the entire story unfolds and every aspect of this movie is satisfying.

8.0,I'm glad I gave this one a second chance.,"I saw and reviewed ""Fargo"" long ago and I decided to re-watch it tonight....and I am glad that I did. The first time I saw it, I gave it a very poor review....and this time I appreciated it much more. I think the reason, though, isn't all my fault. I think it is because the film had SO much hype....so many people saying it was brilliant that the film simply could NOT live up to all the hype. In other words, while a very good film, it certainly was hyped a LOT when it debuted and garnered a lot of attention during the Oscars. I think it also didn't help that they called it a comedy...which it really isn't.The story, despite what it says at the prologue, is NOT a true story. It's the story of a greedy idiot and some dangerous idiots who go to work for him arranging for a kidnapping of the man's wife. I'd say more....but at this point there are over 1000 reviews on IMDB.I recommend you see it. Just adjust your expectations and DON'T think it's a comedy. Yes, a few parts are darkly funny but the Coen Brothers do not appear to have been making a comedy here. I'd put it in the same sort of category as their gritty films like ""Blood Simple"". The acting is excellent, particularly Francis McDormand who won the Oscar for her performance. She played a most unusual character....one who was not funny at all...just a competent sheriff who manages to unravel a weird and most unusual...and bloody case.Overall, I strongly recommend the film...it's well done, though a few other Coen Brothers films manage to be even better.",im glad i gave this one second chance,i saw reviewed fargo long ago i decided re watch it tonight i am glad that i did first time i saw it i gave it very poor review this time i appreciated it much more i think reason though isnt all my fault i think it is because film had so much hype so many people saying it was brilliant that film simply could not live up all hype other words while very good film it certainly was hyped lot when it debuted garnered lot attention during oscars i think it also didnt help that they called it comedy which it really isnt story despite what it says at prologue is not true story its story greedy idiot some dangerous idiots who go work him arranging kidnapping mans wife id say more but at this point there are over 1000 reviews imdb i recommend you see it just adjust your expectations dont think its comedy yes few parts are darkly funny but coen brothers do not appear have been making comedy here id put it same sort category as their gritty films like blood simple acting is excellent particularly francis mcdormand who won oscar her performance she played most unusual character one who was not funny at all just competent sheriff who manages unravel weird most unusual bloody case overall i strongly recommend film its well done though few other coen brothers films manage be even better,0.56249723145072,0.10549078828148595,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,You have no call to get snippy with me.,"I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since. What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses.

8.0,Screwball crime film,"I hesitate to call this a comedy film. I found parts of it funny but more in the way that Wes Anderson films are dainty rather than laugh-out-loud funny. The storyline features a clueless and bumbling car salesman attempting a hare-brained scheme with equally incompetent criminals, all juxtaposed a disarmingly mundane and friendly Midwest setting. The stand-out feature of this film is the acting, as the characters are all perfect depictions of those who simply cannot get anything right! I see more inspiration from old screwball films than traditional crime dramas.

2.0,What Did I Miss Here?!,"Okay, so I've heard of the litany of accolades this movie has received. I've heard how this film is a ""black comedy"" by the Coen Brothers, who supposedly are geniuses in the film industry. And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is. But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie. What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic. And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor.Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs. Well, all goes to hell as the kidnappers end up on a killing spree with a cop questioning all possible leads, including the car salesman himself.If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims. The Coen brothers make a strange mockery out of the deaths of the victims portrayed and deter the audience from taking the film seriously, instead giving them a quasi-mental hypothermia with the serious/humorous dichotomy. And even if this film is not based on a true story, it is so poorly directed that I just felt like I had wasted my time going around in circles. But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash. Sigh.

10.0,A delightful deconstruction of film noir,The Coen brothers' early films are all variants-usually comedic-on film noir. This is the most successful of their early efforts. In some ways it is a rather blunt in how it turns the style inside out. I.e.

The film is highly enjoyable because of this quality.

,An almost perfect film in its genre.,"I had watched ""Fargo"" several years ago, and just last night re-watched it on DVD. I intended to see half of it, go to bed at my normal time, and see the last half this morning. But it isn't that kind of movie. It draws you in, the dialog and editing are so good, you want to keep watching. And so I did. It deserves its high rating.some SPOILERS follow, don't read further if you haven't seen ""Fargo"" yet. Bill Macy is perfect, absolutely, as ""Jerry"" the car sales manager who can't quite get his life in order. You see, Jerry basically cares only about himself. He has some unspecified debt, his father in law (Harve Presnell) is rich but has a very low, deservedly, opinion of Jerry. So Jerry does the only thing he can figure, through a paroled American Native car mechanic that works in his dealership gets hooked up with two thugs (Buscemi and Stormare) who will kidnap Jerry's wife, hold her safe, until Jerry convinces pop-in-law to pay a ransom, which he uses to pay off the thugs and erase his own debt. Ever the schemer, Jerry tells the thugs he will split $80,000 with them, but really plans to extort $1Million and just give them $40,000. In an early scene to establish character, we see Jerry scamming a customer by charging him for a ""topcoat"" treatment that he said a day earlier he would throw in free. Jerry was simply a very flawed person.Things go terribly wrong, thugs get stopped at night in the snow, Stormare shoots the cop, plus two passers by who are tracked down after witnessing the crime scene. Margie (Frances McDormand, oscar winner) is the town sheriff and gets on the trail. She calmly travels to the Twin Cities, interviews people, pieces together clues, finds the hideout near the lake, comes upon Stormare grinding up Buscemi's body, the dead hostage in the cabin. In the interim the father in law gets gunned down, as well as a parking lot attendant. This film is best classified as a very dark comedy. Margie and her fisherman husband are two of the very few normal people in this film, The others - Jerry, his family, the mechanic, the thugs, the prostitutes - are all way off center, and some of the situations and dialog are very funny, within the context of a film where a number of murders are committed. The funniest scene is during the shooting of Presnell, who wounds Buscemi on the right cheek, and he spends the rest of the film with rather large strips of paper stuck to his face to stop the bleeding, his hands and coat collar red and blood-soaked. I mean, there's really nothing funny about murder, but the Buscemi character is very funny.",almost perfect film its genre,i had watched fargo several years ago just last night re watched it dvd i intended see half it go bed at my normal time see last half this morning but it isnt that kind movie it draws you dialog editing are so good you want keep watching so i did it deserves its high rating some spoilers follow dont read further if you havent seen fargo yet bill macy is perfect absolutely as jerry car sales manager who cant quite get his life order you see jerry basically cares only about himself he has some unspecified debt his father law harve presnell is rich but has very low deservedly opinion jerry so jerry does only thing he can figure through paroled american native car mechanic that works his dealership gets hooked up with two thugs buscemi stormare who will kidnap jerrys wife hold her safe until jerry convinces pop law pay ransom which he uses pay off thugs erase his own debt ever schemer jerry tells thugs he will split 80 000 with them but really plans extort 1million just give them 40 000 early scene establish character we see jerry scamming customer by charging him topcoat treatment that he said day earlier he would throw free jerry was simply very flawed person things go terribly wrong thugs get stopped at night snow stormare shoots cop plus two passers by who are tracked down after witnessing crime scene margie frances mcdormand oscar winner is town sheriff gets trail she calmly travels twin cities interviews people pieces together clues finds hideout near lake comes upon stormare grinding up buscemis body dead hostage cabin interim father law gets gunned down as well as parking lot attendant this film is best classified as very dark comedy margie her fisherman husband are two very few normal people this film others jerry his family mechanic thugs prostitutes are all way off center some situations dialog are very funny within context film where number murders are committed funniest scene is during shooting presnell who wounds buscemi right cheek he spends rest film with rather large strips paper stuck his face stop bleeding his hands coat collar red blood soaked i mean theres really nothing funny about murder but buscemi character is very funny,0.5250273368606702,0.14384567901234566,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,"Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies, said Roger Ebert.","""Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies"", said Roger Ebert. The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made. All of Coens' fans have their own favorite film but it is hard to disagree that with Fargo, Coens sealed the place in Cinema Hall of Fame. Fargo is a movie of many dimensions. As many of Coens' films, it centers on a botched crime that includes kidnapping gone terribly wrong. Many viewers see it as a dark comical crime/mystery thriller which it is but it is much more. It rises to the high tragedy, and it is one of the most beautiful gentle love stories committed to screen which is very unusual for Coens. What I especially love in Fargo - the perfect balance between the scenes of building suspense, graphic violence, humor, and the real drama from the lives of the real people.The visual palette of the film with color white dominating the screen is stunning, and the snow that covers American Midwest for what seems the eternal winter, is as important character for the film as the rest of them. The sorrowful music score deserves a special mention for creating the mood. It has been told a lot about dream cast that Coens gathered for the film. Of all stars, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy got the most recognition, and very deservingly so. Macy is amazing and a spot- on, and in the final scene of the film, genuinely heartbreaking. It is impossible to imagine anybody else in the role of Jerry Lundegaard, the desperate man who came up with the perfect scheme to become rich without hurting anyone and whose good intentions paved the road directly to hell of Shakespearean proportions. Macy was determined from the beginning that it was HIS role in spite Coens' doubts even after the second reading. He did not hesitate to beg them, and the result proved absolutely terrific. Any way we look at Fargo, it is a great work of Cinema that would make it difficult for its creators to overpass its perfection. As a true masterpiece, it only gets better as time passes and it turns with new facets with every new viewing.",films like fargo are why i love movies said roger ebert,films like fargo are why i love movies said roger ebert film makers joel ethan coen writing directing team also known as two headed director are reason why i believe modern movie making take story like one fargo is based which has been told so many times before i am sure will be told over over again turn twist it most anticipated ways create characters so alive three dimensional that you believe every word they say every step they take provide them with some best quotes dialogs ive ever had pleasure hear mix dry humor humanity make film recognizable but uniquely beautiful dark dramatic funny thats what coens achieved fargo which has been supposedly best film they ever made all coens fans have their own favorite film but it is hard disagree that with fargo coens sealed place cinema hall fame fargo is movie many dimensions as many coens films it centers botched crime that includes kidnapping gone terribly wrong many viewers see it as dark comical crime mystery thriller which it is but it is much more it rises high tragedy it is one most beautiful gentle love stories committed screen which is very unusual coens what i especially love fargo perfect balance between scenes building suspense graphic violence humor real drama lives real people visual palette film with color white dominating screen is stunning snow that covers american midwest what seems eternal winter is as important character film as rest them sorrowful music score deserves special mention creating mood it has been told lot about dream cast that coens gathered film all stars frances mcdormand william h macy got most recognition very deservingly so macy is amazing spot final scene film genuinely heartbreaking it is impossible imagine anybody else role jerry lundegaard desperate man who came up with perfect scheme become rich without hurting anyone whose good intentions paved road directly hell shakespearean proportions macy was determined beginning that it was his role spite coens doubts even after second reading he did not hesitate beg them result proved absolutely terrific any way we look at fargo it is great work cinema that would make it difficult its creators overpass its perfection as true masterpiece it only gets better as time passes it turns with new facets with every new viewing,0.6379205650979844,0.3047828515570451,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,Reflections on a second viewing,"This should stand as the Coen brothers' tour de force, although I found ""The Big Lebowski"" to be an even more satisfying film. I look at ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""Brother, Where Art Thou?"" as being the Coen's three best movies. I hope there is more from them in the future that can rival these three; though recent offerings such as ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", could be proving their peak creativity is behind them. ""Fargo"" is beyond a doubt, their masterpiece. IMDb's ratings bear this out - 8.2 for ""Fargo"", 8.0 for ""Lebowski"", and 7.8 for ""Brother"". For sheer entertainment, ""Lebowski"" or should I call it, ""The Dude"" wins handsdown, but ""Fargo"" has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence. Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in it's grotesque way. This movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should never be denied. Steve Buscemi's bullet-grazed face becomes almost as painful for the watcher as it is for his character; Steve Buscemi's leg in the wood chipper is as horrific a scene as you are ever going to see. Enough to give Marge Gunderson morning sickness all over again. And the good vs evil thing: so obvious in the contrasts between Marge (the good), Buscemi and Stormare (the evil), and poor Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) squeamishly caught in a trap in-between. I could only handle the violence because of Marge. She is the rock of normality, who continues trumpeting the virtuous life, when all hell is breaking loose around her. She knows all-to-well that ""you know what"" happens, but always knows ""you know what"" can be flushed down the toilet. Frances McDormand, as Marge, deserves every acting award she ever got for this role. Marge, to me, is the most perfect cop I've ever encountered. She is polite, non-judgemental, yet able to ask the tough questions that gets her the information she needs. You can see how thoroughly she sizes up those she interviews: watching every nuance of their body language, and hearing ever inflection of their speech. Now here's a woman who can spot a lie when others can't. Unlike so many cops in movies, she doesn't have to beat information out of someone; she can charm it out of them, all the while appealing to their moral responsibility, no matter how immoral they may be.This is so well-shown in scenes such as talking to the two young hookers in the bar, and putting Jerry on the hotseat in the car dealership interrogations. I elected not to watch some of the scenes on my second viewing. Somewhat oddly, I skipped almost all the scenes involving Jean Lundegaard (the kidnapped one) - I couldn't bear to watch what was happening to this woman, knowing full well her fate. I felt so sorry for her; she was the true victim in this - the most innocent, yet the one who suffered the most. I guess a case could also be made that her son, Scotty, suffered equally, but most of what he went through was not presented on camera. Maybe he would suffer the most, for he had to live afterward. Even Marge would suffer from this catastrophe, but you know her suffering will be tempered by an unwavering belief that good triumphs over evil. As the last scene shows (Marge getting into bed with her husband): despite the horrors that might go on around us, we must seek solace in the everyday beauty of the things that are nearest and dearest to us all. And this message is conveyed to us all by the Coen brothers without any allusions to religion whatsoever. But I'm getting into a personal bias of my own here - if you take solace in religion playing a part in morality, so be it.",reflections second viewing,this should stand as coen brothers tour de force although i found big lebowski be even more satisfying film i look at fargo big lebowski brother where art thou as being coens three best movies i hope there is more them future that can rival these three though recent offerings such as intolerable cruelty ladykillers could be proving their peak creativity is behind them fargo is beyond doubt their masterpiece imdbs ratings bear this out 8 2 fargo 8 0 lebowski 7 8 brother sheer entertainment lebowski or should i call it dude wins handsdown but fargo has all elements true classic beyond doubt i have never seen such dramatically obvious portrayal good vs evil never never have i seen such gut wrenching violence oh violence beautifully believable its grotesque way this movie is proof that artistic freedom portray such violence should never be denied steve buscemis bullet grazed face becomes almost as painful watcher as it is his character steve buscemis leg wood chipper is as horrific scene as you are ever going see enough give marge gunderson morning sickness all over again good vs evil thing so obvious contrasts between marge good buscemi stormare evil poor jerry lundegaard william h macy squeamishly caught trap between i could only handle violence because marge she is rock normality who continues trumpeting virtuous life when all hell is breaking loose around her she knows all well that you know what happens but always knows you know what can be flushed down toilet frances mcdormand as marge deserves every acting award she ever got this role marge me is most perfect cop ive ever encountered she is polite non judgemental yet able ask tough questions that gets her information she needs you can see how thoroughly she sizes up those she interviews watching every nuance their body language hearing ever inflection their speech now heres woman who can spot lie when others cant unlike so many cops movies she doesnt have beat information out someone she can charm it out them all while appealing their moral responsibility no matter how immoral they may be this is so well shown scenes such as talking two young hookers bar putting jerry hotseat car dealership interrogations i elected not watch some scenes my second viewing somewhat oddly i skipped almost all scenes involving jean lundegaard kidnapped one i couldnt bear watch what was happening this woman knowing full well her fate i felt so sorry her she was true victim this most innocent yet one who suffered most i guess case could also be made that her son scotty suffered equally but most what he went through was not presented camera maybe he would suffer most he had live afterward even marge would suffer this catastrophe but you know her suffering will be tempered by unwavering belief that good triumphs over evil as last scene shows marge getting into bed with her husband despite horrors that might go around us we must seek solace everyday beauty things that are nearest dearest us all this message is conveyed us all by coen brothers without any allusions religion whatsoever but im getting into personal bias my own here if you take solace religion playing part morality so be it,0.5212654675341244,0.07820889723874799,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,A masterpiece of Shakesperean proportions,"I've always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter ""What's this?"" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s.",masterpiece shakesperean proportions,ive always thought fargo would make great shakesperean play you could alter modern elements still have created buzz 400 years ago suburban england indeed plot is similar hamlets that they both have characters we root who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out control into bloodshed many people seem like fargo its humorous qualities its characterization minnesotan culture frances mcdormand not me i love fargo its brilliant writing its tragic musical score its tragic plot william h macy harve presnell steve buscemi its ignorance political correctness how many movies can you remember when only two minority characters were both revealed be creeps i want draw attention overlooked reason why film works so well how well music suits visuals this movie each murder scene is scored superbly other audio clues really add effect instance notice how when police officer asks carl showalter whats this reference abductee disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has instantaneous psychological effect how you interpret scene i have seen this film over well embarrassing number times have committed its screenplay start finish by memory fargo is ultimate coen brothers movie brilliant tragedy restores my faith roger ebert as he places this movie as his fourth favorite movie 90s,0.5271739130434783,0.19021739130434784,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Coen brothers' black comedy masterpiece,"The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful.",coen brothers black comedy masterpiece,coen brothers flash based true story disclaimer real 1987 minnesota incident its one misdirections jerry lundegaard william h macy hires two bumbling criminals carl showalter steve buscemi gaear grimsrud peter stormare kidnap his wife force his hard father law wade gustafson pay ransom jerry is miserable working wade his car dealership hes desperate need cash kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including police officer pregnant sheriff marge gunderson frances mcdormand goes investigate this is great movie it has its funny moments it has great visual touches quirky characters off kilter style that is hallmark coen brothers macy is incredible as sniffling little weasel it walks absurd line between dark comedy it has plenty both it is simply wonderful,0.65625,0.076875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,"Well I S'pose Ya Should See It, Ya Know","Bein' a Minnesotan and havin' seen ""Fargo"" (which is not in Minnesota, ya know), I want to say that we don't talk that way. No indeedy. Well that said, this review can move on ahead. I certainly liked that Frances McDormand. You know, she was constantly on the trail of those two guys (they were funny lookin'). William Macy as Jerry certainly did a good job as the auto salesman who fell on hard luck and had to have his wife kidnapped. You betcha! And that kidnapping scene where the two guys botched it was funny in a sick kinda way, considerin' they killed her and all. Yaw! Those Coen brothers. A couple of Minnesotans, ya know, can tell a pretty gory tale and make it work out. And where else would you find a wood chipper bein' a major part of a story? This movie is certainly in my top ten of all time. I hope you get to see it or whatever!",well i spose ya should see it ya know,bein minnesotan havin seen fargo which is not minnesota ya know i want say that we dont talk that way no indeedy well that said this review can move ahead i certainly liked that frances mcdormand you know she was constantly trail those two guys they were funny lookin william macy as jerry certainly did good job as auto salesman who fell hard luck had have his wife kidnapped you betcha that kidnapping scene where two guys botched it was funny sick kinda way considerin they killed her all yaw those coen brothers couple minnesotans ya know can tell pretty gory tale make it work out where else would you find wood chipper bein major part story this movie is certainly my top ten all time i hope you get see it or whatever,0.6216836734693878,0.08005952380952382,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"
4.0,YEP! I AM THE ONE GUY WHO DIDN'T LIKE FARGO!,"Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count. But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo? Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever. I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh. I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou. I loved Happy Gilmore. I loved Clerks. I loved Dr. Strangelove. I loved Blazing Saddles. So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies. But I did not love Fargo.First off, the accents. People say that these Wisconsin accents are hilarious. Well, they're not. I grew up in the South, okay. I have never met a person with a Wisconsin accent in my life. But I do see them in movies and on TV a lot. These are just normal accents. There is nothing satirical about them. They aren't that funny. Get over it.Okay, the plot. Is it just me or is the plot to this movie mediocre and boring? It's an average crime movie. I know crime movies. That's my forte, you could say. My favorite movie genre is crime (Pulp fiction, Leon, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Heat, etc...). But this movie is just an average movie. The plot is pretty predictable too. I could have guessed the entire movie from the word go.Now, I will give credit where credit is due. The movie isn't all bad. The acting is good. The dialog is quick and edgy. The writing is intelligent. And the direction is sharp and nice. But there is nothing funny, groundbreaking, or remotely interesting about this movie.Okay, one last gripe. If you haven't seen the movie, avert thy eyes, because the ending is about to be told. Okay, you still here? Good, I warned you.The wood chipper scene is one of the most famous scenes in the history of movies, or so it has become. Honestly, I see nothing funny about it. It's not that I'm against throwing people into wood chippers. I liked Evil Dead 2. Gore doesn't bother me. But what is so damn funny about throwing a human corpse into a wood chipper? It makes sense to me. If you wanted to dispose of a body and a wood chipper is near by, well hey! IDEA! THROW IT IN! But is it funny? Not really. Is it gory? No. Is it bad? No. But is it deserving of being called one of the greatest scenes ever? HELL NO!I am really trying to understand people's love of this movie. I wasn't the biggest fan of The Blues Brothers, but I understand why people love it. Fargo isn't funny, nor is it very interesting. The acting is the only thing that kept me interested. I love W.H. Macy. All the actors and actresses are good in this movie. But is this movie the work of genus that people make it out to be? No, ohhhhhhhhhh God no. In conclusion: This movie is an ""okay"" movie. There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't great. I hate it when people make movies out to be better than they really are. I found The Untouchables, The Blues Brothers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Being John Malkovic, and Fargo to all be overrated movies. They're not bad, they're just not great, or even that good either. (ESPECIALLY CROUCHING TIGER!) People, please join me in the crusade to bring the truth out and bring down the overrated movies!My rating: 5/10PS: Go ahead, send the hate mail.

1.0,Shiny Happy Tedium,"What is it about these movies from the Coen brothers which appeals to so many people? How can anyone enjoy a slow paced, over-the-top acted borefest with an impressive collection of the most annoying personalities available. Movies which don't seem to go anywhere despite the fact that there is plenty of story to go about. It must be something masochistic which I don't get.Fargo.Surely none of the characters are real life persons but yet I'm not watching a cartoon. None of the dialog seems to be of this Earth, yet I'm not watching a re-enactment of our planet by the inhabitants of Planet KzOrp. So I can only imagine that I'm watching a comedy or at least a movie with an attempt at humor. I mean, what else could it be? It's too preposterous to be a thriller and the characters and the screenplay are too bizarre to make it a drama. I must have been misinformed about this genre of film. Because it has always been my understanding that a comedy had something to do with laughter and amusement. A ridiculous situation could become quite funny, but truly not when the whole movie is ridiculous as well. Same goes for the abominable, hateful characters.If the movie Groundhog Day, arguably amongst the best comedies ever made, was made by the Coen brothers, they would have had the entire village reliving the same day over and over again. And not only that, they would have made every character in that movie be twice as arrogant (Murray), dorky (Larry) and desirable (MacDowell) etc. Its result would be the a monstrosity of a caricature .This movie lacks everything what Groundhog Day makes a good comedy; namely finesse, subtlety and something which makes the viewer not being alienated from the characters and above all, something actually funny going on. (Since when is a kidnapping and a lot of deaths a funny setting? Because Buscemi and Macy are in it?..give me a break, this is hardly Pulp Fiction)For a crime/thriller based on actual fact, it lacks a seriousness and perhaps even respect to the events that have taken place. And the lack of means of time-travel aside, watching Fargo, I was expecting Jeff Bridges to walk onto the set looking for his stupid rug which would have been my longed for queue to press the eject button.So all in all it is not a comedy, it is not a crime/drama/thriller but simply a Coen production. To me it's just an incredibly annoying in-between-genre film which cannot decide what it's supposed to be. Therefore it misses the mark on all counts which make the redeeming qualities of the production (and there are a lot) seem sadly wasted.But it seems to be the minority opinionthe bandwagon ride is so comfy..",shiny happy tedium,what is it about these movies coen brothers which appeals so many people how can anyone enjoy slow paced over top acted borefest with impressive collection most annoying personalities available movies which dont seem go anywhere despite fact that there is plenty story go about it must be something masochistic which i dont get fargo surely none characters are real life persons but yet im not watching cartoon none dialog seems be this earth yet im not watching re enactment our planet by inhabitants planet kzorp so i can only imagine that im watching comedy or at least movie with attempt at humor i mean what else could it be its too preposterous be thriller characters screenplay are too bizarre make it drama i must have been misinformed about this genre film because it has always been my understanding that comedy had something do with laughter amusement ridiculous situation could become quite funny but truly not when whole movie is ridiculous as well same goes abominable hateful characters if movie groundhog day arguably amongst best comedies ever made was made by coen brothers they would have had entire village reliving same day over over again not only that they would have made every character that movie be twice as arrogant murray dorky larry desirable macdowell etc its result would be monstrosity caricature this movie lacks everything what groundhog day makes good comedy namely finesse subtlety something which makes viewer not being alienated characters above all something actually funny going since when is kidnapping lot deaths funny setting because buscemi macy are it give me break this is hardly pulp fiction crime thriller based actual fact it lacks seriousness perhaps even respect events that have taken place lack means time travel aside watching fargo i was expecting jeff bridges walk onto set looking his stupid rug which would have been my longed queue press eject button so all all it is not comedy it is not crime drama thriller but simply coen production me its just incredibly annoying between genre film which cannot decide what its supposed be therefore it misses mark all counts which make redeeming qualities production there are lot seem sadly wasted but it seems be minority opinion bandwagon ride is so comfy,0.6071485260770976,0.11083333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Fargo,"Excellent movie I really enjoyed watching the movie, the storyline was fun. More than once it surprised me with unexpected events, the soundtrack was great, and the photography was great as well. The acting in the movie was good from all the actors, especially Stephen Buscemi, who was the best actor in the movie. Some events in the film could have been deleted and would not affect the plot of the film, such as Mike's character had no role in the story, and felt that it was only put in place in order to increase the length of the film. The movie, and the beginning of the movie was slow. I wish it was faster than that. I recommend watching the film and my rating for the film is 8.1.",fargo,excellent movie i really enjoyed watching movie storyline was fun more than once it surprised me with unexpected events soundtrack was great photography was great as well acting movie was good all actors especially stephen buscemi who was best actor movie some events film could have been deleted would not affect plot film such as mikes character had no role story felt that it was only put place order increase length film movie beginning movie was slow i wish it was faster than that i recommend watching film my rating film is 8 1,0.64,0.36666666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.17}"
