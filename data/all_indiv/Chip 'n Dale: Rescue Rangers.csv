8,Impressive that it even exists,"With all of the self aware jabs at some of the worst trends in Hollywood filmmaking as well as a ridiculous amount of characters from different studios crossing over, it's a miracle that Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers exists in the current filmmaking landscape.What makes it even better is that it's a great film that's impressively paced, funny and pretty heartwarming. A love letter to animation by including as many different forms of it as possible, including the more disturbing ones.John Mulaney cleverly chooses to play it almost completely straight which really helps him bounce off Andy Samberg's energy and adorable naivety. Rounding out the main three is Kiki Layne, who is just as likeable and energetic.Akiva Schaffer's direction is excellent, the film is definitely different to his previous work but he adapts perfectly. The visual effects are consistently strong and the practical and CG blends together nicely overall.",impressive that it even exists,with all self aware jabs at some worst trends hollywood filmmaking as well as ridiculous amount characters different studios crossing over its miracle that chip n dale rescue rangers exists current filmmaking landscape what makes it even better is that its great film thats impressively paced funny pretty heartwarming love letter animation by including as many different forms it as possible including more disturbing ones john mulaney cleverly chooses play it almost completely straight which really helps him bounce off andy sambergs energy adorable naivety rounding out main three is kiki layne who is just as likeable energetic akiva schaffers direction is excellent film is definitely different his previous work but he adapts perfectly visual effects are consistently strong practical cg blends together nicely overall,0.6298850574712644,0.23160919540229885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9,Their legal team must be ELITE,"SCORE: 8.8/10Such a creative masterpiece! Their legal team must've been working overtime to secure all the cameos that were in this movie. We saw so many of the beloved animated characters of our childhood, none of which could amount to the genius inclusion of Ugly Sonic. For the same reasons I love Deadpool 2, I love a movie that is self aware and can make jokes about previous projects. They executed their cameos so well and I was genuinely impressed to see how many characters showed up, both in and out of studio.The voice acting choices were top tier. John Mulaney, Andy Samberg, J. K. Simmons, and the plethora of characters played by Seth Rogen were awesome. I also really enjoyed the plot of this movie, where we see an overweight Peter Pan and his diobolical plan to shoot terrible knock off movies with characters found in this world.

9,A Terrific and Hilarious Spiritual Successor to Roger Rabbit- shame on Disney for not putting this one in theaters,"With a phenomenal cast and incredibly funny and satirical script- Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers is a tremendously fun time and the best hybrid animated/live action flick since Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I have to come clean first, as I have never actually watched the original Rescue Rangers tv show, although I have always had a firm desire to do so at some point. Knowing little to nothing about the characters at hand besides there small presence in some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons- I still found myself to deeply enjoy this film for what it was, and loved its new take and incredible satire on the animation industry. First off, the cast is just amazing; John Mulaney, Andy Samberg, Seth Rogen, Will Arnett, J. K. Simmons, Keegan Michael KEy, Eric Bana, Tim Robinson, and so many more- not to mention its written and directed by Akiva Schaffer of The Lonely Island- there is just so much to geek out about here. The script can go through some familiar elements at times, and it definitely is inspired by the likes of films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but definitely better than other films with that same copycat idea like Cool World or Monkeybone. Besides some basic bland formula structure, I enjoyed the humor of this film deeply- and loved the way they handled the references throughout- especially with Ugly Sonic and the numerous Seth Rogen characters which had me dying every time they were on screen. It also had a surprising amount of heart to it as well, and even made me tear up towards the end there, which I have to say I was not expecting from a film about two talking chipmunks. In the end, Chip 'n Dale may not be as perfect as Roger Rabbit but it's a wonderful and hilarious spiritual successor that I certainly wouldn't mind watching again and am disappointed to see go straight to streaming.My Rating: 8.9/10.",terrific hilarious spiritual successor roger rabbit shame disney not putting this one theaters,with phenomenal cast incredibly funny satirical script chip n dale rescue rangers is tremendously fun time best hybrid animated live action flick since who framed roger rabbit i have come clean first as i have never actually watched original rescue rangers tv show although i have always had firm desire do so at some point knowing little nothing about characters at hand besides there small presence some classic mickey mouse cartoons i still found myself deeply enjoy this film what it was loved its new take incredible satire animation industry first off cast is just amazing john mulaney andy samberg seth rogen will arnett j k simmons keegan michael key eric bana tim robinson so many more not mention its written directed by akiva schaffer lonely island there is just so much geek out about here script can go through some familiar elements at times it definitely is inspired by likes films like who framed roger rabbit but definitely better than other films with that same copycat idea like cool world or monkeybone besides some basic bland formula structure i enjoyed humor this film deeply loved way they handled references throughout especially with ugly sonic numerous seth rogen characters which had me dying every time they were screen it also had surprising amount heart it as well even made me tear up towards end there which i have say i was not expecting film about two talking chipmunks end chip n dale may not be as perfect as roger rabbit but its wonderful hilarious spiritual successor that i certainly wouldnt mind watching again am disappointed see go straight streaming my rating 8 9 10,0.5680470889654563,0.23859550313631944,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.19}"
8,Oh Man! this was soooooo Hilarious!!!,"I'm a man from the Duck Tales Generation so indeed I loved the idea of a reboot movie about Chip N' Dale's Rescue Rangers, but this was so much more. Somewhat a modern take on who Frame Rodger Rabbit, Chip N. Dale play out of work cartoon characters who have not been relevant snice the Disney Afternoon, who get back together in order to solve a real crime.It's a satire on the whole animation business. Lucky for Disney, they have a large roster of animation to choose from. The long history of animation is explored as this new Chip and Dale don't just live in a world of 2D animation, but CGI, stop motion, even puppets interact with the humans here. We also get great cameos from other cartoon characters who add to the showbiz concept of sometimes you're on top with your movie on a billboard on the Sunset strip and sometimes you're not the main attraction at comic con. They left no stone unturned about what Geekdom is like today and every stone turned made me laugh out loudI feel like Disney may have missed the mark on this one. In a world filled with geeks completely nostalgic over their childhood I feel this reboot of the Rescue Rangers could have made a decent dime at the box office.

5,Nostalgia bate at its finest,"Don't get me wrong, the voice acting in the movie is top notch. And the animation style is definitely something to talk about. But where those things exceeds almost everything else in the movie falls flat. I think this movie knew it's strongest pint would be it's nostalgia and it put a lot on that aspect. So beyond that you just have a kid Disney movie with some good voice acting.If your not interested in having 90s and 2000s nostalgia shoved down your eye holes for the entire film this is not for you.

9,Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers,"To say that Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers is the best live-action/animated comedy movie since Who Framed Roger Rabbit does not mean much.Just how many good live-action/animated comedy has there since Roger Rabbit? Space Jam being a honourable exception.Chip and Dale were childhood best friends who ended up having a hit Disney show in the late 1980s as private investigators.It ended bitterly as Dale went for his own solo show that flopped and their series was cancelled.Driven apart. Chip works in insurance and lives a lonely existence. Dale clings on to his old fame by hanging around fan conventions and hoping for Chip 'n Dale to be rebooted.When their old co star Monterey Jack is kidnapped, lured by stinky cheese. Chip and Dale join forces to track him down. Only to find that a bootlegged future awaits once famous cartoon characters.Fast and zany. Disney uses its own IP as well as from other companies. Heck even Roger Rabbit turns up.There is Winnie the Pooh, He-Man, Skeletor, ET, Batman, Scrooge McDuck, The Simpsons, Baloo the Bear, Chipmunks as well as many others. The Stand out is Ugly Sonic, the much mocked version of Sonic the Hedgehog when the movie trailer was unveiled.The movie lovingly mocks Hollywood. Dale has become a CGI character while Chip flatly remains 2D animated. There are jokes about the deadeyes look of early 21st century CGI cartoons such as The Polar Express.",chip n dale rescue rangers,say that chip n dale rescue rangers is best live action animated comedy movie since who framed roger rabbit does not mean much just how many good live action animated comedy has there since roger rabbit space jam being honourable exception chip dale were childhood best friends who ended up having hit disney show late 1980s as private investigators it ended bitterly as dale went his own solo show that flopped their series was cancelled driven apart chip works insurance lives lonely existence dale clings his old fame by hanging around fan conventions hoping chip n dale be rebooted when their old co star monterey jack is kidnapped lured by stinky cheese chip dale join forces track him down only find that bootlegged future awaits once famous cartoon characters fast zany disney uses its own ip as well as other companies heck even roger rabbit turns up there is winnie pooh he man skeletor et batman scrooge mcduck simpsons baloo bear chipmunks as well as many others stand out is ugly sonic much mocked version sonic hedgehog when movie trailer was unveiled movie lovingly mocks hollywood dale has become cgi character while chip flatly remains 2d animated there are jokes about deadeyes look early 21st century cgi cartoons such as polar express,0.4720117845117845,0.1800026782981328,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.34}"
5,What an absolutely bizarre age of movies this is,"Okay, look. I know I say this about almost everything that ever gets made at this point, but when I saw the trailer for Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, I truly, deeply believed that I was watching a parody. This isn't just a quip for the review, like when I jokingly wrote that I mistook Detective Pikachu for a Corridor Digital video or something.Here, it genuinely took me a second to realize that the trailer was posted on the official Disney Studios channel on YouTube; that the teaser for a CG'd reboot of Rescue Rangers -- with music by Doja Cat and ""starring the Lonely Island"" -- WASN'T a sketch by Screen Junkies. But hey, the one where Deadpool plays Pikachu turned out to be a real movie. I really should've guessed.Now, obviously, this isn't to say that the movie is necessarily terrible. It clearly isn't taking itself that seriously and so there is no use to complain too much. But why is THIS the premise of a revamp of The Rescue Rangers?More precisely, it follows in the footsteps of films like Looney Tunes Back in Action (2003), showing these beloved animal characters resurface as washed-up has-beens, some of whom have undergone cosmetic changes (e.g. Dale's upgrade to 3D animation) to stay hot and relevant. Alas, it also takes some cues from Space Jam 2 and the utterly loathsome Tom and Jerry, being a cartoon-live-action hybrid full of references to famous IPs that you're meant to laugh and clap at. We see Roger Rabbit and MC Skat Kat for a little bit, but Disney isn't fooling anyone; there is no reason to put Chip and Dale -- especially the 1990s RR versions -- in this kind of setting.Of course it's not impossible to revamp the old Disney Afternoon shows in a way that also calls back to the days of yore. Just look at how well 2017's Ducktales did. But that one didn't act as if Scrooge McDuck was an actor this whole time and that his escapades were filmed on the same soundstage where Roger Rabbit shoots his shorts.That's not just an analogy, by the way. We do see Scrooge in the movie, along with many other animated ""actors"", not just limited to those found in 2D Disney classics. (There's no Aki Ross, but a boy can dream.) As another critic noted, this is a deeply weird film before we even get to the castration jokes (the PAW Patrol crew are implied to have done something truly horrid to a police officer's manhood), the loathly revelation of Gadget and Zipper's plentiful half-fly, half-mouse offspring, and the realization of the sheer amount of animated media being referenced here -- this Disney movie calls back to the Zemeckisverse, Gumby, anime, Rick and Morty, South Park, and, inadvertently, Bojack Horseman (the film all but ""typecasts"" Will Arnett as a bloated, washed-up actor in a world of both humans and man-beasts).There are several fun gags based around all these different animation styles (Hell, I dare say this romp is more varied and interesting to watch than Ralph Breaks the Internet, another flick that likely paved the way for this one) and there are jokes at the expense of 2019's Cats, the nightmarish original design of Sonic for 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog, and even Disney's own Lion King remake that I especially appreciate. It's rich coming from the same people who just sucked all life and energy out of Monterey Jack and Gadget (all the bona fide 2D animation seems reserved for throwaway cameos), but still.While I occasionally enjoyed the meta-humor and irony, I didn't properly ""register"" them at first. After Free Guy and The Matrix: Resurrection (on top of all the other similar films I've named thus far), you can't really hide your creative bankruptcy and nostalgia-baiting behind the veneer of irony. On the contrary, I've actually come to EXPECT movies like this to make fun of corporate greed while exemplifying that very greed. I'd be shocked if there WEREN'T jokes about reboots and ""Hollywood nonsense"" in this.The main takeaway for me is the following fact: the kiddie film category isn't just for kiddies anymore. Yes, this is a cutesy Disney movie that doesn't have any swears and nudity but let's be honest, small children aren't going to comprehend half of what is happening in this. It's not like Spider-Man: No Way Home, where there's something for everyone but perhaps mostly for the veteran fans. With this movie, it's official; we are now making ""children's films"" that are wholly and exclusively for manchildren.In any case, I guess I'm not too offended. I've found Chip and Dale to be total dicks in almost every canonical appearance I've seen from them -- even when they appeared with no names in 1943's Private Pluto. If Disney wants to ""ruin"" them, I won't lose any sleep.",what absolutely bizarre age movies this is,okay look i know i say this about almost everything that ever gets made at this point but when i saw trailer chip n dale rescue rangers i truly deeply believed that i was watching parody this isnt just quip review like when i jokingly wrote that i mistook detective pikachu corridor digital video or something here it genuinely took me second realize that trailer was posted official disney studios channel youtube that teaser cgd reboot rescue rangers with music by doja cat starring lonely island wasnt sketch by screen junkies but hey one where deadpool plays pikachu turned out be real movie i really shouldve guessed now obviously this isnt say that movie is necessarily terrible it clearly isnt taking itself that seriously so there is no use complain too much but why is this premise revamp rescue rangers more precisely it follows footsteps films like looney tunes back action 2003 showing these beloved animal characters resurface as washed up has beens some whom have undergone cosmetic changes e g dales upgrade 3d animation stay hot relevant alas it also takes some cues space jam 2 utterly loathsome tom jerry being cartoon live action hybrid full references famous ips that youre meant laugh clap at we see roger rabbit mc skat kat little bit but disney isnt fooling anyone there is no reason put chip dale especially 1990s rr versions this kind setting course its not impossible revamp old disney afternoon shows way that also calls back days yore just look at how well 2017s ducktales did but that one didnt act as if scrooge mcduck was actor this whole time that his escapades were filmed same soundstage where roger rabbit shoots his shorts thats not just analogy by way we do see scrooge movie along with many other animated actors not just limited those found 2d disney classics theres no aki ross but boy can dream as another critic noted this is deeply weird film before we even get castration jokes paw patrol crew are implied have done something truly horrid police officers manhood loathly revelation gadget zippers plentiful half fly half mouse offspring realization sheer amount animated media being referenced here this disney movie calls back zemeckisverse gumby anime rick morty south park inadvertently bojack horseman film all but typecasts will arnett as bloated washed up actor world both humans man beasts there are several fun gags based around all these different animation styles hell i dare say this romp is more varied interesting watch than ralph breaks internet another flick that likely paved way this one there are jokes at expense 2019s cats nightmarish original design sonic 2020s sonic hedgehog even disneys own lion king remake that i especially appreciate its rich coming same people who just sucked all life energy out monterey jack gadget all bona fide 2d animation seems reserved throwaway cameos but still while i occasionally enjoyed meta humor irony i didnt properly register them at first after free guy matrix resurrection top all other similar films ive named thus far you cant really hide your creative bankruptcy nostalgia baiting behind veneer irony contrary ive actually come expect movies like this make fun corporate greed while exemplifying that very greed id be shocked if there werent jokes about reboots hollywood nonsense this main takeaway me is following fact kiddie film category isnt just kiddies anymore yes this is cutesy disney movie that doesnt have any swears nudity but lets be honest small children arent going comprehend half what is happening this its not like spider man no way home where theres something everyone but perhaps mostly veteran fans with this movie its official we are now making childrens films that are wholly exclusively manchildren any case i guess im not too offended ive found chip dale be total dicks almost every canonical appearance ive seen them even when they appeared with no names 1943s private pluto if disney wants ruin them i wont lose any sleep,0.48808054085831865,0.12523582384693493,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.26}"
2,Disney is desperate to pander towards the meta-commentary and pop reference crowd but they still can't stop being full of themselves,"I grew up with the Chip 'n Dale shorts from the early years of Disney. Didn't get to watch much of the original Rescue Rangers but I did enjoy some of the episodes. I was skeptical because of how recent Disney films have been lacking and how full of themselves they had become with their movies. But I like Samberg so I gave it a chance. I really didn't like it.The animation is trying to be 2D like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" with the touch of live-action but it honestly looks like garbage. There are moments where there are animation errors and it seemingly looks really ugly. The color palette seems to not match the backgrounds at many moments as if the animation was unfinished. None of the new characters were interesting at all as they felt underwritten, annoying, or just unnecessary to be in. As much as I love most of the cast, the voice acting is completely off-putting and really annoying. Samberg and Mulvany are great comedians but as a duo, I wasn't a big fan of it as it made my ears almost bleed. The dialogue is very clunky and really bad. I almost feel like I am watching a Dhar Mann film.The meta-commentary is trying to play hard with many of its references like making fun of the ugly sonic design, the movie Cats, the Robert Zeckemis Stop motion era, and many other properties. But as the meta continues, it honestly feels like the writers and directors were just trying to jerk themselves off and be like ""See? I am making fun of the other properties because I know more than they do! So I'm smarter and funnier than you"" kind of feel. As if it's like the kid who desperately tries to be in the group and acts all cool to impress people. It's not good meta but just bad and desperate attempts of being meta. Criticizing how ugly the movie Cats look yet Chip n Dale's designs look ugly and very creepy seems ironic I assume. What they did to the character of Peter Pan was shocking and knowing what happened to the original voice actor who suffered from alcoholism, honestly, that's a bit of a stretch. Such I laugh at that? Maybe, but I didn't. As if Disney couldn't help themselves.The best part is that the soundtrack fits well and there are some nice colors demonstrated in the film. It's bad. At least there was more passion than Space Jam: A New Legacy. But I rather watch Neil Breen.People will love this movie as I haven't seen many negative opinions and mostly positive opinions. If you like the movie, that's great. It's just my silly opinion and I'm glad you enjoyed it.2/10.",disney is desperate pander towards meta commentary pop reference crowd but they still cant stop being full themselves,i grew up with chip n dale shorts early years disney didnt get watch much original rescue rangers but i did enjoy some episodes i was skeptical because how recent disney films have been lacking how full themselves they had become with their movies but i like samberg so i gave it chance i really didnt like it animation is trying be 2d like who framed roger rabbit with touch live action but it honestly looks like garbage there are moments where there are animation errors it seemingly looks really ugly color palette seems not match backgrounds at many moments as if animation was unfinished none new characters were interesting at all as they felt underwritten annoying or just unnecessary be as much as i love most cast voice acting is completely off putting really annoying samberg mulvany are great comedians but as duo i wasnt big fan it as it made my ears almost bleed dialogue is very clunky really bad i almost feel like i am watching dhar mann film meta commentary is trying play hard with many its references like making fun ugly sonic design movie cats robert zeckemis stop motion era many other properties but as meta continues it honestly feels like writers directors were just trying jerk themselves off be like see i am making fun other properties because i know more than they do so im smarter funnier than you kind feel as if its like kid who desperately tries be group acts all cool impress people its not good meta but just bad desperate attempts being meta criticizing how ugly movie cats look yet chip n dales designs look ugly very creepy seems ironic i assume what they did character peter pan was shocking knowing what happened original voice actor who suffered alcoholism honestly thats bit stretch such i laugh at that maybe but i didnt as if disney couldnt help themselves best part is that soundtrack fits well there are some nice colors demonstrated film its bad at least there was more passion than space jam new legacy but i rather watch neil breen people will love this movie as i havent seen many negative opinions mostly positive opinions if you like movie thats great its just my silly opinion im glad you enjoyed it 2 10,0.6018365472910927,0.059010560146923796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.23}"

2,Into the Uncanny Valley,"A nightmare version of what an old property revival looks like.From over-realistic CGI with weird designs to cheaply-made cel shaded models. For a second, I thought one of the chipmunks was hand drawn, but no one put that much love into it.The film itself has WAY too many useless references that will get dumb crowds excited, and not enough substance. In fact, this isn't even a real Rescue Rangers sequel, but perspective on the characters I couldn't care about. There are some clever inclusions and ""jokes"" that don't amount to more than their initial introduction and concept, and it all ends up feeling like an SNL skit.

4,Not Roger Rabbit.,"They had all the tools and rights to produce something really great and funny here. While the story is decent (albeit a bit too similar to Roger Rabbit) and the different kinds of animation styles and puppets was fun to see, the movie wasn't funny or fun. There's barely any jokes, funny scenes or funny characters and the existing ""jokes"" was very lame and tame.I constantly question comedy nowadays. When people are working with the things they love and get the opportunity to do a movie, which only happens to relatively few, there should be TONS of funny jokes, wacky characters and funny scenes to chose from. Yet it feel like most comedies, like this one, is just a soulless chore for movie makers, that they're happy to just complete. Who OKs scripts like this? Nobody gave any input on the lack of comedy?

3,Disastrous Revival of the Famed Disney Chipmunk Duo,"Chip & Dale are among the most well known Disney side characters to have their own cult spinoff, Rescue Rangers, to the point of somehow gaining interest in a movie adaptation. Now, following more than 30 years after the show's original run, Lonely Island member Akiva Schaffer and a whole slew of improv comedy writers brought to us one of the most bizarrely odd adaptations of an animated TV show in existence. While the film has garnished positive critical reception, it has also been met with scathing responses from the general public for its crazy execution and forced meta humor. I'd hate to say it, but I'm part of the latter.Set years after the end of the Rescue Rangers show, Chip and Dale live their own boring lives in a world where humans and cartoon characters interact in. Upon realizing that traditionally animated characters are being morphed into cheap knockoffs and realistic computer graphics, Chip and Dale must team up again to save the world from certain doom. What would sound like a really fun idea on paper is sadly botched horribly in the final cut. The mere concept of cartoons being turned into horrible concoctions has a lot of promise, but the movie has no proper context as to how a world with real people and cartoon characters in the first place that the suspension of disbelief is broken from jump street. What doesn't help either is that the movie spends more time vomiting out obnoxious meta humor and making fun of its own flaws and cliches than actually creating an engaging storyline. As a result, the film is left with a predictably hollow plot with more emphasis on the lowbrow comedy than a truly fun adventure. Never has 98 minutes of runtime felt more like 3 hours this much.On top of the confusingly broken premise and condescending meta humor, the characters themselves are not the least bit appealing or endearing. In regards to the titular characters, Chip and Dale have a seemingly strong arc that details how they met all the way up to how they are in the present day. While their origin story sounds charming at first, their dynamic is so obvious and cliched that it's easy to pinpoint how they reunite throughout the runtime. Despite the best efforts from Andy Samberg and John Mulaney, Chip and Dale are sadly mere relics of the film's stale buddy cop movie archetype list, as well as the returning characters from the show and the new people they meet. On top of that, the main villain of the movie is in such poor taste that it makes the movie more insulting than it already is, not helped by a bunch of cookie cutter henchmen that have no character other than their animated forms. All the other characters are either already existing icons used as gimmicks or stale jokes that sometimes serve the plot. Needless to say, this movie is all cartoon and no character.In regards to the film being half live-action and half animated, despite a lot of hard work and effort shown on screen, the end product is utterly mind boggling. Since most of the plot is spent on finding out the cause of animated characters being turned into CG monstrosities, the film does try to play up how unique the different animation styles are around the world. However, because there is no proper context or establishment as to how the world functions, all the different styles feel more like a clash of screen time than anything else. When you have multiple forms of fictional characters all at once, you can't just do whatever you want with them unless some form of believability is set in stone. Other than being somewhat of a commentary on how corrupt the movie industry is, seeing all the gorgeous 2D & CG work on display feels all over the place, as if this movie is all imagination and no payoff. The world feels too overwhelming for pop culture nerds, too unnecessary for Chip & Dale fans, and too annoying and confusing for anyone wanting to follow a concise storyline.It really takes a lot of effort to ruin an imaginative story by taking it in the wrong direction, and somehow, the Chip & Dale movie found a way. Even for all of the hard work from the cast and crew, not even the most creative aspects can save the film from its boring storyline, un engaging characters, poorly delivered meta humor and oddball execution. I don't know who to recommend this to at all, but if you are curious enough to check it out, do so with no expectations. If there's anything noteworthy to say about the movie, it's that nothing will prepare you for whatever it will throw at you upon first viewing.",disastrous revival famed disney chipmunk duo,chip dale are among most well known disney side characters have their own cult spinoff rescue rangers point somehow gaining interest movie adaptation now following more than 30 years after shows original run lonely island member akiva schaffer whole slew improv comedy writers brought us one most bizarrely odd adaptations animated tv show existence while film has garnished positive critical reception it has also been met with scathing responses general public its crazy execution forced meta humor id hate say it but im part latter set years after end rescue rangers show chip dale live their own boring lives world where humans cartoon characters interact upon realizing that traditionally animated characters are being morphed into cheap knockoffs realistic computer graphics chip dale must team up again save world certain doom what would sound like really fun idea paper is sadly botched horribly final cut mere concept cartoons being turned into horrible concoctions has lot promise but movie has no proper context as how world with real people cartoon characters first place that suspension disbelief is broken jump street what doesnt help either is that movie spends more time vomiting out obnoxious meta humor making fun its own flaws cliches than actually creating engaging storyline as result film is left with predictably hollow plot with more emphasis lowbrow comedy than truly fun adventure never has 98 minutes runtime felt more like 3 hours this much top confusingly broken premise condescending meta humor characters themselves are not least bit appealing or endearing regards titular characters chip dale have seemingly strong arc that details how they met all way up how they are present day while their origin story sounds charming at first their dynamic is so obvious cliched that its easy pinpoint how they reunite throughout runtime despite best efforts andy samberg john mulaney chip dale are sadly mere relics films stale buddy cop movie archetype list as well as returning characters show new people they meet top that main villain movie is such poor taste that it makes movie more insulting than it already is not helped by bunch cookie cutter henchmen that have no character other than their animated forms all other characters are either already existing icons used as gimmicks or stale jokes that sometimes serve plot needless say this movie is all cartoon no character regards film being half live action half animated despite lot hard work effort shown screen end product is utterly mind boggling since most plot is spent finding out cause animated characters being turned into cg monstrosities film does try play up how unique different animation styles are around world however because there is no proper context or establishment as how world functions all different styles feel more like clash screen time than anything else when you have multiple forms fictional characters all at once you cant just do whatever you want with them unless some form believability is set stone other than being somewhat commentary how corrupt movie industry is seeing all gorgeous 2d cg work display feels all over place as if this movie is all imagination no payoff world feels too overwhelming pop culture nerds too unnecessary chip dale fans too annoying confusing anyone wanting follow concise storyline it really takes lot effort ruin imaginative story by taking it wrong direction somehow chip dale movie found way even all hard work cast crew not even most creative aspects can save film its boring storyline un engaging characters poorly delivered meta humor oddball execution i dont know who recommend this at all but if you are curious enough check it out do so with no expectations if theres anything noteworthy say about movie its that nothing will prepare you whatever it will throw at you upon first viewing,0.5354607583774251,0.036965889049222385,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
3,A bland story about talentless actors,"At first I thought people would make fun of me when they said, this product would be real. After realizing it is real and after watching it, I now know this is Disney making fun of fans.What about the story? Who cares, it was pointless and boring. Someone got kidnapped and now these ""actors"" have to save them. Something that exists in millions of different and better versions.Remember the character of Chip and Dale? Well, they are actors now. So everything we liked about them is meaningless now. They are just unlikeable Hollywood millionaires. Even their high pitch is not their real voice.Voice acting is really bad. It is soulless, emotionless, effortless and bland. You can tell this is a pay check for them. The cop was good. For some reason J. K Simmons cared about this product. He is also the only good actor/voice actor from the entire assemble.The 2D animation is insanely cheap. There is hardly any animation. Compare it to ANY pre 2000's animation and you will know what I mean by it. Youtubers who copy the old Disney styles are way better than the current talent-free hags from Disney. It has no presence at all. Just drawn on the current frame without any ""real"" animation.There are way to many other art-styles they just butcher. Every style is just a worse version from the same studio 20+ years ago. Stop motion was fine (at best). The sock puppet was unironically great. Caught me off-guard in a good way.It is clear that their entire effort is in 3D, but as usual for Disney, it is bad.There are like 2 jokes. A joke has a set up und a punch line.What this product has are references. Just show a thing people remember.I will most likely forget its existence within the next 8 hours.If you never like Chip and Dale, you liked cheap kidnap movies and you love nostalgia milking products, then this is something for you.If you like good movies with interesting plots and characters you can skip it.",bland story about talentless actors,at first i thought people would make fun me when they said this product would be real after realizing it is real after watching it i now know this is disney making fun fans what about story who cares it was pointless boring someone got kidnapped now these actors have save them something that exists millions different better versions remember character chip dale well they are actors now so everything we liked about them is meaningless now they are just unlikeable hollywood millionaires even their high pitch is not their real voice voice acting is really bad it is soulless emotionless effortless bland you can tell this is pay check them cop was good some reason j k simmons cared about this product he is also only good actor voice actor entire assemble 2d animation is insanely cheap there is hardly any animation compare it any pre 2000s animation you will know what i mean by it youtubers who copy old disney styles are way better than current talent free hags disney it has no presence at all just drawn current frame without any real animation there are way many other art styles they just butcher every style is just worse version same studio 20 years ago stop motion was fine at best sock puppet was unironically great caught me off guard good way it is clear that their entire effort is 3d but as usual disney it is bad there are like 2 jokes joke has set up und punch line what this product has are references just show thing people remember i will most likely forget its existence within next 8 hours if you never like chip dale you liked cheap kidnap movies you love nostalgia milking products then this is something you if you like good movies with interesting plots characters you can skip it,0.5327166666666667,0.15128333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9,Rescue Rangers Comeback Good Example of How Meta Should Be Done,"At first, I was afraid of this film when this was announced, as Hollywood studios (especially Disney) has had a long history of messing up movie adaptations of classic cartoons that are live action with CGI (The two Garfield movie, Underdog, and Yogi Bear to name a few), however, Chip n Dale: Rescue Rangers, a movie based on the Disney Afternoon show of the same name, is one of the few good ones.One of the things they did right with this one is that instead of going for a reboot, they make the story set in the real world where toons and real people co-exist. Having met as kids, Chip and Dale have gone to stardom with the cartoon, but after some tension, the two split up. In the present day, Chip is an insurance salesman while Dale is doing convention runs. However, the two are put in a mystery when one of their own goes missing, and they find out a fallen star is kidnapping toons and changing parts to ship them out of country to be forced to star in bootleg movies.Yeah, the story is good. It's basically like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, as it has the setting of humans and toons living side by side, and instead of going for the usual reboot like most films, they make it a real-world story where the two are actors in a series. Also, because of the setting, it helps sets the stage for a lot of appearances of other cartoon characters (not only other Disney characters, be they movie ones like Lumiere, Baloo, or even the reboot version of Puumba, but also cartoon characters from non-Disney shows and movies, like the Mane Six from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, and other cameos I won't spoil, but have to be seen to believe). However, the movie being meta will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially with Gadget marrying Zipper and starting a family (which will undoubtedly get some fans who want Chip to marry Gadget angry and starting a fuss on the internet).When it comes to voice actors, Chip and Dale get new voice actors in the form of John Mulaney and Andy Samberg, which while may annoy some fans of the cartoon, it helps make it clear the two are portrayed in the film as actors (and one scene even has them do the voices by Tress MacNeille and Corey Burton, two actors from the cartoon who actually return to voice Gadget and Zipper here). Other notable VAs include Eric Bauza taking over as the voice of Montery Jack, Will Arnett as Sweet Pete, the main antagonist, J. K. Simmons as Captain Putty, a claymation police officer, among others.This movie is more than a movie based on a cartoon done right, it's a love letter to nostalgia. Fans who were kids growing up in the 80's and 90's will love the huge guest list of classic cartoon characters, while others will enjoy the story filled with meta jokes (like Chip thinking old cartoon characters rapping is stupid, and the fact that Dale got CGI surgery in order to get a reboot), Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers is a great movie that is not a reboot, but a comeback thirty years in the making.",rescue rangers comeback good example how meta should be done,at first i was afraid this film when this was announced as hollywood studios especially disney has had long history messing up movie adaptations classic cartoons that are live action with cgi two garfield movie underdog yogi bear name few however chip n dale rescue rangers movie based disney afternoon show same name is one few good ones one things they did right with this one is that instead going reboot they make story set real world where toons real people co exist having met as kids chip dale have gone stardom with cartoon but after some tension two split up present day chip is insurance salesman while dale is doing convention runs however two are put mystery when one their own goes missing they find out fallen star is kidnapping toons changing parts ship them out country be forced star bootleg movies yeah story is good its basically like who framed roger rabbit as it has setting humans toons living side by side instead going usual reboot like most films they make it real world story where two are actors series also because setting it helps sets stage lot appearances other cartoon characters not only other disney characters be they movie ones like lumiere baloo or even reboot version puumba but also cartoon characters non disney shows movies like mane six my little pony friendship is magic other cameos i wont spoil but have be seen believe however movie being meta will not be everyones cup tea especially with gadget marrying zipper starting family which will undoubtedly get some fans who want chip marry gadget angry starting fuss internet when it comes voice actors chip dale get new voice actors form john mulaney andy samberg which while may annoy some fans cartoon it helps make it clear two are portrayed film as actors one scene even has them do voices by tress macneille corey burton two actors cartoon who actually return voice gadget zipper here other notable vas include eric bauza taking over as voice montery jack will arnett as sweet pete main antagonist j k simmons as captain putty claymation police officer among others this movie is more than movie based cartoon done right its love letter nostalgia fans who were kids growing up 80s 90s will love huge guest list classic cartoon characters while others will enjoy story filled with meta jokes like chip thinking old cartoon characters rapping is stupid fact that dale got cgi surgery order get reboot chip n dale rescue rangers is great movie that is not reboot but comeback thirty years making,0.4833520646020645,0.12224338161838164,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.4}"

4,Cringe,"Where to start with this movie...Idk the last time I watched a movie where the jokes fell utterly flat the entire runtime. I let out a single ""ha"" only once. The entire movie is a nonsensical macguffin for the writers to cram in as many pop-culture references as possible. Pop-culture references arent comedy. It's like a bad fan fiction or a 14 year old's level of humor, where one gag that could work as a throwaway or a single joke is instead used over and over until any potential for laughs is destroyed. We get it, the first live action sonic design was weird, this movie is just telling the same joke we all already heard multiple times.Most egregious of all is that virtually every character in the movie is the same ""in real life"" as they are in their respective show or movie EXCEPT Chip and Dale: Lumiere is still a talking French candelabra, Peter Pan still wears his green outfit, even the other Rescue Rangers are exactly like their on-screen characters - so why then are Chip and Dale the only ones with different voices? I like both John Mulaney and Andy Samberg but hate their voices for Chip and Dale and it truly makes no sense. The writers decided to make a movie about a world where cartoons and humans co-exist but didn't actually do anything to make it make sense - instead they just figured they could be meta to make it seem like it doesn't matter? And what in tarnation is with Gadget and Zipper? Why.The animation was good and the live-action + animation worked pretty well and I appreciate a Tenacious D song so that's where 4 stars comes from but dear lord, this movie is so cringe.

I Always knew.While I'm very, very grateful to see my childhood characters given the feature film treatment, It was an abomination. I was expecting this to be an in-universe movie where the Rescue Rangers are actual crime fighters like in the series. Very faithful to the material. The entire self-meta direction was messy and forgettable. I nearly fell asleep twice.When the film ""G-Force"" was release in theaters back in 2009, I thought that was the precursor to a Rescue Rangers film and maybe a live action ""Rescuers"" film (maybe setup a mini shared universe).Hopefully make a film with all 3 in one, but after this, this is wrong and a letdown on every levels.Drawing one hand drawn animation and the other CGI was bad enough, unnecessary cameos, and the voices... was unbearable. In the episode ""Flash the Wonder Dog"", where Dale finds out that he's just an Actor which made him upset. That's how this movie made me feel.If you are fan of old cartoon (like myself) this is an insult to fans from the original show.
