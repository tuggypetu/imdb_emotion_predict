I saw it in the Gothenburg film festival and I saw couples holding each other after the film finished (comforting each other) and a guy asked: "" Do they have a crisis center set up to help us deal with the movie now?"".

10.0,An excellent thoughtful film with good music,"This is a film about the ethnic divide in India set during the 1994 Hindu-Muslim riots in Mumbai (Bombay).The direction is slick, the script excellent and the songs brilliant.

,"Spielberg, Listen","This movie is often compared to Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"", as the one and only movie which actually works in this context and how Spielberg could have made it to express his strong pathetic and political emotions. What a shame that ""Bombay"" haven't got such a big audience.The true life epos tells us the story of the Muslim-Hindu conflict 1995 in Bombay from the viewpoint of a young Muslim-Hindu couple doomed to leave their home town and families. This movie was made in the south, in Madras, shortly after the riots, and was immediately synchronized in Bombay to Hindi for the big audience. During the next three hours (the typical hindi movie length) everything works out fine, until the last thirty minutes where the Bombay riots suddenly break up everything. Mani Ratnam is the one and only director how dares to bring a song (every Hindi movie is a musical) during the very realistic war scenes, where such a scene actually works. Scenes where you are immediately reminded to how you would have shaken your head or laughed if this was just ""Schindler's List"". Imagine the jews singing in the last 30 minutes. Or the Trier train dance scene (for which you have to see ""Dil Se"") cut to the end. Not so here. They sing about the cruelty of war. Stop fighting. Crying, laughing, singing, dying, very close together. Where Trier sinks into unbelievable and childish anti-dead sentence pathos, Ratnam is still with the people, full of positive power. Incredible.

,By Far One of the Best Hindi Films I've Seen,"This is a truly beautiful film. The story is essentially this: a Hindu man and a Muslim woman from a small village in India fall in love and decide to marry. The villagers disapprove of this marriage to the point that they are ready to incite a riot. Given the circumstances, the man and woman elope to Mumbai (Bombay.)Everything is okay there, and the two have twins, Kamal Bano and Kabir Narayan (the names are a mix of Hindu and Muslim, to represent their heritage.) The grandfathers (while still in the village) naturally argue with each other and vow to make the children Hindu (or Muslim, depends on who wins.) Suddenly, the 1993 riots erupt, and the whole family is caught in the middle. The twins are almost burned alive, but they survive thanks to police intervention. Both grandfathers show up in Bombay (out of concern for their children and grandchildren) and continue to compete there. When another riot ensues, and the Hindu grandfather (and grandson) are approached by a group of Muslim men, the Muslim grandfather arrives in the nick of time and tells the men ""He is my brother."" Later in the film, one of the twins is separated from the other and is taken in for about a day by a member of the ""hijda"" community (this is a community in India that is essentially composed of eunuchs or hermaphrodites, but they wear women's clothing.) In a conversation with one of the twins, the ""hijda"" says ""Religion is a way to God."" The child asks him, ""Then why are all of these people killing each other?"" To this the man replies, ""I have no idea. And I've been thinking about it for a long time.""You don't necessarily have to be Indian to appreciate this film, but I think it helps. The underlying message is that ""We (as residents of India) should be Indians first and Hindu/Muslim/whatever second. The film also conveys the message of tolerance and humanity. It is really an excellent film.",by far one best hindi films ive seen,this is truly beautiful film story is essentially this hindu man muslim woman small village india fall love decide marry villagers disapprove this marriage point that they are ready incite riot given circumstances man woman elope mumbai bombay everything is okay there two have twins kamal bano kabir narayan names are mix hindu muslim represent their heritage grandfathers while still village naturally argue with each other vow make children hindu or muslim depends who wins suddenly 1993 riots erupt whole family is caught middle twins are almost burned alive but they survive thanks police intervention both grandfathers show up bombay out concern their children grandchildren continue compete there when another riot ensues hindu grandfather grandson are approached by group muslim men muslim grandfather arrives nick time tells men he is my brother later film one twins is separated other is taken about day by member hijda community this is community india that is essentially composed eunuchs or hermaphrodites but they wear womens clothing conversation with one twins hijda says religion is way god child asks him then why are all these people killing each other this man replies i have no idea ive been thinking about it long time you dont necessarily have be indian appreciate this film but i think it helps underlying message is that we as residents india should be indians first hindu muslim whatever second film also conveys message tolerance humanity it is really excellent film,0.43433333333333335,0.18500000000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.26}"

,frightening but excellent,"Ace filmmaker Mani Ratnam has attempted a film on inter-religion marriage and the aftermath of communal riots and came out with flying colors. Ratnam has struck all the right chords here as nothing in this film looks out of place and almost all characters have given their very best. Arvind Swamy shows that he has what it takes to be the numero uno in the industry after his superb performance in Roja while Manisha Koirala is indeed very good here as a Muslim girl torn between her family and her Hindu lover and then a distraught mother of lost twins. None of the actresses portray vulnerability on screen like she does. Nassar is good as the hero's father while Kitty pitches in another believable performance as the heroine's Muslim father. Music is excellent and I understand why after Bombay, Ratnam chooses A.R. Rahman as the music composer for most of his films. Cinematography is breath-taking and the scenarios of the rural India and the suburban Mumbai have been captured genuinely and beautifully. Bombay easily goes down in cinematic history as a classic and it does show some disturbing pictures of the aftermath of the Hindu-Muslim riot like charred, deformed bodies of little children after being burnt down which is truly heart wrenching and might melt even the stone-hearted.Just brilliant!

7.0,A powerful message indeed,"When you mention the words 'Indian cinema' to most people, (and disturbingly, a large proportion of film fans) often the first reaction will be that of a smirk intrinsically linked with a conjuring thought of the 'Bollywood' industry.Most people do not realise that Indian cinema as an industry is the second largest grossing cinema industry in the world, second only to the American giant that is Hollywood. Ever since the early days of the multiplex, Indian cinema has been dominating the cinematic machine, early films often dealt with social and economic strikes (mostly the 50's and before) with the Indian cinema moving more towards the romantic feature which most people associate in the mid 60's. As the decades passed by, the Indian film industry moved, as a whole, through several topics and thought provoking genres (of course a LOT of crap was released as well; this is the typical all singing all dancing 5 hour epic which most people associate Indian cinema with) until in the 90's, film makers finally started focusing on terrorism as a genre, and in particular the strife and violence engaged between Hindus and Muslims within the Tamil speaking area of India.Bombay begins as your typical Indian romance; the protagonist male and female fall in love yet are separated by different religions and families. After a moving Eden like opening song number, the two work hard to stay together through their families approval, eventually moving away form their small villages and into the city of Bombay.After an interval, the film takes a much darker tone, focusing primarily on the Bombay bombings and showing how the couple (now with children) are caught up within the racial attacks. Strikingly disturbing and realistic (one scene involves radicals pouring gasoline over the two crying children as they refuse to speak which religion they belong to) the film touches on dangerous soil as it shows the riots with no remorse or sugar coating. The lead actor delivers a compelling performance and in the end delivers an incredible speech in the middle of the riots, putting himself between the warring factions screaming 'I am neither Hindu or Muslim; I am Indian, we are all Indians!' A must watch for someone interested in good Indian cinema.",powerful message indeed,when you mention words indian cinema most people disturbingly large proportion film fans often first reaction will be that smirk intrinsically linked with conjuring thought bollywood industry most people do not realise that indian cinema as industry is second largest grossing cinema industry world second only american giant that is hollywood ever since early days multiplex indian cinema has been dominating cinematic machine early films often dealt with social economic strikes mostly 50s before with indian cinema moving more towards romantic feature which most people associate mid 60s as decades passed by indian film industry moved as whole through several topics thought provoking genres course lot crap was released as well this is typical all singing all dancing 5 hour epic which most people associate indian cinema with until 90s film makers finally started focusing terrorism as genre particular strife violence engaged between hindus muslims within tamil speaking area india bombay begins as your typical indian romance protagonist male female fall love yet are separated by different religions families after moving eden like opening song number two work hard stay together through their families approval eventually moving away form their small villages into city bombay after interval film takes much darker tone focusing primarily bombay bombings showing how couple now with children are caught up within racial attacks strikingly disturbing realistic one scene involves radicals pouring gasoline over two crying children as they refuse speak which religion they belong film touches dangerous soil as it shows riots with no remorse or sugar coating lead actor delivers compelling performance end delivers incredible speech middle riots putting himself between warring factions screaming i am neither hindu or muslim i am indian we are all indians must watch someone interested good indian cinema,0.4479037267080745,0.11099896480331264,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,Great love story with meaningful ending.,"This story of love and marriage between a Hindu man and Mospem woman was very well done. Even though I could not get the English subtitles to work on my DVD player, I was able to follow the plot with a little help from the package notes. The portrayal of the Hindu/Moslem religious riots of 1992/3 was very well done. It was an excellent portrayal of the violence, horror, bloodshed and suffering in so many such acts of violence in too many time periods, for too many reasons, and between too many groups of people. The thing uppermost in my mind was how Christian fundamentalists could want to import such horrors and such suffering to the United States - but I guess Christian fundamentalists do not watch movies like this.",great love story with meaningful ending,this story love marriage between hindu man mospem woman was very well done even though i could not get english subtitles work my dvd player i was able follow plot with little help package notes portrayal hindu moslem religious riots 1992 3 was very well done it was excellent portrayal violence horror bloodshed suffering so many such acts violence too many time periods too many reasons between too many groups people thing uppermost my mind was how christian fundamentalists could want import such horrors such suffering united states but i guess christian fundamentalists do not watch movies like this,0.44625000000000004,0.30062500000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.16}"

8.0,Perhaps the Best work of Fiction depicting Hindu-Muslim 1993 Riots and it's Communal Harmony..,"Bombay (1995) : Perhaps the Best work of Fiction depicting Hindu-Muslim 1993 Riots and it's Communal Harmony. Arvind Swami, Mani Ratnam and AR Rahman, the Classic Roja trio does it again with new sensational joining Manisha Koirala. Among all those films about Hindu-Muslim 1993 Riots i have seen, Bombay is perhaps the best work of Fiction included in real events. The topper of the list is none other than 'Black Friday' which was a non-fiction project. Bombay is a story of an eccentric couple, a Hindu man marries a muslim girl against the restrictions of guardians and settles in Bombay city. Later, the Babri Masjid incident make Bombay go frantic and riot between Hindus and Muslims takes over. The fictional characters of the film tries to make themselves look more genuine and communal friendly in the first half of the film. The love story, married life and birth of childrens almost wastes the first half and then Bombay truly goes on Riot mode in last 40 minutes. Mani Ratnam gets almost everything right from situations to consequences to human emotions to communal harmony and humanity emancipation. Bombay is more clever and cleaner film than his 'Roja', i don't have any complaints about the screenplay and structure as i had with Roja. AR Rahman goes on to deliver another quality music album besides the fact that Bombay lacks patriotic and harmony theme song. However, all the songs in the Film are fantastic. Choreography of the songs is unexpectedly brilliant. Every song uses the situations and moments correctly. Arvind Swami proves his metal again and Manisha Koirala shines equally despite a normal and sober character. Her presence in the climax scenes feels less and that's where I want to bash Mani Ratnam, not her because it's not her mistake. Rather than calling it a Classic I would say, Bombay is morever a Social Classic and far more important film than all other films of it's time. Mani Ratnam made this film exactly on time when it was needed despite the slight fear of the controversies it could have created. I can feel how people would have reacted and accepted Bombay in 1995 because many Indian citizens were still in shock of the consequences of riots. Dialogues will give you Goosebumps. Bombay doesn't really fall short of anything in its genre but if i really have to ask for something more which was missing then it's more Hard-hitting and Burning Climax. The film doesn't have any character of Saviour who should have at least tried to stop these things, it just goes on an goes on without anyone even trying to stop or restrict it. The other missing thing as i told you Heroine's presence in the last moments is too blur. As a Director Mani Ratnam has made a Powerful Social Film that might have brought change in some people's evil thinking for sure. I have seen his 5 films till date (Roja, Bombay, Dil Se, Guru, Raavan) and Bombay is by Far his Best Film. This is not a Classic but little more than it.RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest",perhaps best work fiction depicting hindu muslim 1993 riots its communal harmony,bombay 1995 perhaps best work fiction depicting hindu muslim 1993 riots its communal harmony arvind swami mani ratnam ar rahman classic roja trio does it again with new sensational joining manisha koirala among all those films about hindu muslim 1993 riots i have seen bombay is perhaps best work fiction included real events topper list is none other than black friday which was non fiction project bombay is story eccentric couple hindu man marries muslim girl against restrictions guardians settles bombay city later babri masjid incident make bombay go frantic riot between hindus muslims takes over fictional characters film tries make themselves look more genuine communal friendly first half film love story married life birth childrens almost wastes first half then bombay truly goes riot mode last 40 minutes mani ratnam gets almost everything right situations consequences human emotions communal harmony humanity emancipation bombay is more clever cleaner film than his roja i dont have any complaints about screenplay structure as i had with roja ar rahman goes deliver another quality music album besides fact that bombay lacks patriotic harmony theme song however all songs film are fantastic choreography songs is unexpectedly brilliant every song uses situations moments correctly arvind swami proves his metal again manisha koirala shines equally despite normal sober character her presence climax scenes feels less thats where i want bash mani ratnam not her because its not her mistake rather than calling it classic i would say bombay is morever social classic far more important film than all other films its time mani ratnam made this film exactly time when it was needed despite slight fear controversies it could have created i can feel how people would have reacted accepted bombay 1995 because many indian citizens were still shock consequences riots dialogues will give you goosebumps bombay doesnt really fall short anything its genre but if i really have ask something more which was missing then its more hard hitting burning climax film doesnt have any character saviour who should have at least tried stop these things it just goes goes without anyone even trying stop or restrict it other missing thing as i told you heroines presence last moments is too blur as director mani ratnam has made powerful social film that might have brought change some peoples evil thinking sure i have seen his 5 films till date roja bombay dil se guru raavan bombay is by far his best film this is not classic but little more than it rating 8 5 10 by,0.39532023532023536,0.17963453213453212,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.42}"

9.0,An outstanding film on riots: brilliant in story and technical aspects.....,"""Bombay"" raised a lot of controversies and saw a commercial success during its release. The film sets an example of a technical brilliance and superb handling of a heart touching story for which it stands out as one of the best achievements of 90s, which got pretty forgotten in the usual buddy buddy movies like ""Dilwale Dulhaniyan Le Jayenge"" or ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai."" The harshness and the human sentiments found in this movie haven't been so far achieved to this date.The film is set under the Hindu Muslim riots enraged in 1992-1993 which engulfed many innocent people and families. One such family shown in the movie is that of Arvind Swamy, a Hindu, and Manisha Koirala, a Muslim who get married despite the fury of their families as they belong to different religions. They have moved to Bombay from a small village of south India, and have a twin sons. The riot shatters the family, kills the parents in laws, and the couple search the lost children under the horror of riots where the people are slain in the light of day, houses burned and goods looted. The film ends with the end of the riots and uniting of the family.The horrors of the riots that mutilated the innocents were the best realized parts of the film. The film just disgusts showing the inhumane activities done in the name of religions, and criticizes the leaders who are killing hundreds of innocents enraging such riots. The film nowhere becomes mild in showing this, for which the film deserves a full commendation. Besides, the film remains outstanding for the brilliant performances and technical aspects. Manisha Koirala looks pretty, innocent, and just gives a beautiful and touching performance. So is Arvind Swami. The acting of Master Harsha and Hriday is full of innocence and touches you. Either the depiction of the beautiful village near the sea beaches or the terror of the riots, or the choreography of the song numbers, the film is excellent in every aspect of techniques.Rating: 4 stars out of 4",outstanding film riots brilliant story technical aspects,bombay raised lot controversies saw commercial success during its release film sets example technical brilliance superb handling heart touching story which it stands out as one best achievements 90s which got pretty forgotten usual buddy buddy movies like dilwale dulhaniyan le jayenge or kuch kuch hota hai harshness human sentiments found this movie havent been so far achieved this date film is set under hindu muslim riots enraged 1992 1993 which engulfed many innocent people families one such family shown movie is that arvind swamy hindu manisha koirala muslim who get married despite fury their families as they belong different religions they have moved bombay small village south india have twin sons riot shatters family kills parents laws couple search lost children under horror riots where people are slain light day houses burned goods looted film ends with end riots uniting family horrors riots that mutilated innocents were best realized parts film film just disgusts showing inhumane activities done name religions criticizes leaders who are killing hundreds innocents enraging such riots film nowhere becomes mild showing this which film deserves full commendation besides film remains outstanding brilliant performances technical aspects manisha koirala looks pretty innocent just gives beautiful touching performance so is arvind swami acting master harsha hriday is full innocence touches you either depiction beautiful village near sea beaches or terror riots or choreography song numbers film is excellent every aspect techniques rating 4 stars out 4,0.5608108108108109,0.3319819819819819,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"

I must admit I hadn't watched a hindi film since seeing Sholay and Qurbani when I was just a small child. the fake punches and over the top storylines were too much to stomach watching a Hindi film. Until I happened to see Bombay with my Aunt and cousin. Seeing this film opened my eyes to Hindi films again. I've been a fan ever since. sure there are still a lot of over the top movies in the Hindi film genre, but the gems are the best. This movie is comparable to any movie I've seen in English. This is a must see film.

10.0,Cant get better beyond this!,"A movie that shakes you to the core emotionally! And aided by what is classified as ""exceptionally great music"". When brilliant film making marries with exceptional music score, the result is BOMBAY!!

10.0,one of the best movies so far,"this is one of those movies that deserve so much more for what they have tried to show. Communal conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, how India(Bombay) suffered and burnt during the riots. The music is just AWESOME... A.R. Rehman is one of the most talented and gifted musicians of today. overall i rate this movie 10/10. just amazing. The movie is in a south Indian language dubbed in Hindi. a very sensitive issue that needs attention in India even in the present times. the movie also has a funny side to it in some parts between the in-laws. there are a thousand movies made in India every year but only a handful of them are worth a mention and this one is one of them. made with so much of sentiments to pass the point clearly and directly to the audience as they are the ones who can bring about a change in the thinking of the society and they better do.",one best movies so far,this is one those movies that deserve so much more what they have tried show communal conflicts between hindus muslims how india bombay suffered burnt during riots music is just awesome r rehman is one most talented gifted musicians today overall i rate this movie 10 10 just amazing movie is south indian language dubbed hindi very sensitive issue that needs attention india even present times movie also has funny side it some parts between laws there are thousand movies made india every year but only handful them are worth mention this one is one them made with so much sentiments pass point clearly directly audience as they are ones who can bring about change thinking society they better do,0.6058823529411765,0.37529411764705883,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.25}"
3.0,Totally crap,"This one is among the worst Mani Ratnam movies I have seen. Not that Mani Ratnam is a great director in my opinion - he's just among the better ones in Bollywood full of third rate directors. But this movie has nothing to commend itself. The movie is supposed to be based on historical incidents, but there is no accuracy in any of the incidents depicted. I would rather read Times of India. It's a totally crap commercial movie, trying to find balance in the 1992/93 massacre, where there was no balance shown by Shiv Sena government or the police force in Mumbai. In a supposedly serious movie, there are unbelievable number of trash and irrelevant songs and dances. While the riot scenes are being shown, there is a background song on the virtues of unity and harmony. Total waste of 3 hours.",totally crap,this one is among worst mani ratnam movies i have seen not that mani ratnam is great director my opinion hes just among better ones bollywood full third rate directors but this movie has nothing commend itself movie is supposed be based historical incidents but there is no accuracy any incidents depicted i would rather read times india its totally crap commercial movie trying find balance 1992 93 massacre where there was no balance shown by shiv sena government or police force mumbai supposedly serious movie there are unbelievable number trash irrelevant songs dances while riot scenes are being shown there is background song virtues unity harmony total waste 3 hours,0.5583333333333333,-0.15952380952380954,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.52}"

9.0,A real drama about communal strife in India.,I myself was a victim of Hindu Muslim riot while living in Dhaka and this film reminded me in vivid details of what happens in real life during a communal riot. The film is a masterpiece in a sense that conflict between and muslims in India is so prevalent and common occurrence and for all these years with hundreds of movies made I have finally found one that dealt with this issue in real terms. The story is about Shekhar Mishra ( Arvind Swamy ) falling in love with Shaila Bano ( Monisha Koirala ) a Muslim girl and eventually marrying her without the blessing of their parents on both sides. They settle in Bombay where Shekhar works as reporter and have twin boys. The story is written in the backdrop of the Auyodha mosque attack during the 1990's and a communal riots breaks out. The director Mani Ratnam has handled the story very well with realistic scenes of the riot with the burning of vehicles and rampant killing on the streets as well as the chaos and confusion of the people and the government. Both Arvind Swamy and Monisha Koirala gave commendable performance in the two leading roles with good support from the others. The music and cinematography is above average. This is a good film to watch . I gave it a nine out of ten.,real drama about communal strife india,i myself was victim hindu muslim riot while living dhaka this film reminded me vivid details what happens real life during communal riot film is masterpiece sense that conflict between muslims india is so prevalent common occurrence all these years with hundreds movies made i have finally found one that dealt with this issue real terms story is about shekhar mishra arvind swamy falling love with shaila bano monisha koirala muslim girl eventually marrying her without blessing their parents both sides they settle bombay where shekhar works as reporter have twin boys story is written backdrop auyodha mosque attack during 1990s communal riots breaks out director mani ratnam has handled story very well with realistic scenes riot with burning vehicles rampant killing streets as well as chaos confusion people government both arvind swamy monisha koirala gave commendable performance two leading roles with good support others music cinematography is above average this is good film watch i gave it nine out ten,0.40888888888888886,0.16444444444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
