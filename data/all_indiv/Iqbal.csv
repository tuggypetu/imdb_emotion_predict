10.0,A great feel good movie,"This is all about chasing your dreams, no matter what the obstacles. The movie is funny in a subtle way and the acting is brilliant. It is rare that such gems come out of the Indian Film industry. Overall a refresher amongst the crap which normally plays in theaters.The story involves a young deaf and dumb boy who is crazy about cricket, and how he hides behind buffaloes to watch a coaching camp and learn bowling. Eventually he finds a teacher in a failed cricketer(played by Nassiruding shah) who leaves his drinking habit and makes it his personal battle to place Iqbal in the Indian cricket team.This movie also touches upon the corruption in the selection system and commercialization of cricket.",great feel good movie,this is all about chasing your dreams no matter what obstacles movie is funny subtle way acting is brilliant it is rare that such gems come out indian film industry overall refresher amongst crap which normally plays theaters story involves young deaf dumb boy who is crazy about cricket how he hides behind buffaloes watch coaching camp learn bowling eventually he finds teacher failed cricketer played by nassiruding shah who leaves his drinking habit makes it his personal battle place iqbal indian cricket team this movie also touches upon corruption selection system commercialization cricket,0.5444444444444445,0.007870370370370337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,iqbal-a winner,"Iqbal doesn't require those plain, ch..ya reviews but aggressive reviews. Call it a bouncer, a sixer, a century, whatever. The experience is as exhilarating. Welcome new cinema. Welcome Iqbal. A movie devoted to a criminally ignored aspect of cricket called bowling with so much of spunk, style, freshness, novelty and surprises that even those not interested in game find it simply irresistible. It has all the aces. Firstly, amazing stories and people happening in small towns too who are crying to be a part of mainstream but nobody really took notice of them. No need to add situational/ item numbers (read non situational)songs or beautiful bimbettes in the name of ""heroines"". Instead a brother-sister combo is remarkably portrayed. And when it starts talking cricket-the game, the passion, the technique, the struggle, the pain, the politics, the victory, everything beautifully woven interspersed in between in subtle humor such that it all looks as real as life itself in flesh and blood. The honors should equally be shared by background score, songs, cinematography, editing (especially), sound design and script. All performances are first rate. Ultimately, and at last a director's film-Nagesh Kukunoor's best among his six and not to forget a superb one coming from producers mukta arts years after. Three cheers. Now few Grey areas. The film slightly looses its crispness in certain parts such as-Iqbal trying hard to get Naseer to coach him; the struggle Iqbal went through after inducted in Ranji Team and lastly the film ends on a slightly abrupt note. But all these are minor diversions. Lastly, a word of advice to established set ups tried and tested, star-studded, NRI romances format of film making. Please step aside. Your turn is over. A New dawn has set. A New player in the offing. Indian films finally finding their identity. Undoubtedly, the best film released so far this year, year 2005 will be remembered for Iqbal and likes. And Box office. F... box office. To those conventional distributors, being a modest budget film it is an easy break even so you GTH (go to hell) Also, if Tax free status is not granted sooner to this film then it is better to abolish this system of promotion via tax-free.

8.0,Take a bow Nagesh Kukunoor,"Everybody wants to see the underdog triumph. But what we Don't want to see in the process is unnecessary over-the-top pity/sympathy created for the underdog. Nagesh Kukunoor understands this. He gives us the kind of cinema which is entertaining, simple and intelligent. The plot itself is simple but it's always difficult to keep it simple and yet entertain. ""Iqbal"" achieves this. The moment we see Iqbal(played wonderfully by Shreyas Talpade) with his rag-tag ""kit bag"" slung over his shoulders,carrying it like it was his most prized possession and steaming in bare feet with that look in his eyes, we want him to win. We want him to knock the socks out of the opponent (batsmen, wheeler-dealer coaches and anyone who's in his way), we want to see the world recognize him. That's what ""iqbal"" does to you. Iqbal's journey ( I wouldn't call it a struggle because the triumph was in his journey) takes us into his village with its rustic dusty backgrounds, buffaloes named after cricketers and a drunk ex-almost-was Naseeruddin Shah, not to mention his family. Shreyas Talpade holds his own against Naseer who seems as though he just woke up drunk in a haystack and carried on from there without knowing there was a film crew around him. Shweta Prasad as Iqbal's sister is just gifted, she brings a maturity to her character which is beyond her age, outstanding. The cricket part is handled very effectively and doesn't look amateurish.The dirt behind the selection process, you-help-me-i'll-help you situations is shown well although Kukunoor solves it simply as well. It might just be a tad more complicated than that in the real Indian cricket world. Nagesh Kukunoor seems to be growing as a film maker with each movie. His ""Teen Deewarein"" was splendid and Iqbal is a step further in the right direction. He has handled the potentially could-have-been-overdone story to a nicety and manages to bring out the emotions without the usual "" look at me, i'm all pitiable and lovable"" stuff. Iqbal isn't pitiable, but he sure is lovable.",take bow nagesh kukunoor,everybody wants see underdog triumph but what we dont want see process is unnecessary over top pity sympathy created underdog nagesh kukunoor understands this he gives us kind cinema which is entertaining simple intelligent plot itself is simple but its always difficult keep it simple yet entertain iqbal achieves this moment we see iqbal played wonderfully by shreyas talpade with his rag tag kit bag slung over his shoulders carrying it like it was his most prized possession steaming bare feet with that look his eyes we want him win we want him knock socks out opponent batsmen wheeler dealer coaches anyone whos his way we want see world recognize him thats what iqbal does you iqbals journey i wouldnt call it struggle because triumph was his journey takes us into his village with its rustic dusty backgrounds buffaloes named after cricketers drunk ex almost was naseeruddin shah not mention his family shreyas talpade holds his own against naseer who seems as though he just woke up drunk haystack carried there without knowing there was film crew around him shweta prasad as iqbals sister is just gifted she brings maturity her character which is beyond her age outstanding cricket part is handled very effectively doesnt look amateurish dirt behind selection process you help me ill help you situations is shown well although kukunoor solves it simply as well it might just be tad more complicated than that real indian cricket world nagesh kukunoor seems be growing as film maker with each movie his teen deewarein was splendid iqbal is step further right direction he has handled potentially could have been overdone story nicety manages bring out emotions without usual look at me im all pitiable lovable stuff iqbal isnt pitiable but he sure is lovable,0.6467940685045948,0.16313283208020046,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,A Simple Heartwarming Story About Hope And Glory,"'Iqbal' is a charming down-to-earth film directed by one of today's finest directors Nagesh Kukunoor. The story revolves around a deaf and mute young man who dreams of becoming a cricketer. It boasts of a talented cast that includes Naseeruddin Shah (awesome), Girish Karnad (very good), Shreyas Talpade (natural), Shweta Prasad (natural), Yatin Karyekar (decent) and Prateeksha Lonkar (sublime) all delivering memorable performances. Cinematography is excellent and gives a realistic spacious feel to the village setting. Music is awesome and background score is very pleasant as it contributes to the mood. I especially like the uplifting song, 'Aashayein'.On the downside, Kapil Dev's appearance is annoying as he can't act and his presence doesn't add anything. Some may feel that the story has been done numerous times before but in my opinion Kukunoor's treatment and execution gives it a unique touch. For example, I loved how he portrayed the relationship between the mother and her children and the two siblings. The chemistry between the actors only make their interactions more real. This is also one of the few films that focuses on the sibling relationship. Iqbal's sister is not the typical Bollywood 'behen' who runs around screaming 'bhaiyya bhaiyya' (brother brother). Actually all the characters are very well written.'Iqbal's main strength is its soul. This is a must see for everyone and one that can be watched with the family. It's an uplifting movie that brings a smile to the face. Always believe in your dreams and have faith in yourself to make them come true. And to parents, always believe in your children's dreams and capability. That's 'Iqbal'.",simple heartwarming story about hope glory,iqbal is charming down earth film directed by one todays finest directors nagesh kukunoor story revolves around deaf mute young man who dreams becoming cricketer it boasts talented cast that includes naseeruddin shah awesome girish karnad very good shreyas talpade natural shweta prasad natural yatin karyekar decent prateeksha lonkar sublime all delivering memorable performances cinematography is excellent gives realistic spacious feel village setting music is awesome background score is very pleasant as it contributes mood i especially like uplifting song aashayein downside kapil devs appearance is annoying as he cant act his presence doesnt add anything some may feel that story has been done numerous times before but my opinion kukunoors treatment execution gives it unique touch example i loved how he portrayed relationship between mother her children two siblings chemistry between actors only make their interactions more real this is also one few films that focuses sibling relationship iqbals sister is not typical bollywood behen who runs around screaming bhaiyya bhaiyya brother brother actually all characters are very well written iqbals main strength is its soul this is must see everyone one that can be watched with family its uplifting movie that brings smile face always believe your dreams have faith yourself make them come true parents always believe your childrens dreams capability thats iqbal,0.6277214541730672,0.308584229390681,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Funny and inspiring Fairy tale,"Iqbal is all about a young village lad in northern India, who eats,sleeps and thinks cricket. His only goal in life is to play for the Indian team. A few obstacles in his path, he is deaf and dumb.. He is poor and cannot afford standard training. His father is not ready to let his son ruin his life in pursuit of a day dream. He does have a few strengths. He can bowl real fast, and has great support from his mother and sister. There is also a village drunkard (ex-bowler for the state team) who will be coaching him. The story here is about how he fights all odds. While the story sounds very normal and often repeated, it is the taking of the movie that is brilliant. The cinematography is very simple. The rural village setting reminded me of the village where I grew up. The dialogues are witty and realistic without any dose of melodrama/sobs/tears. They seem to be inspired by ""The Alchemist"". The background score and the song are cool, and flow with the movie. There is no self-pity or ""I-am-disabled-sohelp-me"" kind of emotion. In fact, his disability ceases to be a factor within 10 minutes of the movie. The movie is very inspiring and entertaining. The acting is first rate. Nagesh Kukunoor (director) makes a good movie about cricket and great movie about ""How not to give up what you like?"".",funny inspiring fairy tale,iqbal is all about young village lad northern india who eats sleeps thinks cricket his only goal life is play indian team few obstacles his path he is deaf dumb he is poor cannot afford standard training his father is not ready let his son ruin his life pursuit day dream he does have few strengths he can bowl real fast has great support his mother sister there is also village drunkard ex bowler state team who will be coaching him story here is about how he fights all odds while story sounds very normal often repeated it is taking movie that is brilliant cinematography is very simple rural village setting reminded me village where i grew up dialogues are witty realistic without any dose melodrama sobs tears they seem be inspired by alchemist background score song are cool flow with movie there is no self pity or i am disabled sohelp me kind emotion fact his disability ceases be factor within 10 minutes movie movie is very inspiring entertaining acting is first rate nagesh kukunoor director makes good movie about cricket great movie about how not give up what you like,0.537531746031746,0.18788888888888888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.23}"

Yes, this movie is exactly what the abundance of word of mouth on it asserts - the best movie of this year.I don't think this is a great movie, it's just that it is so rare to see a film that works in Bollywood, which does not come from a masala genre, that works simply as a straightforward story - that this film looks all the better compared to the awful field it competes with.Iqbal brings a smile to the face and a tear to the eye and a lump to the throat and a racing of the heartbeat in slight twist and sweet turn and more than makes up for the time and money it takes to invest in watching a film - much more than that.Nagesh Kukunoor's minimalist narration (enhanced by rousing music by the creative genius duo of Salim Sulaiman) that we saw in his earlier films is here perfect - the rustic ambiance of the film seems to pervade the storytelling too.The film reminded me of Million Dollar Baby and Shwaas at times - MDB, because of the minimalism & struggle against odds; Shwaas, because of the sweetness of the tale.Lovely, lovely film.",exactly what abundance word mouth asserts best movie this year,watched iqbal yesterday yes this movie is exactly what abundance word mouth it asserts best movie this year i dont think this is great movie its just that it is so rare see film that works bollywood which does not come masala genre that works simply as straightforward story that this film looks all better compared awful field it competes with iqbal brings smile face tear eye lump throat racing heartbeat slight twist sweet turn more than makes up time money it takes invest watching film much more than that nagesh kukunoors minimalist narration enhanced by rousing music by creative genius duo salim sulaiman that we saw his earlier films is here perfect rustic ambiance film seems pervade storytelling too film reminded me million dollar baby shwaas at times mdb because minimalism struggle against odds shwaas because sweetness tale lovely lovely film,0.5548245614035089,0.3925438596491228,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,A cricket Saga,"IQBAL is an excellent movie by Nagesh Kuknoor. His earlier film HYDERBAD BLUES was also good film thematically and in characterization.but had rather loose screen play. But this time he has written a very tight screen play and he has chosen excellent actors . It is a story of an aspiring bowler in a village. This shows clearly that to reach the top is not a plum to be taken but to shed sweat and tears. The relations ship between the deaf and mute bowling aspirant (Shreyas Talpade) and the school going sister(Shweta Prasad) was etched beautifully. In some scenes the film reminded me of that excellent Iranian film ""The Children of Heaven"" by Mohammad Amir Naji. The boy takes the help of an old cricketer who has gone to seed and Nasiruddin Shah etched this role beautifully as Mohit. The story is down to earth with father not very happy with what he thinks unattainable ambitions of the son but the boy is strongly supported by mother and sister. The ambiance was typical village atmosphere and the house a normal village Muslim family -may not be affluent but not below the poverty line. This is a family drama not the rubbish those come out of Kollywood. All in all a memorable film and Kuknoor graduated to almost world class.The film I remember was sent for Oscar. Though this was not nominated Kuknoor is approaching Oscar level.",cricket saga,iqbal is excellent movie by nagesh kuknoor his earlier film hyderbad blues was also good film thematically characterization but had rather loose screen play but this time he has written very tight screen play he has chosen excellent actors it is story aspiring bowler village this shows clearly that reach top is not plum be taken but shed sweat tears relations ship between deaf mute bowling aspirant shreyas talpade school going sister shweta prasad was etched beautifully some scenes film reminded me that excellent iranian film children heaven by mohammad amir naji boy takes help old cricketer who has gone seed nasiruddin shah etched this role beautifully as mohit story is down earth with father not very happy with what he thinks unattainable ambitions son but boy is strongly supported by mother sister ambiance was typical village atmosphere house normal village muslim family may not be affluent but not below poverty line this is family drama not rubbish those come out kollywood all all memorable film kuknoor graduated almost world class film i remember was sent oscar though this was not nominated kuknoor is approaching oscar level,0.6357722832722832,0.34471764346764344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8.0,Very classy Flick,"I went to this movie just today. I heard great reviews from everybody and I finally watched it today. Nagesh Kukunoor has the knack of coming up with some good films, especially off late after Teen Deewarein(Which was brilliant). This movie I think is another feather in his cap. This story is about a deaf mute, Iqbal (Shreyas Talpade), who lives in the small village of Kolipad and dreams of becoming a great cricketer. His father is totally against his love for the game but his mother and sister push him towards his dream. Iqbal is first coached by a devious Girish Karnad, who ditches him for a rich kid. His only refuge is the village drunk Mohit(played brilliantly by Naseeruddin Shah), a former Ranji cricketer. The relationship between Iqbal and Mohit is beautifully brought out on screen. Iqbal's sister (played by Shweta) also gives a brilliant performance. But the cherry on the cake belongs to Naseeruddin Shah. His charm is infectious. He breathes life into the character of Mohit with effortless ease. Shreyas Talpade has also brought in a very good performance. He has really emoted very well and has done justice to his role as the deaf mute. The actor playing Iqbal's father also does a very good job. I think this movie is for the masses as well as the classes. It will be enjoyed by one and all. As the movie's bylane rightly puts it.

9.0,"Remarkable, Outstanding, Astonishing and Unpretentious","An inspiring and thought provoking tale of a specially abled lad's passion to realize his only dream of being part of the national cricket team. This is a gold dust of cinema, one of the finest you would ever come across by. Indeed, Nagesh Kukunoor deserves a big round of applause for this spectacle, a feat that he successfully achieves in his next project (Dor) as well.Anybody among us can dream big but those who realize those dreams are the special ones, right! And what would you call that person who has been written off by many since birth and yet goes on to achieve what he has always dreamed of? EXCEPTIONAL; maybe it is an understatement but yes.As they say, behind every successful man there is a woman, and well Iqbal (a very challenging role portrayed with ease and grace by Shreyas Talpade) had two backing him in his endeavor, his mother and his ever supportive and caring little sister, Khadija (a character brilliantly portrayed by Sweta Basu). Obviously family support is good for moral boost up but it just isn't going to be enough without a well drunk, sorry! a well experienced coach (Nasseruddin Shah's portrayal of this character is surely going to have a lasting impact. He lightened the screen every time with his presence. Pure brilliance!).And for all those who have started to question their choice of watching this movie because of the fact that you do not understand cricket, then let me just tell you - You don't need to understand cricket at all to enjoy this because becoming a national cricket player is used as a synonym in this movie for a dream that is just too big in the eyes of the society for a lad like him).I watched this movie when I was a teenager and I have to admit that this movie forever changed my perception of cinema.

8.0,Must watch movie!!,"Iqbal is not exactly a award-winning work but it is definitely very well-made with the typical Nagesh Kukunoor stamp on it. After Hyderabad Blues, Bollywood Calling and Rockford this is the fourth movie from Kukunoor that I have watched and appreciated. Kukunoor has the knack of picking up the simplest possible theme and turning them into beautifully narrated stories studded with mundane incidents interwoven into a coherent theme. The key is the treatment of the story which Kukunoor executes in a truly unique style. The focus is never on the message; in-fact one can hardly draw a message from any of his movies. Instead what comes out of his movies is the joy one can draw from insignificant everyday events, the little pleasures of life. They seem to emanate the aroma of life often transporting you back into your past, reminding you of the childhood dreams, adolescent crushes, and the dilemmas of youth. The protagonist in each of his movies is an individual on the path of some sort of self-discovery. While Hyderabad Blues saw a NRI returning to his roots in India only to get more confused, in Bollywood Calling a Hollywood actor finds the strength to fight cancer while working for a B-grade Hindi movie. Rockford went into the psychology of a boy who is getting exposed to the vagaries presented by the transformation from childhood to youth. Iqbal is a similar tale though much larger than this. It talks about an ordinary young man, someone who is simply unexceptional in the normal sense except for his talent and undying passion for sports. That this game happens to be cricket is not important; the movie would have remained the same had it been built around some other sport. Though with cricket being at the center stage, the movie is more likely to attract the Indian audience. Another twist thrown in is that the main character, Iqbal (played by Shreyas Talpade), is deaf and dumb. This does not contribute much to the storyline except increase the complexity a bit. But it does sharpen the contrast between the underdog and the privileged. Secondly, while giving out the message that ""impossible is possible"", the 'impossible' is much more accentuated. It also challenges our preconceived notions regarding the physically handicapped people. Lastly it also adds some drollery in the storyline. Here I must stress that though from the face of it the movie appears a heavy, gloomy portray of the struggle of an underprivileged,this is far from true. The plot, the characters and the ending have a very unconventional touch and in the end it leaves one with a positive feeling. The story is about a young man Iqbal living in a village with his parents and a younger sister. Iqbal is deaf and dumb but he has inherited the determination and resolve of his father. He has also inherited something from his mother- a deep love for cricket. And this is not just empty craze. Not having been able to get good education and being forced to work with his father as a farmer, he has somehow been able to give vent to his love for the game by practicing it all alone, with buffaloes as the only audience!! His only learning has happened through eaves-dropping on the coaching sessions at the nets run by an esteemed coach (Girish Karnad), with the lessons translated by his sister into sign language. The routine continues till one day Iqbal's sister gets bored of the 'translator's job' and approaches the coach with the request of taking his brother in his academy. The coach holds an entrance test of sorts and is impressed with the young man's raw energy. This starts the grooming process for Iqbal as he starts to learn the art of fast bowling in the academy along with several other students. But as it turns out, Iqbal has an ego-clash with a fellow-student who was the son of an influential person and was thrown out of the academy. Hope turned into despair and Iqbal slowly started giving up the dreams of playing cricket. And then one day he discovered another guru (played by Naseeruddin Shah), a drunkard who at one time had been a promising player whose career never took off all because of the dirty politics played by his coach, the same person from whose academy Iqbal was ousted. He is the only ray of hope to Iqbal who insists on learning the game from him despite refusal. The coach finally relents even though he is not sure what to expect out of all this trouble. But the subsequent experience takes both of them to a challenging journey where one has to face the resistance put up by his oppressive father who is totally opposed to his son's involvement in the game and the other has a mini-battle of sorts with his habit of drinking and also has to fight with the baggage of his own dismal past. In the end after a dramatic turn of events Iqbal manages to get selected to the national cricket team, in the event beating his jealous opponent of the academy and the trickery of his former coach. The film ends at this point and I must admit that this is one of the most well-timed endings I have seen lately. The film has lot of memorable scenes and dialogs, my favorite one being when, during a conversation with the alcoholic coach, Iqbal's mother says nonchalantly that if her son is not selected for the Indian team then ""I will kill you"". The background score is good though not brilliant. The cast of the film seems to fit the bill perfectly. Shweta Prasad, who plays Iqbal's younger sister, is an amazing child actress. I have earlier seen her as playing the roles of diametrically opposite twins in another Hindi movie Makdi. Naseeruddin Shah and Girish Karnad are brilliant as are Prateeksha Londkar (Iqbal's mother) and Yatin Karyekar (the father).

9.0,One of the best!,"Iqbal tells the amazing story of a teenage boy (Shreyas Talpade) baring the same name, who is deaf and mute but has more talent, spirit and drive for life than ten regular boys his age. Though he is unable to express himself vocally, his mother prays to God for some sort of sign and God sends the family an angel, a young girl named Khadija (played by the devastatingly talented Shweta Prasad) the younger sister to Iqbal who becomes his mouthpiece, his interpreter as well as the initial person who boosts his confidence and jump starts his career in cricketing. Of course nothing will be complete without the normal obstacles that accompany life, first things first is Iqbal's father who is against the sport known as cricket. That is followed by the lengths the rest of the family has to go to to keep their love of the sport as well as their support of Iqbal's dream secret from him. Not to mention the fact that when Iqbal finally gets into the training camp for cricketers, he gets into a quarrel with an annoying rich kid which in turns gets him(Iqbal) kicked out of the camp. Down and devastated, Iqbal is on the verge of giving up his dream when he discovers a picture of an old friend in a magazine and realises that the old drunk he normally feeds scraps to along his way to and fro herding buffaloes is a former cricket player who must have fallen off along the way. With the help of his skeptical sister, they nurse the drunkard (who by the way is played by Naseeruddin Shah in a very outstanding performance) back to health and he in turn reluctantly agrees to train Iqbal. More trials and tribulations come their way en route success, but nothing can stop the fireball that is Iqbal! I loved the soundtrack as well.

7.0,Certainly not your typical Indian film.,"Iqbal is a young deaf man in this film. Despite this, he has a dream to one day play cricket--a national obsession in his native India. But he's never played on a team and his father doesn't want his boy 'wasting his time' playing sports. So, with his little sister as his interpreter, Iqbal works hard to hone his skills and try to get a break. He is able to get one of the important coaches in the country to see him, but this coach turns out to be very politically motivated. So, even though Iqbal might be the best, he won't give the guy a break. So, it's up to Iqbal to get someone else to train him--and all he can find is an alcoholic ex-player. Can Iqbal defy the odds and find a place on the state or national team?In some ways this is a very unconventional film. After all, the story is about a deaf guy. But, it is VERY conventional in most other ways--with the various controversies and hurdles Iqbal needs to overcome, it sure seems to follow a very traditional sports film formula. However, it's important to point out that you don't need to understand cricket (after all, NO ONE understands the game outside of the nations where it's played). Also, while I am reasonably fluent in sign language, I couldn't follow most of the signing. Either they use a different system in India (the most likely answer) or the actors are signing nonsense-- I'd love to know which is the case. I do know that the British system (which probably influenced the Indian one) isn't much like American signing.",certainly not your typical indian film,iqbal is young deaf man this film despite this he has dream one day play cricket national obsession his native india but hes never played team his father doesnt want his boy wasting his time playing sports so with his little sister as his interpreter iqbal works hard hone his skills try get break he is able get one important coaches country see him but this coach turns out be very politically motivated so even though iqbal might be best he wont give guy break so its up iqbal get someone else train him all he can find is alcoholic ex player can iqbal defy odds find place state or national team some ways this is very unconventional film after all story is about deaf guy but it is very conventional most other ways with various controversies hurdles iqbal needs overcome it sure seems follow very traditional sports film formula however its important point out that you dont need understand cricket after all no one understands game outside nations where its played also while i am reasonably fluent sign language i couldnt follow most signing either they use different system india most likely answer or actors are signing nonsense id love know which is case i do know that british system which probably influenced indian one isnt much like american signing,0.5007334428024083,0.13056239737274222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.44}"
6.0,Neat and simplistic take on life,"This movie builds up a nice ethos by using a child protagonist as main character. That he's a budding cricketer who has to overcome a physical handicap along with the nearly impossible overall odds of selection, only adds to his sparse attributes and makes him even more endearing.Having said that, the movie could have taken it up a notch in certain places where it loses steam. For instance, its bad enough to convince a coach, let alone an ex-cricketer who's an acknowledged loser, to get up and give you lessons. BUt there's more than one way to skin the cat. In most cities, towns and villages all over India, what is practiced is a sport called ""galli cricket"" (playing in a lane or road with zero or no traffic). That is how many a cricketer (Sachin?) was born. Very few of the youngsters have access to proper coaching, let alone an academy.The plot seems to have been based on Shwaas (little boy's final hurray before sinking into darkness) and Bend It Like Beckham (battling all of the usual resistances). However, Iqbal shines on its own merit and had there been a wider percolation amongst the cine-going audiences, in all probability it would have been a winner at the BO too. Although its a low-budget picture, it doesn't seem to scrimp on technical aspects nor on production values. But the Muslim angle was unnecessary. Again, its triply impossible for a minority, deaf-and-mute, village kid to chase the dream that Iqbal does.Some scenes and dialogs (state selection process) remind you of Kevin Costner's ""Field of Dreams"". Overall, its an enjoyable film. Well done, Nagesh Kukunoor, after Hyderabad Blues, Teen Deewarein, etc. In movies as in cricket, what matters is a unique style, pace and rhythm.",neat simplistic take life,this movie builds up nice ethos by using child protagonist as main character that hes budding cricketer who has overcome physical handicap along with nearly impossible overall odds selection only adds his sparse attributes makes him even more endearing having said that movie could have taken it up notch certain places where it loses steam instance its bad enough convince coach let alone ex cricketer whos acknowledged loser get up give you lessons but theres more than one way skin cat most cities towns villages all over india what is practiced is sport called galli cricket playing lane or road with zero or no traffic that is how many cricketer sachin was born very few youngsters have access proper coaching let alone academy plot seems have been based shwaas little boys final hurray before sinking into darkness bend it like beckham battling all usual resistances however iqbal shines its own merit had there been wider percolation amongst cine going audiences all probability it would have been winner at bo too although its low budget picture it doesnt seem scrimp technical aspects nor production values but muslim angle was unnecessary again its triply impossible minority deaf mute village kid chase dream that iqbal does some scenes dialogs state selection process remind you kevin costners field dreams overall its enjoyable film well done nagesh kukunoor after hyderabad blues teen deewarein etc movies as cricket what matters is unique style pace rhythm,0.49658986175115205,0.036294162826420895,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.33}"

7.0,"Unabashedly manipulative, but still has a certain charm","Writer-director Nagesh Kukunoor clearly was inspired by John G. Avildsen. Watching ""Iqbal,"" it doesn't take one long to realize that this film takes elements of Avildsen's ""Rocky"" (1976) and ""The Karate Kid"" (1984) and mixes them with India and cricket.It helps a little bit to know something about cricket. At least, to know about the obsession young men growing up in the Indian subcontinent have about the game. Students skip school to watch international matches. Transistor radios come out in full force to listen to commentaries. And you can see crowds gathered outside TV stores and on corners watching or listening to the game.""Iqbal"" wears its heart on its sleeve and isn't ashamed about it. There's nothing particularly novel about this film. You know exactly how it will turn out - after all, it is a feel-good movie. But still the film has a certain undeniable charm.The film lacks the sheer giddiness of, say, ""Lagaan"" (2001). But ""Iqbal"" is buoyed by some pleasant performances, interesting characters and it can't help but bring a smile to your face. Shreyas Talpade is awfully convincing as the titular character, though he is given to moments of over-acting, especially during crucial scenes when Iqbal finds his dreams fading away.On the other hand, the film's best surprise is the performance by Shweta Prasad as Iqbal's little sister, a young girl who makes it her goal in life to ensure her mute brother fulfills his dream. It's young Prasad who brings the film to life. She gives her character the right amount of spunk and attitude; there's nothing unnatural about this young girl's performance. She's funny when she needs to be, serious when she ought to be.""Iqbal"" is all about making the audience feel good about itself. There are no real surprises, plot wise, in the film. There are the usual villains, just as there were in ""The Karate Kid."" In ""Iqbal,"" it's the cricket academy coach and his star player, Kamal (Aadash Balakrishna). Notice parallels to Avildsen's drama?Even the ending is a foregone conclusion long before it arrives.

9.0,Do you need words to describe this miracle?,"Iqbal is a deaf mute boy boy from a small town but with huge dreams - he wants to play in the Indian cricket team. What, another silly cricket fantasy? Absolutely not, this one is a heartwarming tale of the real struggle to beat all odds and achieve one's dream. There is no larger than life scenario, no desire do good, just to try to be what one has dreamed of being. Iqbal is played with great gusto by Shreyas Talpade - a young man to watch out for. In fact after his sixer in Iqbal he scored big again in Dor - so the talent is consistent. Girish Karnad played the worldly wise and manipulative Guruji who sees promise in Iqbal but has to watch out for his own interests. The character of the film was Mohit, the has been cricket player who is also the town drunk - no one but Naseer could have essayed this role with such perfection. After ages one saw a brother sister due that was real and tugged at the heartstrings, Shweta Prasad was brilliant as Khadija, the sister, who believes in her brother's greatness.If there were some faults they were only two in my opinion. Why was the father so fanatically opposed to cricket? Nagesh tries to explain that in the end but it was still far short of a reasonable explanation. Secondly, what were all these people with cricket expertise doing in that two horse town?The film is brilliantly situated in locales that are so real you can smell the dirt. The background score is very effective as are the minimal songs in the films. Kudos to Mr. Kukunoor for taking the hackneyed topic of cricket and weaving a brilliant tale around it.

10.0,"All Successful people have got one thing in common, they have a burning desire.","India is one of those nations in world where people are simply obsessed with Cricket. So it is only natural that once in a while you will find some movies where Cricket plays a role. There was stumped, Malamaal, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Lagaan and now Iqbal.Iqbal is important because it comes from the house of Subhash Ghai, who is know to do movies on the scripts he believes in. The script of Iqbal is not a script, it is a dream of a young man who wants to make it big in the world of Cricket. He wants to get in the Indian National Team.There are parents like Anwar who believes playing cricket is wastage of time and money. He believes nation is losing millions of work hours for Cricket. Everyone else in his family including his wife & daughter doesn't agree with him. This is the family where Iqbal was born.he was deaf and dumb bu birth. From his birth he shared the dream of his mother and sister of cricket. He never let his handicap overshadow his dream.He would take the buffaloes to the field and watch kids playing cricket in a local club. He would watch them being trained by a renowned guruji. When Guruji finds about Iqbal's interest in cricket, he decides to train him. But when dispute arises in the team, Iqbal is thrown out of the club. Iqbal is disheartened but doesn't give up. He finds another mentor in Mohit who was a cricketer once upon a time but couldn't handle the politics in cricket and gave up his career and was drown in alcohols. His coaching makes him qualify for Andhra Pradesh team for a Ranji match. The match is won by Andhra a rather inconsequential team and Iqbal is noticed by selectors.But then Anwar refuses to let Iqbal play the Ranji match and ask him to help him in farm.

,Boundary!!!,"Honestly I was a bit sceptical about ""Iqbal"" primarily because it was backed by Mukta Arts which is known to play spoil-sport with too much interference by the self-proclaimed ""Showman"" leading to dilution of original creativity of director (no, I am not making any references to Mukul Anand  May your soul R.I.P).Nevertheless, you do see our beloved director's style undergone a change.... for starters songs are incorporated, the screenplay is appealing and camera-work is smooth.Though the story skirts around cricket not a single moment you think it's a manipulative move by Kukunoor to cash on the national craze. IMO honestly, if the story was based around any other sport  it would have fared equally well.As usual with Kukunoor, the script is the king and this movie is no exception. The subtle humour as always with Kukunoor's movie is sprinkled adequately. The movie does expose a few manipulations, favourites and the power play by the high and mighty.Every character in the movie is there for a purpose and they carry off their parts with full vigour.Girish Karnad and late Naseeruddin Shah need no comments on their acting. However it seems off late Naseeruddin Shah has joined the fold as Kukunoor's regulars next to Vikram Inamdar and Elahe Hiptoola.Shreyas Talpade gets into the skin of the character and is a convincing cricket freak ""Iqbal"" who is supported by his on-screen mother Prateeksha Lonkar.

The awards this movie has won are not a reflection on how great this film is, but rather how much the rest of the films coming out of Bollywood lack originality.Iqbal is a feel good movie. It has an original story and an original (if limited) screenplay. It also boasts some new actors.The story is about a young deaf and dumb boy who struggles to make it to the International Cricket Team in India. What does the film lack? Reason. It lacks a reason for the main character being a mute. His entire struggle was away from that. He could have had as much trouble even if he could speak. Iqbal's main handicap was his poverty, not his inability to speak.To top it off, his whole struggle was not that tough anyway. It all came a little too easily to him. I think there was scope to make him struggle some more.These points are what lack in this film, that don't let it be a film of International standards. the joy is there when he finally makes it to the team, but it isn't as hard-to-get as the victory in Lagaan or something.",little bit overrated,iqbal has won lot accolades past year it is decent effort but i wouldnt say it was best effort nagesh kukunoor awards this movie has won are not reflection how great this film is but rather how much rest films coming out bollywood lack originality iqbal is feel good movie it has original story original if limited screenplay it also boasts some new actors story is about young deaf dumb boy who struggles make it international cricket team india what does film lack reason it lacks reason main character being mute his entire struggle was away that he could have had as much trouble even if he could speak iqbals main handicap was his poverty not his inability speak top it off his whole struggle was not that tough anyway it all came little too easily him i think there was scope make him struggle some more these points are what lack this film that dont let it be film international standards joy is there when he finally makes it team but it isnt as hard get as victory lagaan or something,0.466573902288188,0.1667040300968872,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Great Job writer and director Nagesh Kukunoor,"Great Job. An excellent effort from Writer and Director: Nagesh Kukunoor, who didn't only use the talent of Naseeruddin Shah, Girish Karnad, Shreyas Talpade, Shweta Prasad, Yatin Karyekar and Prateeksha Lonkar in wonderful manners but delivered an ordinary story with exceptional way. This one of the best Indian movies (after the movie 'Black') where the lead role was a special/disable case (a deaf and dumb guy). It's universal truth, if the family members of a disable person cooperate with him/her using any sign of language to accomplish his/her dream and share his/her happiness as well as beautiful moments in the world any manner rather than taunting him/her on his/her disability then she/he can certainly do exceptional job with his/her talent. I would like to congratulate all the team members of this movie who made this piece of art memorable for the passion of a life of a disable person.

9.0,Iqbal  Black and Blue (the men in blue!),"(Karthik Narayan)Going to a movie is always fun, but it is important to choose the right movie. I had a variety to choose from  Salaam Namaste, Rising (Mangal Pandey) were the two movie names which came to my mind. But then I was surprised to hear that a movie by Nagesh Kukunoor had released and the theme was CRICKET! Being an avid cricket fan how could I ever afford to overlook this one!This story entirely revolves around Iqbal Khan, a deaf and mute 18 year old and his ambition of playing for the Indian cricket team as a fast bowler. His physically challenged state never hampers his ambition, his greatest strength is his commitment and his desire to chase his dreams no matter what happens. His never-say-die attitude is the highlight of the entire movie. Impediments and blocks are always a part of our life, and Iqbal faces enough obstacles in the nature of his father who hates cricket, and enough politics in the game itself. Then hope and inspiration comes in the form of angels  his sister and mother help him on with encouragement, and his drunkard coach moulds his cricket. Emotions run very high in the movie, naturally one is moved the way Shreyas Talpade as Iqbal is totally determined to realize his dream of playing for the team, and the scenes where he forces the deposed Naseeruddin Shah to come out of his drunken state and make him as his coach are too good for words. Can you believe that he is a debutant in Bollywood?? Really amazing talent! Shweta Prasad plays Iqbal's sister and her bubbly wisdom is a total show stopper. Girish Karnad and Naseeruddin are underrated stalwarts in our movies. Naseeruddin especially acts magnificently with his subtle facial expressions. The background music which has been tuned by Salim-Suleiman blend with the on screen moods, euphoric and sad happenings are beautifully set alive with the music. Our involvement in the movie becomes very emotional, we feel and breathe every moment of agony in the life of a 18 year old, and in the end, we spontaneously want to make Iqbal win, to win in his attempt to play for the National team, to don the colors of blue and bliss as he marks his run up to bowl. Ultimately the ecstasy on the face of the young man naturally brings total delight to all our faces and it is an outburst that I also felt. One of happiness, those tearful joyous moments on screen. Poverty is another aspect that has been subtly depicted in the scenes where Iqbal runs in the ""nets"" to bowl his balls with barefeet! Even the stone-cold hearted people would be totally touched to the core of their hearts in this movie. The movie goes beyond the game, and the dirty authorities and politics. It deals with a positive message for all those watching  that ONE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP IN LIFE. Nagesh Kukunoor, an American Desi (he hails from Andhra Pradesh and lived in America for a while) has been a revelation in the movie industry  he became an overnight celebrity with his ""Hyderabad Blues"". Being one of the youngest directors around and with a sound mind and fantastic themes such as ""Bollywood calling"", ""Rockford"" and ""teen deewarein"", he has rocked the Bollywood basement with meaningful, simple themes based on actual incidents. Even though these movies weren't as successful as Hyderabad blues, they were eye openers to all of us that a great director is present amongst us. This movie combines the sentiments reflected in BLACK and LAGAAN, but then again, the theme is different from those movies. So a comparison may not be quit e fair. One might dare to say this is different from Lagaan where in the end, Amir Khan holds our breaths with the heave for a six at the end, carrying all of us to the edges of our seats. If you expected such heroics, you will indeed be disappointed. Overall one can say that this is a great movie and one that brings tears out of us, also presenting a strong message of FAITH and determination. Great movie, great cast and hats off once again to Nagesh Kukunoor!
