10.0,"Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic. A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.",excellent timeless classic best sequel all time,star wars episode v empire strikes back 1980 is excellent timeless classic that it is best sequel all time i love this film death it is my second favorite film best sequel star wars franchise that i love empire strikes back is movie that it is one best sequels i can think it is right there with aliens 1986 it is right there with terminator 2 judgment day 1991 it is excellent sequel it really does establish empire as value treat empire strikes back is still excellent film which i really believe is timeless classic this is my second favorite film director irvin kershner number 1 favorite irvin kershner film will be robocop 2 1990 which is very underrated action flick i still have review those movies someday empire strikes back 1980 is best one series because its deeper darker more philosophical its great because darth vader empire are at their most menacing direction is creative characters feel real nature force is explored more without losing its mysticism pacing is as george lucas would put it faster more intense than any other film saga plot is actually more rescue mission that luke skywalker mark hamill is coming rescue his friends han solo princess leia organa c 3po chewbacca are captured planet bespin cloud city villainous darth vader han solos friend lando calrissian billy dee williams set up with darth vader he set trap luke also luke studied force under jedi master yoda become full jedi knight but end he must confront darth vader david prowse by him self origins luke skywalker are reveled empire strikes back was released 1980 it is directed by irvin kershner this time not george lucas because george lucas decide that he want make this sequel independent one so he ended up coming with his own founding film getting loan money he earn first movie it success so he decided he wanted found film him self he wanted be more executive producer keep eye lamp he moved bigger studio orange county california so he diced be more producer he did not want direct empire strikes back so his first choice was irvin kershner who was professor at uc uc film school that george attended too he always liked irvin kershner course he was former professor it was hard way talk him do it first time irvin kershner didnt want do it so george called irvins agent his agent said irvin take it so he did rest is history this stands test time best film he ever directed i love john williams score still same but i think john williams changed music score little bit but thats just my opinion things that i love this film i love battle with rebels fighting with imperial at at walkers ice world hoth that is my favorite scene ice world film imperial at at walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects i love that origins luke skywalker are reveled that luke is son darth vader who is actually anakin skywalker before he become darth vader went dark site first time ever we see emperor hologram talking darth vader falcon with han solo princess leia organa c 3po chewbacca hiding rocks trys eat monster luke faces with darth vader him self face face get his arm cut off then he jumps off bridge because he didnt want join his father dark force lightsaber duel throughout chamber between luke darth vader was excellent it was epic training sequence with luke master yoda were excellent epic new hope empire strikes back are my favorite films series that are franchise this film gets perfect 10 score been best sci fi adventure sequel all time,0.46498850943295383,0.3614498156164824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,"All the fun of the original with a much better, darker plot","The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion. While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda. However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series. However what gets added to that is a much darker strand. The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact. This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion. In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company. The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett. The two work well together and come together well for a great finale. The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first. The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here. However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi. Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better. Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising. All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.",all fun original with much better darker plot,rebellion has struck important blow power empire by destroying its death star however power dark side force remains strong continues hunt rebellion while rebellion base hoth is under treat luke has gone distant swamp planet receive further jedi training master yoda however power dark side should not be underestimated many dark truths are revealed as threat empire looms large following star wars was never going be easy but this is actually better empire retains same characters same sense fun that first had battle hoth is just one moments series however what gets added that is much darker strand empire is not beaten by destruction one ship its power is barely dented fact this sees some startling revelations i wont spoil it case youve been living under rock but also sees significant blows rebellion fact ending this film could not be more different end star wars like recent episode two this follows two strands more pedestrian scenes with luke yoda more action based scenes with han company scenes with yoda add depth film hint at truth meanwhile other half is lot more action orientated has comedy good new characters such as bobba fett two work well together come together well great finale addition dark strand film makes it all better as it can be enjoyed as story not just fun sci fi film with good effects characters are better here than first strong characters first han c3p0 et al are all still good here however we also get much more interesting version luke as he continues his journey into becoming full jedi yoda is good addition despite sounding like fozzie bear darth vader becomes lot more than just good villain we learn his past revelation then but thing common knowledge now overall this is as good as star wars at its heart but darker nature film makes it much better where first one was victorious uprising this is as title suggests time history where empire strikes back against uprising all music characters things that make star wars star wars are here its simply one best series date,0.44292707292707295,0.24475357975357967,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,"A worthy second (or 5th??) Star Wars installment, might be the best of the bunch.","My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",worthy second or 5th star wars installment might be best bunch,my five children were all pre teens when empire strikes back came theater while there had been other sci fi movies with theme conflict outer space star wars trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them fantastic strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too aliens sitting around tavern enjoying drinks speaking all sorts languages nothing before had approached sheer size space ships depicted here huge cities traveling all over galaxy how about jump hyper speed then disappearing screen as speed exceeds light speed light sabres jedi knights jedi knights striking parallel japanese samurai it is fruitless trying argue which is best trilogy because first one this case star wars starts it all has be father however argument can be made that empire strikes back now dvd called episode v is overall better made movie which has more excitement grabs your imagination than other two original installments now called parts iv vi dvds finally came out last month they are near perfect as we should expect lucas films thx bit rate is high picture is nothing short superb as is dolby ex surround track my wife i watched all three movies dvd this week star wars empire strikes back return jedi compliments our local public library it was appropriate reminder how good these movies are still ahead their time nothing else has been made compare them,0.45626126126126126,0.27515765765765765,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature,"`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.' I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending. Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens. If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al. Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. But somehow it doesn't matter. The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway. Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke. The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia. In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay. It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point. Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER. This was my favourite touch. All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force. Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V. There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition. Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.",its not darkest trilogy its most mature,it avoids having standard shoot em up ending says friend mine by not having ending i suppose this is what most people think but all same film manages form satisfying whole or at least whole that satisfies me im therefore inclined think it does have ending obviously i cant discuss this without giving things away those few who dont know what happens if youre one those few then believe me your ignorance is precious enough be worth guarding until you see film stop reading now after surprise attack rebel base luke skywalker splits with han leia et al hans party gets away first is it just me or is shot luke watching falcon flying off while he stands stranded ground poignant one but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another while luke slinks off quietly safely train with yoda training scenes are many yoda talks great deal rubbish but somehow it doesnt matter film is ambivalent its attitude towards yoda anyway our sympathy clearly lies with entirely non spiritual concerns han leia adolescent luke main story concerns understanding that builds between han leia end they are honest with one another if hans being frozen shipped back tatooine is price pay this well its price pay it was very important not end with dashing rescue that opens return jedi which would be dramatically beside point instead we end with promise that rescue will some day occur thats enough as luke he abandons yoda rescue han leia achieves nothing whatever this was my favourite touch all five jedis luke obi wan yoda vader emperor find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong film is really about temporary triumph human impulses over mystical force lukes human idealism is vindicated but his supernatural powers just this once are not when george lucas gave his star wars trilogy fresh coat varnish 1997 he felt he had justify expense by making needless changes youll notice he made precious few changes episode v there just wasnt room he added few extra shots ice monster which course weakened that one scene but even with those changes place special edition is virtually identical original edition since lucas was so keen making changes wherever he could this is obviously tribute tightness story direction its also tribute perfection original special effects more innovative than effects first star wars movie better than effects any subsequent one,0.4601190476190477,0.1407234432234432,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,"Even though he wasn't at the director's helm this time, George Lucas has done it again.","In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star. I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history.",even though he wasnt at directors helm this time george lucas has done it again,film like empire strikes back especially few years heels such mind bogglingly great film like original star wars there is something that comes

10.0,"Manages to be even better than New Hope, and that was just as brilliant","The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda.

10.0,finest of the trilogy because Lucas didn't write the script,"SPOILERS Three years after ""Star Wars"", creator George Lucas released the second part of his trilogy. Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential.After the events of the first film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are now members of the rebel alliance. Hidden on a frozen planet, the rebels hide from the domineering glow of the Empire. All is not well however as the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is on his way to find them.Easily the best of the trilogy, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has so much going for it. A wonderful plot, an equally good script with some brilliant lines (even actor Harrison Ford joining in with a line or two of his own) and special effects to match, this film is a glowing example of why people love the trilogy so much.Since George Lucas passed on the major responsibilities for this film, we are given a more professional, well made film for our attention and Lucas's vision is better off for it. With it's recent remastering, it is also the only film in the trilogy to not be damaged by Lucas' tampering. Extra images are added, graphics are honed, but nothing major is changed. As a result the film appears to us to be no different from it's original self.Darker and more mature as well, this sequel is better than the original ""Star Wars"" because it isn't so black and white. Presenting the evil Darth Vader as a more balanced individual, we don't quite have the confused Vader of the final chapter, but we are beginning to get signs that he isn't quite as we expected.This second part also gives us the finest performance ever by one of the universes most important characters. Still a rubber puppet with bendy ears, Jedi Master Yoda is introduced in this film as a creature of wit and intelligence. Voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda is brilliant because of his lines. Legendarily possessing of an obsession for splitting sentences up and rehashing them together, Yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film. Occasionally demonstrating his penchant for bad English, he does make a few minor errors, but ultimately it is up to the later scripts of George Lucas to corrupt Yoda's style and turn this wonderful character into an annoying figure of fun.There's no real way to fault ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The finest part of the original trilogy, this film is amazing because it is professionally done. Nobody would ever deny that George Lucas did something wonderful when he thought up ""Star Wars"", but unfortunately for a lot of the films, Lucas always insisted on too much control. A dire writer of scripts, Lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating to watch. In this part though, Lucas didn't get involved and as a result, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece in it's own right.",finest trilogy because lucas didnt write script,spoilers three years after star wars creator george lucas released second part his trilogy giving scripting credits leigh brackett lawrence kasden as well as directing irvin kershner lucas made his smartest ever decision as result was able release finest film trilogy by mile considerably darker more mature than its predecessor empire strikes back is masterpiece modern film it is intense powerful entertaining film with ultimate cinema twist with script worthy its potential after events first film luke skywalker mark hamill han solo harrison ford are now members rebel alliance hidden frozen planet rebels hide domineering glow empire all is not well however as evil darth vader voiced by james earl jones is his way find them easily best trilogy empire strikes back has so much going it wonderful plot equally good script with some brilliant lines even actor harrison ford joining with line or two his own special effects match this film is glowing example why people love trilogy so much since george lucas passed major responsibilities this film we are given more professional well made film our attention lucass vision is better off it with its recent remastering it is also only film trilogy not be damaged by lucas tampering extra images are added graphics are honed but nothing major is changed as result film appears us be no different its original self darker more mature as well this sequel is better than original star wars because it isnt so black white presenting evil darth vader as more balanced individual we dont quite have confused vader final chapter but we are beginning get signs that he isnt quite as we expected this second part also gives us finest performance ever by one universes most important characters still rubber puppet with bendy ears jedi master yoda is introduced this film as creature wit intelligence voiced by frank oz yoda is brilliant because his lines legendarily possessing obsession splitting sentences up rehashing them together yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film occasionally demonstrating his penchant bad english he does make few minor errors but ultimately it is up later scripts george lucas corrupt yodas style turn this wonderful character into annoying figure fun theres no real way fault empire strikes back finest part original trilogy this film is amazing because it is professionally done nobody would ever deny that george lucas did something wonderful when he thought up star wars but unfortunately lot films lucas always insisted too much control dire writer scripts lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating watch this part though lucas didnt get involved as result empire strikes back is masterpiece its own right,0.5272283272283272,0.1684981684981685,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,"The best ""Star Wars"" film ever made.","(Note: This review contains some spoilers.)Movie novelty quickly wears thin, which is why so many sequels pale in comparison to their originals. ""Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, darker and deeper and even more powerful than the first film. Granted, the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs, and is still one of the greatest films ever made, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a tiny inch ahead in the race.It is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy, crammed full with imagination and special effects. It is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time, which is rare for a sequel -- any sequel -- especially in the case of a sci-fi film. Just take a look at ""Predator 2"" for an example of an idea running out of steam, or a director who cannot cope with his script.The film generally picks up where the last left off: Luke (Mark Hamill) saved the day by blowing up the Death Star, the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess (Carrie Fisher), and peace was temporarily restored. But Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones) is still alive, and the Emperor's fury grows stronger as Luke begins his Jedi training under the help of Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia flee to Cloud City to escape an attack from the empire, where they are taken under the wing of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), an old pal of Han's who is secretly working for Vader, somewhat against his own will.The movie is strong in its morals and Biblical metaphors, just as the original. Luke is the savior, Calrissian could be considered the equivalent of Judas, Han Solo is one of Luke's good disciples and Vader represents pure evil. And of course, there's the truly iconic line, ""I am your father,"" that is relevant to the devil, who -- according to the scriptures -- was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming Lucifer. Lucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers. Like all good fables, of fantasy or reality, ""Star Wars"" is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone, in one form or another, and is -- at its roots -- a story we are all very familiar with. It is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs. -evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many. Yes, ""Star Wars"" is the quintessential nerd's film, engulfed in an entirely different dimension, but the film's bad rap for this is undeserved -- it's still a wonderful story, and you don't have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points (and it has many).One of the most popular legends (and misconceptions) regarding the ""Star Wars"" phenomenon is that George Lucas helmed the entire Star Wars trilogy, when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is directed by Irvin Kirshner, who also delivered us the disappointing ""RoboCop 2."" How could one sequel be so great, and the other so bad? Simple: Kirshner's darkness in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had a point, and a high value. In ""RoboCop 2,"" it was just excessive and silly, not to mention totally unnecessary. What Paul Verhoeven was able to do with the original ""RoboCop"" was something not many films can accomplish, and Kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative, which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture.""The Empire Strikes Back"" has a point amidst the action, and is the most important of all three ""Star Wars"" movies. It has the famous introduction of the creature Yoda, who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet, at first startling Luke with his strange features, and then with his subtle wisdom. It is Yoda who trains Luke in the ways of the Jedi, and eventually leads him towards his destination: The showdown with Vader, when the infamous secret is finally revealed.The movie is expertly crafted, both in terms of a a narrative and literal context. From beginning to end it is darker, fiercer and more powerful than the original film, which is not an easy feat. All trilogies have their dark areas, and this is usually the middle chapter (""Back to the Future Part II"" is a good example), yet in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the darkness seems very appropriate given the material. It is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal, murder, revenge, and unrecoverable mistakes. By the end of the movie, we know what Luke is feeling: There is still much to be done, despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion. For us, as an audience, we know everything must come to an end within the next installment. For Luke, it could be an eternity of struggle. But we all know there will be an end to the epic saga, and we have always known this, ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger, more innocent Luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet, so many years ago, when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far, far away...5/5 stars.John Ulmer",best star wars film ever made,note this review contains some spoilers movie novelty quickly wears thin which is why so many sequels pale comparison their originals star wars episode v empire strikes back is best original star wars trilogy darker deeper even more powerful than first film granted original pioneered endless saga imitators somewhat imaginative knock offs is still one greatest films ever made but empire strikes back is tiny inch ahead race it is dark middle chapter almost perfect trilogy crammed full with imagination special effects it is simply one most visionary movies all time which is rare sequel any sequel especially case sci fi film just take look at predator 2 example idea running out steam or director who cannot cope with his script film generally picks up where last left off luke mark hamill saved day by blowing up death star heroes were awarded with medals by princess carrie fisher peace was temporarily restored but darth vader voice james earl jones is still alive emperors fury grows stronger as luke begins his jedi training under help yoda meanwhile han solo harrison ford leia flee cloud city escape attack empire where they are taken under wing lando calrissian billy dee williams old pal hans who is secretly working vader somewhat against his own will movie is strong its morals biblical metaphors just as original luke is savior calrissian could be considered equivalent judas han solo is one lukes good disciples vader represents pure evil course theres truly iconic line i am your father that is relevant devil who according scriptures was angel before being cast into bowels hell becoming lucifer lucas admittedly used these various metaphors strike nerve subconscious his viewers like all good fables fantasy or reality star wars is trilogy that relates just about everyone one form or another is at its roots story we are all very familiar with it is ever familiar notion good vs evil at its core that helps propel these movies into hearts many yes star wars is quintessential nerds film engulfed entirely different dimension but films bad rap this is undeserved its still wonderful story you dont have be die hard fan appreciate its fine points it has many one most popular legends misconceptions regarding star wars phenomenon is that george lucas helmed entire star wars trilogy when fact he only directed first wrote screenplay all three combined empire strikes back is directed by irvin kirshner who also delivered us disappointing robocop 2 how could one sequel be so great other so bad simple kirshners darkness empire strikes back had point high value robocop 2 it was just excessive silly not mention totally unnecessary what paul verhoeven was able do with original robocop was something not many films can accomplish kirshner tried add this with darker narrative which only ended frustratingly empty motion picture empire strikes back has point amidst action is most important all three star wars movies it has famous introduction creature yoda who sits tucked away his hut swamp planet at first startling luke with his strange features then with his subtle wisdom it is yoda who trains luke ways jedi eventually leads him towards his destination showdown with vader when infamous secret is finally revealed movie is expertly crafted both terms narrative literal context beginning end it is darker fiercer more powerful than original film which is not easy feat all trilogies have their dark areas this is usually middle chapter back future part ii is good example yet empire strikes back darkness seems very appropriate given material it is film that dwells long hard betrayal murder revenge unrecoverable mistakes by end movie we know what luke is feeling there is still much be done despite overwhelming emotional downpour attachment confusion us as audience we know everything must come end within next installment luke it could be eternity struggle but we all know there will be end epic saga we have always known this ever since we first caught glimpse younger more innocent luke working his uncle that deserted planet so many years ago when he could only dream having adventures other galaxies far far away 5 5 stars john ulmer,0.56068144499179,0.15029248768472903,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,The best film in the original trilogy.,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.",best film original trilogy,empire strikes back is best film original star wars trilogy it has all great qualities that original star wars has great effects at time its release appealing characters lots spellbinding action it also has eliminated some problems that plagued first storyline is tighter goes much deeper into character development performances are terrific especially by harrison ford as han solo billy dee williams as lando calrissian george lucas has also remembered include spellbinding battle sequence with snowspeeder sequence near beginning film conclusion with lightsaber duel between darth vader luke skywalker is truly one most suspenseful dramatic scenes entire series this is truly wondrous film serves as constant reminder that just because movie is expensive blockbuster doesnt mean that it has be shallow two dimensional this film will undoubtedly entertain viewers all ages start finish,0.5577898550724637,0.20851449275362316,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,Fantastic Sequel,"The rebels' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends? ""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film.

10.0,The best movie of all Star wars,"''Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back '' is my favorite one from all the star war series.Things are getting more and more complicated for the Rebels.Spite of the fact that the Death Star was destroyed, the Imperial troops had success expelling the Rebels from their secret base, and now they are being hunted in all galaxy. The new secret base is localized in Hoth, a very cold world even for the native animals. Darth Vader wants to find Luke at any cost, and now he sent many remote probes to find him in all space. Luke is attacked by a big animal and almost dies, by stays lost in the ice. He sees the ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi talking with him, and he says that Luke needs to go to a system called Dangoba, where Yoda will teach and explain to him all the steps to become a Jedi. Han Solo goes after Luke and they both are saved by their rebel team.The system Hoth is discovered by the Empire(since it should not have any human form living in there) and consequently the Rebel Base. Darth Vader decides to attack the Rebels by the surface,and the Rebels really stay in disadvantage. Han,Leia,C3pO and Chewbacca escapes from Hoth,but after many attacks from the Imperial troops and even asteroids fields, they arrive in the Cloud city that Lando,an old friend of Han,rules.Luke goes with R2 to Dangoba,and there he finds Yoda. The problem is, Yoda does not want to teach him how to become a Jedi,since he finds Luke extremely impatient, old to be trained and also with many anger inside of him,like his father Anakin. Obi Wan tries to change Yoda's mind, but only when Luke promises to really gives his best that Yoda accepts the challenge.The Emperor talks to Vader about a disturbance in the force that comes from Luke Skywalker. He finally says that Luke is son of Anakin and that Luke should never be trained as a Jedi,because of the risk in destroying the siths,that are very high. But Vader has other plans: He always imagined that his offspring died when Padme died, and now he thinks about making Luke a sith,to they both rule the galaxy together and also kill the Emperor.In the city of the clouds, Lando betrays Han and gives them all to Vader.It's all a trap to take Luke that Vader did, and while he tortures Han, Lukes see the vision of his friends suffering,and gave up his training. Yoda alerts him that the risk of turning to the dark side is high, and that he should not stop his training, but Luke is so worried with his friends that he cannot think about anything else. Vader call the award hunters and Boba Fett(the clone of Jango Fett,remember?)is the one who takes Han Solo to Jabba,to win a big prize.We are now in a risky situation, where Lukes needs to confront his dad without be tainted to the dark side, and someone needs to help Han,Chewbacca,Leia and C3po.Ps: *In this movie we can see the first demonstrations that Leia and Han likes each other,and when Leia wants to let Han with jealous and kisses Luke is kind of a funny moment. Another nice moment with Leia, is when we see the connection between her and Luke, when he has his hand cut and is in a dangerous situation after fighting with Vader.*I really like the big Imperial robots called 'walkers': I think they are one of the most impressive artilleries the Empire has.",best movie all star wars,star wars episode v empire strikes back is my favorite one all star war series things are getting more more complicated rebels spite fact that death star was destroyed imperial troops had success expelling rebels their secret base now they are being hunted all galaxy new secret base is localized hoth very cold world even native animals darth vader wants find luke at any cost now he sent many remote probes find him all space luke is attacked by big animal almost dies by stays lost ice he sees ghost obi wan kenobi talking with him he says that luke needs go system called dangoba where yoda will teach explain him all steps become jedi han solo goes after luke they both are saved by their rebel team system hoth is discovered by empire since it should not have any human form living there consequently rebel base darth vader decides attack rebels by surface rebels really stay disadvantage han leia c3po chewbacca escapes hoth but after many attacks imperial troops even asteroids fields they arrive cloud city that lando old friend han rules luke goes with r2 dangoba there he finds yoda problem is yoda does not want teach him how become jedi since he finds luke extremely impatient old be trained also with many anger inside him like his father anakin obi wan tries change yodas mind but only when luke promises really gives his best that yoda accepts challenge emperor talks vader about disturbance force that comes luke skywalker he finally says that luke is son anakin that luke should never be trained as jedi because risk destroying siths that are very high but vader has other plans he always imagined that his offspring died when padme died now he thinks about making luke sith they both rule galaxy together also kill emperor city clouds lando betrays han gives them all vader its all trap take luke that vader did while he tortures han lukes see vision his friends suffering gave up his training yoda alerts him that risk turning dark side is high that he should not stop his training but luke is so worried with his friends that he cannot think about anything else vader call award hunters boba fett clone jango fett remember is one who takes han solo jabba win big prize we are now risky situation where lukes needs confront his dad without be tainted dark side someone needs help han chewbacca leia c3po ps this movie we can see first demonstrations that leia han likes each other when leia wants let han with jealous kisses luke is kind funny moment another nice moment with leia is when we see connection between her luke when he has his hand cut is dangerous situation after fighting with vader i really like big imperial robots called walkers i think they are one most impressive artilleries empire has,0.4880745920745919,0.07066083916083915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader.

Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original.

10.0,Greatest Movie Ever,"This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through. Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for. That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city.

10.0,Why can't they make them like this any more?,"From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second.",why cant they make them like this any more,its opening scenes bleak ice ball that is planet hoth its exciting finale cloud city bespin empire strikes back is worthy sequel magnificent star wars taking over directorial reins george lucas irvin kershner steers movie into darker territory deliver more mature movie than its predecessor empire is still licking its wounds after destruction death star evil darth vader is intent finding rebels responsible destroying his new toy lukes aim meanwhile is become fully fledged jedi knight whilst han sets himself more difficult target he plans getting into leias knickers with more incredible fx packed action scenes than you can shake light sabre at highlights include fantastic battle hoth chase scene through asteroid field luke darth light sabre duel that moment where we learn truth about lukes father its no surprise find that this episode is often said be best series personally new hope will always be my favourite sentimental reasons but empire strikes back is very close second,0.5484265734265734,0.1790792540792541,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,Outstanding follow up.,"Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.",outstanding follow up,congratulations have go line producer gary kurtz director irvin kershner pushing production out perform new hope even though consequence was film that came

""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!Oh, and Han Solo shot first! =)",best best,i cannot believe some people out there didnt like this film yet claim have enjoyed episode one no comparison whatsoever empire strike back is george lucas best contribution human history it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone way do do bird optical effects still stand test time acting is superb harrison ford mark hamil carrie fisher are all better than they we original star wars having fully developed grown into their characters story just keeps going going asteroid fields swamp planets cities sky everything this film works so ignore anyone who claims dislike it see it yourself if you havent already done so 20 out 10 oh han solo shot first,0.3905555555555555,0.4033333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,The snow movie!,"That's what I called this when I was too small to reach the movies in my house. My poor mother had to decipher that description.Just as important as A New Hope was to movies, Empire Strikes Back is to sequels. And why? Because Lucas paid for this himself. No one has ever been in his position before. To make huge movies that are financed by the creator. No studio would ever allow a movie like this, it took risks: It's not a rehash, its darker, a realistic puppet was a serious main character and a lot of the story is left in the air.But while this movie is darker than it's predecessor it's not a dark movie, its just darker. People seem to forget that. It's a more serious story but it's still able to maintain the fun feel of 4. It also continues the speed from 4 as well. Instead of getting in huge fights they are just small scuffles. This doesn't feel for a second that it's trying to outdo the original. The story and the characters are expanded and deepened.Yoda was a huge risk, it's hard for us to think of a puppet not being taken seriously, but no one had ever attempted to make a life like puppet before. And sequels weren't a sure cash in either. In order for this movie to break even it had to be the most successful sequel of all time. It's these things that Lucas gave us. He not only knows how to tell a story and make a great movie but he takes risks to do it at the same time. He did this his whole career. If this movie failed not only was Star Wars dead but so was Lucas' career. That'll motivate you.My favorite SW set is in this, the carbon freezing chamber. I don't know if it's the steam, the orange light or the vastness but I love this room. Everyone looks cool here. Especially the Stormtroopers, their white really illuminates the orange well. And you get Vader and Boba in here too.The snow troopers are very cool. I can't figure out if I like them or the Episode 3 clones best.Lando is a great addition because he's the Han that could have been. And Lando gets crap for being bad but he really does make the best call. He appeases Vader to save his life while still giving himself the freedom to save Han in the end. And he hasn't seen Han in years maybe he's become a real , the last time he saw him he was a smuggler after all. And Billy Dee is great, I don't know if anyone is as effortlessly smooth as this guy.3P0 in pieces is a great addition that provides endless jokes.I love Han's love story with Leah because she's given him no indication that she's interested. And he acts like they have this dating history. But he is right because she does want him.And the best part of the movie: Yoda/training. Not only is Yoda the most powerful Jedi of all but you hang on his every word of wisdom. Lines repeated for my entire life. I have always loved the fact that the most powerful Jedi was the smallest. There's just something about that idea that really gets me.And there's really something to be said for the fact that Yoda is not actually real. We all know that Frank Oz did the voice and puppeteered Yoda but the fact that Yoda is not actually real really helps to make his character real. it's not necessarily Frank Oz as Yoda, what you see is the little green puppet as Yoda. There aren't pictures of him at studio 54 or news of him getting married. Yoda is Yoda. when he is not being the puppet on screen he doesn't exist which really helps to his reality.The biggest complaint since Lucas finished the saga was that ""I am your father,"" is now not a surprise any more. Which is true, you do know, but watching them in order you'll probably be surprised that Anakin turns to the dark side. And it might be a surprise that Vader tells Luke this because as far as we know Vader doesn't know who Luke is. He doesn't even know that he has a kid. And we think that Anakin is dead. I don't know... Only time will tell with people who watch these in episode order",snow movie,thats what i called this when i was too small reach movies my house my poor mother had decipher that description just as important as new hope was movies empire strikes back is sequels why because lucas paid this himself no one has ever been his position before make huge movies that are financed by creator no studio would ever allow movie like this it took risks its not rehash its darker realistic puppet was serious main character lot story is left air but while this movie is darker than its predecessor its not dark movie its just darker people seem forget that its more serious story but its still able maintain fun feel 4 it also continues speed 4 as well instead getting huge fights they are just small scuffles this doesnt feel second that its trying outdo original story characters are expanded deepened yoda was huge risk its hard us think puppet not being taken seriously but no one had ever attempted make life like puppet before sequels werent sure cash either order this movie break even it had be most successful sequel all time its these things that lucas gave us he not only knows how tell story make great movie but he takes risks do it at same time he did this his whole career if this movie failed not only was star wars dead but so was lucas career thatll motivate you my favorite sw set is this carbon freezing chamber i dont know if its steam orange light or vastness but i love this room everyone looks cool here especially stormtroopers their white really illuminates orange well you get vader boba here too snow troopers are very cool i cant figure out if i like them or episode 3 clones best lando is great addition because hes han that could have been lando gets crap being bad but he really does make best call he appeases vader save his life while still giving himself freedom save han end he hasnt seen han years maybe hes become real last time he saw him he was smuggler after all billy dee is great i dont know if anyone is as effortlessly smooth as this guy 3p0 pieces is great addition that provides endless jokes i love hans love story with leah because shes given him no indication that shes interested he acts like they have this dating history but he is right because she does want him best part movie yoda training not only is yoda most powerful jedi all but you hang his every word wisdom lines repeated my entire life i have always loved fact that most powerful jedi was smallest theres just something about that idea that really gets me theres really something be said fact that yoda is not actually real we all know that frank oz did voice puppeteered yoda but fact that yoda is not actually real really helps make his character real its not necessarily frank oz as yoda what you see is little green puppet as yoda there arent pictures him at studio 54 or news him getting married yoda is yoda when he is not being puppet screen he doesnt exist which really helps his reality biggest complaint since lucas finished saga was that i am your father is now not surprise any more which is true you do know but watching them order youll probably be surprised that anakin turns dark side it might be surprise that vader tells luke this because as far as we know vader doesnt know who luke is he doesnt even know that he has kid we think that anakin is dead i dont know only time will tell with people who watch these episode order,0.5484652271847393,0.18452737303347058,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,This is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Disney+.

9.0,Big Improvement Over The First Star Wars,"Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better.",big improvement over first star wars,although called episode v this was second movie star wars 6 part installment ive always thought one better entries series if you watch first star wars then this one youll immediately see vast improvement special effects department there is much more polished look this one improved sound fact dvd transfer is outstanding considering age this film while first star wars was bit subdued this one picks up action right start although lulls are really appreciated because first 40 minutes are pretty hectic most notable those scenes are gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out are still pretty good movie calms down after that opening land war but retains viewers interest with other things second half movie features two stories going at once battle space with most cast involved luke skywalker mark hamill swampland involved his training sessions with master yoda some movies dialog is still corny especially between han solo harrison ford princess leia carrie fisher with their love hate relationship but its not overdone what is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating chewbacca wookie that sheep heat noise can get annoying after awhile rambo action continues as it did first film with villains firing everything at our heroes never hitting them ludicrous but part deal those things you just put up with as film overall delivers another interesting adventure far more than first star wars leading up next one which was even better,0.47022841656987996,0.20599109562524193,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.24}"
