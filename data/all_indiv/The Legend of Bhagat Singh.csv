10.0,This film is a staple on my top ten list!,"There were 10 reviews for this film before mine and they all rated it 10 out of 10 stars. If that's not enough to convince you about how powerful this film is, then read on. It's one of the best films to ever come out of India and can also boast some of the best acting talents as well. The narrative is quite simple. This is the story of the legendary Bhagat Singh and his friends, a group of young boys who idolized Ghandhi as children but became disillusioned as they grew into teenagers and witnessed that none of Gandhi's peaceful tactics seemed to have worked on getting the British colonialists out of India nor stop the oppression. Steadily, they begin to rebel and form their own group and politics and soon emerge as freedom fighters. The incomparable Ajay Devgan stars as the grown up Bhaghat Singh and he is just flawless, he shoots this character into the stratosphere of acting that you eventually find yourself believing that this man might very well be Bhaghat Singh. He owns the character, he becomes the character, he inhabits the very essence of this freedom fighter and makes it his own life for the duration of the entire film. Amrita Rao is a dream to see, a breath of fresh air after viewing hours of the violence, bloodshed and senseless British nonsensical banter and poor excuse for logic. She stars here as the suitor for Bhagat but is rebuffed by the man she now loves and respects. You've heard the stories, now see it for yourself in The Legend of Bhagat Singh.",this film is staple my top ten list,there were 10 reviews this film before mine they all rated it 10 out 10 stars if thats not enough convince you about how powerful this film is then read its one best films ever come out india can also boast some best acting talents as well narrative is quite simple this is story legendary bhagat singh his friends group young boys who idolized ghandhi as children but became disillusioned as they grew into teenagers witnessed that none gandhis peaceful tactics seemed have worked getting british colonialists out india nor stop oppression steadily they begin rebel form their own group politics soon emerge as freedom fighters incomparable ajay devgan stars as grown up bhaghat singh he is just flawless he shoots this character into stratosphere acting that you eventually find yourself believing that this man might very well be bhaghat singh he owns character he becomes character he inhabits very essence this freedom fighter makes it his own life duration entire film amrita rao is dream see breath fresh air after viewing hours violence bloodshed senseless british nonsensical banter poor excuse logic she stars here as suitor bhagat but is rebuffed by man she now loves respects youve heard stories now see it yourself legend bhagat singh,0.4532857142857143,0.2866666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Bhagat Singh's Story,"Santoshi's 'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' tells a detailed biography of the martyred hero. He does provide both the good side and the dark side (his obsession blinding him to the fact that it's wrong to teach children to make bombs). Santoshi also shows the clash between Bhagat Singh's and Gandhi's viewpoints quite effectively. He has tried to stay historically accurate and even though it was released during the same time as Guddu Dhanoa's snoozefest '1930 Shaheed', 'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' triumphs above that and is a masterpiece in comparison.Ajay Devgan, though intense roles are his strength, may seem like an odd choice to play the title role, especially because there is no physical resemblance and he is too old for the part. Otherwise, he delivers a winning performance. Sushant Singh and Akhilendra Mishra are equally powerful. The supporting cast that includes an excellent Raj Babbar, a sincere Farida Jalal and dusky beauty Amrita Rao leave a mark. I liked the actress that played Durga who seems to be an important female figure in Indian history. I would like to see a movie about this woman. The actors who play the Brits are horrendous.The cinematography is fine and A.R. Rahman's soundtrack is another winner. Most of the songs are patriotic but there are a few different numbers too. The background score, though beautiful, is intrusive at times and kind of adds a melodramatic feel (when that isn't necessary).'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' is one of the fewer biopics in Indian cinema that tells a good story while attempting to stay true to the facts. Some might find it difficult to watch due to the violent content but it is a movie that is worth viewing.",bhagat singhs story,santoshis legend bhagat singh tells detailed biography martyred hero he does provide both good side dark side his obsession blinding him fact that its wrong teach children make bombs santoshi also shows clash between bhagat singhs gandhis viewpoints quite effectively he has tried stay historically accurate even though it was released during same time as guddu dhanoas snoozefest 1930 shaheed legend bhagat singh triumphs above that is masterpiece comparison ajay devgan though intense roles are his strength may seem like odd choice play title role especially because there is no physical resemblance he is too old part otherwise he delivers winning performance sushant singh akhilendra mishra are equally powerful supporting cast that includes excellent raj babbar sincere farida jalal dusky beauty amrita rao leave mark i liked actress that played durga who seems be important female figure indian history i would like see movie about this woman actors who play brits are horrendous cinematography is fine r rahmans soundtrack is another winner most songs are patriotic but there are few different numbers too background score though beautiful is intrusive at times kind adds melodramatic feel when that isnt necessary legend bhagat singh is one fewer biopics indian cinema that tells good story while attempting stay true facts some might find it difficult watch due violent content but it is movie that is worth viewing,0.6086134453781513,0.2125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.05, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,Not the easiest Indian film to watch....but a very important film.,"s an American, I had no idea who Bhagat Singh was, though I was familiar with the sort of repression that led to his movement. The British were brutal when it came to controlling India. The nation was huge...and the Brits realized that the only way to control such a large nation was through terror and violence. The film ""The Legend of Bhagat Singh"" does a great job in showing the massacres, the torture of prisoners and the coercion of confessions through beatings...and this is something folks outside of India must know about and accept that it happened. And, as a retired history teacher, I really thought this was a very good and important film. My only reservations were the singing. I know that most Indian films have a lot of singing...that is almost expected. But to throw in a fluffy love song in the middle and a song as the three men are being led to the gallows sure did a lot to deflate the otherwise powerful film. Ajay Devgn was great in the lead and the likeness to Singh was definitely present. The script also was very powerful and I found myself tearing up many times. But the songs...well, a couple of them just had to go. Otherwise, a very powerful and memorable film.",not easiest indian film watch but very important film,s american i had no idea who bhagat singh was though i was familiar with sort repression that led his movement british were brutal when it came controlling india nation was huge brits realized that only way control such large nation was through terror violence film legend bhagat singh does great job showing massacres torture prisoners coercion confessions through beatings this is something folks outside india must know about accept that it happened as retired history teacher i really thought this was very good important film my only reservations were singing i know that most indian films have lot singing that is almost expected but throw fluffy love song middle song as three men are being led gallows sure did lot deflate otherwise powerful film ajay devgn was great lead likeness singh was definitely present script also was very powerful i found myself tearing up many times but songs well couple them just had go otherwise very powerful memorable film,0.6124092970521543,0.2508673469387755,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,Simple narrative and top notch acting,"This movie would top my list of all the patriotic movies I have ever watched. To say the least I have seen a lot of this genre. Rajkumar Santoshi as already mentioned in the other comments must have done a lot of research to come out with such minute details. The narrative was very simple and the fact that it could reach out to the larger mass is evident. That indeed did cut down on the international appeal. But no complains as the objective set out is achieved. Now talking about the acting. It would be only fair to say that Ajay's acting in this movie is at par with his role as Mallik in RGV's ""Company"" if not better. To get into the skin of such a legendary character and to act like him was an ardent task and Ajay looked effortless while doing the scenes which according to me would give the Khans a run for their money. I had tears in my eyes, when the three martyrs break into that ""Rang de basanti"" mood in the climax. It will be remembered for a long long time from now. Last but not the least the supporting cast did a splendid job, which is crucial in such a huge feature. Everyone lived out their respective characters. With special mention to the Court Room scenes and the Hunger strike scenes in the cell. There is a lot the young Indians should learn from this movie which in turn would make Bhagat's sacrifices worthwhile. A sure winner from the first shot to the last. A highly recommended must see which should get nothing less but 8/10.",simple narrative top notch acting,this movie would top my list all patriotic movies i have ever watched say least i have seen lot this genre rajkumar santoshi as already mentioned other comments must have done lot research come out with such minute details narrative was very simple fact that it could reach out larger mass is evident that indeed did cut down international appeal but no complains as objective set out is achieved now talking about acting it would be only fair say that ajays acting this movie is at par with his role as mallik rgvs company if not better get into skin such legendary character act like him was ardent task ajay looked effortless while doing scenes which according me would give khans run their money i had tears my eyes when three martyrs break into that rang de basanti mood climax it will be remembered long long time now last but not least supporting cast did splendid job which is crucial such huge feature everyone lived out their respective characters with special mention court room scenes hunger strike scenes cell there is lot young indians should learn this movie which turn would make bhagats sacrifices worthwhile sure winner first shot last highly recommended must see which should get nothing less but 8 10,0.43470969089390143,0.14087510442773601,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,A LEGENDARY FILM,"Reavan recommends The Legend Of Bhagat Singh Product Rating : Plot revealed in review : Somewhat revealed`The Legend of Bhagat Singh' is an excellent example for flawless filming of the life of a magnificent martyr. Raj Kumar Santhoshi is a director known for raising many quiescent questions and not supplementing the same with adequate answers, but this film was entirely different. The director did the film under petrifying pressure rapidly racing it out with five other filmmakers in bringing the brilliant Bhagat to tinsel town. The superceding selection of authentic actors would have greatly given initial comfort to the director. Ajay Devgan as Bhagat Singh, Susan Singh as Sukhdev, Santhosh as Rajguru, Akilendra Mishra as Chandrasekar Azad, Raj Babbar and Farida Jalal as Bhagat's parents all of them made a mind-blowing mark for themselves in this miraculous movie and in the history of Bollywood. The sub cast lead by Amrita Rao, who plays fiancée were no inferior in delivering the goods. A particular mention to be made of the jailor, and the actors who played the roles of Emerson and Gandhiji .The soundest strength of the film was the amazing ability of Rajkumar Santhoshi to impeccably interweave sentiments and dramatic scenes amidst the course of the film , jubilantly justifying history all the way. The suitable sequences for the former fact are the court scene where gosh approves, Sarfaroshi Ki Tamana song, Bhagat's farewell to his mother etc. The cinematography and art direction have done wonderfully well to keep up with the classy cinema. The lyricist and dialogue writer have been efficiently equal to the tumultuous task and their resourceful role has been a pivotal point in the film. One phenomenal personality who had lent the cutting edge to this memorable movie is `Music Midas' a r rahman. The way rahman marvelously meddles with our minds, moods and music is yet another record of his activating ability and acquaintable acumen. He deserves a resolute round of applause for unbelievably using Sonu Nigam and Sukhwinder Singh. Though the film had not tipped TIPS, the producers benevolently at the baffling box office, the immaculate impact it created is not negligible. It is slowly and steadily creating a sound stardom for Bhagat Singh amongst the youth of the country, which was the cause of the film.",legendary film,reavan recommends legend bhagat singh product rating plot revealed review somewhat revealed legend bhagat singh is excellent example flawless filming life magnificent martyr raj kumar santhoshi is director known raising many quiescent questions not supplementing same with adequate answers but this film was entirely different director did film under petrifying pressure rapidly racing it out with five other filmmakers bringing brilliant bhagat tinsel town superceding selection authentic actors would have greatly given initial comfort director ajay devgan as bhagat singh susan singh as sukhdev santhosh as rajguru akilendra mishra as chandrasekar azad raj babbar farida jalal as bhagats parents all them made mind blowing mark themselves this miraculous movie history bollywood sub cast lead by amrita rao who plays fianc e were no inferior delivering goods particular mention be made jailor actors who played roles emerson gandhiji soundest strength film was amazing ability rajkumar santhoshi impeccably interweave sentiments dramatic scenes amidst course film jubilantly justifying history all way suitable sequences former fact are court scene where gosh approves sarfaroshi ki tamana song bhagats farewell his mother etc cinematography art direction have done wonderfully well keep up with classy cinema lyricist dialogue writer have been efficiently equal tumultuous task their resourceful role has been pivotal point film one phenomenal personality who had lent cutting edge this memorable movie is music midas r rahman way rahman marvelously meddles with our minds moods music is yet another record his activating ability acquaintable acumen he deserves resolute round applause unbelievably using sonu nigam sukhwinder singh though film had not tipped tips producers benevolently at baffling box office immaculate impact it created is not negligible it is slowly steadily creating sound stardom bhagat singh amongst youth country which was cause film,0.6661458333333332,0.3830729166666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,"A Fantastic Bio-pic on an Intriguing Figure, but Not Without Flaws","The Legend of Bhagat Singh is one of Indian cinema's most ambitious projects to date. After three years of painstaking research and set construction, veteran film maker Raj Kumar Santoshi and actor Ajay Devgan shot the film in a short stretch of six months. The film released early due to competition from other films dealing with roughly the same subject. Overall it's a pretty solid film but one can't help shake the feeling that it could have been a far superior product if it had been worked on for a short while longer.The film tells the entire life story of Indian freedom fighter and martyr Bhagat Singh who, in a nut shell, grew disillusioned with Gandhi's passive movement and lead an independent violent struggle against the British.Colonial India is recreated magnificently in the film and the British atrocities committed are portrayed with aplomb by the director. One can truly get a sense of how such frustrating conditions could drive youngsters to violence and revolt. Some of the film's strengths are its hard hitting portrayal of British atrocities, its court scenes and its action scenes.The film's biggest highlight is its lead performer, Indian actor Ajay Devgan. The actor single handedly manages to uplift even the most dull and unconvincing scenes in the film to a high quality level. His every expression and mannerism is carefully calculated to maximize his impact on the viewer. This man can move audiences to tears or wide smiles with just a few short lines and quick glances from his intense eyes. His work here is par excellence and can easily rival any work done by any grade-A actors the world over.The supporting cast is good as well, with fellow revolutionary Sukhdev (Indian stage actor Sushant Singh) Bhagat Singh's mother (Indian diva Farida Jalal) leaving lasting impressions as well.The last excellent thing about the movie is the music by renowned composer A.R. Rahman. The music is not as festive as Bollywood movies usually boast, but that's to be expected considering the subject of the film. The well crafted, soothing ethnic tunes manage to evoke the right emotions without seeming rash and distasteful.The film isn't without its weaknesses, however. For one, it's obviously a rushed effort. Segments of the script seem under developed and the impact of certain national tragedies on Bhagat Singh's mindset is never fleshed out as one would want them to be.Also, Bhagat Singh's political ideology (he was a communist, by the way) is never really spelled out for viewers. Instead, they are left to put together pieces for themselves connecting the dots from dialogs and incidents in the film to really figure out the main character's mindset and view points.The second half of the film moves at an awkward pace, sometimes lingering on minute details and other times racing ahead and skipping crucial events (which are referenced in later dialog). Finally, for a film that remains very objective in presenting most events, viewers will be surprised by a very negative portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi and India's first Prime Minister Nehru. This angle of the film stuck out like a sore thumb to say the least.For all its faults however, Legend of Bhagat Singh has plenty of strengths to make it a superb film. It tells a great story with style and conviction. It has wonderful performances including one of finest performances ever in Indian cinema by Devgan. It has great action, moving drama, soothing music, and is (overall) a thoroughly rewarding and entertaining experience. It comes highly recommended by me.",fantastic bio pic intriguing figure but not without flaws,legend bhagat singh is one indian cinemas most ambitious projects date after three years painstaking research set construction veteran film maker raj kumar santoshi actor ajay devgan shot film short stretch six months film released early due competition other films dealing with roughly same subject overall its pretty solid film but one cant help shake feeling that it could have been far superior product if it had been worked short while longer film tells entire life story indian freedom fighter martyr bhagat singh who nut shell grew disillusioned with gandhis passive movement lead independent violent struggle against british colonial india is recreated magnificently film british atrocities committed are portrayed with aplomb by director one can truly get sense how such frustrating conditions could drive youngsters violence revolt some films strengths are its hard hitting portrayal british atrocities its court scenes its action scenes films biggest highlight is its lead performer indian actor ajay devgan actor single handedly manages uplift even most dull unconvincing scenes film high quality level his every expression mannerism is carefully calculated maximize his impact viewer this man can move audiences tears or wide smiles with just few short lines quick glances his intense eyes his work here is par excellence can easily rival any work done by any grade actors world over supporting cast is good as well with fellow revolutionary sukhdev indian stage actor sushant singh bhagat singhs mother indian diva farida jalal leaving lasting impressions as well last excellent thing about movie is music by renowned composer r rahman music is not as festive as bollywood movies usually boast but thats be expected considering subject film well crafted soothing ethnic tunes manage evoke right emotions without seeming rash distasteful film isnt without its weaknesses however one its obviously rushed effort segments script seem under developed impact certain national tragedies bhagat singhs mindset is never fleshed out as one would want them be also bhagat singhs political ideology he was communist by way is never really spelled out viewers instead they are left put together pieces themselves connecting dots dialogs incidents film really figure out main characters mindset view points second half film moves at awkward pace sometimes lingering minute details other times racing ahead skipping crucial events which are referenced later dialog finally film that remains very objective presenting most events viewers will be surprised by very negative portrayal mahatma gandhi indias first prime minister nehru this angle film stuck out like sore thumb say least all its faults however legend bhagat singh has plenty strengths make it superb film it tells great story with style conviction it has wonderful performances including one finest performances ever indian cinema by devgan it has great action moving drama soothing music is overall thoroughly rewarding entertaining experience it comes highly recommended by me,0.46636829415310416,0.10865280289330921,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Excellent representation of one of India's freedom fighters,"The Legend of Bhagat Singh is a wonderful representation of India, in the middle of its struggle to throw the British out. As with any with movie with a historical basis, I was a nervous that Bollywood would use artistic license to cheapen the story. In fact, the director, Santoshi shows in details how Bhagat came to develop his views of the British with very little outside distraction.Ajay Devgan is excellent as a the title character, bringing the necessary passion that only he can provide with his steel-y stare. Of particular note is the scene showing the freedom fighters telling Gandhi to stop working within the British framework. Westerners can see the parallel between Gandhi's nonviolent methods and the more revolutionary Bhagat Singh with Martin Luther King's methods vs Malcolm X ""by any means necessary"" credo.As the last reviewer mentioned, it's a great reference for those interested in India's independence struggle and it truly reinvigorated my interest in Indian history.See this movie if you enjoy eastern history, but won't go for the traditional Bollywood flick.",excellent representation one indias freedom fighters,legend bhagat singh is wonderful representation india middle its struggle throw british out as with any with movie with historical basis i was nervous that bollywood would use artistic license cheapen story fact director santoshi shows details how bhagat came develop his views british with very little outside distraction ajay devgan is excellent as title character bringing necessary passion that only he can provide with his steel y stare particular note is scene showing freedom fighters telling gandhi stop working within british framework westerners can see parallel between gandhis nonviolent methods more revolutionary bhagat singh with martin luther kings methods vs malcolm x by any means necessary credo as last reviewer mentioned its great reference those interested indias independence struggle it truly reinvigorated my interest indian history see this movie if you enjoy eastern history but wont go traditional bollywood flick,0.508695652173913,0.24375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.44}"

10.0,Very intense and thought provoking,"As I preach that comments are and should be taken no more than personal opinion of an individual, I, right at the outset would say that GO, GET & WATCH this masterpiece. The director seems to have done his homework properly. Very realistic sets, appearance of characters. As far as story is concerned or better say truthfulness of the story is concerned, history poses as one of the toughest problem. There is no going back. The conflict between Gandhi's non-violence and Bhagat Singh's Tit for Tat philosophy is one of the most touching points of the movie. It eventually leads to execution of Bhagat Singh. How true is that? I am wondering and will always wonder with hope that either Gandhi or Bhagat Singh would come in my dreams and tell me what the truth was. But nevertheless, it is a great movie to watch which will stir emotions. Ajay as Bhgat Singh is brilliant. He is among the finest actors in India indubitably. The other character that impresses is Sushant Singh who makes an impact with his intense performance. All in all, all have done justice with their characters and fit well. Director did good home work and hence a movie that we should be proud of is out there on someone who is perhaps not internationally as famous as Gandhi but for sure was a great freedom fighter, real patriot and a great son of Mother India.",very intense thought provoking,as i preach that comments are should be taken no more than personal opinion individual i right at outset would say that go get watch this masterpiece director seems have done his homework properly very realistic sets appearance characters as far as story is concerned or better say truthfulness story is concerned history poses as one toughest problem there is no going back conflict between gandhis non violence bhagat singhs tit tat philosophy is one most touching points movie it eventually leads execution bhagat singh how true is that i am wondering will always wonder with hope that either gandhi or bhagat singh would come my dreams tell me what truth was but nevertheless it is great movie watch which will stir emotions ajay as bhgat singh is brilliant he is among finest actors india indubitably other character that impresses is sushant singh who makes impact with his intense performance all all all have done justice with their characters fit well director did good home work hence movie that we should be proud is out there someone who is perhaps not internationally as famous as gandhi but sure was great freedom fighter real patriot great son mother india,0.6305390211640213,0.3411408730158731,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8.0,"Patriotic - Revolutionizing treat, worth watching!","Tone, Script & Story: The movie moves around, the story of revolutionaries of British ruled India. Some of the major revolutionaries which are portrayed are Bhagat Singh, RajGuru, SukhDev and ChandraShekar Azad. The incidences that are filmed include jallianwala bagh massacre, Kakori train robbery, establishing HRA (further modified as HSRA), Simon Go Back protest, killing of John Saunders, Assembly Bombing, Fasting in prison for equal rights (and achieving success), finally being hanged till death (Bhagat Singh, RajGuru, SukhDev) or suicide (ChandraShekar Azad).The movie is very patriotic. It shows conflicting ideas between congress headed by Gandhiji and HRA (further modified as HSRA). The movie shows Bhagat's take to revolutionize people of India through think tank of young blood. He suceeded in conveying apparatus for making Bomb to Indians via press, he also succeded in gaining equal rights for all prisoners (English and Indian's alike) and accepting death as punishment with pride. All this while watching in the movie gives one a dose of adrenalin rushing in their veins.Bhagat's family was welthy enough. They were able to pay 60000, even in those days to provide him bail. Despite such wealth he chose to become revolutionary. The movie informs us about fasting which lasted for atleast 63 days. It had never happened in history before.

9.0,History Done Right,"I saw this movie after I saw Rang De Basanti. It seems like the title of Rang De Basanti came from the song that Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru are marching to the gallows. Well, many things bothered me about Rang De Basanti. You have these young men with no purpose suddenly decide an assassination is their goal in life. That seemed so distasteful. So when the young men in The Legend devote themselves to revolution and moreover to removal of class distinctions, you at least feel they have some compass. The assassination they carry out follows a brutal massacre of numerous men women and children. The bombing is carried out in such a way to attract attention without killing or injuring. It is just a better feeling than I got in Rang De Basanti. In RDB, the female lead is highly distressed by the use to which her movie is put. The women in The Legend of Bhagat Singh are simply frightened by the danger their men are courting. In the end they understand the nobility of the cause.Anyway, this is just a much better movie. It does a good, and I think accurate, job of recreating some important Indian history. And the parts are well acted. That's why I rate it 9 out of 10.",history done right,i saw this movie after i saw rang de basanti it seems like title rang de basanti came song that singh sukhdev rajguru are marching gallows well many things bothered me about rang de basanti you have these young men with no purpose suddenly decide assassination is their goal life that seemed so distasteful so when young men legend devote themselves revolution moreover removal class distinctions you at least feel they have some compass assassination they carry out follows brutal massacre numerous men women children bombing is carried out such way attract attention without killing or injuring it is just better feeling than i got rang de basanti rdb female lead is highly distressed by use which her movie is put women legend bhagat singh are simply frightened by danger their men are courting end they understand nobility cause anyway this is just much better movie it does good i think accurate job recreating some important indian history parts are well acted thats why i rate it 9 out 10,0.5407142857142857,0.109484126984127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8.0,An individual dies but enlivens a nation,"In the darkness of the night of the 23rd day of the month of March in the year 1931, three dead bodies were burnt in a jungle near Ferozepur (Punjab). The sparks coming out their bodies set the minds of a whole population on fire. A revolution broke out. A nation awakened.These dead bodies were of three great Indian martyrs - Shivraam Rajguru, Sukhdev Thaapar and Sardaar Bhagat Singh. All being barely 23-24 years old, sacrificed their lives for the cause of liberating their motherland from the shackles of slavery, the colonial rule of the British. Sardaar Bhagat Singh was the first among equals in this threesome.Born in the house of Sardaar Kishan Singh from the stomach of a brave lady - Vidyavati, Bhagat Singh learnt to love his nation and hate the foreign rule since his early childhood. His uncle, Sardaar Ajeet Singh was a great patriot who spent a major part of his life either in jail or in exile. In such a great family, this great son of India was born with abundant love for his nation in his genes.A number of movies have been made in Bollywood on the life of this great thinker cum martyr. I consider Shaheed (1965) as the best movie made on the life of this legend. The movie which I consider the second best in this context is The Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002.True to its title, The Legend of Bhagat Singh narrates the legend of this revolutionary from birth to death, covering the historical incidents taking place in that period (1907-1931). Rajkumar Santoshi has directed this movie after a lot of research work. Still a couple of lacunaes got overlooked. At the time of the Chauri Chaura incident (1922) in which a mob had burnt a police station killing many policemen, Bhagat Singh was 14-15 years old but in the movie, Santoshi has committed the blunder of showing him as 10 years old. Besides, the movie portrays Mahatma Gandhi in badlight (he appears to be a supporter of the British) which could have been avoided through careful drafting of the script.If we ignore these deficiencies, The Legend of Bhagat Singh is a highly authentic and sensitive movie which portrays the life and conveys the message of the great visionary with a high intensity of passion. The movie unlike the other Bhagat Singh based movies, gives proper footage and importance to his fellow martyrs - Sukhdev and Rajguru. In fact, this is the only movie in which these two martyrs have been described in detail and with realism. The character of the leader of the revolutionary group, Chandra Shekhar Aazaad has been given ample footage and his greatness has been brought to fore with vehemence, still his character has not been allowed to overshadow that of Bhagat Singh.The biggest plus point of this movie is that it has put greater emphasis on the philosophy and thoughts of Bhagat Singh than his armed activities. In discussions inside the revolutionary group as well as in the high tempo drama in the courtroom, the director has focused on the ideas of the young legend whose tender age did not match the maturity of his brains. He was able to look beyond the immediate goal of attainment of political freedom and visualize the future state of affairs in the nation. He understood the reality and knew what should be the ideal state of affairs post freedom. He knew that substition of old masters by news masters will not change the fortunes of the country. The system that ensured exploitation and oppression of the resourceless and the underdog by the resourceful and the mighty, had to be changed. Then only the freedom could be called freedom in the true sense. The movie presents these ideas from the mouth of the great martyr with such a clarify that is rarely seen in the Indian movies.Technically, the movie is marvellous. The production value is high. The art director and the cinematographer have left no stone unturned in bringing that bygone era alive on the screen. Everything has been shown with a high degree of authenticity. The movie is not unduly long and certain events not supported by the historical records have been avoided. Despite dealing with real life episodes, the movie has not been reduced to a documentary. It is very interesting from beginning to end.Dialogues are quite praiseworthy. The discussion between Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev regarding the arrest after throwing the harmless bomb and the pamphlets in the central assembly, is damn impressive. A.R. Rehman has composed the music according to the patriotic flavour of the movie. In addition to the songs written by the martyrs themselves, i.e., Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna, Mera Rang De Basanti Chola and Pagadi Sambhaal Jatta; Desh Mere Desh Mere Meri Jaan Hai Tu and Maahi Ve specially impress among the songs which are all admirable. Sameer has written good lyrics for the songs.Ajay Devgan quite deservingly won the national award for the best actor for this movie. His eyes speak a lot. He not just played the role. He seems to have lived a minuscule life of the immortal hero. Ditto for Sushant Singh as Sukhdev who got perhaps the meatiest role of his acting career and shined like anything. Farida Jalaal as Bhagat Singh's mother, Raj Babbar as his father and D. Santosh as Rajguru are fabulous. Despite his age being on the higher side, Akhilendra Mishra has left a big impression in the role of Chandra Shekhar Aazaad and the scene of his death is a tear-jerker. All others have done their cameos with perfection. Even the smallest character has not been ignored and allowed to maintain its identity.I pay my tribute to the immortal martyr whose legend will continue to be told generations after generations.",individual dies but enlivens nation,darkness night 23rd day month march year 1931 three dead bodies were burnt jungle near ferozepur punjab sparks coming out their bodies set minds whole population fire revolution broke out nation awakened these dead bodies were three great indian martyrs shivraam rajguru sukhdev thaapar sardaar bhagat singh all being barely 23 24 years old sacrificed their lives cause liberating their motherland shackles slavery colonial rule british sardaar bhagat singh was first among equals this threesome born house sardaar kishan singh stomach brave lady vidyavati bhagat singh learnt love his nation hate foreign rule since his early childhood his uncle sardaar ajeet singh was great patriot who spent major part his life either jail or exile such great family this great son india was born with abundant love his nation his genes number movies have been made bollywood life this great thinker cum martyr i consider shaheed 1965 as best movie made life this legend movie which i consider second best this context is legend bhagat singh 2002 true its title legend bhagat singh narrates legend this revolutionary birth death covering historical incidents taking place that period 1907 1931 rajkumar santoshi has directed this movie after lot research work still couple lacunaes got overlooked at time chauri chaura incident 1922 which mob had burnt police station killing many policemen bhagat singh was 14 15 years old but movie santoshi has committed blunder showing him as 10 years old besides movie portrays mahatma gandhi badlight he appears be supporter british which could have been avoided through careful drafting script if we ignore these deficiencies legend bhagat singh is highly authentic sensitive movie which portrays life conveys message great visionary with high intensity passion movie unlike other bhagat singh based movies gives proper footage importance his fellow martyrs sukhdev rajguru fact this is only movie which these two martyrs have been described detail with realism character leader revolutionary group chandra shekhar aazaad has been given ample footage his greatness has been brought fore with vehemence still his character has not been allowed overshadow that bhagat singh biggest plus point this movie is that it has put greater emphasis philosophy thoughts bhagat singh than his armed activities discussions inside revolutionary group as well as high tempo drama courtroom director has focused ideas young legend whose tender age did not match maturity his brains he was able look beyond immediate goal attainment political freedom visualize future state affairs nation he understood reality knew what should be ideal state affairs post freedom he knew that substition old masters by news masters will not change fortunes country system that ensured exploitation oppression resourceless underdog by resourceful mighty had be changed then only freedom could be called freedom true sense movie presents these ideas mouth great martyr with such clarify that is rarely seen indian movies technically movie is marvellous production value is high art director cinematographer have left no stone unturned bringing that bygone era alive screen everything has been shown with high degree authenticity movie is not unduly long certain events not supported by historical records have been avoided despite dealing with real life episodes movie has not been reduced documentary it is very interesting beginning end dialogues are quite praiseworthy discussion between bhagat singh sukhdev regarding arrest after throwing harmless bomb pamphlets central assembly is damn impressive r rehman has composed music according patriotic flavour movie addition songs written by martyrs themselves i e sarfaroshi ki tamanna mera rang de basanti chola pagadi sambhaal jatta desh mere desh mere meri jaan hai tu maahi ve specially impress among songs which are all admirable sameer has written good lyrics songs ajay devgan quite deservingly won national award best actor this movie his eyes speak lot he not just played role he seems have lived minuscule life immortal hero ditto sushant singh as sukhdev who got perhaps meatiest role his acting career shined like anything farida jalaal as bhagat singhs mother raj babbar as his father d santosh as rajguru are fabulous despite his age being higher side akhilendra mishra has left big impression role chandra shekhar aazaad scene his death is tear jerker all others have done their cameos with perfection even smallest character has not been ignored allowed maintain its identity i pay my tribute immortal martyr whose legend will continue be told generations after generations,0.4662950058072008,0.23809668989547036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9.0,"Epic, Educational and Entertaining","A historical is probably the toughest kind of film to make. One has to not only educate the viewer but also enlighten and entertain the audience. T.L.O.B.S scores in may fields but it works mainly because it tells a simple story of a complicated man with extreme sincerity. Story? Well if you're Indian and you don't know the story of Bhagat Singh - then you're probably not worth telling it to. If you're not Indian and you don't know the story - I strongly recommend you watch this one instead of reading my mediocre narration. T.L.O.B.S. takes us to the world of Bhagat Singh and a country under British Rule. That's another plus of the movie. It feels so real yet magnificent. I've always been a fan of Raj Kumar Santoshi and I feel the reason he stands out is because nobody can make a better hard hitting drama than him. In T.L.O.B.S. as well, he gives us some shocking scenes and clap-worthy dialogue. Bhagat Singh's transition into a fearless freedom fighter is shown with brilliance. Also, the courtroom scenes are gripping due to powerful direction. There are some minor flaws here and there. The main problem I have with the film is in the narrative. Santoshi has packed a lot into the picture but he forgot to insert a few things that I felt were important since you're making a film on his life. First, how did Bhagat feel when he cut his hair? What about his parents? Also, Bhagat Singh's atheism is not explained well enough. I felt those things needed to be added in the film. There is also a point in the second half when one feels the narrative starts to stretch and nothing is happening. Editing is not crisp enough. The writing is terrific for the most part. The screenplay is straightforward and has only one objective – to tell a story of a legend. Another thing, the film is not afraid to express itself but it also does not jump to conclusions. Note the scenes that feature Mahatma Gandhi. Those are some significant portions and they depict truth more than opinion. A.R. Rahman's music is underrated. In fact, I liked most of the songs and I felt that they were not given enough appreciation, but then again, neither was this film. The technical aspects are all brilliant from cinematography to sound. I would like to point out another thing here – the background score is just out of this world.Santoshi always extracts the best performances from his actors and this film is no exception. The film belongs to Ajay Devgan and there should be no doubt. Before watching this, I did not really see Ajay as a Bhagat Singh because despite him being a Sikh, it did not suit him – but boy was I surprised. He puts even more life into an already powerful character. Just Amazing.Another performance I'd like to mention is of Sushant Singh – who I felt was another surprise. He's terrific. The guy who plays Rajguru is also efficient. Raj Babbar is a delight to watch and Farida Jalal is as always, wonderful. Amrita Rao is okay. The hero her is Raj Kumar Santoshi over anybody else. A brilliant director who back to form after giving a few average to below average films in China Gate, Pukar and Lajja. This is Santoshi at his best.Overall – A brilliant take on a freedom fighter that many have not justified. Ultimately, the film motivates you to also tell the story of a legend named Bhagat Singh. 4.5/5",epic educational entertaining,historical is probably toughest kind film make one has not only educate viewer but also enlighten entertain audience t l o b s scores may fields but it works mainly because it tells simple story complicated man with extreme sincerity story well if youre indian you dont know story bhagat singh then youre probably not worth telling it if youre not indian you dont know story i strongly recommend you watch this one instead reading my mediocre narration t l o b s takes us world bhagat singh country under british rule thats another plus movie it feels so real yet magnificent ive always been fan raj kumar santoshi i feel reason he stands out is because nobody can make better hard hitting drama than him t l o b s as well he gives us some shocking scenes clap worthy dialogue bhagat singhs transition into fearless freedom fighter is shown with brilliance also courtroom scenes are gripping due powerful direction there are some minor flaws here there main problem i have with film is narrative santoshi has packed lot into picture but he forgot insert few things that i felt were important since youre making film his life first how did bhagat feel when he cut his hair what about his parents also bhagat singhs atheism is not explained well enough i felt those things needed be added film there is also point second half when one feels narrative starts stretch nothing is happening editing is not crisp enough writing is terrific most part screenplay is straightforward has only one objective tell story legend another thing film is not afraid express itself but it also does not jump conclusions note scenes that feature mahatma gandhi those are some significant portions they depict truth more than opinion r rahmans music is underrated fact i liked most songs i felt that they were not given enough appreciation but then again neither was this film technical aspects are all brilliant cinematography sound i would like point out another thing here background score is just out this world santoshi always extracts best performances his actors this film is no exception film belongs ajay devgan there should be no doubt before watching this i did not really see ajay as bhagat singh because despite him being sikh it did not suit him but boy was i surprised he puts even more life into already powerful character just amazing another performance id like mention is sushant singh who i felt was another surprise hes terrific guy who plays rajguru is also efficient raj babbar is delight watch farida jalal is as always wonderful amrita rao is okay hero her is raj kumar santoshi over anybody else brilliant director who back form after giving few average below average films china gate pukar lajja this is santoshi at his best overall brilliant take freedom fighter that many have not justified ultimately film motivates you also tell story legend named bhagat singh 4 5 5,0.5744847192608387,0.20024875621890548,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,"Great freedom fighter of India, overshadowed by Corrupt politicians and Gandhi followers","The legacy of Bhagat Singh told in a fine way, the movie is a benchmark, its very very different from the normal stereotype movies, which goes ga ga on Ghandhi and depicts That the Freedom struggle and the independence movement has everything to do with Gandhi alone. The movie shows the love for the country by this youth, who quits Education, family, relationships, marriage, money, fame & kisses death @ the age of 23 & shows Ghandhi in true colors, a well established leader who has great powers & influence, but who fails to save the 3 youths Bagat, Rajguru and Sukhdev for his political gains and ideologies The movie starts with child Bhagat, who witnesses the autocrats of Britishers.. he grows up in the patriotic atmosphere as his parents and uncle take part in active freedom struggles, As a Kid, Bhagat is a great follower of Ghandi, his principals and follows him.@ the age of 12 he witnesses the Jalianwala Bagh massacre & gets highly disturbed by it The movie than switches to a young Bhagat(Ajay) in college silent yet furious in thoughts ..he joins the HRA(later known as Hindustan Socialist Republican Association) He quits Religion, adapts Atheism & communism ideologies, Walks away from home as his father arrange marriage for him.. with the death of the top leaders of HRA, he jumps in to action and takes the party forward, For taking revenge of Lala Lajpat Rai's death he and other revolutionaries plot Saunders murder and execute it, he becomes wanted by British govt @ that time he throws bomb in the assembly, surrenders to police, so that he could make his voice reach to the general public via the prosecution process He is successful in it, the people start hearing to the views of the young and vibrant Bhagat Singh, whose demands and ideas are way ahead of Ghandi, when its about the people farmers, workers, traders, poor etc & The demand for total Independence above everything the current Indian leader Ghandi is forced to demand what Bhagat has demanded to sustain his image This is the historical movement, where Bhagat's popularity is parallel to that of Ghandhi if not above him.

7.0,Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna...,"The struggle for independence rested on the twin pillars of Gandhi's non-violent protest and the 'tit-for-tat by any means possible' protest spearheaded by Azad, Bismil and Bhagat Singh. The Legend of Bhagat Singh traces the life and times of Bhagat Singh. The film starts as a jumbled collage of rapidly moving pictures, shows a very young Bhagat Singh who is witnessing the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre in a ""surreal"" way, then moves to his getting thoroughly disillusioned by the backtracking done by the Mahatma, and picks up steam as the young college student Bhagat turns into a firebrand. A ragtag team of comrades gather and nucleate around Chandra Shekhar Azad to rob the train going through Kakori. Then Saunders is murdered by the revolutionaries. Finally in an attempt to show the nation that they are serious revolutionaries and not terrorists and to win popular support for their cause, they blast a bomb in the assembly and are arrested. Many months in prison follow with deprivations, a fast to improve conditions in jail, torture and force feedings. The trio of Bhagat, Rajguru and Sukhdev are sentenced to hang for the murder of Saunders but not before the nation is energized and change is in the air.Who will not be inspired by such a stirring tale that is reasonably well told? But I cannot help compare this tale to the one told to us by Manoj Kumar in Shaheed. This vibrant colorful tale pales in comparison to that stirring take in black and white so many years ago. It seems heavily inspired by the older film, many songs and situations parallel the old. Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna was not penned in that jail - so if it was an add-on in Shaheed, it was certainly ""copied"" from that version here. TLOBS falls short in a few areas - it is overly dramatized in many segments and this is a shortcoming for a film that has the backdrop of patriotic fervor. Even a subtle film will do the job, and in fact might do it better as shown in Shaheed. The romantic interlude song was the most jarring, why was the Punjabi Kudi dreaming a fantasy number in the Kashmir mountains? I would have been happy with Sarson Ke Khet. The last song and the trio walking through an interminable Bhool Bhuliaya of corridors was not needed. And why were the women folk on the outside? Was the hanging not moved forward by 12 hours? These faults in the scripting made the film seem like a hurried effort.The acting ranged from very good to OK. Sushant Singh did a very commendable job as Sukhdev, as did Santosh as Rajguru, Ajay started out shaky but settled into the role quite well by the end of the film. Akhilendra Mishra was excellent as Aazd. The entire British cast was abysmal and the court scenes were quite bad. Bhagat's family was very well depicted. All in all I think this was a decent and informative film, but it could have been so much better if the director had been able to restrain the histrionics and the overly dramatic moments. I give it an A- for effort but only a B for the overall film.A word about the music - I hate to say this as I think AR Rahman is a genius. But the way the familiar songs Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna, Pagdi Sambhal and Mera Rang De Basanti were composed made them seem distorted. I wish he had stayed with the original tunes. This ruined the soundtrack for me.",sarfaroshi ki tamanna,struggle independence rested twin pillars gandhis non violent protest tit tat by any means possible protest spearheaded by azad bismil bhagat singh legend bhagat singh traces life times bhagat singh film starts as jumbled collage rapidly moving pictures shows very young bhagat singh who is witnessing jallianwalla bagh massacre surreal way then moves his getting thoroughly disillusioned by backtracking done by mahatma picks up steam as young college student bhagat turns into firebrand ragtag team comrades gather nucleate around chandra shekhar azad rob train going through kakori then saunders is murdered by revolutionaries finally attempt show nation that they are serious revolutionaries not terrorists win popular support their cause they blast bomb assembly are arrested many months prison follow with deprivations fast improve conditions jail torture force feedings trio bhagat rajguru sukhdev are sentenced hang murder saunders but not before nation is energized change is air who will not be inspired by such stirring tale that is reasonably well told but i cannot help compare this tale one told us by manoj kumar shaheed this vibrant colorful tale pales comparison that stirring take black white so many years ago it seems heavily inspired by older film many songs situations parallel old sarfaroshi ki tamanna was not penned that jail so if it was add shaheed it was certainly copied that version here tlobs falls short few areas it is overly dramatized many segments this is shortcoming film that has backdrop patriotic fervor even subtle film will do job fact might do it better as shown shaheed romantic interlude song was most jarring why was punjabi kudi dreaming fantasy number kashmir mountains i would have been happy with sarson ke khet last song trio walking through interminable bhool bhuliaya corridors was not needed why were women folk outside was hanging not moved forward by 12 hours these faults scripting made film seem like hurried effort acting ranged very good ok sushant singh did very commendable job as sukhdev as did santosh as rajguru ajay started out shaky but settled into role quite well by end film akhilendra mishra was excellent as aazd entire british cast was abysmal court scenes were quite bad bhagats family was very well depicted all all i think this was decent informative film but it could have been so much better if director had been able restrain histrionics overly dramatic moments i give it effort but only b overall film word about music i hate say this as i think ar rahman is genius but way familiar songs sarfaroshi ki tamanna pagdi sambhal mera rang de basanti were composed made them seem distorted i wish he had stayed with original tunes this ruined soundtrack me,0.4925108225108227,0.1318961038961039,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.3}"
