9,Awesome !!!!,"Well frankly saying it is a ten year wait to watch a full length romantic movie after ALAIPAYUTHE being released. Great work Gautam,the movie is very close to heart with no added ingredients.The movie is pure and simple, and the narration is excellent. It may not be the usual stuff with comedy and fights, but still its worth a watch more than once. The lead pair is terrific, with Simbu in a new avatar, a territory which he has never charted. Trisha is amazing as Jessie, many will fall in love for her after this movie. Definitely, this move can be one of their best performance till date. ARR is amazing as usual, the BGM and the songs are awesome. At many part u would be dragged into the movie unknowingly.Of course the movie has other routine Gautam stuff. Though it may not be convincing to everyone, but still all those who watch the movie will have one moment in the movie which will be close to them, if that is so then, the mission of the director is achieved. I would recommend this movie for all you people who waited for a romantic piece. A final word, Gautam should we wait for another 10 years for another romantic movie?",awesome,well frankly saying it is ten year wait watch full length romantic movie after alaipayuthe being released great work gautam movie is very close heart with no added ingredients movie is pure simple narration is excellent it may not be usual stuff with comedy fights but still its worth watch more than once lead pair is terrific with simbu new avatar territory which he has never charted trisha is amazing as jessie many will fall love her after this movie definitely this move can be one their best performance till date arr is amazing as usual bgm songs are awesome at many part u would be dragged into movie unknowingly course movie has other routine gautam stuff though it may not be convincing everyone but still all those who watch movie will have one moment movie which will be close them if that is so then mission director is achieved i would recommend this movie all you people who waited romantic piece final word gautam should we wait another 10 years another romantic movie,0.5745245825602969,0.32413033395176255,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.25}"
8,An Unusual Romantic Masterpiece,"Vinnai Thaandi Varuvaayaa(shortly ""VTV"")created a big buzz before its release but once it was released some of the audiences were pretty much disappointed by it but certain audiences like me or in my age group(20-25) loved the movie so much. The fact that it was typically a Gautham Vasudev Menon film and so i went in to the theater not expecting a big ""Mass"" opening song and lengthy dialogues to boast the hero's image but a decent reality film with excellent cinematography(Hats off Manoj Paramahamsa) and beautiful songs(""Oscar Winner"" A.R.Rahman Rocks!). I wasn't disappointed at all and i had a pretty good time observing the chemistry between Karthik(A Good-Looking Smart Silambarasan worth his title of ""Young Superstar"")and Jesse(A Ravishing Trisha)and what are all the phases they go through throughout the entire movie till the climax. I was deeply moved by the situations that the lead are put to that tests their strength of love rather vaguely. Songs are the biggest plus for the movie and with A.R.R at the helm you can't expect anything less than a riveting music and an excellent BGM. A.R.R. shines in both these with his usual trademark. Whoever says whatever about the movie nobody can take back that VTV is indeed a different attempt in modern day Love stories. Want to know why? Just go for it!

10,a timeless classic,"Vinnaithandi Varuvaya, the much expected and much-hyped movie of Gautam Vasudev Menon with Simbhu & Trisha in the lead is a timeless classic in all aspects.The songs already hit the chart busters with A.R.Rahman's Magical Music which helped create anticipation for the movie.i had seen the movie 8 times and i am still counting. Even in action films like Kaakka Kaakka and Vettayadu Vilaiyadu and family drama like Vaaranam Aayiram, the romantic scenes are refreshing with cute & chirpy dialogs. Since it's a full-fledged romantic movie I never wanna miss this.i am an Oriya but i like to watch south movies with English subs.i am a great fan of Mani Ratnam and Gotham Menon and i just love to watch their movies.The movie is all about Karthik, an aspiring film maker and Jessi, a program Analyst working in Polaris. It starts in Jessi's wedding at a Church where Karthik narrates his flashback. We simply forget Simbhu and Tisha and can see only Karthik and Jessi romancing. He falls in Love with the ravishing Jessi at the first sight . She goes to Alleppy to spend a week vacation with her grandma. Soon Karthik follows her to Alleppy to say sorry to her. This time the director himself has added a dialog referring to VA. Seems Gautham is still in VA hangover. Meanwhile he befriends Ganesh, a cinematographer and tries to join as an assistant to director K.S.Ravikumar with his reference. Ganesh supports his love and accompanies him to Kerala. Karthik asks Jassi to forgive for his behavior and wants to be a friend with her. Jassi likes the way he proposed and also the way he said sorry. She likes his courage and befriends him like Meghna of VA. She starts loving him but denies to accept it since his parents are staunch Christians and will never allow to marry a Hindu guy. But she wants to be with him just as a friend. Their parents come to know about their affair and Jassi's parents arrange for her marriage while Karthik's parents shift their house to another area. Jassi leave for Kerala for her marriage. Karthik goes to Kerala with Ganesh and narrates the story to us till this part.The story has the twist in its 2nd half which is the highlight of the movie. Unlike other Gautam movies, the 2nd half is pretty interesting despite its slow pace. I don't want to disclose the twist. It has a very good feel of romance. I bet that it would rekindle your Love in the present and in the past and it would take a long time to come out of the impact.Both Simbu and Trisha have given their best performances till date. Both of them share a good chemistry. Trisha sheds her Glam doll role and steals our heart as Jassi. Simbhu sans his finger mannerisms, punch dialogs, double triple meaning sleazy dialogs makes a strong impression as Karthik. . He's simply mind blowing when he describes the girl in his heart. Apart from the lead couple it's Ganesh who comes throughout the movie without breaking the flow of the movie. Thanks to Mr.Menon for not casting a popular comedian for that role which would be a compromise for C Center audience. K.S.Ravikumar comes now and then as director and makes us laugh st times. Bob Anthony, the yesteryear villain does a neat job as Trisha's stubborn father. His brother looks like a puck rowdy with Gautham's rugged voice. We can't believe it's Trisha's brother. Very bad choice. Her mother- Ayyo Paavam!!! Kitty and Uma Padmanabhan are just okay as Simbhu's parents. Why they were not shown in the 2nd half? His sister doesn't make any mark. Simbhu's voice modulation could have been better.Music- The greatest asset of the movie right from the beginning till the end with excellent background score. I don't like all the songs since they are lyrically-challenged. I thought Thamarai had less job to do with 6-7 lines per song with repetitive verses. But it's so much related to the movie. Esp Kannukkul Kannai & Mannippaya. The bitter truth is the lyrics are dominated by Rahman's Music unlike Harris' who gives importance to lyrics in some songs. The Picturisation of Hosannah, Omana Penne and Kannukkul Kannai are visual delight but I didn't like my favorite Mannippaya on screen. It lacks the feel that Shreya Ghoshal has in her voice. It was pictured as a happy duet instead of the melancholic lyrics. It should have come after their separation. Similarly the Picturization of Aaromale is also not so apt as far as the lyrics are concerned.Manoj Paramahamsa is the eye of the director. The locales of Alappuzha, Malta Island, and Sinbhu-Trisha's house are treat to watch. We can feel the story is happening in our next home. He's done a fabulous job post Eeram.A special mention to singer Chinmayi who has done a wonderful job by lending her voice to Trisha with exact Tamil and Malayalam accents. The way she says Karthik is so lovely and romantic. Does she have a BF named Karthik? Great job Chins! Also to Nalini Sriram for giving decent and elegant costumes to Trisha and making her looking gorgeous. (Esp the first blue Saree till the red Saree in the climax). Simbhu too looks so smart with his casual shirts.On a whole, the movie is a must-watch. If you watch movies for time-pass and expect action, mas ala, item numbers, it's not your cup pa. It's not for those who see movies, it for those who feel movies. After Alaipayuthe, I loved this as a full and full romantic movie without any action, comedy sequences (almost after a decade). Don't miss it if u love LOVE! My Rating : 5/5",timeless classic,vinnaithandi varuvaya much expected much hyped movie gautam vasudev menon with simbhu trisha lead is timeless classic all aspects songs already hit chart busters with r rahmans magical music which helped create anticipation movie i had seen movie 8 times i am still counting even action films like kaakka kaakka vettayadu vilaiyadu family drama like vaaranam aayiram romantic scenes are refreshing with cute chirpy dialogs since its full fledged romantic movie i never wanna miss this i am oriya but i like watch south movies with english subs i am great fan mani ratnam gotham menon i just love watch their movies movie is all about karthik aspiring film maker jessi program analyst working polaris it starts jessis wedding at church where karthik narrates his flashback we simply forget simbhu tisha can see only karthik jessi romancing he falls love with ravishing jessi at first sight she goes alleppy spend week vacation with her grandma soon karthik follows her alleppy say sorry her this time director himself has added dialog referring va seems gautham is still va hangover meanwhile he befriends ganesh cinematographer tries join as assistant director k s ravikumar with his reference ganesh supports his love accompanies him kerala karthik asks jassi forgive his behavior wants be friend with her jassi likes way he proposed also way he said sorry she likes his courage befriends him like meghna va she starts loving him but denies accept it since his parents are staunch christians will never allow marry hindu guy but she wants be with him just as friend their parents come know about their affair jassis parents arrange her marriage while karthiks parents shift their house another area jassi leave kerala her marriage karthik goes kerala with ganesh narrates story us till this part story has twist its 2nd half which is highlight movie unlike other gautam movies 2nd half is pretty interesting despite its slow pace i dont want disclose twist it has very good feel romance i bet that it would rekindle your love present past it would take long time come out impact both simbu trisha have given their best performances till date both them share good chemistry trisha sheds her glam doll role steals our heart as jassi simbhu sans his finger mannerisms punch dialogs double triple meaning sleazy dialogs makes strong impression as karthik hes simply mind blowing when he describes girl his heart apart lead couple its ganesh who comes throughout movie without breaking flow movie thanks mr menon not casting popular comedian that role which would be compromise c center audience k s ravikumar comes now then as director makes us laugh st times bob anthony yesteryear villain does neat job as trishas stubborn father his brother looks like puck rowdy with gauthams rugged voice we cant believe its trishas brother very bad choice her mother ayyo paavam kitty uma padmanabhan are just okay as simbhus parents why they were not shown 2nd half his sister doesnt make any mark simbhus voice modulation could have been better music greatest asset movie right beginning till end with excellent background score i dont like all songs since they are lyrically challenged i thought thamarai had less job do with 6 7 lines per song with repetitive verses but its so much related movie esp kannukkul kannai mannippaya bitter truth is lyrics are dominated by rahmans music unlike harris who gives importance lyrics some songs picturisation hosannah omana penne kannukkul kannai are visual delight but i didnt like my favorite mannippaya screen it lacks feel that shreya ghoshal has her voice it was pictured as happy duet instead melancholic lyrics it should have come after their separation similarly picturization aaromale is also not so apt as far as lyrics are concerned manoj paramahamsa is eye director locales alappuzha malta island sinbhu trishas house are treat watch we can feel story is happening our next home hes done fabulous job post eeram special mention singer chinmayi who has done wonderful job by lending her voice trisha with exact tamil malayalam accents way she says karthik is so lovely romantic does she have bf named karthik great job chins also nalini sriram giving decent elegant costumes trisha making her looking gorgeous esp first blue saree till red saree climax simbhu too looks so smart with his casual shirts whole movie is must watch if you watch movies time pass expect action mas ala item numbers its not your cup pa its not those who see movies it those who feel movies after alaipayuthe i loved this as full full romantic movie without any action comedy sequences almost after decade dont miss it if u love love my rating 5 5,0.5002142857142856,0.22443121693121704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10,review....,"What a big expectation for this movie.......I think the BIGGEST for a romantic flick. 15 minutes in to the movie I thought this is the landmark one not only for the crew but also for the Tamil film industry. ohhh...is there any magic Gautham is spelling on his actresses? I promise by heart, I have never seen Trisha more beautiful than this.Let us get in to the first half... I can boldly say this is the best chemistry between the lead pair in the decade (not to forget alaipayudhe).What beautiful dialogues......same like Mani Ratnam...... And now I know why he chose Rahman for the music. It indeed forms the backbone of the movie. what a classical BG score..... Gautham is getting bigger with his movies.The main plus for his movies is that the critics have never been able to find out a point to make him down.And what a screenplay by this guy (though nobody is surprised here because even his Pachaikili Muthucharam which was less than impressive @ the BO,had a great screenplay)The second part of the movie now I don't think any different theme about love can be explored at this time as everything has already been made. So Gautham plays with the age old theme of boy meets girl of different religion andfalls in love and the girl fearing about their parents' acceptance. But of course he has put his midas touch at it. And it his hard at this stage of Tamil cinema to give out an out andout romantic flick and that too with the lead pair occupying around 90% of the screen space. The only flip for this movie is the slow pace at this part of the movie. The dialogues between the lead pair do tell me that he is the next one to take the mantle of Mani sir..... And all of us know that it is not only in romance he is good at but can do action flicks too like KK & VV.....Just the same way as Mani does.... But not a coincidence they both are at their best at romance....And finally the climax Any directors ability is fully answered only by the way he does his climax....and Gautham will get my maximum points for this climax...he does raise everybodys eyebrows after the climax...........Particularly this climax will stay in our minds for a long time to come..... this too comes the same way as Mani Ratnams",review,what big expectation this movie i think biggest romantic flick 15 minutes movie i thought this is landmark one not only crew but also tamil film industry ohhh is there any magic gautham is spelling his actresses i promise by heart i have never seen trisha more beautiful than this let us get first half i can boldly say this is best chemistry between lead pair decade not forget alaipayudhe what beautiful dialogues same like mani ratnam now i know why he chose rahman music it indeed forms backbone movie what classical bg score gautham is getting bigger with his movies main plus his movies is that critics have never been able find out point make him down what screenplay by this guy though nobody is surprised here because even his pachaikili muthucharam which was less than impressive bo had great screenplay second part movie now i dont think any different theme about love can be explored at this time as everything has already been made so gautham plays with age old theme boy meets girl different religion andfalls love girl fearing about their parents acceptance but course he has put his midas touch at it it his hard at this stage tamil cinema give out out andout romantic flick that too with lead pair occupying around 90 screen space only flip this movie is slow pace at this part movie dialogues between lead pair do tell me that he is next one take mantle mani sir all us know that it is not only romance he is good at but can do action flicks too like kk vv just same way as mani does but not coincidence they both are at their best at romance finally climax any directors ability is fully answered only by way he does his climax gautham will get my maximum points this climax he does raise everybodys eyebrows after climax particularly this climax will stay our minds long time come this too comes same way as mani ratnams,0.5042989417989417,0.20919312169312163,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.2}"

9,"Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa?? - "" the answer is NO""..","""Vinnaithaandi varuvaayaa"" is a feel good romantic movie by Gautham Vasudev Menon starring simbu and trisha After a successful Vaaranam Aayiram GVM ventures into his next project Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, focusing entirely on the best emotion in the world, LOVE, a subject that the brilliant director is known to handle with style, finesse, panache and a lot of heart. Although, VTV could have been an apt Valentine’s Day presentation, it nevertheless does not cease to impress the target audience, the YOUTH.VTV is all about falling in love, the emotions, confusions and the innumerable roller-coaster sensations associated with it. Karthik (Silambarasan), a mechanical engineer is an aspiring film director. It is love at first sight for this young man with his landlords daughter Jessy (Trisha), a Malayalee Christian and a computer professional. Karthik expresses his love to her in a quite unexpected manner but she does not accept it citing practical reasons. Notwithstanding her absence even for a short while, Karthik reaches Kerala along with his cinematographer friend Ganesh.He finds Jessy in the pretext of apologizing to her for his behavior but earns her friendship. The ensuing train trip to Chennai from Allapuzha paves way for a deeper bond between the two. Meanwhile Karthik rubs Jessy’s brother on the wrong side which creates a wedge between the two families and Karthiks family is made to vacate the premises. This triggers the hasty fixing of marriage for Jessy in Kerala. Needless to say, Karthik reaches there and what happens thereafter form the crux of Vinnaithaandi Varuavaayaa. The answers to questions like whether Karthik and Jessy unite in marriage or go their individual ways are narrated with a trademark Gautham Menon’s style.This is the first time Gautham teams up with A R Rahman and his music has already scorched the charts and the songs are the strong pillars to the film.The movie is a visual treat and characters are so real to make people believe.On the flip side the narration is very slow and is not suitable for commercial audience.As for me i consider the movie as a emotional heartbreak and the best work by GVM ever. hats off!!!!9/10..",vinnaithaandi varuvaayaa answer is no,vinnaithaandi varuvaayaa is feel good romantic movie by gautham vasudev menon starring simbu trisha after successful vaaranam aayiram gvm ventures into his next project vinnaithaandi varuvaayaa focusing entirely best emotion world love subject that brilliant director is known handle with style finesse panache lot heart although vtv could have been apt valentine s day presentation it nevertheless does not cease impress target audience youth vtv is all about falling love emotions confusions innumerable roller coaster sensations associated with it karthik silambarasan mechanical engineer is aspiring film director it is love at first sight this young man with his landlords daughter jessy trisha malayalee christian computer professional karthik expresses his love her quite unexpected manner but she does not accept it citing practical reasons notwithstanding her absence even short while karthik reaches kerala along with his cinematographer friend ganesh he finds jessy pretext apologizing her his behavior but earns her friendship ensuing train trip chennai allapuzha paves way deeper bond between two meanwhile karthik rubs jessy s brother wrong side which creates wedge between two families karthiks family is made vacate premises this triggers hasty fixing marriage jessy kerala needless say karthik reaches there what happens thereafter form crux vinnaithaandi varuavaayaa answers questions like whether karthik jessy unite marriage or go their individual ways are narrated with trademark gautham menon s style this is first time gautham teams up with r rahman his music has already scorched charts songs are strong pillars film movie is visual treat characters are so real make people believe flip side narration is very slow is not suitable commercial audience as me i consider movie as emotional heartbreak best work by gvm ever hats off 9 10,0.4872043010752688,0.21094086021505373,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10,Disowning the initial draft of VTV..,"This is not a review for a person who haven't watched the movie yet. This post is a comment on the storyline of VTV for someone who have already loved the movie.. :)In an interview Gautam Menon gave to Baradwaj Rangan about the short film Karthik Dial Seytha Yenn (sequel to VTV), he spoke about the nuances of Jessie's characterization when he explained how they had shot few sequences of Jessie going in search of Karthik during his shoot days in Goa, and that in the final edit the sequence got cut for what ever reasons. And you wouldn't believe me - that what-ever-reason is what VTV is for the unadulterated me!She happened to go to Goa where she encountered a misunderstanding scene of Karthik having an affair with the heroine there, which kinda not just reinforced her religious-family's hatred for movies and its culture, but to reject her (what for me is the purest form of 'Love' in a movie around that time) love for him.

As a golden rule in Tamil cinema's love, religion, father and every possible thing which comes to your mind put their love in disguise. And the story unfolds showing whether they have joined hands or left apart with an interesting climax.Performances: Simbhu has done a very nice underplay here and he shines. I always believe there is no such thing called a ""good actor"". Its all the director who pulls the talent out of an actor. And Gautam shows he is an expert in this in the form of Karthick's role.Trisha though looks pretty aged, blows us with her performance. She portrays a girl's emotions and the challenges which she undergoes with all finesse. Ganesh who comes as a friend of Karthick gets more applause than anyone when he utters those quirky remarks.Music: The world knows why Rahman is a genius. But at certain times, the music which has the upper hand sometimes suppresses the beautiful, poetic lyrics by Thamarai. Other than that Rahman tries fusing traditional Indian vocals with an awesome guitar play in Aaromale which is nothing short of a classic. Omana Penne, Manippaya gets better while watching on screen. Hosana is this year's Adiye Kolludhe! Its refreshingly new.Cinematography and Art: This guy simply blows away. Gautam shows his life he wanted to put on the screen through the lens' of this guy. A cinematographer or art director shouldn't be praised for his individual elements and tricks he employs in the movie. What matters is, even if its simple, how it gels with the flick really matters to me. in that sense Manoj and Raajevan win hands down. The choice of colors they used makes it simple but elegant in the screen.Editing: Antony should have been generously cut some 15 minutes of scenes in the second half as it spoils the flow of the flick.On the down side, songs were not in sync with the movie. Only when Aaromale and Mannipaya you feel a certain connectivity with the movie. Other songs though they feel good to hear, however doesn't go with the story. Being a little dragged during second half and songs every 10-15 minutes certainly spoils the movie's flow to an extent.But of late I didn't witness any honest story straight from the director like this. How frequent we come across a dialogue or a BGM playing in the movie make us getting goosebumps? The climax scene while trisha shaking hands with Simbhu and the Mannipaya playing in the background did bring me goosebumps. And this is why i like movies. When you feel for the character or you think yourself as a certain character, the director wins. And so Gautam Menon. Period.Forget the minor flaws(which could have been corrected by crisp editing) and whining about it.Watch a great, simple and honest love story with hurdles which they overcome being the ones you watched umpteen times in other movies but with a soul to it in VTV and with a different treatment.",vtv has soul,with many expectations like gautam menon ar rehmans new combination knack romance which gautam has delivers each his flicks i went see this result certainly i am way too satisfied with movie it exceeded all my expectations apparently it lived up its hype story karthick simbhu falls love with jessy trisha when he sees her first time typical gms love start jessy is orthodox christian family while karthick hails hindu family who aspires be director as golden rule tamil cinemas love religion father every possible thing which comes your mind put their love disguise story unfolds showing whether they have joined hands or left apart with interesting climax performances simbhu has done very nice underplay here he shines i always believe there is no such thing called good actor its all director who pulls talent out actor gautam shows he is expert this form karthicks role trisha though looks pretty aged blows us with her performance she portrays girls emotions challenges which she undergoes with all finesse ganesh who comes as friend karthick gets more applause than anyone when he utters those quirky remarks music world knows why rahman is genius but at certain times music which has upper hand sometimes suppresses beautiful poetic lyrics by thamarai other than that rahman tries fusing traditional indian vocals with awesome guitar play aaromale which is nothing short classic omana penne manippaya gets better while watching screen hosana is this years adiye kolludhe its refreshingly new cinematography art this guy simply blows away gautam shows his life he wanted put screen through lens this guy cinematographer or art director shouldnt be praised his individual elements tricks he employs movie what matters is even if its simple how it gels with flick really matters me that sense manoj raajevan win hands down choice colors they used makes it simple but elegant screen editing antony should have been generously cut some 15 minutes scenes second half as it spoils flow flick down side songs were not sync with movie only when aaromale mannipaya you feel certain connectivity with movie other songs though they feel good hear however doesnt go with story being little dragged during second half songs every 10 15 minutes certainly spoils movies flow extent but late i didnt witness any honest story straight director like this how frequent we come across dialogue or bgm playing movie make us getting goosebumps climax scene while trisha shaking hands with simbhu mannipaya playing background did bring me goosebumps this is why i like movies when you feel character or you think yourself as certain character director wins so gautam menon period forget minor flaws which could have been corrected by crisp editing whining about it watch great simple honest love story with hurdles which they overcome being ones you watched umpteen times other movies but with soul it vtv with different treatment,0.5035881590229416,0.20278567245958548,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9,Pure Magic... My Best romantic movie.. Left a lump in my throat and a heavy heart,"I have deducted 1 point only becos I think the climax was made a sad one just to draw audience.. becos sad endings mostly click at BO. But ya.. most real life love stories end in such a way.Things I liked: Cameraman Manoj paramahamsa who likes Blue color..Awesome works.. Even normal deserted streets look like Garden :-) I bow to ur effort.The way all the songs start slowly with the scene and carry on. There are no abrupt scene shifts.. The song slowly builds onto the scene. All songs are absolutely made according to the scene. ARR is divine in this.I have to accept that Simbu is very good and natural in the movie. Never seen him act so well. It suits him due to his tragic lover boy image. In the last part of movie, in Central Park when Karthik is imagining talking with Jessie explaining her abt his lover, his voice breaks and he is stopping himself from crying.. Simbu excels here.Trisha is also a surprise! Seeing her u feel the next door girl image .. natural beauty.. Especially Chimayi's wonderful dubbing.. So soft spoken, emotional :-) A typical end .. where the Girl is shown as a matured, practical and family oriented person and the guy is left alone, wounded and failed lover. Boo to Jessie!My favourite scenes (actually i liked every scene): Karthik explaining Jessie how he wants to sit next to her and not across the table.Jessie after walking away from church, explains to Karthik in her house how she likes him...Karthik drops Jessie and says whats happening.. why shud we be friends.. and Jessies says I hate u.. to which he replies.. Thank youScenes where Karthik asks .. This is love right.. Of course Ganesh :) provides good support and a very good friend to have.No over-the-top scenes, punch dialogues, unnecessary violence, sudden songs etc...Gautam menon... hats off.. He has made me feel as though I was in the movie and its all happening to me :-) Wonderful movie..A clean movie.. although traditional parents will not like it. Hope all directors and actors make such movies.This is the first movie to leave a lump in my Throat and a heavy heart. I am not that emotional a person, but this one knocked me off..I want to experience a love like this but a successful one. Would be interesting.",pure magic my best romantic movie left lump my throat heavy heart,i have deducted 1 point only becos i think climax was made sad one just draw audience becos sad endings mostly click at bo but ya most real life love stories end such way things i liked cameraman manoj paramahamsa who likes blue color awesome works even normal deserted streets look like garden i bow ur effort way all songs start slowly with scene carry there are no abrupt scene shifts song slowly builds onto scene all songs are absolutely made according scene arr is divine this i have accept that simbu is very good natural movie never seen him act so well it suits him due his tragic lover boy image last part movie central park when karthik is imagining talking with jessie explaining her abt his lover his voice breaks he is stopping himself crying simbu excels here trisha is also surprise seeing her u feel next door girl image natural beauty especially chimayis wonderful dubbing so soft spoken emotional typical end where girl is shown as matured practical family oriented person guy is left alone wounded failed lover boo jessie my favourite scenes actually i liked every scene karthik explaining jessie how he wants sit next her not across table jessie after walking away church explains karthik her house how she likes him karthik drops jessie says whats happening why shud we be friends jessies says i hate u which he replies thank youscenes where karthik asks this is love right course ganesh provides good support very good friend have no over top scenes punch dialogues unnecessary violence sudden songs etc gautam menon hats off he has made me feel as though i was movie its all happening me wonderful movie clean movie although traditional parents will not like it hope all directors actors make such movies this is first movie leave lump my throat heavy heart i am not that emotional person but this one knocked me off i want experience love like this but successful one would be interesting,0.568995157384988,0.1653813559322034,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.2}"

9,A different VTV review yet again,"A true tribute to Love, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya couldn't have come at a better time and thus it not only resurrects Tamil Cinema that has been rolling out annoyingly cockeyed experiments and demeaning formula flicks of late, but also thrusts it to a new level that can only be matched by pure Magic. VTV has had all kinds of positive reviews from all quarters including the critics that mostly analyzes the crucial movie-making aspects like direction, acting, music, cinematography etc and it wouldn't be wrong to declare that all these departments couldn't have blended better in this movie. Gautam's exclusive touch, ARR's hypnotic tunes, Simbu's innate acting skills, Trisha's ravishing beauty and Manoj's eye-popping visuals, though undeniably true, have been discussed and reviewed to death and therefore this review will not cover any of it fortunately.If one takes a deeper look as to why this movie had a stupendous response, it would be quite evident that it deals with a subject that keeps human species from going extinct, which is apparently ""Love"" or call it ""Romance"" in a more youthful way. Love is one of the very few things that people go crazy for, not to mention Money and Power. It is always refreshing to see the lead actors in such a movie behave naturally while romancing and deal with realistic situations as we would see in the life of a boy/girl next door. It not only gives a pragmatic facet to the film-making but also provides a hardly-witnessed dimension of seeing ourselves on the big screen. Although most successful movies have piggybacked on this aspect, VTV has easily managed to take it many steps further and achieved an insurmountable level of connectivity with the audience. When such a phenomenon occurs, movie-goers would not mind watching the movie over and over again, which inturn leads to its commercial success. There are quite a few circumstances in the story that deserves special applause for its simplicity and true-to-life treatment.Various people in the industry keep talking about taking Tamil Cinema to the new level though the visibility of that level is never fathomed except for a handful like Kamal Hassan and Mani Ratnam. The attainment of that kind of level does not necessarily mean acceptance and praise from overseas film industries because of the indigenous nature of our subjects. VTV has certainly taken good strides towards this and Gautam is not far from reaching it in the near future provided he stays impervious to producer's and hero's demands. So, it's not surprising that VTV will be remade in Hindi and Gautam will wield the megaphone again in an attempt to make Bollywood audience go gaga about it as he has already done that with Tamil audience.",different vtv review yet again,true tribute love vinnaithaandi varuvaaya couldnt have come at better time thus it not only resurrects tamil cinema that has been rolling out annoyingly cockeyed experiments demeaning formula flicks late but also thrusts it new level that can only be matched by pure magic vtv has had all kinds positive reviews all quarters including critics that mostly analyzes crucial movie making aspects like direction acting music cinematography etc it wouldnt be wrong declare that all these departments couldnt have blended better this movie gautams exclusive touch arrs hypnotic tunes simbus innate acting skills trishas ravishing beauty manojs eye popping visuals though undeniably true have been discussed reviewed death therefore this review will not cover any it fortunately if one takes deeper look as why this movie had stupendous response it would be quite evident that it deals with subject that keeps human species going extinct which is apparently love or call it romance more youthful way love is one very few things that people go crazy not mention money power it is always refreshing see lead actors such movie behave naturally while romancing deal with realistic situations as we would see life boy girl next door it not only gives pragmatic facet film making but also provides hardly witnessed dimension seeing ourselves big screen although most successful movies have piggybacked this aspect vtv has easily managed take it many steps further achieved insurmountable level connectivity with audience when such phenomenon occurs movie goers would not mind watching movie over over again which inturn leads its commercial success there are quite few circumstances story that deserves special applause its simplicity true life treatment various people industry keep talking about taking tamil cinema new level though visibility that level is never fathomed except handful like kamal hassan mani ratnam attainment that kind level does not necessarily mean acceptance praise overseas film industries because indigenous nature our subjects vtv has certainly taken good strides towards this gautam is not far reaching it near future provided he stays impervious producers heros demands so its not surprising that vtv will be remade hindi gautam will wield megaphone again attempt make bollywood audience go gaga about it as he has already done that with tamil audience,0.5401994700701597,0.13575225779967157,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

6,In search of Hosanna,"Hosanna indeed! There's something about Hebrew words of worship (Hallelujah). It isn't merely about a certain cadence. They form sublime expressions of adoration or worship. When infused with the right musical intonation, the appeal borders on the sublime. There is no greater testimony to this than Indian Ocean's Kandisa. For the compositions to work though, it needs much more than rousing notes. So praise be to A R Rahman. He knows a thing or two about the sublime.There are two aspects to his music that have contributed to his growth as a composer over the years. Firstly, the Sufi influence in his music. What began with Ishq Bina (Taal) has crystallized over the years and probably peaked with Khwaaja Mere Khwaaja (Jodhaa Akbar). It has probably led him to seek other influences and musical forms that exalt worship itself. Consequently, he has derived inspiration from the unlikeliest of sources for modern movie compositions, prayer songs and hymns (Maargazhi Poove). Second - his tracks of late grow on you. His first wave had songs that would sweep one away even before the instrumental prelude gave way to the vocals. Now, he is much more experimental and that means songs that reveal themselves in new ways even after endless rounds of listening (Rehna Tu (Delhi 6) being a case in point). In short, this is someone who is acquiring newer influences all the while (arguably the hardest thing for a composer, or for that matter, any artiste to do) and exploring ways to synthesize them into tracks that gel with an audience. All of this is evident in Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa. This is a soundtrack to treasure.Built on this bedrock of a foundation is a movie that eventually does justice to the soundtrack. It manages to do so by being a sincere film on most counts. Also a rarity in Tamizh cinema these days, it also acknowledges the archetype of a woman who finds herself in the oxymoronic position of deriving her independence from attachment to a set of factors. And when she is beckoned to pursue something that will invariably mean detachment from all that she had previously held constant, she balks and braves alternately. Trisha Krishnan comes out trumps, and the best thing that can be said about the performance is that even when Gautam Menon and Manoj Paramahamsa are liberal with the close-up, one can watch her for the four or five minutes that the camera hogs her - in the midst of seemingly rambling dialogue. A test for any actor in that one cannot build a case for one's character.Silambharasan aka Simbhu brings to the role a quiet and steely resolve (accentuated by the white-blue themed clothing). As noted, it's a performance that grows on you and one can sense ownership of the role towards the end. His dancing skills have finally been put to good use resulting in graceful moves as opposed to his constant zeal to defy gravity in his earlier films. On the whole, the two vibe well on screen and are only let down occasionally by the writing. There are a couple of surprise packages in the movie in the form of Ganesh and Babu Anthony.The word 'Gautamisms' isn't far off if he keeps coming up with stuff like 'one-way ticket to heartbreak city'. Such lines don't ring true in the context of the film and jut out. Gautam probably expresses himself in such fashion but that doesn't mean every character he creates needs to express himself / herself likewise. I am probably being a tad harsh on a director whose credentials and work are creditworthy for the most part - which is the point. For someone whose films avoid the pitfalls of his peers, this persistence in thrusting dialogues to actors forms a jarring note many a time.Thankfully, the sheer weight of stated and unstated emotional value he is able to derive from semi-autobiographical ventures (probably evinced by the line by Surya's airplane father figure in Vaaranam Aayiram) dwarfs everything else. This is married to rigorous thought in terms of what story-telling technique best brings out this value. He is also proving to be a location scout of the caliber of Mani Ratnam with Alappuzha and Goa shot sumptuously on screen.",search hosanna,hosanna indeed theres something about hebrew words worship hallelujah it isnt merely about certain cadence they form sublime expressions adoration or worship when infused with right musical intonation appeal borders sublime there is no greater testimony this than indian oceans kandisa compositions work though it needs much more than rousing notes so praise be r rahman he knows thing or two about sublime there are two aspects his music that have contributed his growth as composer over years firstly sufi influence his music what began with ishq bina taal has crystallized over years probably peaked with khwaaja mere khwaaja jodhaa akbar it has probably led him seek other influences musical forms that exalt worship itself consequently he has derived inspiration unlikeliest sources modern movie compositions prayer songs hymns maargazhi poove second his tracks late grow you his first wave had songs that would sweep one away even before instrumental prelude gave way vocals now he is much more experimental that means songs that reveal themselves new ways even after endless rounds listening rehna tu delhi 6 being case point short this is someone who is acquiring newer influences all while arguably hardest thing composer or that matter any artiste do exploring ways synthesize them into tracks that gel with audience all this is evident vinnaithaandi varuvaayaa this is soundtrack treasure built this bedrock foundation is movie that eventually does justice soundtrack it manages do so by being sincere film most counts also rarity tamizh cinema these days it also acknowledges archetype woman who finds herself oxymoronic position deriving her independence attachment set factors when she is beckoned pursue something that will invariably mean detachment all that she had previously held constant she balks braves alternately trisha krishnan comes out trumps best thing that can be said about performance is that even when gautam menon manoj paramahamsa are liberal with close up one can watch her four or five minutes that camera hogs her midst seemingly rambling dialogue test any actor that one cannot build case ones character silambharasan aka simbhu brings role quiet steely resolve accentuated by white blue themed clothing as noted its performance that grows you one can sense ownership role towards end his dancing skills have finally been put good use resulting graceful moves as opposed his constant zeal defy gravity his earlier films whole two vibe well screen are only let down occasionally by writing there are couple surprise packages movie form ganesh babu anthony word gautamisms isnt far off if he keeps coming up with stuff like one way ticket heartbreak city such lines dont ring true context film jut out gautam probably expresses himself such fashion but that doesnt mean every character he creates needs express himself herself likewise i am probably being tad harsh director whose credentials work are creditworthy most part which is point someone whose films avoid pitfalls his peers this persistence thrusting dialogues actors forms jarring note many time thankfully sheer weight stated unstated emotional value he is able derive semi autobiographical ventures probably evinced by line by suryas airplane father figure vaaranam aayiram dwarfs everything else this is married rigorous thought terms what story telling technique best brings out this value he is also proving be location scout caliber mani ratnam with alappuzha goa shot sumptuously screen,0.43238289488289483,0.11229118104118105,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"
4,Disagree... I did not like this movie,"I am really not sure how come so many liked the movie and i just did not like the movie at all.. For a start i am not a big fan of Simbu.. so my comments could be a little biased.. Simbu's way of dialogue delivery is not like-able at all.. he has a typical way of trying to copy Kamal but it just does not work... more over it looks like he is trying too hard to act... the love story also did not have any kind of depth to it.. boy sees girl, girl sees boy.. they see something in their eyes.. and they started loving each other.. since the first time they ever saw each other.. very silly, very very silly.There were only three things that i liked. The Music is awesome.. however i did not quite enjoy the background music at some places.. they sounded a little too loud for the scene. Second is Trisha.. i think she showed how mature a actress she now is.. full points to her.. she looks a little old in the movie (perhaps that was meant to be).. but she looks very elegant.. She was also wonderfully dressed throughout the movie. A third thing i liked about the movie was the camera work and visualizations for the songs. These three things are typical of Gautham's movie. However no story, really makes the movie fall flat for me.I felt the movie was longer that it actually was.. kind of gave the feeling of watching a television serial close to its climax, when the producer wants to keep extending it for few more weeks.. I certainly got bored watching.. only thing that kept me going was because i was curious to know why the movie was a hit.. perhaps there was a very good ending.. but again disappointed.",disagree i did not like this movie,i am really not sure how come so many liked movie i just did not like movie at all start i am not big fan simbu so my comments could be little biased simbus way dialogue delivery is not like able at all he has typical way trying copy kamal but it just does not work more over it looks like he is trying too hard act love story also did not have any kind depth it boy sees girl girl sees boy they see something their eyes they started loving each other since first time they ever saw each other very silly very very silly there were only three things that i liked music is awesome however i did not quite enjoy background music at some places they sounded little too loud scene second is trisha i think she showed how mature actress she now is full points her she looks little old movie perhaps that was meant be but she looks very elegant she was also wonderfully dressed throughout movie third thing i liked about movie was camera work visualizations songs these three things are typical gauthams movie however no story really makes movie fall flat me i felt movie was longer that it actually was kind gave feeling watching television serial close its climax when producer wants keep extending it few more weeks i certainly got bored watching only thing that kept me going was because i was curious know why movie was hit perhaps there was very good ending but again disappointed,0.5840286404416841,0.1524301242236025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.22}"

7,"A Boy meets a Girl, he proposes to her, first she rejects, then she falls for him, and something unusual happens at the end","Love at first sight, lots of movies in the list and still VTV(vinnai thandi varuvaya) gives something different for the movie goers. VTV is all about a boy(karthick), who meets a girl(jessi) elder to him, falls for her, he manages to get her love with lot of hurdles(religion,age,etc..)What makes VTV different is the way the story moves after the breakup of the lead actors, Jessi leads a normal life with her husband abroad while karthick becomes a director, and makes a movie based on his love life. The quote which karthick speaks ""we can't decide whom we are going to love, we can't go searching for love, love happens, it should sweep you off your feet,thats true love"". Though the movie is top notch at the technical aspects,the movie make us somewhat sleepy in the middle, unwanted fight sequence plays the spoilsport in a good romantic movie.",boy meets girl he proposes her first she rejects then she falls him something unusual happens at end,love at first sight lots movies list still vtv vinnai thandi varuvaya gives something different movie goers vtv is all about boy karthick who meets girl jessi elder him falls her he manages get her love with lot hurdles religion age etc what makes vtv different is way story moves after breakup lead actors jessi leads normal life with her husband abroad while karthick becomes director makes movie based his love life quote which karthick speaks we cant decide whom we are going love we cant go searching love love happens it should sweep you off your feet thats true love though movie is top notch at technical aspects movie make us somewhat sleepy middle unwanted fight sequence plays spoilsport good romantic movie,0.5298245614035086,0.31052631578947365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10,A riveting poignant and unpredictable love story,"Vinnaithandi Varuvaya (VTV) is very simple story told in a mesmerizing way. The plot of the movie is like any other rom- com but what take it several notches higher, is the script and the way director envisioned the script and brought it onto the screen. It's a love story between two characters – Karthik (played by Silambarasan) and Jessie (Trisha). Karthik is a jobless engineer who wanted to be a film- maker, pretty clear in his thoughts, stubborn, dreamer, perseverant and madly in love with Jessie. Jessie is simple and yet confused and torn between her love for karthik and her parents who would not let her marry a Hindu boy as she is a Christian. The Film boasts of some mesmerizing moments between the two lead actors- sometimes full of love, sometimes anger, sometimes frustration making it look pretty real and giving viewers a feel as if ""yes this is the way it happens in real life"" Both Silambarasan and trisha brings a gamut of expression (extreme frustration, joy, love, anger) associated with various situations there life goes through without going over the top. The guy who played, the friend of Simbu is also brilliant brings some genuine laughter moments in the movie.The best part about this movie is that despite having a very simple and regular rom-com plot, it doesn't ever get predictable. As the movie looks to move in certain direction, there is beautiful twist to make one cling on to the movie. Despite all those twists the movie it has its heart at right place - remains truthful to the basic plot. The photography is brilliant. Cinematography is beautiful, have captured some of the most beautiful locations.Some of the best scenes are The Kerala meet up between Karthik and Simbu. The marriage break up sceneTrisha Love confession Last half an hour and the climax are brilliant. I will go for 10/10 for this movie",riveting poignant unpredictable love story,vinnaithandi varuvaya vtv is very simple story told mesmerizing way plot movie is like any other rom com but what take it several notches higher is script way director envisioned script brought it onto screen its love story between two characters karthik played by silambarasan jessie trisha karthik is jobless engineer who wanted be film maker pretty clear his thoughts stubborn dreamer perseverant madly love with jessie jessie is simple yet confused torn between her love karthik her parents who would not let her marry hindu boy as she is christian film boasts some mesmerizing moments between two lead actors sometimes full love sometimes anger sometimes frustration making it look pretty real giving viewers feel as if yes this is way it happens real life both silambarasan trisha brings gamut expression extreme frustration joy love anger associated with various situations there life goes through without going over top guy who played friend simbu is also brilliant brings some genuine laughter moments movie best part about this movie is that despite having very simple regular rom com plot it doesnt ever get predictable as movie looks move certain direction there is beautiful twist make one cling movie despite all those twists movie it has its heart at right place remains truthful basic plot photography is brilliant cinematography is beautiful have captured some most beautiful locations some best scenes are kerala meet up between karthik simbu marriage break up scenetrisha love confession last half hour climax are brilliant i will go 10 10 this movie,0.5447289377289377,0.2813333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"
6,Love not at its best... But claims to be..!,"I have always been an admirer of the works of Gautham Menon and this time he's fallen short of the line he'd drawn for himself in Tamil cinema industry.The theme of the movie is very pleasant and simply beautiful in its own way. The lead pair has had a really impressive chemistry between them throughout the movie. Gautham has again proved that he can still step up the stardom of the lead-pair in his movie irrespective of the story. As against their previous movies, Simbu is incredibly handsome and Trisha's gorgeous as well.The enthralling writer in Gautham is exemplified when Trisha admits that she wants to look at herself through the eyes of Simbu after he lauds her beauty. The first half levitates the expectations of any unbiased audience to the likes of Karthik-Revathy pair in Manirathnam's Mouna Raagam - love best ever showcased in Tamil cinema. But disappointment awaits in the second half - thanks to Gautham's cliché.The humorous but slow dialogs of cameraman Ganesh is an overdose to the inexplicably stagnant pace of the movie itself. Oscar winner Rahman has proved his might yet again in this movie as his music treats our senses. But as to why foreign dancers crowd the hero in all of Gautham's movies - not one but in 3 songs, remains a mystery..!The theme fails in its purpose to portray Simbu's true love and Trisha's quandary to accept it in so many instances of the movie. Like when Simbu refuses Trisha's friendship citing he feels like he always wants to make love to her and Trisha's willingness to give into romance whenever Simbu comes close to her - is it the director's misinterpretation of the word ""Love"" with ""Lust""???The complicated screenplay draws the dislike of majority of audience as people found their way out of the theater even with 20 minutes left in the movie, notably on the day of release (source- I was there too!) The climax is probably the only way Gautham could get himself out of jail as both the possible endings one can think of is there. Not enjoyable though..! If you are expecting a delightful romantic story without inquietude, back out..! Not if you're biased..!",love not at its best but claims be,i have always been admirer works gautham menon this time hes fallen short line hed drawn himself tamil cinema industry theme movie is very pleasant simply beautiful its own way lead pair has had really impressive chemistry between them throughout movie gautham has again proved that he can still step up stardom lead pair his movie irrespective story as against their previous movies simbu is incredibly handsome trishas gorgeous as well enthralling writer gautham is exemplified when trisha admits that she wants look at herself through eyes simbu after he lauds her beauty first half levitates expectations any unbiased audience likes karthik revathy pair manirathnams mouna raagam love best ever showcased tamil cinema but disappointment awaits second half thanks gauthams clich humorous but slow dialogs cameraman ganesh is overdose inexplicably stagnant pace movie itself oscar winner rahman has proved his might yet again this movie as his music treats our senses but as why foreign dancers crowd hero all gauthams movies not one but 3 songs remains mystery theme fails its purpose portray simbus true love trishas quandary accept it so many instances movie like when simbu refuses trishas friendship citing he feels like he always wants make love her trishas willingness give into romance whenever simbu comes close her is it directors misinterpretation word love with lust complicated screenplay draws dislike majority audience as people found their way out theater even with 20 minutes left movie notably day release source i was there too climax is probably only way gautham could get himself out jail as both possible endings one can think is there not enjoyable though if you are expecting delightful romantic story without inquietude back out not if youre biased,0.5227083333333333,0.23320833333333338,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.25}"
