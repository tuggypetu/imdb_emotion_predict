10,Perfect twelve,"Mammootty transforms into Amudhan, the father while Sadhana astonishes us as the spastic child. Through the last few months of waiting, from the trailers, the impression was that the spastic child in the trailer was actually a spastic child. Not one moment where the real Sadhana flickers through. Always Paapa, the character.While Amudhan is always playing the caretaker role, carrying the responsibility of raising his spastic child, one chapter is devoted to Amudhan and his tribulations. That was the chapter where Mammootty stood up and declared that he is indeed world class, the best of the best. Performance reminiscent of Amaram, and perhaps even better. There are other magical strokes too that come through at various points as would from an honest, realistic narrative of a storyline centered around being a spastic child, and raising a spastic child.It is however also true that the admiration for Mammootty meant that you could never only see Amudhan on the screen. When simple non-melodramatic close up shots of Amudhan surface on the screen, you cannot but feel the Mammootty aura.The movie asks you very direct questions and gives you many blatant truths. It is not designed to make the viewer cry. While the subject can easily lead into such moments, by design, the movie has been kept even keel.While the narrative is slow, there is so much content to wade through that it will take some time for the experience to sink in. Perfection shines through in many scenes. Trailers that had been released are unedited scenes from the movie as is. They have a completeness to them as is. Through slow and seemingly mundane scenes, the movie suddenly takes a strong stand that you cannot ignore, or reveals something new that you did not see coming.To all the ""retired peacefully"" lifestyle seekers, the movie asks whether you would let a spastic child live in your neighborhood if she screams uncontrollably at night? That is how the movie starts. Forced into exile, Amudhan seeks to live with his daughter in an isolated house in a beautiful valley where the mist and the mountains give the cameraman a canvas. Tarkovsky's mists had set too high a standard in my mind to be met here in Peranbu, but the sights were really nice, though the mist seems to have been sped up a bit that did not feel as natural.In a matter of a couple of seemingly slow scenes, the movie communicates that the daughter is not initially close to her father and then just as effortlessly brings them together with very realistic beautiful small incidents with background music that gels everything together nicely. No fanfare. Just honesty. This promise has been kept all through the movie as the movie asks one tough question after another and files open complaints against the injustices that it sees in the protagonists' world.The movie addresses the challenging question of sexuality of a spastic child in a few of it's later chapters. Her sexuality is as real as any other teenager's while her being a spastic adds an incongruent challenge to it. The movie addresses the subject forthrightly. There is a scene where the overload of information on the subject destabilizes Amudhan leading to a minor accident. That scene is beautifully open to interpretation.There have been so many movies made already and the typical challenge is to be able to say anything at all that is new. Peranbu comes across as if it is unaware of any such challenges. There is so much that the movie says. Filled with insights, the movie is impossible to ignore.The music and background score of the movie has been excellent and aligns very well with the communication style that the movie has adopted. Emotional, but at the same time, simple.Casting has been perfect. Every single character in the movie has found the right actor to represent him/her. Presented as twelve chapters, but still very nicely integrated, editing has been very good. Camera work has been subtle and gentle for most of the movie. Great story, great screenplay, masterful direction - a must watch!",perfect twelve,mammootty transforms into amudhan father while sadhana astonishes us as spastic child through last few months waiting trailers impression was that spastic child trailer was actually spastic child not one moment where real sadhana flickers through always paapa character while amudhan is always playing caretaker role carrying responsibility raising his spastic child one chapter is devoted amudhan his tribulations that was chapter where mammootty stood up declared that he is indeed world class best best performance reminiscent amaram perhaps even better there are other magical strokes too that come through at various points as would honest realistic narrative storyline centered around being spastic child raising spastic child it is however also true that admiration mammootty meant that you could never only see amudhan screen when simple non melodramatic close up shots amudhan surface screen you cannot but feel mammootty aura movie asks you very direct questions gives you many blatant truths it is not designed make viewer cry while subject can easily lead into such moments by design movie has been kept even keel while narrative is slow there is so much content wade through that it will take some time experience sink perfection shines through many scenes trailers that had been released are unedited scenes movie as is they have completeness them as is through slow seemingly mundane scenes movie suddenly takes strong stand that you cannot ignore or reveals something new that you did not see coming all retired peacefully lifestyle seekers movie asks whether you would let spastic child live your neighborhood if she screams uncontrollably at night that is how movie starts forced into exile amudhan seeks live with his daughter isolated house beautiful valley where mist mountains give cameraman canvas tarkovskys mists had set too high standard my mind be met here peranbu but sights were really nice though mist seems have been sped up bit that did not feel as natural matter couple seemingly slow scenes movie communicates that daughter is not initially close her father then just as effortlessly brings them together with very realistic beautiful small incidents with background music that gels everything together nicely no fanfare just honesty this promise has been kept all through movie as movie asks one tough question after another files open complaints against injustices that it sees protagonists world movie addresses challenging question sexuality spastic child few its later chapters her sexuality is as real as any other teenagers while her being spastic adds incongruent challenge it movie addresses subject forthrightly there is scene where overload information subject destabilizes amudhan leading minor accident that scene is beautifully open interpretation there have been so many movies made already typical challenge is be able say anything at all that is new peranbu comes across as if it is unaware any such challenges there is so much that movie says filled with insights movie is impossible ignore music background score movie has been excellent aligns very well with communication style that movie has adopted emotional but at same time simple casting has been perfect every single character movie has found right actor represent him her presented as twelve chapters but still very nicely integrated editing has been very good camera work has been subtle gentle most movie great story great screenplay masterful direction must watch,0.5196753246753245,0.19045753704290286,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10,Rarest of rarest ❤,Peranbu (2019)This film is phenomenal & truly magical. Probably the most beautiful movie ever made. A Masterpiece indeed ❤. One doesn't have to mention anything about Mammootty's acting skills as we all know it's legendary 🙏. We have seen what an incredible actor he has been over the past 48 years. This movie will definitely go in the records as one of the best film ever. I really appreciate Mammootty for doing this role with such an ease. I will not be surprised if Mammookka gets a national award for Peranbu. The perfection that he brings to his character is absolutely mind blowing as always. As an actor he is a class of his own. And Sadhana has lived the role & she was amazing and deserves the national award. Both Anjali & Anjali Ameer were outstanding 👏👏. Yuvan Shankar Raja's BGM and songs brings soul to the movie 👌👌 & Theni Easwar's DOP is beautiful 😍. Peranbu is gonna grab National awards for sure. Thank you Ram sir for giving us this gem.

9,"For every Resurrection, there's a story you wouldn't want to lend you ears to","Ram's Peranbu is a statement to all those films that label themselves as deep and thought provoking. He has created a masterpiece of sorts, that delves right into what the society stamps as taboo and virtually challenges the viewer into what was a film of epic proportions.Peranbu indulges the viewer into a story that might be one of the rarest in Indian cinema. It's powerful, gripping and moreover empowers various sections of Indian society in a cleansing manner. Peranbu puts forward a Father that puts you in a state of remorse from scene one. And when it is played by Mammootty, one cannot put away the sadness that reflects on the audience. Peranbu effectively works because of the out of the box nature of Ram. The film is quick and open to themes that are particularly hard to be visualised on screen. Both ethically and professionally. The hardships that goes through a child, and the consequences of such are beautifully potrayed on screen by Sadhana. Paapa's portrayal felt slightly forced in the beginning, as mentioned by many, but later on the performance becomes solid, giving the viewer a hard time to focus on Paapa.The film's themes are excellent and rich. It is hard to name films that have very good themes and at at the same time, an excellent depiction of the said theme. Peranbu is such a film that just excels in what it intended to achieve. The film could have had a shaky opening if it had been premiered in India. Props to the coordinators for opening it Internationally before the domestic release.Peranbu has the power to lift you. So don't be surprised if you are 'resurrected'.",every resurrection theres story you wouldnt want lend you ears,rams peranbu is statement all those films that label themselves as deep thought provoking he has created masterpiece sorts that delves right into what society stamps as taboo virtually challenges viewer into what was film epic proportions peranbu indulges viewer into story that might be one rarest indian cinema its powerful gripping moreover empowers various sections indian society cleansing manner peranbu puts forward father that puts you state remorse scene one when it is played by mammootty one cannot put away sadness that reflects audience peranbu effectively works because out box nature ram film is quick open themes that are particularly hard be visualised screen both ethically professionally hardships that goes through child consequences such are beautifully potrayed screen by sadhana paapas portrayal felt slightly forced beginning as mentioned by many but later performance becomes solid giving viewer hard time focus paapa films themes are excellent rich it is hard name films that have very good themes at at same time excellent depiction said theme peranbu is such film that just excels what it intended achieve film could have had shaky opening if it had been premiered india props coordinators opening it internationally before domestic release peranbu has power lift you so dont be surprised if you are resurrected,0.5281280788177339,0.18778325123152706,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.24, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"
