10.0,the best indian movie in the history,"If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",best indian movie history,if i would ive seen this movie 2016 it certainly would have been my list best movies if youre going this movie thinking aamir will be flexing showcasing his acting prowess then well good but girls are highlight movie hands down script major props bringing out story which is inspiring one which india needs right now story is kept grounded reality no over top gimmicks songs blend very well with premise none scenes linger long period time there was very natural flow story which helped engage audience 2 hours 41 minutes even movies like mary kom or bhaag milkha bhaag started drag by end but hats off piyush gupta shreyas jain i have said this that dialogue shouldnt seem like dialogue unless it is musical or re imagining play dialogue this movie is lesson as how dialogue should be used little nods grunts expressions serve more than explanatory conversation i am not fan narration i wasnt really liking it here either it was fine light hearted scenes but serious scenes required silence but i can give it pass only scene which felt bit off is where mahavir gets locked up room before final fight if it didnt happen reality then it was really unnecessary direction chillar party was movie with some serious message but was little preachy bhootnath returns went full preachy nitesh tiwari toned down that preaching very natural level this movie every single topic that has happened or still happens family was touched upon beginning sleaziness men child marriage sacrifice parents make everything was utilised advantage movie none that brought movie halt first half movie had good amount comedy that gelled into second half with ease thing that many might not notice that there are no pay off scenes except last scene if audience reaches peak before ending then pay off wouldnt have solid effect if used multiple times pay off scenes are those scenes where characters are shown be doing things extra slow motion have orgasmic effect audience director cleverly used it at end order give proper tribute art character fight choreography this section needed category its own quite deservedly i saw mary kom sultan saala khadoos which had extensive fight scenes all movies had extremely lack lustre fight scenes camera moved too much order cover up actor actresses incapability fight comparison all those movies here camera just followed fighters no wide shots fight audiences perspective because that allows stunt double come all fights had actresses scene hats off all them their dedication acting like i said before best performance among some amazing performances was newcomer fatima sana shaikh that said it will really be unjust name one performance as best performance because everyone was amazing this movie aamir khan sakshi tanwar sanya malhotra aparshakti khurana zaira wasim suhani bhatnagar ritwik shore girish kulkarni gave amazing performances as aamir had put so much weight that altered his physicality lot which enhanced his performance another level sakshi tanwar should be doing more movies she gave very subdued nuanced performance sanya malhotra as grown up babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didnt have any dialogue zaira wasim sulhani bhatnagar were awesome just awesome i was awe how they are able emote so much at their age ritwik shore aparshakti khurana together made omkar memorable character i think they had some best scenes entire movie i wanted kill girish kulkarni after ugly after this i still want kill him thats compliment side actors who formed audience little roles like dangal organiser guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance movie final verdict i am sure everyone has seen this movie by now if you havent then please do its complete movie it is very rare see complete movie without gimmicks nowadays i loved how they had such eye detail because they gave that damaged effect aamirs ear many wouldnt notice it but its great that they did provide authenticity character movie its 10 10 me one best movies 2016,0.4803982951205172,0.22179992161473638,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Awesome film n wonderful performance by Aamir. Disney n Aamir did a miracle with this film.,"I saw this with my family in a theatre. Awesome experience. Aamir's acting, effort n most importantly his passion is what makes his cinema so damn unique. First thing Dangal has going for it is Aamir khan. Aamir khan gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Phogat. He is the best actor in bollywood. Period. He shocked me by his transformation. I myself being a gym trainer knows the effort which goes in such kinda transformation. Without Aamir I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. The child actors were good too. The music was good. The direction by Tiwari was the best of 2016. This movie was never boring and full credit shud go to the director. The cinematography gave you a feeling as if what you are watching is real. Overall you don't have to like wrestling or know wrestling to appreciate this movie. Its a wonderful movie.

10.0,Ultimate triumph,"Director Mr. Nitesh Tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes, you just forget that you are watching film. You simply start witnessing the journey of Phogat's family. Makers are so confident that they have even given credit for story idea to Divya Rao, which reflects their honesty. She is not in writing team but gets her due credit. There are four writers, Director himself, Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain and Nikhil Mehrotra and their work is fantastic. Screenplay is seamless and very balanced with much needed freshness. Film starts with glimpse of Mahavir Singh Phogat's passion for wrestling, while watching and challenging another district level arrogant winner, while commentary comes over on them which is fresh. When that person gets defeated he says 'Tumne district level pehlawan ko haraya hai' Then Mahavir Singh replies ' Tension mat le, tum national level champion se hare ho'. Words may be a bit different but meaning was same. Which gives strong idea that what level of dialogues you are going to listen and they have maintained the graph. Dialogues just nourish your senses, inducing correct emotions. A simple scene where protagonist massages feet of his sleeping daughter, clearly reflects that he is just not a ruthless coach but a caring father too. Girls curse their father in front of their friend who is getting married, then that girl emotional words about her feeling towards their caring father is very cute, emotional and enough to make girls realize that what they are taking for granted. Best part of this film is it's continues ascending graph in every aspect. First half is cute, funny with subtle dose of emotions. Second half takes this graph to the horizon. Full of emotions, either it is of defeat, victory or relations. Another major plus point is the way they have shown wrestling. I dint know a bit of it but I enjoyed all wrestling matches like it was my favorite game and that is major chunk of film. Hats off to the team behind wresting choreography .Though you have basic idea of film happenings but still they kept you engrossed by presentation. Climax comes with a very strong message that one can train you but only you have to implement the techniques, which makes you true winner and enriches self confident. Performance makes you thunderstruck. Words can not justify or compliment, Amir Khan's performance as Mahavir Singh Phogat. Zaira Waseem as younger Geeta is brilliant. She is so good that when Fatima Sana Sheikh takes over as grown up Geeta, you miss younger one but soon Fatima proves that she has taken the graph far ahead. Same happens with younger Babita played by Suhani Bhatnagar and grown up by Sanya Malhotra. Skashi Tanwar as wife of Mahavir Singh is very good. Girish Kulkarni , who had played coach is superb, you do hate his character but love his performance. Actor, who played younger cousin of Geeta and even grown up one, both actors are cute and endearing. Kudos to casting director Mukesh Chhabra and team. Music by Pritam and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya, are integral part of this film. Without any formulated track you just enjoy every song and your eyes get mois in one too.",ultimate triumph,director mr nitesh tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes you just forget that you are watching film you simply start witnessing journey phogats family makers are so confident that they have even given credit story idea divya rao which reflects their honesty she is not writing team but gets her due credit there are four writers director himself piyush gupta shreyas jain nikhil mehrotra their work is fantastic screenplay is seamless very balanced with much needed freshness film starts with glimpse mahavir singh phogats passion wrestling while watching challenging another district level arrogant winner while commentary comes over them which is fresh when that person gets defeated he says tumne district level pehlawan ko haraya hai then mahavir singh replies tension mat le tum national level champion se hare ho words may be bit different but meaning was same which gives strong idea that what level dialogues you are going listen they have maintained graph dialogues just nourish your senses inducing correct emotions simple scene where protagonist massages feet his sleeping daughter clearly reflects that he is just not ruthless coach but caring father too girls curse their father front their friend who is getting married then that girl emotional words about her feeling towards their caring father is very cute emotional enough make girls realize that what they are taking granted best part this film is its continues ascending graph every aspect first half is cute funny with subtle dose emotions second half takes this graph horizon full emotions either it is defeat victory or relations another major plus point is way they have shown wrestling i dint know bit it but i enjoyed all wrestling matches like it was my favorite game that is major chunk film hats off team behind wresting choreography though you have basic idea film happenings but still they kept you engrossed by presentation climax comes with very strong message that one can train you but only you have implement techniques which makes you true winner enriches self confident performance makes you thunderstruck words can not justify or compliment amir khans performance as mahavir singh phogat zaira waseem as younger geeta is brilliant she is so good that when fatima sana sheikh takes over as grown up geeta you miss younger one but soon fatima proves that she has taken graph far ahead same happens with younger babita played by suhani bhatnagar grown up by sanya malhotra skashi tanwar as wife mahavir singh is very good girish kulkarni who had played coach is superb you do hate his character but love his performance actor who played younger cousin geeta even grown up one both actors are cute endearing kudos casting director mukesh chhabra team music by pritam lyrics by amitabh bhattacharya are integral part this film without any formulated track you just enjoy every song your eyes get mois one too,0.5474172719935433,0.22271186440677965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,This is AAMIR KHAN's by far the best one.Finest casting and terrific acting by all.,"Aamir Khan shines in the role of Mahavir Singh Phogat. He is so outstanding in his performance that this could be considered as one of his best works ever. The opening scene of the film is just a glimpse of Phogat's passion for the sport – wrestling. The first half of Dangal works exactly like a skilled wrestler – invariably sure of its moves. The film's second half is all about victory. Mahavir's transformation from the once upset father of a baby girl to the most triumphant one to Geeta's string of losses before she finally wins a gold during Common Wealth Games to desi akhara being replaced by wrestling mat – every moment works in contrast to what you had watched earlier. But not even once does the film loses its focus.A word here about Mukesh Chhabra's casting: he has done a tremendous job of the casting. Nitesh Tiwari's direction is amazingly terrific. AmitabhBhattacharya's lyrics are great. Pritam's music is in terrific sync with the mood of the drama. 'Dangal dangal' is a very inspiring song and will soon become a rage. 'Dhaakad' and 'Haanikarak' are also very well-tuned. The 'Gilehariyaan' song has terrific charm of a different kind. Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics are great. The song writer may pick up some awards for his lyrics. Bosco- Caesar's choreography is very real. Pritam's background music deserves distinction marks. The actors who play the young Geeta and Babita (Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar) do a competent job of maintaining the audiences attention. And both Shaikh and Malhotra carry it forward, especially when they spend a lot of the second half on the mat, learning how to lose, and, above all, to win. Since it encapsulates the historic win of the phogats who bought India glory so it is bound to inspire women. Dialogues are absolute gems. Without being overtly long, they are so effective that they invariably touch the heart before reaching the ears. On the whole, Dangal is not just a movie; it is an experience to be cherished. The film is destined to be one of the biggest blockbusters of Indian cinema.As it content oriented so The movie is both for the single screens as well as for the multiplexes and people of all age can watch.so this movie is a must watch. So I Rate it 10 stars out of 10 because I was thinking movie deserves it.I usually don't rate any movie 10 but This movie ""HatsOff"". Don't Expect a better story than this.Finest piece.Dangal hai yeh.",this is aamir khans by far best one finest casting terrific acting by all,aamir khan shines role mahavir singh phogat he is so outstanding his performance that this could be considered as one his best works ever opening scene film is just glimpse phogats passion sport wrestling first half dangal works exactly like skilled wrestler invariably sure its moves films second half is all about victory mahavirs transformation once upset father baby girl most triumphant one geetas string losses before she finally wins gold during common wealth games desi akhara being replaced by wrestling mat every moment works contrast what you had watched earlier but not even once does film loses its focus word here about mukesh chhabras casting he has done tremendous job casting nitesh tiwaris direction is amazingly terrific amitabhbhattacharyas lyrics are great pritams music is terrific sync with mood drama dangal dangal is very inspiring song will soon become rage dhaakad haanikarak are also very well tuned gilehariyaan song has terrific charm different kind amitabh bhattacharyas lyrics are great song writer may pick up some awards his lyrics bosco caesars choreography is very real pritams background music deserves distinction marks actors who play young geeta babita zaira wasim suhani bhatnagar do competent job maintaining audiences attention both shaikh malhotra carry it forward especially when they spend lot second half mat learning how lose above all win since it encapsulates historic win phogats who bought india glory so it is bound inspire women dialogues are absolute gems without being overtly long they are so effective that they invariably touch heart before reaching ears whole dangal is not just movie it is experience be cherished film is destined be one biggest blockbusters indian cinema as it content oriented so movie is both single screens as well as multiplexes people all age can watch so this movie is must watch so i rate it 10 stars out 10 because i was thinking movie deserves it i usually dont rate any movie 10 but this movie hatsoff dont expect better story than this finest piece dangal hai yeh,0.5081816578483245,0.23937566137566138,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,Another great film from Aamir Khan.,"""Dangal"" is the highest grossing Indian film of all time and among the highest grossing non-Chinese films in China. Why? I assume it's because in both countries, women's roles are very traditional and the film celerates women stepping outside the normal female roles and succeeding...a great message of empowerment.The story is about a frustrated man. Mahavir (Aamir Khan) was an Indian national wrestling champion but his father insisted he give up the sport and get a job. As a result, he never had a chance to compete internationally.Mahavir comes up with the idea of him and his wife having a son....and he could teach the son to be a great champion wrestler. But he ends up having daughters. Instead of abandoning the idea, Mahavir decides he'll teach his daughters and make them champions....even though women generally don't compete in the sport in India. So, he has his daughters wrestle boys....and they win.Eventually, his oldest, Geeta, becomes the Indian women's champion and is sent to the national training center. Things do not go well there and Geeta experiences loss for the first time. What will Geeta do? And, what of Mahavir's plans for producing a champion?Aamir Khan has an incredible record and has produced some of India's best films. While I wouldn't say this film is quite as good as his ""3 Idiots"" or ""Like Stars on Earth"", it is an extraordinary film...and I can see why it did so well at the box office. Well made from start to finish and a most enjoyable story.By the way, I was shocked at what Khan went through in order to make this movie. His weight loss, gain and muscle mass is incredible. I was especially shocked when I saw him take off his shirt early in the film...the guy was ripped!",another great film aamir khan,dangal is highest grossing indian film all time among highest grossing non chinese films china why i assume its because both countries womens roles are very traditional film celerates women stepping outside normal female roles succeeding great message empowerment story is about frustrated man mahavir aamir khan was indian national wrestling champion but his father insisted he give up sport get job as result he never had chance compete internationally mahavir comes up with idea him his wife having son he could teach son be great champion wrestler but he ends up having daughters instead abandoning idea mahavir decides hell teach his daughters make them champions even though women generally dont compete sport india so he has his daughters wrestle boys they win eventually his oldest geeta becomes indian womens champion is sent national training center things do not go well there geeta experiences loss first time what will geeta do what mahavirs plans producing champion aamir khan has incredible record has produced some indias best films while i wouldnt say this film is quite as good as his 3 idiots or like stars earth it is extraordinary film i can see why it did so well at box office well made start finish most enjoyable story by way i was shocked at what khan went through order make this movie his weight loss gain muscle mass is incredible i was especially shocked when i saw him take off his shirt early film guy was ripped,0.533,0.21133333333333332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"

7.0,"""You have to fight in a way that people remember you.""","Most of the reviewers for this film here on IMDb appear to be folks of Indian background; nothing wrong with that but with most of them offering glowing praise and a '10 rating, it's difficult to get a true perspective on the movie. I thought it was OK, though not a '10' rated film by any means. The picture utilizes a tried and true sports movie formula depicting a rigorous training schedule, a demanding coach and notable accomplishments along the way before the principal character encounters some roadblocks on the way to a Commonwealth Games gold medal. There's also the idea of success achieved by defying conventional thinking, in the way Geeta Phogat (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and her sister Babita (Sanya Malhotra) rise to prominence in the traditionally male sport of wrestling. That's perhaps the film's best takeaway, as the girls in question endured a lot of physical and mental anguish to achieve their goals, thereby serving as role models for other young women to follow.I couldn't help thinking however, that if the setting for this film was present day America, the father (Aamir Khan) might never have gotten past the first month of training his daughters because someone would have turned him in for child abuse. Cutting the girls' hair and restricting their diet would have gotten someone to notice, and Mahavir slapping his young nephew Omkar for some slight was totally uncalled for. It might not have appeared so bad if the man had lightened up his approach from time to time but his expression was always so grim it looked like he was mad at the world. One could say that his style eventually paid off in the end, but the emotional toll on his daughters, especially Geeta, could have been avoided with a more 'fatherly' approach. The one American film this most reminded me of was 1984's ""The Karate Kid"", but without a bully opponent and with national prestige at stake in the tournament matches. The film makers for that earlier movie put together a compelling and entertaining story in just about two hours, The additional forty minutes of screen time in ""Dangal"" is padded by repetitious scenes of training activity in the early part of the story that aren't all that necessary, while others are characteristically set to a musical accompaniment that seems to be a trademark of Hindi films. I did like the realism involved in staging the wrestling matches throughout the story, and the climactic final match was filled with suspense. With seconds to go, one will recall Mahavir's earlier explanation of the point scoring system, fully hoping that Geeta would somehow manage a five point take-down to insure a victory. The fact that this movie was based on the real life story of Mahavir Phogat and his wrestling daughters make it all the more fascinating.",you have fight way that people remember you,most reviewers this film here imdb appear be folks indian background nothing wrong with that but with most them offering glowing praise 10 rating its difficult get true perspective movie i thought it was ok though not 10 rated film by any means picture utilizes tried true sports movie formula depicting rigorous training schedule demanding coach notable accomplishments along way before principal character encounters some roadblocks way commonwealth games gold medal theres also idea success achieved by defying conventional thinking way geeta phogat fatima sana shaikh her sister babita sanya malhotra rise prominence traditionally male sport wrestling thats perhaps films best takeaway as girls question endured lot physical mental anguish achieve their goals thereby serving as role models other young women follow i couldnt help thinking however that if setting this film was present day america father aamir khan might never have gotten past first month training his daughters because someone would have turned him child abuse cutting girls hair restricting their diet would have gotten someone notice mahavir slapping his young nephew omkar some slight was totally uncalled it might not have appeared so bad if man had lightened up his approach time time but his expression was always so grim it looked like he was mad at world one could say that his style eventually paid off end but emotional toll his daughters especially geeta could have been avoided with more fatherly approach one american film this most reminded me was 1984s karate kid but without bully opponent with national prestige at stake tournament matches film makers that earlier movie put together compelling entertaining story just about two hours additional forty minutes screen time dangal is padded by repetitious scenes training activity early part story that arent all that necessary while others are characteristically set musical accompaniment that seems be trademark hindi films i did like realism involved staging wrestling matches throughout story climactic final match was filled with suspense with seconds go one will recall mahavirs earlier explanation point scoring system fully hoping that geeta would somehow manage five point take down insure victory fact that this movie was based real life story mahavir phogat his wrestling daughters make it all more fascinating,0.5143308080808081,0.07465728715728717,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,Dangal is very special. Ultimate mix of technical film making and popular cinema,"Dangal (9/10) is the kind of film for which the 70mm medium exists. It has universal appeal, is technically brilliant and more than anything else it is a film that skillfully balances popular sentiments and realism. It is going to reach tens of millions of people without having compromised the quality of storytelling.An extraordinary story of some extraordinary people who not only conquered their fears but also a society which had the negativity to kill their dreams even before they were born.If Chak De was a fine example of exemplary editing in a sports film and Pan Singh Tomar was an exceptional sports film with great depth and realism, Dangal would forever be remembered as one of the best Indian sports film for the sheer reach it will have. Wrestling is a fast paced technical sport. To make the whole thing look as authentic as it has looked in the film, it would have required some meticulous planning and extensive training and they have done it really well.The fact that you feel the frustration that Mahavir Singh Phogat feels in the final scene and you along with the whole audience begins to clap after each of Geeta's winning bout as if there was a live game at display shows how supremely engaging the film is. One negative, though not significant enough to harm the film is that it has over dramatazied the narrative at the cost of slight misrepresentation of the facts.Only if the majority of Indian film makers could realize that it is not impossible to make good cinema with popular appeal, we would start getting more than just a couple of Hindi films every year worth watching. Now is a good time to list Top Films from India in the Sports/Drama genre: 1)Paan SIngh Tomar 2)Dangal 3)Chak De India 4)Iqbal 5)Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander 6)Lagaan 7)Bhaag Milkha Bhaag",dangal is very special ultimate mix technical film making popular cinema,dangal 9 10 is kind film which 70mm medium exists it has universal appeal is technically brilliant more than anything else it is film that skillfully balances popular sentiments realism it is going reach tens millions people without having compromised quality storytelling extraordinary story some extraordinary people who not only conquered their fears but also society which had negativity kill their dreams even before they were born if chak de was fine example exemplary editing sports film pan singh tomar was exceptional sports film with great depth realism dangal would forever be remembered as one best indian sports film sheer reach it will have wrestling is fast paced technical sport make whole thing look as authentic as it has looked film it would have required some meticulous planning extensive training they have done it really well fact that you feel frustration that mahavir singh phogat feels final scene you along with whole audience begins clap after each geetas winning bout as if there was live game at display shows how supremely engaging film is one negative though not significant enough harm film is that it has over dramatazied narrative at cost slight misrepresentation facts only if majority indian film makers could realize that it is not impossible make good cinema with popular appeal we would start getting more than just couple hindi films every year worth watching now is good time list top films india sports drama genre 1 paan singh tomar 2 dangal 3 chak de india 4 iqbal 5 jo jeeta wohi sikander 6 lagaan 7 bhaag milkha bhaag,0.6248257839721254,0.29584917115404913,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9.0,Bhed Ki Haahakaar Ke Badle Sher Ki Ek Dahaad Hai Pyaare- Dangal!,"Aamir Khan is back after 'pk' as a wrestler who wants his daughter to win the Gold for the nation. It is a biopic of Mahavir Phogat. And believe me, it's a must watch biopic to get inspiration. To achieve something you have to let go the rest of the things.A simple story with great performances make this film a worthy watch. Aamir Khan is as usual fantastic. But, the girls are true heroes of this film. Fatimah who plays Geeta is a sure shot winner. She looks exactly as per her character and delivers great impact as a wrestler. Younger girls of Geeta and Babita are also very fine. Sakshi has a small role, but she plays it safely. Aparshakti Khurana is doing a voice over here and plays a role of the girls' cousin brother. He is funny and entertains the audiences for sure. Girish Kulkarni is also there, who delivered a classy performance in Ugly. So, the star cast and their performances are the biggest point of Dangal.Direction and writing by Nitesh Tiwari are worthy enough for viewers as they don't get bored in any situation. Except one, after interval song, that is like something slow paced. Everyone has to applause him as he gives justice to Phogat's family and doesn't add any extra material which we often see in Bollywood movies. He has delivered the frame as it is, so the middle class viewer can easily be able to connect with the film. What I like the most in the film apart from the performances is Music. Pritam has given it with the lyrics of Amitabh Bhatacharya. Both were amazing in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. This time also they are killing the stereotypes. I loved all the songs. I'm downloading it. Hanikarak Bapu and Dhakad are pitch perfect. They have some English words as well as some pure Hindi words in them which make them enjoyable. But the best song is by far the Title track in the voice of Daler Mehndi. Full marks to the music department!Yes, it is very emotional film. Those who get the connection easily with films, may cry during some scenes. Even I'm one of them, too. It is better than Sultan, because it's a pure wrestling movie with a family background. Sultan was like a love story with a background of wrestling till interval and then box fighting post interval. I wish, Dangal may cross the record of Sultan at Box Office.On the whole, just go and enjoy the perfect film with your entire family as many time as you can. Btw, I will go for the second time for sure. So, 2016 has ended with a perfect film.

8.0,"2 years later, Aamir Khan yet again succeeds with this Sports-drama. Pritam's music is a bronze medal","Honestly I was a bit determinant after watching Sultan thinking that this film could be a remake but honestly after watching this movie, it was a lot different. This movie just melted my heart with the fantastic writing, direction, performances, and editing. Nitesh Tiwari brought 2 average films which were Bhoothnath Returns and Chillar Party. But for this film, he deserves a bow for the amount of hard work he managed to put for this film.The performances in the movie were absolutely phenomenal. Aamir Khan is back to becoming nuanced and self confident Khan we always admired. His fat to fit video really created a lot of inspiration for me and my friends and that increased our eager level in watching this movie. Sakshi Tanwar is a pretty decent actress. Her role was absolutely strong and withheld but her dialogues in certain places were quite awkward and almost out-of-place.The girls who played Geeta and Babita just kept me to the edge of my seat. What amazement these girls did and how they used their empowerment to pull of a male-sport with such ease.The screenplay and direction was something I really loved just like how Haryana was shot and how the wrestling scenes were shot.After Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, I managed to enjoy Priam's music but the songs in Dangal were average and I wouldn't consider them at loop-listening soundtracks. Not many songs really stand out as such.Honestly, I enjoyed this movie much more than Sultan based on its true story and fantastic direction. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece with beautiful direction, performances, and acting. This motion picture really touched my heart. Leave your house and grab your tickets, this is definitely a cinema watching movie.In any society, it is very important to understand the meaning of women rights. No matter how boyish something could be, women are considered human beings. Girls have the right to do anything ranging from being a police officer to a taxi driver. These are typical jobs that mostly men pull off but women can also pull these jobs off but much quicker. Try to understand that men and women are the same professional wise.",2 years later aamir khan yet again succeeds with this sports drama pritams music is bronze medal,honestly i was bit determinant after watching sultan thinking that this film could be remake but honestly after watching this movie it was lot different this movie just melted my heart with fantastic writing direction performances editing nitesh tiwari brought 2 average films which were bhoothnath returns chillar party but this film he deserves bow amount hard work he managed put this film performances movie were absolutely phenomenal aamir khan is back becoming nuanced self confident khan we always admired his fat fit video really created lot inspiration me my friends that increased our eager level watching this movie sakshi tanwar is pretty decent actress her role was absolutely strong withheld but her dialogues certain places were quite awkward almost out place girls who played geeta babita just kept me edge my seat what amazement these girls did how they used their empowerment pull male sport with such ease screenplay direction was something i really loved just like how haryana was shot how wrestling scenes were shot after ae dil hai mushkil i managed enjoy priams music but songs dangal were average i wouldnt consider them at loop listening soundtracks not many songs really stand out as such honestly i enjoyed this movie much more than sultan based its true story fantastic direction overall this movie is masterpiece with beautiful direction performances acting this motion picture really touched my heart leave your house grab your tickets this is definitely cinema watching movie any society it is very important understand meaning women rights no matter how boyish something could be women are considered human beings girls have right do anything ranging being police officer taxi driver these are typical jobs that mostly men pull off but women can also pull these jobs off but much quicker try understand that men women are same professional wise,0.5112698412698412,0.22692592592592592,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,This Years Best along with PINK,"DANGAL - its such a good thing that both PINK and DANGAL , two top movies of this year are women centric. Its such an improvement for Bollywood which doesn't make movies on women because such movies doesn't make money , which is a wrong fact , PINK made almost 300% profit. You just need to make a good movie and it will make you money. And by saying women centric m serious, the character of Mahavir Phogat is not the real hero of the movie , rather its his daughter Geeta Phogat who is in the center of the movie. For understanding what MAhavir Phogat has achieved in his life , we must know the fact that Hariyana is one of the worst state in India for girls. A very low sex ratio and a very low Literacy rate for women. And in such scenario what Mahavir Phogat has achieved is tremendous. That said , one thing is clear that we cant expect anything out of the box which we always get from AMIR's movies like 3 idiot , PK and TALAASH , because its a biopic , so they have to show what actually happened , which is not exactly bad things , in fact what this movie shows is an out of the box real life story. First i would like to mention two things which i don't liked. 1st - The way the wrestling coach of NATIONAL SPORTS ACADEMY has been shown as one sided villain also who is kind of incapable to train , was wrong. 2nd - there was an unnecessary twist in the end which seems unconvincing. Apart from these two things , everything else is either good or great in the movie. The movie tackle through different themes. Sometimes it tackles them one by one , and sometimes simultaneously. But the good thing is that it tackles them convincingly. For example when we see Mahavir training his daughters rigorously , there comes a thought that, what kind of dad he is. He just stole the childhood of her daughters to fulfill his own dreams. But after some scenes on the wedding of Mahavir's daughters' friend both the daughters complaining about Mahavir her friend (who is getting married) reply that she hoped that she would had get such father as Mahavir who thinks about their daughters and wants them to achieve something and not like his own father who force her to marry at the age of just 14 to an unknown person. That particular scene convince the audience that what Mahavir is doing is not wrong as compared to the society where they are living. Another theme which movie showed very convincingly was how free a girl feel when she goes out of his family for the first time. Almost 1 hour of the movie contains wrestling matches. And those matches were done extremely well on technical level , and hook you like you were watching a real match. I mean as compared to this the matches show in SULTAN were just nothing. Among the performances ZAIRA WASIM (also the lead actor of Amir's next SECRET SUPERSTAR) playing Young GEETA was delight to watch. The scene where she request her father to not cut her hair and she will do anything he wants was heartbreaking. And she does her fighting scenes very well considering the fact that the director in an interview has mentioned that ZAIRA was actually the weakest among all the four girls before they start their training. But when it comes to fight scenes , FATIMA SANA SHEIK as the older Geeta was best. She fights like a real fighter and her hard work is visible on the screen. On her dramatic acting front she was awesome too. Both the actresses who played young and old Babita were good too , but got less screen time as compared to Geeta's character. Aparshakti Khurana(brother of Ayushman Khurana) as the nephew of Mahavir has an impeccable timing of comedy , and surly will make you laugh many time. But for Amir Khan , what to say , he blends so nicely , that he became MAHAVIR , and the actor Amir is nowhere visible anywhere. He just makes me wonder why cant other actors (yes pointing at SRK and SALLU) stop-showing their persona and blend into characters in their movies . Around the whole movie there were so many whistle blowing happening , that i was not able to here the dialogues many times. But just before climax , the NATIONAL ANTHEM runs in common wealth games after GEETA PHOGAT won her gold medal(i hope that's not a spoiler) and the whole theater stands in respect of NATIONAL ANTHEM you just cant help and get OVERWHELMED. 9.4/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR",this years best along with pink,dangal its such good thing that both pink dangal two top movies this year are women centric its such improvement bollywood which doesnt make movies women because such movies doesnt make money which is wrong fact pink made almost 300 profit you just need make good movie it will make you money by saying women centric m serious character mahavir phogat is not real hero movie rather its his daughter geeta phogat who is center movie understanding what mahavir phogat has achieved his life we must know fact that hariyana is one worst state india girls very low sex ratio very low literacy rate women such scenario what mahavir phogat has achieved is tremendous that said one thing is clear that we cant expect anything out box which we always get amirs movies like 3 idiot pk talaash because its biopic so they have show what actually happened which is not exactly bad things fact what this movie shows is out box real life story first i would like mention two things which i dont liked 1st way wrestling coach national sports academy has been shown as one sided villain also who is kind incapable train was wrong 2nd there was unnecessary twist end which seems unconvincing apart these two things everything else is either good or great movie movie tackle through different themes sometimes it tackles them one by one sometimes simultaneously but good thing is that it tackles them convincingly example when we see mahavir training his daughters rigorously there comes thought that what kind dad he is he just stole childhood her daughters fulfill his own dreams but after some scenes wedding mahavirs daughters friend both daughters complaining about mahavir her friend who is getting married reply that she hoped that she would had get such father as mahavir who thinks about their daughters wants them achieve something not like his own father who force her marry at age just 14 unknown person that particular scene convince audience that what mahavir is doing is not wrong as compared society where they are living another theme which movie showed very convincingly was how free girl feel when she goes out his family first time almost 1 hour movie contains wrestling matches those matches were done extremely well technical level hook you like you were watching real match i mean as compared this matches show sultan were just nothing among performances zaira wasim also lead actor amirs next secret superstar playing young geeta was delight watch scene where she request her father not cut her hair she will do anything he wants was heartbreaking she does her fighting scenes very well considering fact that director interview has mentioned that zaira was actually weakest among all four girls before they start their training but when it comes fight scenes fatima sana sheik as older geeta was best she fights like real fighter her hard work is visible screen her dramatic acting front she was awesome too both actresses who played young old babita were good too but got less screen time as compared geetas character aparshakti khurana brother ayushman khurana as nephew mahavir has impeccable timing comedy surly will make you laugh many time but amir khan what say he blends so nicely that he became mahavir actor amir is nowhere visible anywhere he just makes me wonder why cant other actors yes pointing at srk sallu stop showing their persona blend into characters their movies around whole movie there were so many whistle blowing happening that i was not able here dialogues many times but just before climax national anthem runs common wealth games after geeta phogat won her gold medal i hope thats not spoiler whole theater stands respect national anthem you just cant help get overwhelmed 9 4 10 by anup apu kumar,0.5046399176954735,0.16023662551440324,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8.0,Another Classic from Aamir but this time a Tribute to Mr. Phogat,"DANGAL REVIEW :- ""Dear Sam, remember the day 23 Dec 2016 when you watched Best Film ever made on Wrestling."" This is what my heart said to me after the very first sec i finished watching Dangal. Without wasting time let me elaborate my views about Film. Acting - Aamir Khan does excellent Job, not the Best of the year but surely in top 5. Never saw Fatima before but she was the Best among star cast. Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra got limited screen space and gave their Best. Supporting Starcast is good too.Writing - Excellent ! I Don't except better story/writing than this for any Wrestling based film (It was expected due to Biopic Thing).Screenplay - Notable ! It really keeps you hook from the first frame to the last, especially in last 30 minutes.Music - Good but not the Best. Reason is, expectations from Pritam are always high. Not a single Filmy Song, every song is situational so Video Songs looks better than Audio. Background Score is Awesome, helps film in emotional scenes.Cinematography - Average ! Its good actually but Nothing impressive except those Fight sequences. Some scenes are pacy and some are Slow, overall Average. Direction - Nitesh Tiwari at his Best. He has succeeded in Whatever he wanted to present to audience. He is The real master behind this Classic, with any other director it would have become typical Filmy movie but Nitesh kept it strictly as an Art Film which is needful for Biopic like this. In some scenes he loses it, few scenes are too filmy but receives Claps and Whistles so i must say he wanted to keep it Classy but forcefully added some Massy scenes. Will meet him soon and thank him for giving us Classic Called Dangal.Final Words - Dangal is not a Commercial film like PK and 3 Idiots i mean some Massy elements and comedy is missing which is needed for high Repeat Value so i believe this film won't get that High level success which these films got. It is less in Quality compared to Epic Taare Zameen par and less Commercially compared to PK, it misses the Masterpiece Tag just because of few scenes and minuses but it is another 'Classic' by genius called Aamir Khan. He gave 2 years for the film and it worths. Film has many Goosebumps and Emotional moments which you will remember even after leaving theater. It worths your money, it is Best Film of the year among all High Budget Film released so far, i recommend don't miss this film. And last thing don't even think to compare it with Sultan cause it will be like comparing Sachin Tendulkar with Murali Vijay. 8/10* stars by me. And last but not the Least 'A Grand Salute' to the 'Mahavir Phogat and his Family'. True Heroes like him needs to be recognised for their Hardwork in our Country.",another classic aamir but this time tribute mr phogat,dangal review dear sam remember day 23 dec 2016 when you watched best film ever made wrestling this is what my heart said me after very first sec i finished watching dangal without wasting time let me elaborate my views about film acting aamir khan does excellent job not best year but surely top 5 never saw fatima before but she was best among star cast sakshi tanwar sanya malhotra got limited screen space gave their best supporting starcast is good too writing excellent i dont except better story writing than this any wrestling based film it was expected due biopic thing screenplay notable it really keeps you hook first frame last especially last 30 minutes music good but not best reason is expectations pritam are always high not single filmy song every song is situational so video songs looks better than audio background score is awesome helps film emotional scenes cinematography average its good actually but nothing impressive except those fight sequences some scenes are pacy some are slow overall average direction nitesh tiwari at his best he has succeeded whatever he wanted present audience he is real master behind this classic with any other director it would have become typical filmy movie but nitesh kept it strictly as art film which is needful biopic like this some scenes he loses it few scenes are too filmy but receives claps whistles so i must say he wanted keep it classy but forcefully added some massy scenes will meet him soon thank him giving us classic called dangal final words dangal is not commercial film like pk 3 idiots i mean some massy elements comedy is missing which is needed high repeat value so i believe this film wont get that high level success which these films got it is less quality compared epic taare zameen par less commercially compared pk it misses masterpiece tag just because few scenes minuses but it is another classic by genius called aamir khan he gave 2 years film it worths film has many goosebumps emotional moments which you will remember even after leaving theater it worths your money it is best film year among all high budget film released so far i recommend dont miss this film last thing dont even think compare it with sultan cause it will be like comparing sachin tendulkar with murali vijay 8 10 stars by me last but not least grand salute mahavir phogat his family true heroes like him needs be recognised their hardwork our country,0.40700892857142856,0.18379794973544972,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Had me on the edge of my seat and in tears,"It's conceivable that a wrestling movie might have you on the edge of your seat, but who'd have thought it would bring tears to your eyes.

I can't remember the last 3 hour movie (nearly) where absolutely nobody took a toilet break apart from in the intermission.Everything about the movie is superb from the cinematography through to the script writing. The movie is superbly directed and there are so many stellar acting performances that it would be unfair to single anyone out.One thing about sports movies is that the action can often seem staged, but the fight sequences in this movie are superbly done and brilliantly filmed.Everyone knows an AK movie is going to be great, and this definitely doesn't disappoint.A must watch.",had me edge my seat tears,its conceivable that wrestling movie might have you edge your seat but whod have thought it would bring tears your eyes dangal does both large doses right opening scenes through awesome climax this is one movie that will keep you glued screen i cant remember last 3 hour movie nearly where absolutely nobody took toilet break apart intermission everything about movie is superb cinematography through script writing movie is superbly directed there are so many stellar acting performances that it would be unfair single anyone out one thing about sports movies is that action can often seem staged but fight sequences this movie are superbly done brilliantly filmed everyone knows ak movie is going be great this definitely doesnt disappoint must watch,0.5472619047619048,0.34226190476190477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,"Charming, informing and emotional","Dangal is a very charming bio pic, I have been a fan of Aamir Khan's work ever since watching ""3 idiots"" and have since been a fan of many Indian films, which gets me quite excited to see this film. Dangal is well acted, directed, the music was great as well, but it seems to lack the depth that was so captivating in Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots or even in the more recent movie ""PK"".As a real-life inspired bio pic this film couldn't have been done any better, it is a feel good story and focuses heavily on a father- daughter relationship, an element of the film that brings lots of emotions to the table. As many of Aamir's work there are often these very emotional elements and like he has done before he has succeeded in this film. This is an inspiring story and a very empowering film as well. The narrative flow of the story was good and I thought that the song choices were spot on, really helps building the emotions in this film.Aamir Khan's acting was amazing and so are the other Indian stars who I am unfamiliar with. Because of Indian film's tendencies to last for long durations there really is a chance to tell this story in immense detail which helped to elevate its narrative without drifting away into any irrelevant details. But that really is all that is to say about this particular film, it works well as a sports/drama biopic and is well made, the thing is there is nothing much to it other than that, Aamir Khan's film has a tendency to explore important ideas and to really be able to delve deep into them, while there is the central theme of sexism in India and acts as a powerful social commentary unlike his previous bouts this really isn't as inspiring. So in conclusion this is an amazing film and deserves many praises however I feel that there is a definite room for improvement.",charming informing emotional,dangal is very charming bio pic i have been fan aamir khans work ever since watching 3 idiots have since been fan many indian films which gets me quite excited see this film dangal is well acted directed music was great as well but it seems lack depth that was so captivating aamir khans 3 idiots or even more recent movie pk as real life inspired bio pic this film couldnt have been done any better it is feel good story focuses heavily father daughter relationship element film that brings lots emotions table as many aamirs work there are often these very emotional elements like he has done before he has succeeded this film this is inspiring story very empowering film as well narrative flow story was good i thought that song choices were spot really helps building emotions this film aamir khans acting was amazing so are other indian stars who i am unfamiliar with because indian films tendencies last long durations there really is chance tell this story immense detail which helped elevate its narrative without drifting away into any irrelevant details but that really is all that is say about this particular film it works well as sports drama biopic is well made thing is there is nothing much it other than that aamir khans film has tendency explore important ideas really be able delve deep into them while there is central theme sexism india acts as powerful social commentary unlike his previous bouts this really isnt as inspiring so conclusion this is amazing film deserves many praises however i feel that there is definite room improvement,0.5637121212121211,0.2095075757575758,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,"Dangal, a sports biopic, is a powerful, inspirational and incredible story of women empowerment.","Dangal (means a Wrestling Competition), a biopic on Phogat Sisters Geeta and Babita and their father Mahavir Singh Phogat, by Nitesh Tiwari is a triumph over odds. Geeta made history by being the first Indian female wrestler to win the Gold medal (55kg) and Babita won Silver medal (51 Kg) in 2010 Commonwealth games. Offlate, Bollywood has certainly made a few very good sports biopics viz. Chake de, Bhag Milkha Bhag, Mary Kom, M.S. Dhoni etc. Most of them have done justice to the players and their lives. It is true that films about real heroes can become predictable. The story telling needs to be authentic too without misconstruing the essence. And that is where Dangal scores like anything. It is unadulterated, and remains true to the core. Dangal focuses on a father and his perseverance, persistence and eccentricities to fulfill his dream of fetching gold for the country through daughters. Under the umbrella of this main plot, the film tries to create awareness about so many pertinent issues. The film not only talks about the fight which one has to do in the real Dangal but also about the fight which one has to do against the mindset of people viz. certain games and sports defined as a taboo for girls by the society, the thought that girls are born just to get married, raise children and do household chores etc. The fight is also against the scarcity of resources, the lack of infrastructure support for the sports people especially sports like wrestling. One can instantly connect with the father who has deleted 'impossible' from his dictionary. One can also very well connect with the girls who just want to enjoy the bliss of being children and dressing up like girls, find their father to be overbearing, and their transformation to achieve what their father dreamt for them. The end is indeed predictable since we all know about Phogat sisters and their achievement but Dangal brings to us their journey which is simply incredible, inspiring and awesome. The best part of the film is its tone which is kept very much real, authentic and light. There are moments of humour too.Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) is a National Level Wrestling Champion who had to make a choice in his life and leave wrestling. But his passion and love for the sport never died. He used to enjoy all the fights in the local Dangal and always felt nostalgic of his wrestling days looking at the medals and certificates he had won. He is hopeful of living his dream through his to-be-born son. He gets disappointed every time when his wife Daya Shobha Kaur (Sakshi Tanwar) delivers a baby girl instead of a boy. He is definitely unlike those fathers who disown their girl children. Mahavir loved his girls but was just disillusioned about how to fulfill his dream of fetching gold for the country without having a son. But the day he realizes that his girls Geeta (Zaira Wasim -young Geeta), and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar - Young Babita), have the potential to be wrestlers, he decides to go against the societal norms, fights all odds to train his girls. This is where the incredible journey of Phogat sisters begins. Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat is terrific. It is one of his best performances, which would be remembered for ever, be it in terms of his physical transformation, his dictatorial approach with girls, his determination, never-to-quit attitude, being a possibilist as a path finder; he excels in every frame.Sakshi as Mahavir's wife Daya Shobha Kaur has given such a powerful and natural performance. She has fewer dialogues, but she speaks through her eyes and facial expressions. She plays perfect bridge between her unyielding husband and daughters.Phogat sisters are real discoveries be it the younger versions of Geeta and Babita (Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar) or their grown up versions (Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra). They are so much convincing. Zaira and Suhani are adorable. Fatima and Sanya are also very good. They have played their roles with so much of conviction.Another character which needs special mention is that of Omkar, nephew of Mahavir Singh Phogat. Ritwik Sahore (Ferrari Ki Sawari fame) has played his role very well. Aparshakti Khurrana (brother of Ayushman Khurana) plays the role of grown up nephew, he has less screen time, but he has made his presence felt. He narrates the story in typical Haryanvi accent. His scenes generate humour.Girish Kulkarni as coach in National Sports Academy has done justice to his role.The songs go with the flow of the film. Pritam's music clubbed with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya is great. The lyrics are in absolute sync with the story. Dangal would certainly touch your hearts. I failed miserably in letting the tears come out of my eyes at many occasions, be it father- daughter relationship, their triumph over all odds, attitude to remain positive even amidst challenges. Felt like jumping out of chair and cheer their every victory on and off Dangal. Got goosebumps when the National Anthem is played along with the tricolor in the air. Many scenes have stayed with me.Dangal, a sports biopic, is a powerful, inspirational and incredible story of women empowerment. It not only talks about the fight Mahavir Phogat and his daughters Geeta and Babita had to do in the real Dangal but also about the fight which they had to do against the mindset of the people, patriarchic society, scarcity of resources etc. A must watch film.",dangal sports biopic is powerful inspirational incredible story women empowerment,dangal means wrestling competition biopic phogat

10.0,"Inspiring and original, the year's best film","An Aamir Khan film is special. It's an event that happens once every two years or once a year if we're lucky. We've come to expect excellence from a man who can go from playing a college student to an alien to now an aging overweight former wrestler with such pure passion and dedication that you're left wondering if there's anything Mr. Khan can't dobut we already know the answer to that question. He pours his blood and sweat into each project and I truly believe that no other individual in the Indian film industry understands the pulse of their audience as well as Aamir does. He graces our screens rarely but the wait is worth it. We think we've seen the year's best film and here comes Aamir with a bang!Dangal is a remarkable movie. It's inspiring, emotional, and very entertaining. It's based on the extraordinary true story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, a man determined to win a gold medal in wrestling. When his dreams don't bear fruit he hopes his son will do what he couldn't but fate has something else planned for the father of four daughters. Mahavir realizes that his (and society's) mindset needs a drastic switch and transfers all his energy and efforts into training his two daughters, Geeta and Babita. Nothing and no one can come between him and his ambition. He is relentless and focused to a fault which, to be fair, is needed to achieve greatness. You have to be a little mad to live your passion. The film makes many such points very well. You're only crazy until you're first to cross the finish line and the spectators cheer. We want it all but few of us are willing to put in the hard work it actually takes to win. Not many sports based films are as real as Dangal. You feel each aching muscle and nothing comes easy. Defeat is heartbreaking and victory is earned.More than anything, the movie is about family and relationships. There's a father who gives everything he has to make his daughters succeed, a concerned and strong mother in the background, and daughters who are confused and resentful until they realize what they can achieve. Each character is beautifully fleshed out and finds strong connect with the audience. The casting director has outdone himself, everyone looks and plays their part with utmost conviction. It's hard to say if the young Geeta and Babita are better portrayed by Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar or if Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra do more justice to their roles as the older Geeta and Babita. Aparshakti Khurana plays the girls' cousin and reluctant sparring partner in some of the films' funniest and most heartwarming scenes. The bond that the entire family shares brings a genuine smile to your face. Sakshi Tanwar infuses quiet strength in Daya Kaur, the mother and wife who makes the decision to watch her daughters weep, struggle and, eventually triumph. Aamir is the only well known actor in this team and he is so consumed by the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat that you realize that you're watching Aamir the actor not Aamir the superstar. You make method acting look good, Mr. Khan.Four writers are credited for writing the movie that was two years in the making. The attention to detail shows, not a scene or emotion is out of place. Several instances stay in your mind after the final reels play, the most notable of those being: when the little girls' hair is mercilessly cut off and you don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for them, when Geeta literally takes down her father and later calls to apologize, and every time one of the girls enters the ring to wrestle. The music and background score are smoothly blended into the screenplay, time isn't set aside to play a song but when they come up you appreciate them as your senses are heightened. Director Nitesh Tiwari has worked tirelessly to come up with a movie that captivates moviegoers. It's a colorful journey that never strays from the plot and at no point becomes boring or slow. Mission accomplished!Dangal is refreshingly feminist without being a movie about feminism. That in itself deserves a standing ovation. There's talk about the differences between sons and daughtersboys and girls but it soon morphs into a film about athletes. Gender isn't used as a crutch nor is girl power shoved down your throat. At no point is the fact that the main characters are girls irrelevant nor should it be because going against the grain and succeeding should always be celebrated. Dangal is one of those rare films that surpasses its own aspirations. Take a bow, team Dangal, you're worthy of all the praise coming your way.",inspiring original years best film,aamir khan film is special its event that happens once every two years or once year if were lucky weve come expect excellence man who can go playing college student alien now aging overweight former wrestler with such pure passion dedication that youre left wondering if theres anything mr khan cant do but we already know answer that question he pours his blood sweat into each project i truly believe that no other individual indian film industry understands pulse their audience as well as aamir does he graces our screens rarely but wait is worth it we think weve seen years best film here comes aamir with bang dangal is remarkable movie its inspiring emotional very entertaining its based extraordinary true story mahavir singh phogat man determined win gold medal wrestling when his dreams dont bear fruit he hopes his son will do what he couldnt but fate has something else planned father four daughters mahavir realizes that his societys mindset needs drastic switch transfers all his energy efforts into training his two daughters geeta babita nothing no one can come between him his ambition he is relentless focused fault which be fair is needed achieve greatness you have be little mad live your passion film makes many such points very well youre only crazy until youre first cross finish line spectators cheer we want it all but few us are willing put hard work it actually takes win not many sports based films are as real as dangal you feel each aching muscle nothing comes easy defeat is heartbreaking victory is earned more than anything movie is about family relationships theres father who gives everything he has make his daughters succeed concerned strong mother background daughters who are confused resentful until they realize what they can achieve each character is beautifully fleshed out finds strong connect with audience casting director has outdone himself everyone looks plays their part with utmost conviction its hard say if young geeta babita are better portrayed by zaira wasim suhani bhatnagar or if fatima sana shaikh sanya malhotra do more justice their roles as older geeta babita aparshakti khurana plays girls cousin reluctant sparring partner some films funniest most heartwarming scenes bond that entire family shares brings genuine smile your face sakshi tanwar infuses quiet strength daya kaur mother wife who makes decision watch her daughters weep struggle eventually triumph aamir is only well known actor this team he is so consumed by character mahavir singh phogat that you realize that youre watching aamir actor not aamir superstar you make method acting look good mr khan four writers are credited writing movie that was two years making attention detail shows not scene or emotion is out place several instances stay your mind after final reels play most notable those being when little girls hair is mercilessly cut off you dont know whether laugh or feel bad them when geeta literally takes down her father later calls apologize every time one girls enters ring wrestle music background score are smoothly blended into screenplay time isnt set aside play song but when they come up you appreciate them as your senses are heightened director nitesh tiwari has worked tirelessly come up with movie that captivates moviegoers its colorful journey that never strays plot at no point becomes boring or slow mission accomplished dangal is refreshingly feminist without being movie about feminism that itself deserves standing ovation theres talk about differences between sons daughters boys girls but it soon morphs into film about athletes gender isnt used as crutch nor is girl power shoved down your throat at no point is fact that main characters are girls irrelevant nor should it be because going against grain succeeding should always be celebrated dangal is one those rare films that surpasses its own aspirations take bow team dangal youre worthy all praise coming your way,0.558852109949671,0.17480708654489144,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,Another Cinematic Masterpiece from Aamir Khan,I am a big fan of Aamir Khan and I watch all his movies. Aamir sets a high expectation bar for his movies in all departments. Dangal also had a high bar to climb and it did so with aplomb. Aamir chose a great subject of encouragement for female wrestlers in India. Against all odds Mahavir Singh Phogat decides to train his daughters in wrestling to win a gold medal for India. Movie's casting was excellent with all actors doing so well in their characters. Aamir was great as usual but I was really impressed by how well the four girls did as growing wrestlers. They were strong and they were agile and they owned the court they were in. I am sure there were some technical help provided in shooting all those wrestling scenes but you will not be able to tell that while watching the movie. Their scenes were authentic and you were rooting for them as they were gritting their teeth and fighting tooth and nail to defeat their opponents. Dialog delivery in Haryanvi was on the money and you really will come out thinking that these actors speak that way everyday. I am not going to provide any spoiler but will just say that this is a movie to watch. It is a shame that release of such a beautiful movie had to be delayed by more than a year because of political fear.,another cinematic masterpiece aamir khan,i am big fan aamir khan i watch all his movies aamir sets high expectation bar his movies all departments dangal also had high bar climb it did so with aplomb aamir chose great subject encouragement female wrestlers india against all odds mahavir singh phogat decides train his daughters wrestling win gold medal india movies casting was excellent with all actors doing so well their characters aamir was great as usual but i was really impressed by how well four girls did as growing wrestlers they were strong they were agile they owned court they were i am sure there were some technical help provided shooting all those wrestling scenes but you will not be able tell that while watching movie their scenes were authentic you were rooting them as they were gritting their teeth fighting tooth nail defeat their opponents dialog delivery haryanvi was money you really will come out thinking that these actors speak that way everyday i am not going provide any spoiler but will just say that this is movie watch it is shame that release such beautiful movie had be delayed by more than year because political fear,0.5323842592592591,0.33694444444444444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,The movie with its classic taste,"Amir Khan a person always amazes everyone,recently he is working for movies with a good moral lesson and a worthy base.That kind of movie is a ""movie"". Dangal is a good example it has a classic taste and digestible fun which peels off the people eyes. It is a true story full of suspense and when you're watching a fight you feel like you are wrestling in between this kind of quality is difficult to be produced and Amir is good at it. The reason for giving 9 stars is because of its ending I think it should be made better by showing scene like he is putting that medal at the wall of Honor.
