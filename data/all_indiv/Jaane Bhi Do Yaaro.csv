8.0,"Satire, Farce & Black Comedy all rolled into one","I remember when this movie came out it faired poorly at the box office and was off the theatres within a week. But I think it generated an underground sort of movement amongst youth who wanted to watch a different kind of cinema and soon it had a cult of its own. You ask any Indian cine fan between 30s and 40s his/her top 10 favorite movies and I think this movie will figure in the list somewhere. The plot is simple; two struggling photographers accidentally get involved in the filth that Indian 'system' is and which includes everybody from the police to media to politicians to builders etc. etc. etc. Once involved they try to expose everyone involved but the question is 'will they survive?' Performance wise, everyone from Naseer to Ravi Baswani to Pankaj Kapoor to Satish Shah to Satish Kaushik to Om Puri have given brilliant performances, probably amongst their best. It's almost like magic that you know that it happened but you never know how. The film is bustling with synergy of all these performers (actors, writers, director and the whole crew) who are just happy to work with each other and in such a creative environment and are out to make a difference. And difference they made. It is and will remain a cult classic with people from our generation.",satire farce black comedy all rolled into one,i remember when this movie came out it faired poorly at box office was off theatres within week but i think it generated underground sort movement amongst youth who wanted watch different kind cinema soon it had cult its own you ask any indian cine fan between 30s 40s his her top 10 favorite movies i think this movie will figure list somewhere plot is simple two struggling photographers accidentally get involved filth that indian system is which includes everybody police media politicians builders etc etc etc once involved they try expose everyone involved but question is will they survive performance wise everyone naseer ravi baswani pankaj kapoor satish shah satish kaushik om puri have given brilliant performances probably amongst their best its almost like magic that you know that it happened but you never know how film is bustling with synergy all these performers actors writers director whole crew who are just happy work with each other such creative environment are out make difference difference they made it is will remain cult classic with people our generation,0.6595864661654135,0.30921052631578955,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,"Brilliant farce, one of the finest movies ever made !!!","A lot of comments about this movie have centered on the apparently slapstick comedy, ignoring its usage to lend a sense of the grotesque in what is a essentially a masterful farce, and beneath the surface, more of a tragedy.This movie centers around the two young protagonists, full of ideals and the will to win against the powers of endemic and ubiquitous corruption, a corruption that is so manifestly present that the others do not seem to question its existence, but implicitly assume it and use it to serve their own ends. However, our heroes find the going quite tough.Although partly inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow-up"", this movie is in a class by itself, with dark humor reminiscent of Kafka and Gogol. The star cast includes some of the finest actors to ever grace the screens of Bollywood (or for that matter, anywhere else). Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapoor and many others deliver stellar performances in this tragi-comedy which is one of finest pearls produced by the New Wave movement in Indian cinema.Regretabbly, comprehension of the movie requires intimate knowledge of the background, something which you would only have if you have lived in India, where corruption is as natural as breathing, and if you are familiar with the turbulent times when New Wave Cinema was taking off, a time of discontent and idealism among youth, a time of unemployment and the times of the angry young man (as typified by Amitabh Bachchan in many commercial films from this era).However one can still enjoy it for it is a comedy worth watching. Hopefully, the viewer will see the tragedy beneath the humor.I rate this movie among the finest movies of all time, and in the class of farces, it stands alongside Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"".",brilliant farce one finest movies ever made,lot comments about this movie have centered apparently slapstick comedy ignoring its usage lend sense grotesque what is essentially masterful farce beneath surface more tragedy this movie centers around two young protagonists full ideals will win against powers endemic ubiquitous corruption corruption that is so manifestly present that others do not seem question its existence but implicitly assume it use it serve their own ends however our heroes find going quite tough although partly inspired by michelangelo antonionis blow up this movie is class by itself with dark humor reminiscent kafka gogol star cast includes some finest actors ever grace screens bollywood or that matter anywhere else om puri naseeruddin shah pankaj kapoor many others deliver stellar performances this tragi comedy which is one finest pearls produced by new wave movement indian cinema regretabbly comprehension movie requires intimate knowledge background something which you would only have if you have lived india where corruption is as natural as breathing if you are familiar with turbulent times when new wave cinema was taking off time discontent idealism among youth time unemployment times angry young man as typified by amitabh bachchan many commercial films this era however one can still enjoy it it is comedy worth watching hopefully viewer will see tragedy beneath humor i rate this movie among finest movies all time class farces it stands alongside kubricks dr strangelove,0.537669801462905,0.16927028909787536,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Good guys always lose,"Two simple photographers, trying to eke out an honest living, caught in a web of scandal and deceit.Fantastic direction, outstanding plot, brilliant script, phenomenal casting and amazing acting. This movie has you laughing till the last scene, which is when the laughter is wrenched from your throat!The movie has great attention to detail. For example, the scene when monkey is being photographed, look into the mirror in his hand. You actually see Tarneja in a checked jacket and gun in hand. Which leads to the single biggest flaw: no gunshot heard?But that may be forgiven. The comedy is unending!!! For example, the Dhritrashtra, still blind, saying ""This is too much! Yeh Akbar kahaan se aa gaya?""... Or Tarneja and Ahuja entering the Mahabharat in complete costumes, but still wearing their specs and sunglasses respectively!

10.0,The most successful experiment in Indian film-making,"Vinod and Sudhir are struggling photographers. Shoba, editor of a political daily newspaper 'Khabardar' hires them for an assignment. what they thought was just a photography assignment turns out be a journalistic venture. Real life losers ends up hatching a 'big story'. A film about the modern ruling class and ruled class with a humorous backdrop.The very first time I watched this film I mistook it for a comedy. After 20 years I watch this film again and again and I get something new every time. This is a satire, farce, comedy, tragedy, drama or whatever you call it and its brilliant. There are just so many things in this film to admire. Acting, script, pace, camera, dialogs, humor. It's a masterpiece. This film has an unparalleled legend. The best thing I like about this film is its unique narration i.e. to find out the dead body Sudhir and Vinod enact the whole scene. They don't just look around. One actually shoots another guy who acts dropping dead and then look around for the body. Every character is stretched to its maximum. Ashok is a spy so he spies with binoculars, Sudhir and Vinod uses the same script to woo their customers, Demello is a corrupt mayor so he himself gives the plan and not just take bribes. They are simple things which brings out the characters. Ashok greets Tarneja every time he sees him. Even when he enters on the stage during Mahabharat he says ""Good morning Sir"" and then gets into his character. Ahuja drinks so much that he takes a coffin for a sports car. Priya is a bait Tarneja uses so she has a romantic angle with everyone she meets (including Ashok). Commissioner falsely crying on a mike and talking about 'Gutter'. Demello giving an interview to Times magazine. Ashok walks in with a loud sycophant (""Lattu Ho Jayegee Lattu"") to threaten Shobha by mistake kicks her on the back and she actually twists his nose with a wrench. Every scene and every character is stretched. Its like a mythology. A Pandu gives a 'Hul' to the camera person before realizing he is on TV. Tarneja shamelessly talking about his success. Shobha changes her color unabashedly.A time bomb in a dinner party. A dead body on stage (how can someone think of this one??). I have no idea if one can write this kind of a script on a paper.This movie is unparalleled as far as great actors in one film is concerned. Pankaj Kapoor is the most underrated actor of our times. Imagine Tarneja and Kallu Mal Koyle Wala is played by one man. Brilliant actor.My favorite line is ""Ashok Ye Press Confrenece Kyun Bulayee Gayee Thee"". Satish Kaushik has given a genius performance. I love it when he say ""Time bomb Main Time Bahut Kam Hai"". By the way he has also written dialogs for this film. Naseer is too good. His best line is ""Tum Commissioner Ka Bawarchee Hai?"". Satish Shah has done a genius work as a dead body. He has maintained a wacky smiley expression throughout. Ravi Vasvani is too good. I love him when he sing ""Ek Duje Ke Liye"". Om Puri is a genius. His best line are ""paalan To Hamnin Apne Baap Kee Agya Ka Nahin Kiya. Tu Cheej Kya Hai"" and ""Pul To Tutegaaee"".

10.0,Hum Honge Kamyaab...,"Hum Honge Kamyaab....and they did with Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro! JBDY is one of those rare Indian comedies where you don't have to wait for a funny situation to crop up from under the weight of suspense, action, romance, and tragedy. The most recognizable genres of the film world, practically all of them, have been realized, exploited and stretched to such an extent in this film that they almost border on the edge of not just satire but surrealism and you are left wondering – How in the world did they ever find humor in this one? Who could ever come up with the idea of a male corpse dressed as a woman, on roller skates, ""standing"" as a prop in a stage production of Mahabharata? It's bizarre but it works because of the stellar performances of the lead cast and some bitingly clever writing by Kundan Shah.The film takes its central idea from Antonioni's Blow Up and explores the investigation of two struggling photographers Vinod (Naseeruddin Shah) and Sudhir (Vinod Baswani) who in their desperation accept the offer of a local self-serving tabloid editor Shobha Sen (Bhakti Barve) to photograph a clandestine meeting between the corrupt Municipal Commissioner D'Mello (Satish Shah) and the real estate developers who intend on bribing him to get the best deal in town. As the rivalry between the builders, the smooth and vile Tarneja (Pankaj Kapur) and the alcoholic Ahuja (Om Puri) escalates, the threat of murder looms large. The two knuckle-headed photographers, caught in a web of deceit and double crosses, to their horror, inadvertently capture murder on camera that further leads them into the dark recesses of corruption that plagues news media, business, politicians, bureaucracy, and police. We along with our heroes later learn about the extent to which the guilty parties will go to preserve their survival.It is this very struggle for survival of each character fueled by greed that not just exudes cynicism while adding weight to the story but also acts as a source of non-stop side-splitting fun. Case in point: the scene in which the entire entourage of Tarneja and Ahuja, including the city commissioner, unabashedly usurp the play of Mahabharata because Vinod and Sudhir have hidden the dead body that could serve as the proof of the builder's wrongdoing and our heroes' innocence somewhere in that production. This has to be the most original idea ever to come out of Bollywood. The film clearly hints at the deterioration of the social structure of a society where the entire machinery is immoral and corrupt; breaking allegiances is commonplace, and all we have left to fight for us are two dunderheads who drew inspiration from a monkey and the only weapon that they have is a dead body. And this is where the blackness in this comedy works so wonderfully.Despite a more somber theme, Kundan Shah and team have done a great job in keeping the tone of the movie light. Even the most intense scenes are so multi-layered and laced with such farce and symbolism that it would be unfair and impossible to reveal all of them here. This movie is an experience and if you want to know why the lines ""Thoda Khao, Thoda Phenko"" (Eat a little, throw a little) and ""Tum commissioner ka bawarchi hai?"" (Are you the chef of the commissioner?) still induce a belly laugh among the loyalists, you have to OWN this movie and watch it again and again till your belly hurts.",hum honge kamyaab,hum honge kamyaab they did with jaane bhi do yaaro jbdy is one those rare indian comedies where you dont have wait funny situation crop up under weight suspense action romance tragedy most recognizable genres film world practically all them have been realized exploited stretched such extent this film that they almost border edge not just satire but surrealism you are left wondering how world did they ever find humor this one who could ever come up with idea male corpse dressed as woman roller skates standing as prop stage production mahabharata its bizarre but it works because stellar performances lead cast some bitingly clever writing by kundan shah film takes its central idea antonionis blow up explores investigation two struggling photographers vinod naseeruddin shah sudhir vinod baswani who their desperation accept offer local self serving tabloid editor shobha sen bhakti barve photograph clandestine meeting between corrupt municipal commissioner dmello satish shah real estate developers who intend bribing him get best deal town as rivalry between builders smooth vile tarneja pankaj kapur alcoholic ahuja om puri escalates threat murder looms large two knuckle headed photographers caught web deceit double crosses their horror inadvertently capture murder camera that further leads them into dark recesses corruption that plagues news media business politicians bureaucracy police we along with our heroes later learn about extent which guilty parties will go preserve their survival it is this very struggle survival each character fueled by greed that not just exudes cynicism while adding weight story but also acts as source non stop side splitting fun case point scene which entire entourage tarneja ahuja including city commissioner unabashedly usurp play mahabharata because vinod sudhir have hidden dead body that could serve as proof builders wrongdoing our heroes innocence somewhere that production this has be most original idea ever come out bollywood film clearly hints at deterioration social structure society where entire machinery is immoral corrupt breaking allegiances is commonplace all we have left fight us are two dunderheads who drew inspiration monkey only weapon that they have is dead body this is where blackness this comedy works so wonderfully despite more somber theme kundan shah team have done great job keeping tone movie light even most intense scenes are so multi layered laced with such farce symbolism that it would be unfair impossible reveal all them here this movie is experience if you want know why lines thoda khao thoda phenko eat little throw little tum commissioner ka bawarchi hai are you chef commissioner still induce belly laugh among loyalists you have own this movie watch it again again till your belly hurts,0.4878747795414462,0.09872134038800703,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"

,Shah's Farce On Corruption,"I had hard a lot about 'Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro' and Kundan Shah happens to be one of my favourite Indian directors. Moreover the cast included first rate actors. Thus, I was quite excited. Now the film does look quite dated at times and some of the jokes feel a little old but things get funnier as the story moves along. Many seem to have been impressed by the in-your-face slapstick humour which is abundant in 'Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro' but what made this a better comedy for me was the underlying satire regarding the cynicism of corruption in India. Corruption has become just as frequent as the summer sun shining over the equator. It's a regular occurrence in the workplace and this movie captures that effectively with a dose of humour. Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, Ravi Baswani, Pankaj Kapur, Bhakti Barve and Satish Shah deliver hilarious performances. Kundan Shah's direction is fluid and, along with Sudhir Mishra, he's done a very good job in writing. Loosely based on Antonioni's 'Blow Up', ''Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro' has achieved the cult classic status over the years.

9.0,Mahabharat scene is the best comic scene ever produced in Hindi cinema,"The entire movie is very good and tickle you continuously. But the last Mahabharat scene is a real diamond in the entire Hindi cinema. Never again such scene could be produced. The movie revolves around some set of characters and after the interval it centers around the dead body of the Dmelo. Dmelo is the municipal governor and is murdered by Tarneja (Pankaj Kapur). Unfortunate for Tarneja two young photographers (who think that they are professional), Vinod (Naseeruddin Shan) and Sudhir (Ravi Baswani) succeed to collect evidence against him. Ahuja (Om Puri) the builder and Shobha (Bhakti Barve-Inamdar) the reporter are two enemies of Tarneja and want to have hands on the proofs that Ahuja kills Dmelo. The main achievement of the movie is the pasteurization of the scenes. Starting from the opening ceremony to the end Mahabharat scene, all the scenes make you laugh like a child. Actors too are well fitted in their roles. All the actors are art film actors and certainly knows their work very well. Will not comment any more on the end scene of Mahabharat. Hardly there will be any who have not seen this scene. Any time you watch this scene, it has ability to make you fall on ground. The movie not only makes you laugh, but from inside makes you think about the corrupted society that we are living in. The movie has sad ending, which makes it more close to reality.

9.0,Realism seasoned with comedy,"I had watched the movie years ago and thought it was funniest film I had ever seen. So I sat down one afternoon to enjoy a few laughs all over again. Let me say right off the bat that a comedy this ain't. Is it a good film? You betcha - it is a great film! Naseeruddin Shah and Ravi Baswani are two photographers who want to get their photo studio off the ground. Instead they get caught up in a lot of hanky-panky involving corrupt politicians, government officials, and construction magnates. They run from pillar to post trying to get a scoop of a life time, but end up ""seeing"" a murder in a photograph they took. A Blowup (David Hemmings) type scenario ensues with a lot of bumbling around at night. A corpse is found that does not stay in place and the whole thing is very reminiscent of Weekend at Bernie's that came years later, and was perhaps inspired by this Kundan Shah gem! The comedic moments start with the wandering corpse and end in the most rollicking 15 minutes in cinema when a staging of the Mahabharata goes seriously bad. The Pandavs are desperate for the play to proceed on with Draupadi's Cheerharan (removal of clothes) while the Kauravas are equally desperate to see that Draupadi remains clothed (and I am not confused about the Mahabharata)!

Comedy was beyond childish and the protagonists swung one moment from being bumbling stumbling fools to Sherlock Holmes. Situations are so outlandish only a 10 year old from the 80s would laugh at. Naseerudin is an awesome serious actor but loses all credibility in comedic roles. He tries really hard against his natural style of acting and the effort is evident to the discerning viewer. Bhakti Bharve and Om puri are credible mentions in the movie. Pankaj Kapur had a on and off performance. The rest of the cast filled in the space in between.

10.0,"A rollicking, uproariously hilarious, slapstick comedy.","One monkey, two photographers and a murder-mystery form the backdrop to portray the quintessential nexus between the corrupt Indian politico-administrative class and the honest, trying-to-make-ends-meet class.

,Slightly Overrated.,"Let me first clarify that I have been a fan of this movie for a long time. When I say its overrated, I mean to say that its still a very good movie, much much ahead of its times, but its not as great as its made out to be.I will just outline some of the negatives that may or may not have been pointed out by prior reviewers. Positives are many obviously. The biggest positive is the fact that a film of this nature was conceived, that too back in 1983, with a budget of barely around 800k rupees. The comic sequences are nice, the satire is accurate. I especially loved the portrayal of early 80s Bombay, India. The people and the places of that era.Coming to the negatives, the whole plot is so superficial, so shallow, so vain. may be that type of a premise was necessary here, to combine the comic and tragic aspects of the movie. But it makes all the characters of the movie seem incredible, in the bad sense. Too inconsistent. They keep switching from being normal, to being idiotic, to being intelligent, randomly. Perfect example of it is the scene between Naseeruddin and Bhakti Barve in her office. It could have been an awesome scene, but it doesn't reach that potential. And the same is true for so many other scenes. May be the film was made in a hurry.Another thing is, when you watch the movie now, the humor doesn't work much. Its like a movie playing on slow-mo. Even the actor's reactions and dialogue deliveries seem to be delayed, everything seems too slow. There are a number of Priyadarshan movies, that are way funnier than this one. Of course its unfair to compare movies like that. The point is, its just not as hilarious as I first found it to be.There are other issues too. The whole Murder-Deadbody segment is so flawed logically. Why would Tanreja murder someone in a park, that too in broad daylight? and why would he choose to return there in the middle of the night to pick up the dead body. And then, why would anyone dump the body under a bridge to be inaugurated to the public the next day.The satire is monotonous. We Indians are all already aware of corruption. the film doesn't really say anything new. and the worst thing is, there isn't really any greater message to the film. I mean if its a satirical movie, it should have something to say. shouldn't it? This one just announces that the COMMON man is doomed in corrupt India.I still do endorse this movie. My favorite scene is the one under the bridge, where the two innocent citizens, Naseer and Ravi get harassed by the constable. Unfortunately, its 2014 and the same is still happening in India. I guess thats the ultimate message of this movie. To laugh at it, or to cry over that, is left to the viewers choice.",slightly overrated,let me first clarify that i have been fan this movie long time when i say its overrated i mean say that its still very good movie much much ahead its times but its not as great as its made out be i will just outline some negatives that may or may not have been pointed out by prior reviewers positives are many obviously biggest positive is fact that film this nature was conceived that too back 1983 with budget barely around 800k rupees comic sequences are nice satire is accurate i especially loved portrayal early 80s bombay india people places that era coming negatives whole plot is so superficial so shallow so vain may be that type premise was necessary here combine comic tragic aspects movie but it makes all characters movie seem incredible bad sense too inconsistent they keep switching being normal being idiotic being intelligent randomly perfect example it is scene between naseeruddin bhakti barve her office it could have been awesome scene but it doesnt reach that potential same is true so many other scenes may be film was made hurry another thing is when you watch movie now humor doesnt work much its like movie playing slow mo even actors reactions dialogue deliveries seem be delayed everything seems too slow there are number priyadarshan movies that are way funnier than this one course its unfair compare movies like that point is its just not as hilarious as i first found it be there are other issues too whole murder deadbody segment is so flawed logically why would tanreja murder someone park that too broad daylight why would he choose return there middle night pick up dead body then why would anyone dump body under bridge be inaugurated public next day satire is monotonous we indians are all already aware corruption film doesnt really say anything new worst thing is there isnt really any greater message film i mean if its satirical movie it should have something say shouldnt it this one just announces that common man is doomed corrupt india i still do endorse this movie my favorite scene is one under bridge where two innocent citizens naseer ravi get harassed by constable unfortunately its 2014 same is still happening india i guess thats ultimate message this movie laugh at it or cry over that is left viewers choice,0.5227398989898989,0.10370408631772271,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.34}"
