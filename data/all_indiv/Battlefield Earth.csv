1.0,One of the greatest sci fi comedies ever made!,"My spouse and I went to see this on opening night. We were expecting to see an extremely bad and costly film, and we were not really disappointed. It is a testament to John Travolta's genius that his career survived this disaster at all.As they say, garbage-in, garbage out. Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned, war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you, I thought so too!), and add unfortunate Barry ""can't get a break"" (or maybe it should be 'cant pick a script') Pepper and all you need is Travolta himself - playing the arrogant, merciless, slightly effeminate and quite under-sized leader of the alien colonists. Remove any hint of character development from the script and use the worst of the worst black box technobabble explanations for plot devices. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.In fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. We had a great time that night. Halfway through the film more than half the crowd was actually interacting with the film, asking ""Mr Worf, where's Commander Riker?"" and asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds of years gas would remain viable in the gas-tank of a Harrier.If you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens, and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid, weak, etc. Barry Pepper somehow becomes convinced that he's not born to be a slave, and learns to fly a harrier, etc. It's really not worth the effort of typing. There are a few not-so-subtle and not very original but good messages about ethnocentrism to be found here, but not much else. Some day when you need a good laugh, rent this or borrow it from your local bad film collector.",one greatest sci fi comedies ever made,my spouse i went see this opening night we were expecting see extremely bad costly film we were not really disappointed it is testament john travoltas genius that his career survived this disaster at all as they say garbage garbage out start with l ron hubbard novel your first mistake featuring completely plagiarized dark skinned war like hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads if this sounds like klingons you i thought so too add unfortunate barry cant get break or maybe it should be cant pick script pepper all you need is travolta himself playing arrogant merciless slightly effeminate quite under sized leader alien colonists remove any hint character development script use worst worst black box technobabble explanations plot devices finally stay true idiotic gibberish you based film first place youve got makings rolling floor comedy fact opening night packed theater people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into film never really stopped we had great time that night halfway through film more than half crowd was actually interacting with film asking mr worf wheres commander riker asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds years gas would remain viable gas tank harrier if you need know about plot its this simple earth has been conquered by amazingly stupid group klingon like aliens remaining humans live large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid weak etc barry pepper somehow becomes convinced that hes not born be slave learns fly harrier etc its really not worth effort typing there are few not so subtle not very original but good messages about ethnocentrism be found here but not much else some day when you need good laugh rent this or borrow it your local bad film collector,0.5578520316892411,-0.05450189345538179,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"

Very impressive indeed!1 hour 56 minutes: ...But since the Harriers have been sitting in a hangar for 1000 years how come they are still fully fueled and shiny with working weapons?? Never mind. I guess we're not supposed to notice that.2 hours: Yayyy the fighting has begun! Ooo look, some pretty explosions. Cool - a building fell down! The humans are stopping to throw chairs through windows. That will defeat the aliens for sure!2 hours 2 minutes: Hang on just one moment? Isn't this supposed to be BATTLEFIELD earth? There are about 15 humans and 10 aliens.

,The new millennium's nominee for Worst Film of the Century,"BATTLEFIELD EARTH (2000) 1/2 * John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Kim Coates, Richard Tyson, Sabine Karsenti, Michael MacRae, Michael Byrne, Sean Hewitt, Kelly Preston (unbilled cameo). My candidate for worst film for the new millennium: atrociously awful Travolta vehicle (who is totally to blame for his co-producing this pet project due to his Scientology ties) in bringing L. Ron Hubbard's cult sci-fi novel to fruition is just one God-forsaken mess from start to finish in what feels like the ultimate Ed Wood film with a dire need for the gang from MST3K to show up and provide apt ridicule: Travolta stars as 9 foot tall alien Terl, a Psychlo who commands his rampaging race in wiping out mankind in the year 3000 with only rebel Pepper out to thwart his nefarious plans of mining gold for his own just rewards. Ridiculous from the get go: the make-up of the Psychlos: a combination of dreadlocks a la Jar Jar Binks to the 'Coneheads' to the costume rejects of any speed metal band of the 1990s; the dim lighting and production design; the cheezy special effects (except for the climax of Terl's planet - who the HELL cares if I'm giving away the ending?!! IT SUCKS!!!) - which looked kinda cool!) and laugh-out loud dialogue: ('Rat-brains' is the often reviled retort by Terl to the 'man-animals' he despises).

2.0,The Critics Are Right,"What a bad film this is. I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren`t BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio. It`s badly directed , badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen . Maybe Travolta should have stuck to his guns and played Jonnie . He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper) and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos , sounds just like psychos , I bet they `re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think "" Rat brains "" is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the "" man animals "" to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term "" Man animals "" irritating ? Surely it should be "" Manimals "" ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and Harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think they`d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ? Do you think anyone involved with this film deserves to work again ? Me neither",critics are right,what bad film this is i thought critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren t battlefield earth is one worst films released by major hollywood studio it s badly directed badly cast barry pepper as jonnie makes one least impressive screen hero s ever seen maybe travolta should have stuck his guns played jonnie he perhaps would have been slightly too old part but at least he does have some charisma unlike pepper has one worst scripts ever written alien race called psychlos sounds just like psychos i bet they re really evil cruel oh they are evil cruel just like psychos why do they think rats are favourite food humans when it s only thing they ve seen humans eat why do they think rat brains is insult humans especially when they consider man animals be primitive species am i alone finding term man animals irritating surely it should be manimals far sharper clever expression but sharp clever is no way describe this script cities stand almost intact after thousand years since collapse human civilisation not only that but so do large amounts firearms ammo harrier jump jets flight simulator jump jets where humans learn fly within week no doubt they ll learn what petrol is learn put it jets order fly them does this sound very likely you let me put it this way go into time machine go back biblical times capture few dozen people bring them back present get them become fighter pilots within week do you think they d be any good flying planes shooting down enemy forces me neither do you think they could overthrow superior civilisation me neither do you think anyone involved with this film deserves work again me neither,0.6585515873015872,-0.11753472222222223,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,"Bad direction, bad dialogue, an unimaginative and over-done look, laughable plot twists and a collection of average actors struggling to stay afloat amide all the nonsense","It is the year 3000. Many years have passed since the world was conquered by an evil race called the Psychlos in order that they would strip it of its resources just as they had countless other planets. Man has been forced back to the Stone Age, slowly dying out in small, ineffective pockets of resistance around the world. Sent out from his community, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods  a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses (who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer) opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.Being a film critic must be a hard job to do at times. Many of the films you watch will not be brilliant, nor will they be terrible  most will be OK and nothing more. Therefore when reviewers get a chance to gush, they generally take it. Likewise, when a bad film does come to the big screen and reviewers get to see it, they often will take great pleasure in putting the boot it  we see it with at least one big budget film each year (2004 was Catwoman). So I usually will try and view a really panned film because I am aware that sometimes the critics are just being unfair  however, most of the time I'll wait until it comes to TV to make that decision. With Battlefield Earth, I must concede that it is a pretty bad film  but maybe not as bad as the many critics all said, although it would be easy to just keep kicking it in the same way as everyone else does.The film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue, poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess, if not 'the worst film of all time'. The story quickly goes wrong by making massive plot jumps with its two threads (Jonnie and Terl) that it quickly becomes tiresome. It is not just that major parts of it make little sense (even if you are trying to get into it) it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms  something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years, or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100% seriously at the same time.The film has clearly had money spent on it, and it isn't that the effects look bad, it is more that they feel over-designed. The Psychlos (cr*p name) look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd  like a Klingon but with more bits! Similarly the transport craft and alien sets all feel like somebody has just ripped off other films and then tried to combine them; the end result is the look of a cheap sci-fi that looks like it is a sci-fi film as opposed to a 'real' futuristic world. It is hard to describe and maybe I'm doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future's of a thousand sci-fi movies, not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and, as such, it was even less engaging. Of course it didn't help that the direction was so ham fisted that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it  a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn't have saved it; but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.With such a poor product to sell to us, even an all star cast would have struggled  so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just soobvious and easy  there is nothing to watch here, partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and, try as he might, he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness, taking his character way too seriously for the material  but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable, low-rent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don't even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.Overall this is a very poor film and, although I don't wish to join the mob by just kicking it, I didn't find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful, they just feel like generic, overdone sci-fi fare with little or no imagination  a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are, at best, illogical and, at worst, silly, stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the 'worst film ever' hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time.",bad direction bad dialogue

2.0,The Battlefield of Shaker Heights,"This movie should have been a 'Project Redlight'. John Travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to L. Ron Hubbard. That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake. I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film, but the acting, the dialog, the special effects, the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development, and of course, the hair extensions will just have to suffice.I would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating, but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something, I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee, so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director, but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place. The end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except Travolta.'In preparing a judgment of worth, I proclaim this lame movie to be worst' Don't forget that 'I told ya' to blame John Travoltaand L.

1.0,What were they thinking???,"Actually, was anyone involved with this total disaster thinking at all? My personal guess: no, and if they were, I'd rather not know about what.None of the reviews have done BE justice. Having heard what a start to finish mess this was, my brother and I decided to watch it, just for fun. It was horrible beyond all our expectations - and not in a fun way. And so I can now tell anyone who's interested: You must see this movie yourself to realize the sheer magnitude of its badness, stupidity, and ineptitude. I've heard that BE cost about 70 million dollars to make - though how anyone could have greenlighted it is a great mystery. Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much, my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:* Travolta's salary, plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.* Special effects, film, sets, costumes, makeup and hair extensions: 25 million.* all other salaries: $4,999,888.* script: $112 and change.Though that still doesn't begin to explain the end result. I give up. I'll never understand how Travolta managed to get BE made, or released, for that matter. Why is he tanking his career again? Who knows? After this, why should anyone care? Ah, well. I hope he finds something better to act in in the future; I honestly can't see how he could come up with something worse.I never thought I'd give anything a 1, but this is indeed as worthy a candidate as I've ever seen. So, * is my vote, and I'd rate it lower if it were possible. Just... incredible.

1.0,Awesomely Bad,"It's been a couple of years now since I saw this astounding film for the first (only) time; actually, I don't think I'll ever quite recover from the experience.The English language doesn't have enough negative terms to give an adequate analysis of what's wrong here, but let's give it a try.First, the plot, which has more holes than my oldest jacket. We are asked to believe that Earth has been strip mined by the vicious Psychlos for 1000 years, yet can still produce useful quantities of valuable minerals. In all that time, the Psychlos never found Fort Knox, though gold is high on their shopping list, nor did they stumble on the jet fighters that the humans themselves find when the aliens send them out to find gold. The humans, by the way, though reduced to primitive servitude by their conquerors, learn to use those jets in about a day, with the help of a flight simulator that fortunately is not only in working order, but can draw on power from... somewhere.The story is given appropriate support by some of the worst acting (what WAS John Travolta thinking???), dialog, and music you're ever likely to see or hear. A couple of acceptable special effects shots only serve to highlight the wretched standard of the rest. As for the camera work, well, I have nothing in particular against slow motion or tilting the camera, but was it really necessary to use either so lavishly here?After a while, I stopped even trying to find anything good in this mess and sat watching in sullen silence, unwilling to admit defeat by walking out, but determined not to see the film again.Since IMDb doesn't allow a zero rating, I guess it has to be 1/10 - which is at least 10 points more than this deserves.",awesomely bad,its been couple years now since i saw this astounding film first only time actually i dont think ill ever quite recover experience english language doesnt have enough negative terms give adequate analysis whats wrong here but lets give it try first plot which has more holes than my oldest jacket we are asked believe that earth has been strip mined by vicious psychlos 1000 years yet can still produce useful quantities valuable minerals all that time psychlos never found fort knox though gold is high their shopping list nor did they stumble jet fighters that humans themselves find when aliens send them out find gold humans by way though reduced primitive servitude by their conquerors learn use those jets about day with help flight simulator that fortunately is not only working order but can draw power somewhere story is given appropriate support by some worst acting what was john travolta thinking dialog music youre ever likely see or hear couple acceptable special effects shots only serve highlight wretched standard rest as camera work well i have nothing particular against slow motion or tilting camera but was it really necessary use either so lavishly here after while i stopped even trying find anything good this mess sat watching sullen silence unwilling admit defeat by walking out but determined not see film again since imdb doesnt allow zero rating i guess it has be 1 10 which is at least 10 points more than this deserves,0.5370758928571429,-0.006495535714285718,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"

If you can find a copy; not too people have wanted to rent this movie, so copies of it are rare.This movie is painful to watch. It hurts my eyes because everything is so tinted, it hurts my neck because everything is so angled, and it hurts my ears because the acting is so bad. Oh, and trying to figure out why someone thought this would make a good movie gave me a headache. All that being said, I cannot hate this film like some other movies, and I think it's because no one thinks it's good. I feel like it didn't do anything to me. I didn't see it in theatres and I didn't rent it, it just soaked up a couple hours of TV time. And, I have to admit, it was a lot of fun watching how gut-wrenchingly awful this movie could get.And it got awful. People have called Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst movie of all time. I disagree. I firmly believe that Battlefield Earth is the worst movie of all time. It had a budget, so it had no excuse to be awful. This is the worst movie ever made.

1.0,Whoever thought that making this movie was a good idea should be shot.,"It was with a certain morbid curiosity and a near certainty that I would be seeing an awful movie that I rented Battlefield Earth, and I must say the movie exceeded all of my expectations, it is indeed exceptionally terrible. Upon finishing the film I immediately checked to see if Ed Wood had directed it, then I remembered he has been dead for some time, but no worries Roger Christian is here to take his place.I'm not real sure where to begin because there is nothing good to start with and so much bad to describe, but I might as well start from the top. Earth has been taken over by an evil alien race that is scouring the universe for gold....yeah gold, don't know why but they want it. Earth has been occupied for a thousand years by these aliens and they are still here, searching for gold. They haven't bothered to raid the bank vaults of the world, they are too busy digging for the stuff....no really, part of the plot later hinges on the humans finding and raiding Fort Knox to supply gold to the aliens to fool them into thinking the humans are mining when they are secretly planning a revolt....I'm not kidding, but that comes later.The few remaining humans are savage tribal creatures scratching out a miserable existence as primitive hunter-gatherers. Later on they learn to fly Harrier jets and dogfight alien ships with only a few days of work, they must have been passing down fighter pilot lore for the last ten centuries or so. The main character, Jonnie Goodboy (Barry Pepper) and no I'm not making up that name either, leaves the safety of his tribe because he doesn't believe in the aliens and his dad has just died. His dad's death is very emotional, even though he never appears on camera, is never referred to ever again in the film, and the mourning lasts for about three seconds before the cut to the next scene. Anyway he gets captured by the aliens in a shopping mall and taken to their base. There follows a terrible scene where Jonnie Goodboy does battle with the alpha male in the prison population over who gets to eat first, Jonnie defeats him, and proclaims that everyone will eat at the same time from now on with thunderous cheers from the riff raff....pretty powerful stuff. I've already wasted a lot of time bashing this film so I'll just finish by saying that Jonnie Goodboy gets hooked up to a learning machine, becomes really educated, learns to fly, plans a revolt, does a little nuclear engineering, and blows up a planet. Pretty good for a guy whose most advanced tools were sticks and rocks earlier in the film. Oh one last thing, at least half the film is shot at a fifteen degree angle, we're not sure why, and once again slow motion doesn't make a bad scene better, it just makes it take longer.",whoever thought that making this movie was good idea should be shot,it was with certain morbid curiosity near certainty that i would be seeing awful movie that i rented battlefield earth i must say movie exceeded all my expectations it is indeed exceptionally terrible upon finishing film i immediately checked see if ed wood had directed it then i remembered he has been dead some time but no worries roger christian is here take his place im not real sure where begin because there is nothing good start with so much bad describe but i might as well start top earth has been taken over by evil alien race that is scouring universe gold yeah gold dont know why but they want it earth has been occupied thousand years by these aliens they are still here searching gold they havent bothered raid bank vaults world they are too busy digging stuff no really part plot later hinges humans finding raiding fort knox supply gold aliens fool them into thinking humans are mining when they are secretly planning revolt im not kidding but that comes later few remaining humans are savage tribal creatures scratching out miserable existence as primitive hunter gatherers later they learn fly harrier jets dogfight alien ships with only few days work they must have been passing down fighter pilot lore last ten centuries or so main character jonnie goodboy barry pepper no im not making up that name either leaves safety his tribe because he doesnt believe aliens his dad has just died his dads death is very emotional even though he never appears camera is never referred ever again film mourning lasts about three seconds before cut next scene anyway he gets captured by aliens shopping mall taken their base there follows terrible scene where jonnie goodboy does battle with alpha male prison population over who gets eat first jonnie defeats him proclaims that everyone will eat at same time now with thunderous cheers riff raff pretty powerful stuff ive already wasted lot time bashing this film so ill just finish by saying that jonnie goodboy gets hooked up learning machine becomes really educated learns fly plans revolt does little nuclear engineering blows up planet pretty good guy whose most advanced tools were sticks rocks earlier film oh one last thing at least half film is shot at fifteen degree angle were not sure why once again slow motion doesnt make bad scene better it just makes it take longer,0.5111236171236172,-0.06537157287157287,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"

1.0,Lives up to the Hype,"Battlefield Earth has become something of a legend. It's the Holy Grail of Hollywood crap from the decade if not beyond and is quite possibly ""that which we do not speak of"" among scientologists. I was never one to pay much attention to critics, I always liked to watch and decide for myself but even I couldn't resist being strayed from any interest by the aura of disdain that surrounded this movie back in 2000. I was 16 then and any sci-fi adventure movie should've been worth a view, but not this one. Now, eleven years later I finally sat down to give it a shot and not only does it live up to it's reputation, it surpasses it.I was expecting a bad a movie. I was expecting cheesy performances and a weak a script but I got so much more. Battlefield Earth is a garbled mess from start to finish. We begin, as you might have guessed, on earth. A tribe of caveman-esque people struggle to survive. They're warned of a beast that prowls the land just beyond the horizon and are told of demons that rule the planet. But one brave dude, played by Barry Pepper decides there's more out there worth seeing and sets out to prove it. That beast they're all scared of? That's a statue from a long since abandoned mini-golf course. And those demons they're always whining about? They're a race of aliens from the planet Psychlo that have enslaved the human populace. For you see this isn't earth billions of years ago but earth in the future where the humans are no longer the dominant lifeforce and it's been so long since they had any power they're not even aware of how badly they got screwed over. This might seem like a spoiler...like I just blew a twist for you...but nope...fear not. Because thanks to a lame subtitle at the opening we already know this is ""A Saga of the Year 3000,"" and thanks to some other on screen text that we apparently needed we also already know that the human race is nearly extinct. Which basically means that if you actually managed to get to this movie without having seen any previews you still won't be in for any surprises. Because who wants to be surprised by a movie right? That would be stupid.The basic idea behind this introduction to the world isn't actually bad, having us start on what seems like a primitive society and seeing the truth revealed in layers has been done before but it can be effective even in spite of those spoilerific titles at the beginning. The problem though is this information is thrown at us within about 15 minutes of screen time. The whole movie feels very rushed and none of the scenes have any room to breath and we're treated to the same split wipe transition every 5 minutes or so. I won't break down the plot any more than that because there's really no need...let's just say the badguys do some stuff, the goodguys get involved and they want to stop being slaves...because well, being a slave sucks.The director seems determined to make this movie a visual feast but really doesn't know how. Every camera in the entire movie is tilted, which can make for an interesting shot, but when EVERY DAMN shot is done the same way it holds no artistic merit what so ever...instead it looks like they were working with a broken tripod. There's really nothing visually interesting about this movie at all except for the establishing shots of the planet Psychlo, which is only because they remind you of Blade Runner. In fact I'm pretty sure they just tinted a few shots from Blade Runner purple and cut them into this movie.The aliens are essentially just people with dreadlocks and slightly bigger, hairier hands with an extra finger and apparently they're also really stupid. You see, they have access to all of Earth's history and the capability to learn how to decipher it but evidently nobody thought it was a good idea which is why they think the favorite meal of a human is uncooked rat, and they can't be sure of man's ability to fly without tossing them in the air as a test. To top it all off the alien performances are so goofy they lose all menace. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have careers full of great performances but with this material they look like a High School theater troupe.There might've actually be a decent story to be mined out of this mess but the people involved just weren't able to find it. I like to give credit where credit is due even in movie's I'm not fond of, it's not too often I find a movie with no redeeming qualities to be found but I'm afraid Battlefield Earth just made the list.",lives up hype,battlefield earth has become something legend its holy grail hollywood crap decade if not beyond is quite possibly that which we do not speak among scientologists i was never one pay much attention critics i always liked watch decide myself but even i couldnt resist being strayed any interest by aura disdain that surrounded this movie back 2000 i was 16 then any sci fi adventure movie shouldve been worth view but not this one now eleven years later i finally sat down give it shot not only does it live up its reputation it surpasses it i was expecting bad movie i was expecting cheesy performances weak script but i got so much more battlefield earth is garbled mess start finish we begin as you might have guessed earth tribe caveman esque people struggle survive theyre warned beast that prowls land just beyond horizon are told demons that rule planet but one brave dude played by barry pepper decides theres more out there worth seeing sets out prove it that beast theyre all scared thats statue long since abandoned mini golf course those demons theyre always whining about theyre race aliens planet psychlo that have enslaved human populace you see this isnt earth billions years ago but earth future where humans are no longer dominant lifeforce its been so long since they had any power theyre not even aware how badly they got screwed over this might seem like spoiler like i just blew twist you but nope fear not because thanks lame subtitle at opening we already know this is saga year 3000 thanks some other screen text that we apparently needed we also already know that human race is nearly extinct which basically means that if you actually managed get this movie without having seen any previews you still wont be any surprises because who wants be surprised by movie right that would be stupid basic idea behind this introduction world isnt actually bad having us start what seems like primitive society seeing truth revealed layers has been done before but it can be effective even spite those spoilerific titles at beginning problem though is this information is thrown at us within about 15 minutes screen time whole movie feels very rushed none scenes have any room breath were treated same split wipe transition every 5 minutes or so i wont break down plot any more than that because theres really no need lets just say badguys do some stuff goodguys get involved they want stop being slaves because well being slave sucks director seems determined make this movie visual feast but really doesnt know how every camera entire movie is tilted which can make interesting shot but when every damn shot is done same way it holds no artistic merit what so ever instead it looks like they were working with broken tripod theres really nothing visually interesting about this movie at all except establishing shots planet psychlo which is only because they remind you blade runner fact im pretty sure they just tinted few shots blade runner purple cut them into this movie aliens are essentially just people with dreadlocks slightly bigger hairier hands with extra finger apparently theyre also really stupid you see they have access all earths history capability learn how decipher it but evidently nobody thought it was good idea which is why they think favorite meal human is uncooked rat they cant be sure mans ability fly without tossing them air as test top it all off alien performances are so goofy they lose all menace john travolta forest whitaker have careers full great performances but with this material they look like high school theater troupe there mightve actually be decent story be mined out this mess but people involved just werent able find it i like give credit where credit is due even movies im not fond its not too often i find movie with no redeeming qualities be found but im afraid battlefield earth just made list,0.49144631185807636,0.04701137424666838,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"
1.0,The Worst Sci-Fi film ever created,"I must admit, it was only recently I actually came across this film. The first clip I saw was the scene in the bar where John Travolta's character 'Terl' says his infamously cheesy ""While you were still learning how to spell your name, I was being trained to conquer galaxies"" line. The clip was on the YouTube video 100 top cheesiest quotes and at first I didn't recognise the fact that it was John Travolta giving this atrociously cheesy line and instead thought it was a secondary character or a comic relief, so I dug further in and decided to have a stab at watching this, hoping to God that it was what I had suspected. It was not, and in fact, it was much worse than that.The main problems with this film can be summed up in a few words:Everything...The acting is an absolute joke, there's no character development, John Travolta makes himself out to be a complete doom-brain, the special effects have nothing special to them, the story is more convoluted and nonsensical than anything ever written and whatever's left of this steaming pile of mess is probably a joke as well. At first I had high expectations to this film, but turns out I was wrong on so many levels.Let me elaborate on my above points, everyone in this movie (especially John Travolta) over acts their parts to the point of extremity, so much so that every scene is almost laughable. There is no character development, no proper run in as to he character's situation, you're just expected know before hand what is going on, which you can't because there's not enough of a back-story for you to build on. The special effects look like they were made on Flash Player 2004, the story makes no sense, with so many plot holes such as essential savages being able to learn in the window of a few days how to arm guns and fly Harrier Jump Jets, and how an entire Global Military force could not defeat the aliens yet 6 Harrier Jump Jets could take them down with ease. But this point is only trivial compared to some of the other points of idiotic interest you can pick out from this film. And probably my most irritating point is the fact that 99% of the shots are at an angle, which makes the movie almost unwatchable to begin with. Was the director's neck stuck at an angle so the only way he could tell what was going on was to have the camera's at an angle too? Really no need for it.Overall, this was just a big waste of time and money that somehow made it into the cinemas. I mean, for what was supposed to be an overly serious movie about the last fight of Mankind against aliens, this actually seems pretty comical, I mean John Travolta is essentially a one man comedy show with his overacting, a real gem of cinema there folks!",worst sci fi film ever created,i must admit it was only recently i actually came across this film first clip i saw was scene bar where john travoltas character terl says his infamously cheesy while you were still learning how spell your name i was being trained conquer galaxies line clip was youtube video 100 top cheesiest quotes at first i didnt recognise fact that it was john travolta giving this atrociously cheesy line instead thought it was secondary character or comic relief so i dug further decided have stab at watching this hoping god that it was what i had suspected it was not fact it was much worse than that main problems with this film can be summed up few words everything acting is absolute joke theres no character development john travolta makes himself out be complete doom brain special effects have nothing special them story is more convoluted nonsensical than anything ever written whatevers left this steaming pile mess is probably joke as well at first i had high expectations this film but turns out i was wrong so many levels let me elaborate my above points everyone this movie especially john travolta over acts their parts point extremity so much so that every scene is almost laughable there is no character development no proper run as he characters situation youre just expected know before hand what is going which you cant because theres not enough back story you build special effects look like they were made flash player 2004 story makes no sense with so many plot holes such as essential savages being able learn window few days how arm guns fly harrier jump jets how entire global military force could not defeat aliens yet 6 harrier jump jets could take them down with ease but this point is only trivial compared some other points idiotic interest you can pick out this film probably my most irritating point is fact that 99 shots are at angle which makes movie almost unwatchable begin with was directors neck stuck at angle so only way he could tell what was going was have cameras at angle too really no need it overall this was just big waste time money that somehow made it into cinemas i mean what was supposed be overly serious movie about last fight mankind against aliens this actually seems pretty comical i mean john travolta is essentially one man comedy show with his overacting real gem cinema there folks,0.4836087061087062,0.010114237614237619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
