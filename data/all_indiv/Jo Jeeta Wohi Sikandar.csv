10.0,from Orkut's JJWS-Community-Owner; JJWS is the Best Aamir Khan Movie of all time. - Aamir's Career-Best film !!!,"I give JJWS 10/10,100/100,1000/1000-----""The victory of the underdog"" theme makes for great entertainment. a true classic; it has that Aamir stamp all over it. This is a movie I've wanted to write about since ages. I seriously think its one of the most understated movies of Hindi cinema. It clearly hasn't received its due credit. This is the story of a family;family of a father & two young sons;about the bond between them;story of a small town life. JJWS is so real. Life of a small town boy .... who initially is Carefree & fun-loving;goes to the extent of causing a lot of trouble thru his actions; BUT eventually,he takes a u-turn,turns a new-leaf & Decides to take revenge in a very special-way...he also starts respecting both his Father & ever-supportive Brother......I love that scene {just before final cycle race} where Sanju starts crying & talks to Ratan - feels bad that Ratan couldn't take part in the race because of Sanju's tussle with the villainous Rajput-champ...Victory at the end wiping out all his past-antics----JJWS is complete.The characters just live with you in day-to-day life.The vision of the director is so fantastic,and never has he had to sacrifice entertainment to fulfill it.JJWS covers so many different aspects of a teenagers life and the movie has been so tastefully done that one can easily relate to the theme being portrayed.I say this because I grew up watching JJWS and have seen it almost 60 times and each of those times i have discovered some new aspect of the movie. The attention to detail is immaculate and this is the hallmark of a good movie. One of the most interesting aspects of JJWS is the background score. Not for one moment do you feel that the music doesn't belong there and has been inserted there just for the heck of it (as is the case with most of the movies of the time). The training montage(when Sanju prepares for the final cycle race), the music when the race is going on, the music when the Rajput boys go through MalRoad (shouting Vir Bahadur Ladke Kaun...) and for that matter every second of JJWS has remarkable music complementing the stellar performance. The way the song 'Pehla Nasha' captures the feeling of your first crush cannot be described. Jatin Lalit have really done a wonderful job. Last but not the least the way human emotions have been portrayed in JJWS is beyond comparison. I will never forget the scene in which Sanju(Aamir) tells his father that Ratan has had an accident. The acting by both the actors doesn't go overboard and there's no melodrama; the scene finds its place among the best in my mind.In my opinion JJWS was way ahead of its times in Hindi cinema and has been denied its due credit as a result of internal politics in Bollywood.What really makes JJWS compelling viewing is director Mansoor Khan's simple yet excellent narrative. Most of the characters are etched out well. Some great relationships are portrayed in the movie.....The coldness between Sanju & his dad is brought out in the movie pretty well. Secondly, between Sanju and his best friend Anjali who turns out to be his love eventually. Sanju never sees the love Anjali has for him, until she's the only support he has when he's alone in life. Thirdly, between the two brothers Ratan and Sanju.....who are as dissimilar to each other as one can think of......but are still so close to each other. One of the best sibling relationships portrayed in a Hindi movie. Three cheers for Aamir who has defied his chocolate-boy looks to emerge as the most-varied actor of his time.----- The biggest thing for the people in the town is the inter-school sports competition held every year. Ever since his cycling victory against the Rival school Rajput, Ramlal has been obsessed with Model beating them, through his obedient older son Ratan; Model's model student, in studies, sports and character and the pride of his father. there's one student who can win laurels for his school.....the honest, hard-working Ratan who's the ""gem of Model High School"". Ratan is determined to win this race this time......but courtesy a fight with Deepak Tijori and gang, he falls from a cliff and is badly injured. Model High's only hope.....Ratan can't participate in the race now, and Model has to be content with its usual ""pyjamachaap"" image. Sanju, is a happy-go-lucky bloke who loves hanging with friends and having fun in life even if it causes him to fail classes and disappoint his father. When this sudden tragedy occurs to Ratan, Sanju is transformed from a guy with not a care in the world to a responsible friend, brother, son and athlete. The stage is now set for a tale of friendship,love,family,sports and competition told beautifully by Mansoor Khan. All the performances are in top form.Aamir Khan is as adorable as ever as Sanju. You can't help but love him in this sweet role. Special mention should go to Mamik who plays Ratan. He put in a very sincere performance. you can't say that that was his first movie.he looked like a seasoned performer. It is too bad he wasn't seen too much after JJWS. Overall the movie was excellent. Amazing story, great performances and sweet music, well-defined small-town cinematography,nice melodious songs.....all-gr8-gripping-cycle-race-scenes . From start till end this movie keeps you glued to your seats. Performance...a top notch.Aamir Khan,Mr perfectionist, was totally remarkable.He is the soul of this film.From his starting non-serious attitude to ending maturing person was tremendous. The bike race is symbolic-especially for Sanjay, who finally reaches a level of maturity and realizes what needs to be done in order to prove for himself that he can do what needs to be done along with showing his family that he is capable of doing it. His understanding of his brother matures during the movie. This is a Must See if you enjoy Aamir Khan movies !",orkuts jjws community owner jjws is best aamir khan movie all time aamirs career best film,i give jjws 10 10 100 100 1000 1000 victory underdog

Perfect editing by Zafar Sultan n Dilip Katalgi. Awewome cinematography by Najeeb Khan. I saw this first on a rented VHS. After that I bought the VHS. Now planning to buy a DVD. This is a sports movie, in this movie the lead character, the brilliant Aamir, races bicycles, it has a contest at the end. This movie made so many teens mad with bicycle lust. Of course this is not just a bicycle film. Its a sweet lil masterpiece. A hidden gem. A classic. Its one of the few realistic coming of age stories. The characters are really likable and the acting is great too. Must watch for every teen. Everybody can relate to the characters. Whether still young or now old, many small-town and college-town guys who grew up with a tight circle of best friends will relate to this movie. I got so absorbed that I felt I was among them. Such was the impact of the acting by all. The final bike racing sequence is an adventurous and glorious experience. Every time I come across this film i cant help but to watch from start to finish.

10.0,Classic,"there are some films you watch once, feel good and nice, then forget as years pass on. on the other - hand there are some films which though you had watched them in your growing years and liked them, but whenever you catch up with them, it feels like you are watching them the very first time. And needless to say, they bring a smile on your face. Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992) is a film which I categorize in the latter. Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (abbreviated as JJWS) is a film which even if I try, I cannot fit into one genre. It is a love story, it is a musical comedy, it is a thriller (no not the thriller in the murder mysteries sense), it has a heady cocktail of emotion and drama and list goes on. Starring Aamir Khan, Ayesha Jhulka, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Mamik, Deepak Tijori, Pooja Bedi and Asrani in pivotal roles JJWS is set in small hilly town of Dehradun. In fact, the film opens with an overview of what is to come by. Schools are separated and segregated by Class and Status of people. Model School, Rajput School, Lawrence, Xaviers and Queens. Model School has the Tea Vendor's, Motor Mechanic's kids as students. Rajput, Lawrence and Queens are having kids from higher status and class of people. But among all these differences and inequalities one thing or one common thread which bonds all these schools and their students alike is the Annual Sports Meet. The stakes are high for single biggest sporting event in the hilly town. The Pyjamachaps (Model School Boys as christened by Rajput Boys) have a lot to prove, the Rajput's have to stamp their authority and in turn woo the Queens Girls. Lawrence and Xaviers too are not behind. Hopes and Dreams are riding high on the Cycle Race. Ratan Lal Sharma (played by Mamick) gets defeated by Rajput Boys' Shekhar Malhotra (played brilliantly by Deepak Tijori) in the Cyccle Race as his cycle is inferior quality and make than Shekhar's Italian one. Ramlal Sharma (assayed by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) vows to buy an imported bicycle for next year's Cycle Race by saving money. Inflated by the win, Shekhar Malhotra roams around the town with his gang of friends (Sooraj Thapar only I can reminisce) on Bikes, a Car, woos and flirts Queens College girls. He bullies and ridicules the Model School Boys. In comes Sanjay Lal Sharma (nickname Sanju) a happy go lucky sort of guy who is good for nothing, roams around with his sidekicks (Ghode -- played by Aditya Lakhia and Deven Bhojani ), dreams about Queens' College Girls, bunks classes, and is a laggard in studies as well as sports. Sanjay Lal Sharma (played by Aamir Khan) and Shekhar Malhotra's paths cross when they fall and try to woo the Queens College hottie and bombshell -- Devika (marvellously played by Pooja Bedi). Devika learns about Shekhar's flirtatious nature and arrogance, therefore tries to settle scores with him along with Sanjay Lal Sharma's help. Meanwhile, Anjali (played superbly by Ayesha Jhulka) has a soft corner for Sanjay. She too studies in Model School. She's in for a rude awakening when she assumes that Shekhar will confess his love for her. In turn, she finds Shekhar and Devika together. She takes this heartbreak in her stride pretty well. having said that, Devika dumps Sanjay and gets along with Shekhar. Things take another ugly turn, when Ratan gets into a fight with Shekhar and his gang. Ratan suffers severe injuries and his dream of participating and ultimately defeating Shekhar too shatters. However, jolted by these multiple debacles in his life in a short span of time Sanjay takes up the responsibilities of his house-hold. Nursing and attending his injured elder brother, consoling his father (Ramlal Sharma), we see a dramatic transformation in Sanjay's character. Ramlal Sharma too is very disappointed, that his elder son will not be able to make to the Annual Cycling Race. Disillusioned too because he has purchased the imported Italian Bicycle from his yearly savings. Sanjay too gets support from Anjali, who stands by him like a rock and also helps him train for the Annual Cycle Race. Another, powerful and important scene in the film, is the realization of the changes happening in Sanjay from his elder brother Ratan. He even relinquishes his position as a competitor and participant in the Annual Cycle Race and asks Sanjay to step into his shoes. the Final Cycle Race is really an edge of the seat matter. In a nail biting finish, Sanjay topples and pips Shekhar and emerges victorious. Lot of takeaways from JJWS. Nothing is impossible, Hard Work and Perseverance are keys to success and victory. In order to prove oneself in front of the world --- actions speak louder than words. Friends are forever, the self realization and self introspection is sufficient to discover the hidden strengths and talent. Coming First and emerging Victorious is one thing, but maintain that consistently is altogether a different ballgame. Underdog tag helps in the respect, that an Underdog has nothing to lose. The JJWS story is very simple but is told in a very different manner. The Key ingredients of the story, are aforementioned. Music too is a USP of JJWS. Lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri is top - notch. The Film's signature dialog ""Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar"" you will get to hear twice, one in the beginning and another one at the climax. Even after the end Credits start to roll, you feel it is utmost right ""Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar"".",classic,there are some films you watch once feel good nice then forget as years pass other hand there are some films which though you had watched them your growing years liked them but whenever you catch up with them it feels like you are watching them very first time needless say they bring smile your face jo jeeta wohi sikandar 1992 is film which i categorize latter jo jeeta wohi sikandar abbreviated as jjws is film which even if i try i cannot fit into one genre it is love story it is musical comedy it is thriller no not thriller murder mysteries sense it has heady cocktail emotion drama list goes starring aamir khan ayesha jhulka kulbhushan kharbanda mamik deepak tijori pooja bedi asrani pivotal roles jjws is set small hilly town dehradun fact film opens with overview what is come by schools are separated segregated by class status people model school rajput school lawrence xaviers queens model school has tea vendors motor mechanics kids as students rajput lawrence queens are having kids higher status class people but among all these differences inequalities one thing or one common thread which bonds all these schools their students alike is annual sports meet stakes are high single biggest sporting event hilly town pyjamachaps model school boys as christened by rajput boys have lot prove rajputs have stamp their authority turn woo queens girls lawrence xaviers too are not behind hopes dreams are riding high cycle race ratan lal sharma played by mamick gets defeated by rajput boys shekhar malhotra played brilliantly by deepak tijori cyccle race as his cycle is inferior quality make than shekhars italian one ramlal sharma assayed by kulbhushan kharbanda vows buy imported bicycle next years cycle race by saving money inflated by win shekhar malhotra roams around town with his gang friends sooraj thapar only i can reminisce bikes car woos flirts queens college girls he bullies ridicules model school boys comes sanjay lal sharma nickname sanju happy go lucky sort guy who is good nothing roams around with his sidekicks ghode played by aditya lakhia deven bhojani dreams about queens college girls bunks classes is laggard studies as well as sports sanjay lal sharma played by aamir khan shekhar malhotras paths cross when they fall try woo queens college hottie bombshell devika marvellously played by pooja bedi devika learns about shekhars flirtatious nature arrogance therefore tries settle scores with him along with sanjay lal sharmas help meanwhile anjali played superbly by ayesha jhulka has soft corner sanjay she too studies model school shes rude awakening when she assumes that shekhar will confess his love her turn she finds shekhar devika together she takes this heartbreak her stride pretty well having said that devika dumps sanjay gets along with shekhar things take another ugly turn when ratan gets into fight with shekhar his gang ratan suffers severe injuries his dream participating ultimately defeating shekhar too shatters however jolted by these multiple debacles his life short span time sanjay takes up responsibilities his house hold nursing attending his injured elder brother consoling his father ramlal sharma we see dramatic transformation sanjays character ramlal sharma too is very disappointed that his elder son will not be able make annual cycling race disillusioned too because he has purchased imported italian bicycle his yearly savings sanjay too gets support anjali who stands by him like rock also helps him train annual cycle race another powerful important scene film is realization changes happening sanjay his elder brother ratan he even relinquishes his position as competitor participant annual cycle race asks sanjay step into his shoes final cycle race is really edge seat matter nail biting finish sanjay topples pips shekhar emerges victorious lot takeaways jjws nothing is impossible hard work perseverance are keys success victory order prove oneself front world actions speak louder than words friends are forever self realization self introspection is sufficient discover hidden strengths talent coming first emerging victorious is one thing but maintain that consistently is altogether different ballgame underdog tag helps respect that underdog has nothing lose jjws story is very simple but is told very different manner key ingredients story are aforementioned music too is usp jjws lyrics by majrooh sultanpuri is top notch films signature dialog jo jeeta wohi sikandar you will get hear twice one beginning another one at climax even after end credits start roll you feel it is utmost right jo jeeta wohi sikandar,0.5441139734582359,0.1270647931303669,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"

,"Overall a highly recommended film for audiences who appreciate a little drama, good performances and an entertaining few hours.","Long Review:Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (JJWS) is a heart-warming story of a young man, Sanju, his buddies and his family consisting of his father (Ramlal) and an older brother(Ratan). The story is set in a hill station where the richest families send they're kids to school. Apart from top notch schools, there are also a few local ones like Model in which Ramlal is a coach and Ratan, Sanju and their friends attend.The biggest thing for the people here is the interschool sports competition held every year. Ever since his one cycling victory against the Rival school Rajput, Ramlal has been obsessed with Model beating them, through his obedient older son Ratan. Ratan is Model's model student, in studies, sports and character and the pride of his father. Sanju on the other hand is a happy-go-lucky bloke who loves hanging with friends and having fun in life even if it causes him to fail classes and disappoint his father. Sanju's friends consist of two good-hearted but not so bright boys and a tomboyish girl, Anjali who is also secretly in love with Sanju. A fact that Sanju is unaware of. When an sudden tragedy occurs, Sanju is transformed from a guy with not a care in the world to a responsible friend, brother, son and athlete.The stage is now set for a tale of friendship, love, family, sports and competition told beautifully by Mansoor Khan. The music is light and sweet especially Pehla Nasha (amazing job by Udit Narayan) and the title song which is uplifting.All the performances are in top form. Aamir Khan is as adorable as ever as Sanju. You can't help but love him in this sweet role. Ayesha Jhulka is also very good as the loyal friend. Deepak Tijori is also quite despicable as the bad guy. The rest of the cast is also very competent and fit their roles well. Special mention should go to Mamik who plays Ratan. He put in a very sincere performance. It is too bad he wasn't seen too much after JJWS. Overall the movie was excellent. Amazing story, great performances and sweet music. Definately recommend it to everyone, young and old alike will enjoy this movie thoroughly.",overall highly recommended film audiences who appreciate little drama good performances entertaining few hours,long review jo jeeta wohi sikander jjws is heart warming story young man sanju his buddies his family consisting his father ramlal older brother ratan story is set hill station where richest families send theyre kids school apart top notch schools there are also few local ones like model which ramlal is coach ratan sanju their friends attend biggest thing people here is interschool sports competition held every year ever since his one cycling victory against rival school rajput ramlal has been obsessed with model beating them through his obedient older son ratan ratan is models model student studies sports character pride his father sanju other hand is happy go lucky bloke who loves hanging with friends having fun life even if it causes him fail classes disappoint his father sanjus friends consist two good hearted but not so bright boys tomboyish girl anjali who is also secretly love with sanju fact that sanju is unaware when sudden tragedy occurs sanju is transformed guy with not care world responsible friend brother son athlete stage is now set tale friendship love family sports competition told beautifully by mansoor khan music is light sweet especially pehla nasha amazing job by udit narayan title song which is uplifting all performances are top form aamir khan is as adorable as ever as sanju you cant help but love him this sweet role ayesha jhulka is also very good as loyal friend deepak tijori is also quite despicable as bad guy rest cast is also very competent fit their roles well special mention should go mamik who plays ratan he put very sincere performance it is too bad he wasnt seen too much after jjws overall movie was excellent amazing story great performances sweet music definately recommend it everyone young old alike will enjoy this movie thoroughly,0.5716936208445642,0.27291778975741243,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Inspiring movie,"""The victory of the underdog"" theme makes for great entertainment. The story takes place in a hill-station, which is a centre of many boarding schools. And all the schools have their share of financially rich students.....except Model School, where all the relatively poorer students go to. And among big schools like Rajput, Xavier's, Lawrence and Queens....Model High is a misfit. So, the students studying there are ever-ridiculed, and labeled as no-hopers. But there's one student who can win laurels for his school.....the honest, hard-working Ratan who's the ""gem of Model High School"". Ratan's family includes his father and brother Sanjay who also studies in the same school (but is diametrically opposite to his brother). Sanjay is least interested in anything else apart from whiling his time away and having fun with his group of ""pyjamachaap"" friends. Cut to the main plot.....there's an annual inter-school bicycle race, which is always won by the Rajput College brat Deepak Tijori. He and his friends are the greatest bullies around. But Ratan is determined to win this race this time......but courtesy a fight with Deepak Tijori and gang, he falls from a cliff and is badly injured. Model High's only hope.....Ratan cannot participate in the race now, and the school has to be content with its usual ""pyjamachaap"" image. Not quite!!! Ratan's good-for-nothing brother Sanju takes up the challenge on behalf of his brother, and despite no one giving much of a chance in the race......no prizes for guessing who turns out the winner in the end!What really makes Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar compelling viewing is director Mansoor Khan's simple yet excellent narrative. Most of the characters are pretty etched out as well. Some great relationships are portrayed in the movie.....that of Sanju and his father (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda). The coldness between the two of them is brought out in the movie pretty well. Secondly, between Sanju and his best friend Anjali who turns out to be his love eventually. Sanju never sees the love Anjali has for him, until she's the only support he has when he's alone in life. Thirdly, between the two brothers Ratan and Sanju.....who are as dissimilar to each other as one can think of......but are still so close to each other. One of the best sibling relationships portrayed in a Hindi movie....far different from the overly melodramatic brotherly love that one is used to seeing. And of course, none of this would have been possible without the actors.......so there's Deepak Tijori who truly irritates you with his brattish attitude, the hot (but not very emotive) Pooja Bedi as Devika, Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the father who admires his elder son and is frustrated and aloof with his younger son (but loves him nevertheless), Ayesha Jhulka (in her only memorable role) as Anjali who has always loved Sanju but does not get the reciprocation from him, Mamik as the sincere Ratan.......and of course, Aamir Khan who's the soul of the movie. As usual, the actor gives a marvelous performance as Sanju. Three cheers for this actor who's defied his chocolate-boy looks to emerge as the most-varied actor of his time. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the melodious music......almost all songs are great to hear, with ""Pehla Nasha"" being the highlight.All, in all.......the movie does inspire you, and after you've seen it....you do feel like doing something similar for your own school/college as well.",inspiring movie,victory underdog theme makes great entertainment story takes place hill station which is centre many boarding schools all schools have their share financially rich students except model school where all relatively poorer students go among big schools like rajput xaviers lawrence queens model high is misfit so students studying there are ever ridiculed labeled as no hopers but theres one student who can win laurels his school honest hard working ratan whos gem model high school ratans family includes his father brother sanjay who also studies same school but is diametrically opposite his brother sanjay is least interested anything else apart whiling his time away having fun with his group pyjamachaap friends cut main plot theres annual inter school bicycle race which is always won by rajput college brat deepak tijori he his friends are greatest bullies around but ratan is determined win this race this time but courtesy fight with deepak tijori gang he falls cliff is badly injured model highs only hope ratan cannot participate race now school has be content with its usual pyjamachaap image not quite ratans good nothing brother sanju takes up challenge behalf his brother despite no one giving much chance race no prizes guessing who turns out winner end what really makes jo jeeta wohi sikandar compelling viewing is director mansoor khans simple yet excellent narrative most characters are pretty etched out as well some great relationships are portrayed movie that sanju his father played by kulbhushan kharbanda coldness between two them is brought out movie pretty well secondly between sanju his best friend anjali who turns out be his love eventually sanju never sees love anjali has him until shes only support he has when hes alone life thirdly between two brothers ratan sanju who are as dissimilar each other as one can think but are still so close each other one best sibling relationships portrayed hindi movie far different overly melodramatic brotherly love that one is used seeing course none this would have been possible without actors so theres deepak tijori who truly irritates you with his brattish attitude hot but not very emotive pooja bedi as devika kulbhushan kharbanda as father who admires his elder son is frustrated aloof with his younger son but loves him nevertheless ayesha jhulka her only memorable role as anjali who has always loved sanju but does not get reciprocation him mamik as sincere ratan course aamir khan whos soul movie as usual actor gives marvelous performance as sanju three cheers this actor whos defied his chocolate boy looks emerge as most varied actor his time oh i almost forgot mention melodious music almost all songs are great hear with pehla nasha being highlight all all movie does inspire you after youve seen it you do feel like doing something similar your own school college as well,0.5492171105730429,0.2749152542372882,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.35}"

9.0,Mansoor Khan's triumph.,"Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar review :Welcome to the world of Archie comics!!Most of us have read the series and invariably, would draw reference to all prime characters of writer- director Mansoor Khan's second film after the blockbuster Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). Come to think of it, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar was a clever adaptation where Aamir Khan was Archie Andrews, Ayesha Jhulka was the gentle and kind Betty, Pooja Bedi was the haughty and snobbish Veronica while Deepak Tijori perfectly defined Reggie Mantle.It is first time we got to see such natural characters - college going kiddos and their usual lingo - in a movie so realistic yet magical. Aamir Khan was truly outstanding in the lead role and I fell in love with Ayesha Jhulka and became her fan for life - going to the extent of watching her later duds from Kohra (1993) to Double Cross : Ek Dhokha (2005) in theatres. Pooja Bedi oozed sex appeal in her most memorable performance ever and Deepak showed his grey side in a role coveted by Akshay Kumar at one time.Mansoor Khan's direction was of high calibre and he deserves kudos for taking an inter-college cycle race to such level of excitement in the film's grand finale. The climactic slow motion shots are simply amazing. Jatin Lalit's musical score was another winner with 'Pehla Nasha' topping the charts. My personal favourite is 'Jawaan ho yaaro' imaginatively filmed as a college skit.Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar released at the right time for me as I had just passed my school in May 1992 and was waiting to enter college life. I saw it with my school buddies at Matunga's Bijlee Cinema and was simply blown away. I went again the same week to relish it more. The film surprisingly, belied my expectations at the box office and turned out to be just an average grosser performing well in cities but flopping in the interiors. This was clearly a multiplex film in an era when there were no multiplexes.The film got its due at the Filmfare awards function winning the Best Film for 1992. It inspired many Karan Johar flicks in coming years starting with his debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) and going right till the recent Student Of The Year 2 (2019).

,Go; Get Your Bike!,"I watched this movie because a friend of mine dragged me to the theater, to test if I could avoid feeling myself involved with a bicycle race that was a major part of the movie. (Now, speaking of that incident after a decade, I should perhaps replace the ""watched"" with ""had watched"", or rather, ""had first watched"", because later I watched this movie a few more times.)This is a very cute (I could not find another equally suitable adjective) movie that realistically depicts the life of small-town kids who belong to homes with limited means. It's a story of their pretensions and frustrations, their wish to be part of the richer folk, that of affectionate families, and of budding puppy-love. Due to very good performance by every artiste, this movie -- with a quite simple storyline -- is capable of making everyone feel part of the movie.While watching it, one is bound to get unintentionally involved with the bike race in the movie. Every heart feels warmth for Ayesha Jhulka, and everyone gets angry at Amir Khan for ignoring Ayesha's innocent and true affection. The impact of this movie could be overwhelming if one is in one's late teen or early youth. The music score was good, though I now know that the famous ""Pehla Nasha"" was lifted (I fail to recollect which was the original tune!).It's a very enjoyable movie, and I can not think of a reason as to why anyone should dislike it!Note: Now I found a reason why someone may dislike it: its story is taken from ""Breaking Away"".",go get your bike,i watched this movie because friend mine dragged me theater test if i could avoid feeling myself involved with bicycle race that was major part movie now speaking that incident after decade i should perhaps replace watched with had watched or rather had first watched because later i watched this movie few more times this is very cute i could not find another equally suitable adjective movie that realistically depicts life small town kids who belong homes with limited means its story their pretensions frustrations their wish be part richer folk that affectionate families budding puppy love due very good performance by every artiste this movie with quite simple storyline is capable making everyone feel part movie while watching it one is bound get unintentionally involved with bike race movie every heart feels warmth ayesha jhulka everyone gets angry at amir khan ignoring ayeshas innocent true affection impact this movie could be overwhelming if one is ones late teen or early youth music score was good though i now know that famous pehla nasha was lifted i fail recollect which was original tune its very enjoyable movie i can not think reason as why anyone should dislike it note now i found reason why someone may dislike it its story is taken breaking away,0.5229012345679013,0.20189153439153443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"

Both movies are based on Cycle Race and are coming of age movie but that's it. Director Mansoor Khan himself has confirmed that he became aware of Breaking Away only after Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander was released and likeness was brought to his attention.Acting done by cast, screenplay and attention to detail director has given to this movie is awe inspiring.

,"Arre, jo jeeta wohi sikandar, mere dost!","A non-Indian friend of mine saw this (it was on really late on some British channel, surprisingly...God bless cable TV) and asked me about it and if I had seen it. And I replied to her saying that I had and I loved it. Not the performances, or anything in particular, I just love the film in general. She adored it, and is now a huge fan of Hindi movies. Judging by her reaction to it (she's usually pretty picky about her films), I would recommend this.St. Xaviers School, Rajput School, and lastly the not so wealthy Model School have been arch rivals in sporting competitions for years. Ratanlal Verma (Mamik) is from Model School, and is the cycling star of his school. He is hoping to win the cycling championship and earn his school the respect it needs. He has pressure on his shoulders, but he is confident about the race so it isn't too bad. Ratan's main rival is the snobby Shekhar Malhotra (Deepak Tijori), from Rajput School. The race gets closer and closer, and things begin to complicate and the tension builds up. Ratan's cheeky and charming brother Sanjay (Aamir Khan) starts dating a wealthy spoiled brat of a girl Devika(Pooja Girl) from a rich school, St Annes. Sanjay makes Devika believe that he is from St. Xaviers, as he wants to impress her. Devika finds out the truth and dumps Sanjay, and at the same time his father throws him out of the house, for stealing money. All this just as the race is getting nearer and nearer...Just before the big day, Shekhar and his bratty friends beat up Ratan so bad and leave him almost dying. Ratan, devastated and in a critical condition, cannot compete in the race. Sanjay, in disgrace, and seeing his brothers' dreams shattered, vows to take a stand, and get Shekhar back...Aamir's performance was good. I liked him in this movie. My favourite performance was by Mamik, who played Ratan. I thought he was brilliant in his role and played it with dignity and style. Deepak Tijori was an excellent villain and Pooja Bedi was decent enough in her portrayal of a rich brat. Ayesha Jhulka as Anjali was lovely - she added a lot of grace/elegance into the film.The music was beautiful and I loved Pehla Nasha and Humse Hai Saara Jahan.

8.0,Woh Sikandar hai....,"I had been told that this was yet another Mansoor Khan film that was a Hollywood ripoff - this time of the film Breaking Away (1979). So I was avoiding seeing the film. But finally I did see it and yes it is a ripoff, but strangely enough it still manages to please. Aamir plays the irresponsible Sanjaylal - the goof off younger brother of Ratanlal (Mamik) and son of Ramlal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). He goes to the local school in Dehradun, a town full of elite schools populated by rich boys and girls. The local car bike repair shop girl Anjali (Ayesha Jhulka ) loves him but he is lusting for Devika (Pooja Bedi) the sorority girl equivalent in this film. There is inter-school rivalry spearheaded by 'Deepak Tijori as the hero of the rich guys and Ratanlal as the hero of the poor guys. The cornerstone of this rivalry is a bike race that Tijori has won for two straight years. But dirty work is afoot and Ratanlal is injured. Will Sanjaylal be able to take his brother place and bring glory to the school and his father? The film is predictable but still manages to hold one's interest and the sports scenes are quite well done. This film is from an era when extras were juts that - extras - no one other than the main players looks at all like a college kid! But the main actors do a decent job. Aamir is fun as the scamp Sanjaylal - I have always liked him in his 'scamp playing the wide eyed innocent' roles. The ladies are very forgettable, Kulbhushan Kharbanda is great, Deepak Tijori is an adequate other man. The films is well directed and has one great song - Pehla Nasha, and other okay songs.

10.0,This Is My Most Favourite Movie,"Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar review :Welcome to the world of Archie comics!!Most of us have read the series and invariably, would draw reference to all prime characters of writer- director Mansoor Khan's second film after the blockbuster Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). Come to think of it, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar was a clever adaptation where Aamir Khan was Archie Andrews, Ayesha Jhulka was the gentle and kind Betty, Pooja Bedi was the haughty and snobbish Veronica while Deepak Tijori perfectly defined Reggie Mantle.It is first time we got to see such natural characters - college going kiddos and their usual lingo - in a movie so realistic yet magical. Aamir Khan was truly outstanding in the lead role and I fell in love with Ayesha Jhulka and became her fan for life - going to the extent of watching her later duds from Kohra (1993) to Double Cross : Ek Dhokha (2005) in theatres. Pooja Bedi oozed sex appeal in her most memorable performance ever and Deepak showed his grey side in a role coveted by Akshay Kumar at one time.Mansoor Khan's direction was of high calibre and he deserves kudos for taking an inter-college cycle race to such level of excitement in the film's grand finale. The climactic slow motion shots are simply amazing. Jatin Lalit's musical score was another winner with 'Pehla Nasha' topping the charts. My personal favourite is 'Jawaan ho yaaro' imaginatively filmed as a college skit.Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar released at the right time for me as I had just passed my school in May 1992 and was waiting to enter college life. I saw it with my school buddies at Matunga's Bijlee Cinema and was simply blown away. I went again the same week to relish it more. The film surprisingly, belied my expectations at the box office and turned out to be just an average grosser performing well in cities but flopping in the interiors. This was clearly a multiplex film in an era when there were no multiplexes.The film got its due at the Filmfare awards function winning the Best Film for 1992. It inspired many Karan Johar flicks in coming years starting with his debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) and going right till the recent Student Of The Year 2 (2019). But then, Original is Original boss!!",this is my most favourite movie,jo jeeta wohi sikandar review welcome world archie comics most us have read series invariably would draw reference all prime characters writer director mansoor khans second film after blockbuster qayamat se qayamat tak 1988 come think it jo jeeta wohi sikandar was clever adaptation where aamir khan was archie andrews ayesha jhulka was gentle kind betty pooja bedi was haughty snobbish veronica while deepak tijori perfectly defined reggie mantle it is first time we got see such natural characters college going kiddos their usual lingo movie so realistic yet magical aamir khan was truly outstanding lead role i fell love with ayesha jhulka became her fan life going extent watching her later duds kohra 1993 double cross ek dhokha 2005 theatres pooja bedi oozed sex appeal her most memorable performance ever deepak showed his grey side role coveted by akshay kumar at one time mansoor khans direction was high calibre he deserves kudos taking inter college cycle race such level excitement films grand finale climactic slow motion shots are simply amazing jatin lalits musical score was another winner with pehla nasha topping charts my personal favourite is jawaan ho yaaro imaginatively filmed as college skit jo jeeta wohi sikandar released at right time me as i had just passed my school may 1992 was waiting enter college life i saw it with my school buddies at matungas bijlee cinema was simply blown away i went again same week relish it more film surprisingly belied my expectations at box office turned out be just average grosser performing well cities but flopping interiors this was clearly multiplex film era when there were no multiplexes film got its due at filmfare awards function winning best film 1992 it inspired many karan johar flicks coming years starting with his debut kuch kuch hota hai 1998 going right till recent student year 2 2019 but then original is original boss,0.4951501035196687,0.2693426501035197,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.02, 'Fear': 0.48}"
9.0,Movie with Heart,"This movie is different from other movies because it's not just a love story- the movie is more about action and goals. Even when you feel it is a losing battle, you can still come out a winner with enough heart and hard, hard, work. The bike race is symbolic-especially for Sanjay, who finally reaches a level of maturity and realizes what needs to be done in order to prove for himself that he can do what needs to be done along with showing his family that he is capable of doing it. His understanding of his brother matures during the movie, and in the final scene, he is shown jutting past shekhar-and achieving his goal- proving that yes, jo jeeta- wohi sikandar- the one who finishes first, is the winner- fair and square.Bottomline: This is a really good movie *****/5 stars. Also, it is probably THE Hindi movie I would recommend to people- the movie is a family film/drama that has heart and is worth watching.",movie with heart,this movie is different other movies because its not just love story movie is more about action goals even when you feel it is losing battle you can still come out winner with enough heart hard hard work bike race is symbolic especially sanjay who finally reaches level maturity realizes what needs be done order prove himself that he can do what needs be done along with showing his family that he is capable doing it his understanding his brother matures during movie final scene he is shown jutting past shekhar achieving his goal proving that yes jo jeeta wohi sikandar one who finishes first is winner fair square bottomline this is really good movie 5 stars also it is probably hindi movie i would recommend people movie is family film drama that has heart is worth watching,0.5495098039215686,0.13480392156862744,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,Entertaining,"This movie has a lot of scope for typical Bollywood melodrama, but steers clear of it. It remains minimalist, in the sense that it does not opt for glamour or exotic locations. It is very charming in its realistic depiction of youthful life.So, we have college gangs taking over each other in sports, and amidst all the heated competition, several instances of romance. A story designed to win. The songs were hummable, with obviously Pehla Nasha standing out.Performance wise, I simply loved Ayesha Jhulka, for me she was the screen stopper. Pooja Bedi was very charming too; and gave an earnest performance. Deepak Tijori was fantastic as always. Deven Bhojani was too cute. I was not very impressed by Mamik and Aamir though, who did not seem to give their best to the role. Overall, a very feel good film from the nineties, an era of romance and drama. Can be watched without regret.",entertaining,this movie has lot scope typical bollywood melodrama but steers clear it it remains minimalist sense that it does not opt glamour or exotic locations it is very charming its realistic depiction youthful life so we have college gangs taking over each other sports amidst all heated competition several instances romance story designed win songs were hummable with obviously pehla nasha standing out performance wise i simply loved ayesha jhulka me she was screen stopper pooja bedi was very charming too gave earnest performance deepak tijori was fantastic as always deven bhojani was too cute i was not very impressed by mamik aamir though who did not seem give their best role overall very feel good film nineties era romance drama can be watched without regret,0.5695665445665447,0.33858974358974364,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"
