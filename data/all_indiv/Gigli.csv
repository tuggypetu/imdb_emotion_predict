1.0,"Critics, we owe you an apology","`Awful', `Hopeless', `Terrible', `Benifer's Gate'.These are the words I read from some of North America's most respected film critics in my research before viewing the debacle Gigli starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. At first, I wondered aloud 'how bad can it be'. After all, how often does the common public agree with the harsh words of a critic. Besides, Pacino and Walken in the same film should be enough to generate even one star out of even the sternest critic, right. Right? Gigli is about two unbelievable gangsters who are assigned the task of kidnapping and watching over a prosecutors mentally challenged brother while also keeping an open eye on each other to ensure the success of the operation. Ben plays Gigli, an accent challenged goon who is as believable as Madonna in a nuns uniform, and Jennifer plays Ricky, a lesbian gangster who is primarily hired to ensure that Gigli doesn't screw things up. Along the way, plenty of bit characters and ridiculous side plots stymie the progress of the mission. Ricky has an ex-lover show up at the house and attempt suicide, the gangsters ask for the thumb of the prisoner sent to the prosecutor, Gigli has to rush to his mothers house and learns that good ole ma knows all about lesbians and throughout the film we are constantly annoyed by conversations between Gigli and his crime boss, Lenny over the phone. I could go on, but what's the point.Gigli was one of the worst reviewed films of 2003. So I began to wonder why this film in particular ended up on everyone's poop list even though there were plenty of worse films people were throwing good money at (Boat Trip, Bad Boys II, Masked and Anonymous).  The answer became pretty obvious. Nothing was expected of these other entries, but Gigli had the star power of the two most talked about celebrities in Tinseltown. Throw in director Martin Brest who has had incredible success with Scent of a Woman, Midnight Run and Beverley Hills Cop, and sprinkle in the veteran a-list power of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. With a recipe as rich as these ingredients suggest, one's expectations are set to a higher standard. Gigli simply does not deliver the goods. The dialogue is so laughable that you expect this film to have midnight showings a la Rocky Horror Picture Show in the next ten years, and the characters are so eccentrically hysterical that you can't help but cringe in your seat in embarrassment for all those involved.So now back to the critics. We, owe you an apology. Most of the year, we read your reviews and chastise your opinions, but every once and a while, a consensus amongst your peers keeps us from going in mass and spending our hard earned dollars on crap like this. A $6 million dollar domestic take for Gigli is an example of the power that you possess, and for that, I will keep reading.",critics we owe you apology,awful hopeless terrible benifers gate these are words i read some north americas most respected film critics my research before viewing debacle gigli starring ben affleck jennifer lopez at first i wondered aloud how bad can it be after all how often does common public agree with harsh words critic besides pacino walken same film should be enough generate even one star out even sternest critic right right gigli is about two unbelievable gangsters who are assigned task kidnapping watching over prosecutors mentally challenged brother while also keeping open eye each other ensure success operation ben plays gigli accent challenged goon who is as believable as madonna nuns uniform jennifer plays ricky lesbian gangster who is primarily hired ensure that gigli doesnt screw things up along way plenty bit characters ridiculous side plots stymie progress mission ricky has ex lover show up at house attempt suicide gangsters ask thumb prisoner sent prosecutor gigli has rush his mothers house learns that good ole ma knows all about lesbians throughout film we are constantly annoyed by conversations between gigli his crime boss lenny over phone i could go but whats point gigli was one worst reviewed films 2003 so i began wonder why this film particular ended up everyones poop list even though there were plenty worse films people were throwing good money at boat trip bad boys ii masked anonymous answer became pretty obvious nothing was expected these other entries but gigli had star power two most talked about celebrities tinseltown throw director martin brest who has had incredible success with scent woman midnight run beverley hills cop sprinkle veteran list power christopher walken al pacino with recipe as rich as these ingredients suggest ones expectations are set higher standard gigli simply does not deliver goods dialogue is so laughable that you expect this film have midnight showings la rocky horror picture show next ten years characters are so eccentrically hysterical that you cant help but cringe your seat embarrassment all those involved so now back critics we owe you apology most year we read your reviews chastise your opinions but every once while consensus amongst your peers keeps us going mass spending our hard earned dollars crap like this 6 million dollar domestic take gigli is example power that you possess that i will keep reading,0.5075396825396826,-0.045039682539682546,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
2.0,"$54,000,000! Where did all the money go?","I saw this movie and hated about 99% of it. After I found out it cost $54,000,000 to make, I started to hate the other 1%. If this is considered a love story between Lopez and Affleck, may I ask...where was the love? A sex scene with no nudity, no passion, and no sound....why? Supporting characters like Christopher Walken and others were introduced and went no where...why? The story alone peeks when Pacino arrives and shoots one of the cast members. From there, i was hoping that Pacino had finished the job and killed the rest of the cast. If that happened, the movie would have been good. Instead, the movie drags and drags and drags. The audience is not going to care if the actors in the movie learn something or progress if they don't care about the characters. Lopez and Affleck's characters do not exist! Much like the ugly tattoos on Affleck's shoulder, the movie was not fun to look at. In my opinion, and I do not think I am wrong, if Lopez had a small nude scene and / or the movie was done as an independent film for under 2 or 3 million, Gigli would have been a giant success. Instead, we are left to wonder....why?",54 000 000 where did all money go,i saw this movie hated about 99 it after i found out it cost 54 000 000 make i started hate other 1 if this is considered love story between lopez affleck may i ask where was love sex scene with no nudity no passion no sound why supporting characters like christopher walken others were introduced went no where why story alone peeks when pacino arrives shoots one cast members there i was hoping that pacino had finished job killed rest cast if that happened movie would have been good instead movie drags drags drags audience is not going care if actors movie learn something or progress if they dont care about characters lopez afflecks characters do not exist much like ugly tattoos afflecks shoulder movie was not fun look at my opinion i do not think i am wrong if lopez had small nude scene or movie was done as independent film under 2 or 3 million gigli would have been giant success instead we are left wonder why,0.4583333333333334,-0.0763888888888889,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,"Suffered from Ben and J-Lo backlash and isn't as bad as many say, but is still an ill-formed, poorly judged shambles","Larry Gigli is a hired thug for the mob in LA. When he is put on a job to kidnap the brother of the Federal DA, he takes the mentally handicapped Brian to his flat with the intention of the DA dropping charges against his boss. Later he is joined by another contractor, Ricki, who Louis has put with him to make sure he doesn't f**k the job up. His amorous approaches towards her are rejected when she tells him she is a lesbian, but the two have bigger problems with the job itself.I rented this film because I had read all the harsh reviews, both professional and on this site, that just ripped into it and seemed to have more personal vendettas against the stars rather than objective points to make about the film. With this in mind I decided that I would have to check it out myself; I have no personal feelings about Lopez and Affleck - their relationship is not something I have had rammed down my throat as I don't read the gossips mags and my paper of choice is the Times, where they get rather limited coverage. Without this fatigue I was able to view the film as it came to me rather than seething with cruel and clever put downs even before the film started (as some critics clearly did).However, the critics were mostly right, even if they overreacted to the extreme. The film starts reasonably well and you can see the potential, or at least you can see what they were thinking when the film was being put together. Sadly, as the film continues, the thin strands holding it together are slowly unravelling until almost nothing is left of value. Some of it works well; how many times have the audience embraced a comic crime caper with hit men in the lead roles? Here the film does have some of that type of humour (particularly in the jokes about Gigli's masculinity) but the music used to set the tone begins to grate after a while because there is nothing to support it, and everything else is flawed.The main plot is so very full of holes and stupid plot devices that it is difficult to be involved by it. For a crime comedy, the plot doesn't need to be perfect - but it needs to be good enough so that it doesn't take away from the film, here it is so weak that it damages the film at it's core. The other side of the plot is the romance, and it is absurd! I'm sure if I were a lesbian that I would be offended by the `I'll turn her' approach of the film, but I'm not so I'll leave that for others to debate. However the romance between the two is unrealistic and uninvolving, the lesbian thing just makes it worse.The characters themselves are poor. Neither Gigli or Ricki ever seem like killers - in fact even a hint of violence and they look terrified and out of their depth. His personality seems to change to whatever the scene requires (one moment impatient, the next sensitive, the next angry) while Ricki is just sweetness and light. Affleck and Lopez must take almost all the blame for this, their performances are as misjudged and lacking as the script. Affleck is actually not that bad - he is willing to send himself up, it is the jumping script that makes him appear to be all over the place. Lopez is awful; someone who has done this crime comedy style movie before should have been much better but she acts like she is in a simpering rom-com. What is surprising is just how little chemistry the two have considering they are a couple now; they just don't do the job at all.Bartha gives a dumb Rain Man impression to the point where I kept expecting him to say `I'm an excellent driver'. His character is just a joke and I even wished for Lopez to come onto the screen whenever he was on - at least I could just stare at her body and ignore him! The two main cameos are actually very good but unfortunately serve to show up the rest of the film. Walken is good but his character appears and disappears without reason, Pacino is much better simply because he does his menacing `woo-ha' thing and is very effective.Overall this is not the `worst film ever made', those who tell you that have clearly have a limited viewing experience; many of the reviews were made harsher by the back lash against the whole Bennifer thing. However that's not to say they are wrong - only overly harsh. The film is poorly judged in almost every aspect and is too hard to enjoy as a result. Has about 3 good moments in it, but it is an overwhelming shambles.",suffered ben j lo backlash isnt as bad as many say but is still ill formed poorly judged shambles,larry gigli is hired thug mob la when he is put job kidnap brother federal da he takes mentally handicapped brian his flat with intention da dropping charges against his boss later he is joined by another contractor ricki who louis has put with him make sure he doesnt f k job up his amorous approaches towards her are rejected when she tells him she is lesbian but two have bigger problems with job itself i rented this film because i had read all harsh reviews both professional this site that just ripped into it seemed have more personal vendettas against stars rather than objective points make about film with this mind i decided that i would have check it out myself i have no personal feelings about lopez affleck their relationship is not something i have had rammed down my throat as i dont read gossips mags my paper choice is times where they get rather limited coverage without this fatigue i was able view film as it came me rather than seething with cruel clever put downs even before film started as some critics clearly did however critics were mostly right even if they overreacted extreme film starts reasonably well you can see potential or at least you can see what they were thinking when film was being put together sadly as film continues thin strands holding it together are slowly unravelling until almost nothing is left value some it works well how many times have audience embraced comic crime caper with hit men lead roles here film does have some that type humour particularly jokes about giglis masculinity but music used set tone begins grate after while because there is nothing support it everything else is flawed main plot is so very full holes stupid plot devices that it is difficult be involved by it crime comedy plot doesnt need be perfect but it needs be good enough so that it doesnt take away film here it is so weak that it damages film at its core other side plot is romance it is absurd im sure if i were lesbian that i would be offended by ill turn her approach film but im not so ill leave that others debate however romance between two is unrealistic uninvolving lesbian thing just makes it worse characters themselves are poor neither gigli or ricki ever seem like killers fact even hint violence they look terrified out their depth his personality seems change whatever scene requires one moment impatient next sensitive next angry while ricki is just sweetness light affleck lopez must take almost all blame this their performances are as misjudged lacking as script affleck is actually not that bad he is willing send himself up it is jumping script that makes him appear be all over place lopez is awful someone who has done this crime comedy style movie before should have been much better but she acts like she is simpering rom com what is surprising is just how little chemistry two have considering they are couple now they just dont do job at all bartha gives dumb rain man impression point where i kept expecting him say im excellent driver his character is just joke i even wished lopez come onto screen whenever he was at least i could just stare at her body ignore him two main cameos are actually very good but unfortunately serve show up rest film walken is good but his character appears disappears without reason pacino is much better simply because he does his menacing woo ha thing is very effective overall this is not worst film ever made those who tell you that have clearly have limited viewing experience many reviews were made harsher by back lash against whole bennifer thing however thats not say they are wrong only overly harsh film is poorly judged almost every aspect is too hard enjoy as result has about 3 good moments it but it is overwhelming shambles,0.5939914392723382,-0.006799982165150704,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,J-Lo and Ben: 2 of the most laughable characters ever,"J-Lo and Ben were badly miscast as gangsters in this. Neither is believable.We are supposed to believe Ricki (J-LO) is a gangster and mean just because she says so. She does absolutely nothing to make her seem dangerous. But, then it gets even funnier when she shows up in a crop top shirt, letting it all show, only to announce she's gay. What! J-Lo is just too famous for anyone to see her as gay, not to mention, she never acts like it in the film.As for Ben, he's really bad too. He's uses this horrible accent and swears a lot. I guess that means we are supposed to believe he's a tough gangster from New York because of this. He doesn't have the stomach to cut off a finger and he lets a guy that owes money only pay half. No muscle man would act like such a wuss.Then we get the mentally challenged guy that plays some role with the plot, but I'm not sure what because the plot never made sense to me. I never got the whole point of kidnapping the guy. Then there are the very bad dialogue scenes that have been mentioned many times. What was the writer thinking and how could Bennifer say those lines without laughing. And I still don't get why a lesbian would give that yoga speech to a guy in such a seductive way. So unbelievable.The only thing that made me laugh was Gigli reading to the retarded guy. He read what's on tabasco sauce bottle and charmin toilet paper.FINAL VERDICT: Gobble, gobble says it all. Overall bad acting and writing. But I have seen worse movies. I only recommend it for those who feel compelled to see J-Lo looking really hot for a couple of hours.",j lo ben 2 most laughable characters ever,j lo ben were badly miscast as gangsters this neither is believable we are supposed believe ricki j lo is gangster mean just because she says so she does absolutely nothing make her seem dangerous but then it gets even funnier when she shows up crop top shirt letting it all show only announce shes gay what j lo is just too famous anyone see her as gay not mention she never acts like it film as ben hes really bad too hes uses this horrible accent swears lot i guess that means we are supposed believe hes tough gangster new york because this he doesnt have stomach cut off finger he lets guy that owes money only pay half no muscle man would act like such wuss then we get mentally challenged guy that plays some role with plot but im not sure what because plot never made sense me i never got whole point kidnapping guy then there are very bad dialogue scenes that have been mentioned many times what was writer thinking how could bennifer say those lines without laughing i still dont get why lesbian would give that yoga speech guy such seductive way so unbelievable only thing that made me laugh was gigli reading retarded guy he read whats tabasco sauce bottle charmin toilet paper final verdict gobble gobble says it all overall bad acting writing but i have seen worse movies i only recommend it those who feel compelled see j lo looking really hot couple hours,0.6436288561288563,-0.09166734916734914,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,You must never see it.,"Smug and a self-adorned cine-sophisticate, I rented out Gigli with a friend ready to scrutinise it with the benefit of my enlightened view of film. It was going to be an hilarious two hours. I'd settled down in a very comfy armchair and had poured a glass of some Austrian glug. I couldn't wait to laugh at the stupid dialogue and that ridiculous script but the joke was on us because Gigli transcends the established limit of effective urine stealing. This is because its simply so horrible that you can forget trying to make yourself look intelligent and media literate by ripping the bladder evacuate because the scale of misguided conception baffles the mind and eventually shuts it down. It's like being hit by a sack full of bricks in the face for a full 114 minutes. There's a teasing little scene with J-Lo early on when she tells a bunch of unruly kids that there's a martial arts move that can gouge out the eyes and simultaneously destroy the visual cortex meaning that not only are you rendered blind but you'll never be able to remember anything you've seen. For the Gigli viewer this is like showing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to a hall packed with diabetics. You're left to ponder the short term agony weighed up against the long term benefit as Martin Brest's story unfolds with the principle characters of a unlikeable, emotionally and sexually retarded thug with a soft centre (a fat Affleck), a lesbian who isn't really a lesbian because you can be converted to heterosexuality by an emotionally and sexually retarded thug and an actually retarded man who was probably supposed to be a Rainman-type character who redeems Affleck's arrogant meathead but is in fact a cringe inducing, self-harm facilitating caricature of the mentally handicapped. Look, many movies look good on paper and suffer from poor execution but what's head scratching about Gigli is that it's as dire on the page as it is on screen. Broadly it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, sort of Out of Sight meets Rainman meets Whats New Pussycat? but it's stillborn as a criminal caper, devoid of anything approaching sensitivity and has some of the worst battle of the sexes banter that ever crawled onto the screen. Brest, who directed the dire 16 hour remake of Meet John Doe, Meet Joe Black, shows that when it comes to misjudging material he's peerless. His crimes here are compounded by the fact that this is his own script. That script, incidentally is a roll call of on screen horror. Witness, if you can, the Penis Vs. Vagina scene in which Affleck argues the case for the male genitals or the tear jerking moment in which the soft hearted Affleck, having given the Mentally Handicapped Brian relationship advice, looks on like a proud father as his new friends woos an Australian bombshell during the filming of a Baywatch beach party. You'll envy the man who gets his brains blown out and eaten by goldfish or the horrendous girlfriend of J-Lo, who having realised which film she's in, slits her wrists...stupidly, the wrong way. Once its all over and you sit there open mouthed you're left to (briefly) ponder why Brest did it. Did the kidnapped brother have to be disabled? Surely there must have been a more effective way of facilitating Affleck's transition from idiot to slightly more compassionate idiot? Did J-Lo have to be a Lesbian? Sure, Affleck has to have some obstacles toward getting the girl and we all like a bit of sexual tension but gay viewers must have been flabbergasted that a man who describes men and women as ""the bull and the cow"" and does lovable things like warmly looking vacuous and endearingly been obnoxious should persuade a woman to er, ""hop over the fence"". And even if Brest was blinded by his own vanity what in the name of Beverly Hills Cop persuaded Christopher Walken and Al Pacino to cameo? None of it makes any sense. The bottle of wine I had with the film was good though but by the time I regained consciousness the bit left in the bottle was undrinkable.",you must never see it,smug self adorned cine sophisticate i rented out gigli with friend ready scrutinise it with benefit my enlightened view film it was going be hilarious two hours id settled down very comfy armchair had poured glass some austrian glug i couldnt wait laugh at stupid dialogue that ridiculous script but joke was us because gigli transcends established limit effective urine stealing this is because its simply so horrible that you can forget trying make yourself look intelligent media literate by ripping bladder evacuate because scale misguided conception baffles mind eventually shuts it down its like being hit by sack full bricks face full 114 minutes theres teasing little scene with j lo early when she tells bunch unruly kids that theres martial arts move that can gouge out eyes simultaneously destroy visual cortex meaning that not only are you rendered blind but youll never be able remember anything youve seen gigli viewer this is like showing charlie chocolate factory hall packed with diabetics youre left ponder short term agony weighed up against long term benefit as martin brests story unfolds with principle characters unlikeable emotionally sexually retarded thug with soft centre fat affleck lesbian who isnt really lesbian because you can be converted heterosexuality by emotionally sexually retarded thug actually retarded man who was probably supposed be rainman type character who redeems afflecks arrogant meathead but is fact cringe inducing self harm facilitating caricature mentally handicapped look many movies look good paper suffer poor execution but whats head scratching about gigli is that its as dire page as it is screen broadly its supposed be romantic comedy sort out sight meets rainman meets whats new pussycat but its stillborn as criminal caper devoid anything approaching sensitivity has some worst battle sexes banter that ever crawled onto screen brest who directed dire 16 hour remake meet john doe meet joe black shows that when it comes misjudging material hes peerless his crimes here are compounded by fact that this is his own script that script incidentally is roll call screen horror witness if you can penis vs vagina scene which affleck argues case male genitals or tear jerking moment which soft hearted affleck having given mentally handicapped brian relationship advice looks like proud father as his new friends woos australian bombshell during filming baywatch beach party youll envy man who gets his brains blown out eaten by goldfish or horrendous girlfriend j lo who having realised which film shes slits her wrists stupidly wrong way once its all over you sit there open mouthed youre left briefly ponder why brest did it did kidnapped brother have be disabled surely there must have been more effective way facilitating afflecks transition idiot slightly more compassionate idiot did j lo have be lesbian sure affleck has have some obstacles toward getting girl we all like bit sexual tension but gay viewers must have been flabbergasted that man who describes men women as bull cow does lovable things like warmly looking vacuous endearingly been obnoxious should persuade woman er hop over fence even if brest was blinded by his own vanity what name beverly hills cop persuaded christopher walken al pacino cameo none it makes any sense bottle wine i had with film was good though but by time i regained consciousness bit left bottle was undrinkable,0.5066973304473305,0.044570707070707066,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,Rhymes with 'Really'. As in Really Bad.,"I borrowed my friend's Gigli DVD to see if the movie was really as bad as the ratings and other comments here will indicate. The answer is yes. When the film first came out, it rocketed to number 1 on the bottom 100 list. That ranking was undeserved, as the movie does have decent technical aspects (editing, sound) relative to Manos and Future War. Its good to see Gigli settling a little further down the list. From the outset, I could tell the dialog was just horrible. It was unfunny 90% of the time, and contained useless overlong scenes. One example was the whole 'pleasing a woman' sequence where Lopez was doing Yoga on a mat while talking with Affleck. Just horrible. Jennifer Lopez has to win the award for most painfully miscast actress. She is totally unbelievable as a Lesbian girl gangster. She failed to convince me that she had ever broken the law in the past.

1.0,"A Flat, Lifeless Lump of a Movie","A truly cynical person might think that the whole J-Lo/ Ben Affleck relationship was a publicity stunt designed to help this movie along. After all, if a couple was in the midst of a passionate affair, it is reasonable to expect some on-screen chemistry between then, right? That kind of chemistry is sadly lacking in the J-Lo/ Affleck interactions.Ms. Lopez appears to be either in over her head as far as acting ability, or realized that she was in a ""take the money and run"" failure; I did not buy her as the character she was supposed to be. Affleck was just leaden, although he had nothing to work with in terms of character or dialogue. He has not always been bad (I liked ""Chasing Amy""), but here, his scenes crawl along at a painfully slow pace. The ""retarded kid"" (and that is all he deserves to be called) is playing a high-school play version of ""Rain Man"" with all the annoyance but none of the nuance, complexity, or charm. The less seen, the better. Forgettable cameos top the mess.The worst thing about Gigli is the endings. Imagine a painfully bad film, where you want to sit it through to the end, just because of all the pain and suffering it has put you through (""this film is NOT going to defeat me""). You get to the end. Then, there is another ending. Then, another ending; then, an ending involving the retarded kid. Then, an ending not involving the retarded kid. Then another... You get to a point where you sincerely believe that the editor should be forbidden from ever working in film again.

6.0,Defending Gigli (Really),"I've postponed seeing this film for quite a while for obvious reasons: it's arguably the most hated film ever made, perhaps even more than ""Battlefield Earth."" But last night morbid curiosity finally got the best of me and I caught it on Encore.And amazingly, astonishingly, against all odds, it's not that bad. It isn't great, it isn't even quite good, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 6. It's okay. It held my interest from start to finish and even had some intriguing elements that far less notorious failures have lacked.What surprised me most was how heartfelt and engaging it was, thanks mainly to one of Ben Affleck's best performances. Turns out he's got a real flair for comedy; his half-baked Robert DeNiro impersonation is a hoot, and I have no doubt is quite intentional. The movie is built around his baffled/flummoxed/bemused/exasperated reactions to his ill-tempered boss, gorgeous lesbian watchdog, and handicapped hostage, and they're all quite believable and funny. Naturally, given the amount of vitriol that was directed at the film, I assumed that Affleck just phoned in his performance (as he's been known to do) but that's far, far from the case. He carries this film the way Tom Cruise carried ""Rain Man."" Of course, ""Gigli"" is not ""Rain Man,"" but it's not Affleck's fault.""Gigli"" is, remarkably, a genuinely and quite intentionally funny film at times, more so than the obvious and desperate ""Bringing Down the House,"" for instance. Affleck half-heartedly reading the toilet paper packaging in lieu of a bedtime story to pacify his child-like hostage is hysterical. So is the latter's ""Baywatch"" obsession and his antics with Affleck's cell phone and his ""who's on first?"" routine with Affleck's boiling crime boss.Justin Bartha, as the mentally handicapped hostage, is no Dustin Hoffman, to be sure, and at times his performance makes you cringe because his level of retardation seems to fluctuate depending on the scene -- but he gets laughs. Jennifer Lopez really struggles with some of her line readings (particularly in her scene with Al Pacino; how is this the same actress who was so impressive playing a similar character in ""Out of Sight""?) but she looks amazing and she gives off the necessary sexual spark to make the romantic comedy elements work.But if only director Martin Brest had revised his script before shooting, to iron out the film's three principle flaws. One, it's so weak the way Lopez' character is introduced; I guess that's something many viewers just couldn't get past. She's clearly no tougher than Affleck is, so why is she there again? It might have been interesting if Affleck's boss had had a secret soft side, recognized his underling's loneliness and sent Lopez to try to kill two birds with one stone: ""cure"" Lopez of her homosexuality and play cupid. But he has no soft side; he's a two-dimensional monster, and it never makes a great deal of sense.Second, the plot is much too thin. Christopher Walken shows up for one scene and then vanishes, never to be heard from again! This film obviously NEEDS him to stick around and keep the heat on our heroes, in addition to Affleck's boss. How a filmmaker as experienced as Martin Brest could have failed to recognize that is beyond me. I can only speculate that the studio wanted to max out the Bennifer angle and stuff in as many scenes featuring the two of them as possible, even at the expense of our greatest living character actor, not to mention the demands of the story.Third, the film is 30 minutes too long and badly edited. There are a number of scenes that just stretch on two, three or four beats longer than they should, particularly that scene where Lopez scares off those punks with her interminable eye-gouging monologue. I'd heard that the dialogue in ""Gigli"" was just atrocious, but I didn't really think it was that bad, just long-winded. Had the film been edited down to a compact 90 minutes, I have little doubt that it would have received a more favorable response. There's just enough material here for a good movie, but Brest spreads it too thin.The most interesting thing about ""Gigli"" is that it's kind of a tender-hearted crime flick. It's more interested in the feelings and the emotions of its characters than the violence they engage in, or refuse to engage in. The sudden killing towards the end of the film is as jarring as anything I've seen because it comes out of nowhere, and Affleck and Lopez seem authentically horrified at what they've witnessed; in most crime films, the leads would feign disinterest and play it cool - not here.I really bought that Bartha brought out the big brother, father figure in Affleck and Lopez his sensitive, caring, feminine side. Clearly he's not cut out for his line of work, and that's what his two companions help him to realize. That is not an insignificant thing. Would that less reviled films boasted such a satisfying character arc.So why does this film have a microscopic 2.2 rating at IMDb? Perhaps people are reviewing Affleck's and Lopez' over-publicized, failed romance instead of the film - beats the heck out of me.",defending gigli really,ive postponed seeing this film quite while obvious reasons its arguably most hated film ever made perhaps even more than battlefield earth but last night morbid curiosity finally got best me i caught it encore amazingly astonishingly against all odds its not that bad it isnt great it isnt even quite good but scale 1 10 id give it 6 its okay it held my interest start finish even had some intriguing elements that far less notorious failures have lacked what surprised me most was how heartfelt engaging it was thanks mainly one ben afflecks best performances turns out hes got real flair comedy his half baked robert deniro impersonation is hoot i have no doubt is quite intentional movie is built around his baffled flummoxed bemused exasperated reactions his ill tempered boss gorgeous lesbian watchdog handicapped hostage theyre all quite believable funny naturally given amount vitriol that was directed at film i assumed that affleck just phoned his performance as hes been known do but thats far far case he carries this film way tom cruise carried rain man course gigli is not rain man but its not afflecks fault gigli is remarkably genuinely quite intentionally funny film at times more so than obvious desperate bringing down house instance affleck half heartedly reading toilet paper packaging lieu bedtime story pacify his child like hostage is hysterical so is latters baywatch obsession his antics with afflecks cell phone his whos first routine with afflecks boiling crime boss justin bartha as mentally handicapped hostage is no dustin hoffman be sure at times his performance makes you cringe because his level retardation seems fluctuate depending scene but he gets laughs jennifer lopez really struggles with some her line readings particularly her scene with al pacino how is this same actress who was so impressive playing similar character out sight but she looks amazing she gives off necessary sexual spark make romantic comedy elements work but if only director martin brest had revised his script before shooting iron out films three principle flaws one its so weak way lopez character is introduced i guess thats something many viewers just couldnt get past shes clearly no tougher than affleck is so why is she there again it might have been interesting if afflecks boss had had secret soft side recognized his underlings loneliness sent lopez try kill two birds with one stone cure lopez her homosexuality play cupid but he has no soft side hes two dimensional monster it never makes great deal sense second plot is much too thin christopher walken shows up one scene then vanishes never be heard again this film obviously needs him stick around keep heat our heroes addition afflecks boss how filmmaker as experienced as martin brest could have failed recognize that is beyond me i can only speculate that studio wanted max out bennifer angle stuff as many scenes featuring two them as possible even at expense our greatest living character actor not mention demands story third film is 30 minutes too long badly edited there are number scenes that just stretch two three or four beats longer than they should particularly that scene where lopez scares off those punks with her interminable eye gouging monologue id heard that dialogue gigli was just atrocious but i didnt really think it was that bad just long winded had film been edited down compact 90 minutes i have little doubt that it would have received more favorable response theres just enough material here good movie but brest spreads it too thin most interesting thing about gigli is that its kind tender hearted crime flick its more interested feelings emotions its characters than violence they engage or refuse engage sudden killing towards end film is as jarring as anything ive seen because it comes out nowhere affleck lopez seem authentically horrified at what theyve witnessed most crime films leads would feign disinterest play it cool not here i really bought that bartha brought out big brother father figure affleck lopez his sensitive caring feminine side clearly hes not cut out his line work thats what his two companions help him realize that is not insignificant thing would that less reviled films boasted such satisfying character arc so why does this film have microscopic 2 2 rating at imdb perhaps people are reviewing afflecks lopez over publicized failed romance instead film beats heck out me,0.5551779935275081,0.13326591154261053,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

6.0,Like a Greatest Hits Album.....,"You know how you get a Greatest Hits Album and there's a handful of good songs, the ones you know and love, and then the rest are stinkers? Filler just put there to pad out the time? That's basically like Gigli, a movie that's not particularly good as a whole, but has some knockout individual scenes.First off, let's be honest...it's not as bad as we've been led to believe. Look at the message board - more and more people are admitting ""it's not that bad"". Not exactly praise, but considering SO many people voted this into the Bottom 100 (it's at #29 when I wrote this), I think it's safe to say most of those were just padded votes, mainly from people who wanted to hate this movie and hated the whole ""Bennifer"" thing. Ebert gave it mild thumbs down and said he was deluged with hate mail complaining how he didn't hate it ENOUGH. Gimme a break.OK, the plot is awful. No bones about that. In case you don't know, here it is: A mafia hit-man kidnap's a DA's retarded brother so the case won't go to trial. He's a notorious screwup, so the mob sends a 2nd hit-man, who's a lesbian and looks like a supermodel, to make sure Hit-man #1 doesn't screw up. They sit around an apartment, talking and debating. Random people show up and they have to hide the retarded kid. Every once in a while they go out for Mexican (in a convertible with the top down!!) What in the world?? And this was supposed to be a big summer movie? I suspect writer/director Martin Brest came up for the storyline in a dream and for some reason thought it was a good idea. It's not. Watching this movie is akin to having an annoying roommate who keeps changing the channel between Rain Man, Prizzi's Honor, Chasing Amy, a failed sitcom about hit men, and any play with one set and no budget.Why do I kinda like this movie then? Same reason I dig Brest's Beverly Hills Cop - there's scenes in here that are to die for. I remember as a kid, i'd rewind scenes in Beverly Hills Cop over and over again, because I thought they were the funniest things ever. Same here. There's at least 3 or 4 awesome scenes, and about 5 good ones as well. The rest is filler.Witness: The ""rip that tears the past"". The speech in front of the mirror. The yoga scene. ""Turkey time. Gobble Gobble."" ""The Baywatch."" The Tabasco sauce. The morgue. The plastic knife. The ""sweet hetero-lingus"". Christopher Walken, showing more fire in 3 minutes than he has in YEARS, talking about ice cream and Marie Callendar's pies. Pacino's scene. Yes, he's YELLING again. He's playing a mobster again. So what? Now name another recent movie with that many rewind-worthy scenes. I can't either.Jennifer Lopez is sexy in this movie. Anyone who says she's not is lying. Ben Affleck is not. Nor is he supposed to be. People who say he's trying to be ""sexy and dangerous"" missed the point somewhere. He's doing a riff on Andrew Dice Clay, plain and simple. He knows he's acting like a buffoon. Anyone who likes him on SNL should like him here.Everyone should see this movie at least once. You'll have a good time. Even if you're watching it to see how bad it is, you won't be disappointed. No, I wouldn't want to sit through the whole movie again.

1.0,"Really, really bad","I will give some credit where it's due, I don't think Gigli is the worst movie ever made. However, that is very faint credit, it is still a terrible movie with few redeeming features.The cinematography is rather shoddy and the lighting is considerably dull. Neither do anything to compliment some decent surroundings, while the music is just bizarre and badly placed. The direction starts off inept and never recovers, while the script is just cringe-worthy with some lines verging on the really cheesy side, none of the characters are likable or well written and the story is full of plot holes and unnecessary scenes.The acting in general is terrible. Ben Affleck is rather stiff and uncomfortable, but he is nothing compared to the terror that is Jennifer Lopez. And it doesn't help that there is absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between them. And how great actors such as Christopher Walken and Al Pacino signed up for this film I shall never know. Actually, they weren't too bad, Walken's character was just poorly explored but he did what he could.

But while Ben Affleck was a bit of a horror, Jennifer Lopez shone (in terms of sexual appeal) throughout the film.One of the weakest parts of the film for me was the fact that they had a romantic relationship even though she was a lesbian.

1.0,The torture never stops...,"Frank Zappa said it all about Gigli on the 1976 album Zoot Allures, during track number three: the torture never stops. Bad films come in many configurations. There are films so bad that they are funny in a reversed sort of way. There are films so bad one cannot watch the end of them because they are too boring. Then there are films that are so bad they become a sort of perverse endurance test, the kind of film that dares you to turn it off before the end credits roll. Unfortunately, Gigli is definitely the third kind. Aside from having the worst principal cast this side of an Ed Wood production, the story is so utterly incompetent it defies all rational explanation (more on that anon). When released upon a gobsmacked public, Gigli attracted such terrible reviews that theatres in England never gave it a second week. David Letterman began to use it as a regular punchline about films so excruciatingly bad one would have to be mad to watch them. And therein lies one of the big problems. Gigli is merely mediocre.The worst parts first. Whomever had the idea of casting Ben Affleck to play a mob enforcer must have been drunk, stoned, or both. He is about as intimidating as Robert De Niro's infant grandrelatives, and probably about as muscular in the forearm. He is watchable when he is not trying to pretend to be the archetypal tough-guy, but when the script requires him to be intimidating, the whole thing comes apart. The second big mistake was casting Jennifer Lopez as a higher mob enforcer called in to supervise Affleck and clean up his mistakes. To say that this stretches credulity to the outer limits is like saying that casting Jennifer Lopez in a film is a bad idea. But by far the worst problem for Gigli is a script that could have been written by trained monkeys who drank paint for weeks on end for all we know. The script's attempts at humour often revolve around the correct pronunciation of Gigli's name, a joke that gets tired about one reel in. It would have been a wiser move to build jokes around the fact that it really is pronounced ""giggly"".But by far the worst mistake of the script lies in the central premise. It all starts with Gigli getting a call asking him to kidnap the retarded brother of a judge who is hearing a case involving one of the big bosses. The people ordering Gigli to perform this kidnapping hope that they can intimidate the judge into ruling favourably for their boss. The boss in question, played in cameo by Al Pacino, apparently did not authorise this course of action, and no wonder. Kidnapping is an incredibly serious offense under federal law, and ordering it could get anyone put away for life. Granted, mob bosses like to keep all sorts of fail-safes in place so that a case can never be made that they did in fact order such a course of action, but this is beside the point. Exactly what prompted the underboss in question to order this course of action without authority from the boss himself is something nobody who understands organised crime is ever going to figure out. Hence, the whole film regards its audience as a bunch of morons.Another big problem for the film is that it cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. The central premise duels between comedy and mobster drama. The principal actors seem to think they are on a teenie soap opera. The editor seems to think he is meant to be making a lengthy epic. The director seems to think he is directing a music video. All of these elements combine to make an incoherent, unfocused pile of nonsense that must have been as confusing for the crew as it was for the audience. What little audience there was in theatres, anyway. Word about how terrible Gigli was spread so fast that after a mere two weeks in US theatres, Gigli limped away with a gross of six million and change against a fifty-four million dollar investment. Not surprisingly, the film was available on DVD-Video faster than most films finish their theatrical engagement. Martin Brest has not directed a film since, in spite of previously being involved in some solid works such as Beverly Hills Cop. In any case, Gigli soon became a job that everyone involved would rather forget.And the sad thing is that unlike Battlefield Earth, Gigli is not even bad in a funny way. It just basically sits there and shows you its offensiveness, as if mocking you for not only choosing a bad film at that particular moment, but for the fact that it managed to con various suckers into contributing more than fifty million dollars to its making. In that sense, it is like an Australian or British Prime Minister that nobody wants to be led by, but they just cannot get rid of. These days, it is all too easy for people who think they are connoisseurs of bad cinema, but are not, to label the director of a bad film the new Ed Wood. The thing is, Ed Wood consistently made films that were endearing in an especially terrible way because he was so enthusiastic to make films that he never noticed how bad he was at making them. The people involved in Gigli know they have made a bad film, and they have gone to great pains either to hide that fact, or to negate its presence in their resume. It is cynical film-making at its absolute worst. Even if it is so much fun to see Jennifer Lopez kill what is left of her unremarkable career.For that reason, I gave Gigli a one out of ten.

6.0,The review that will make my entire career questionable,"I would love to view writer/director Martin Brest's original version of Gigli, which was said to be a black comedy with very offbeat humor and no romantic subplot at all. I would also love to have seen how that film would've fared amongst critics rather than the one that was released to the public. During its release, I find the film's extremely poor reception and disastrous box office performance unsurprising. The gossip about the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez was overexposed, obsessive drivel and tabloids raced to the neverending finish line of publishing nonsensical articles about the couple and bedazzled them beyond recognition. This was one of the key things that led to Ben Affleck's negative public persona and made it irreparable until he adopted a directorial career in 2007.Viewing Gigli a decade later, when news of Affleck and Lopez's relationship has long past faded into obscurity, the film is nowhere near as bad as people have said. In fact, it's a farcry from the worst film I've seen this year. I'd go as far as to call it somewhat enjoyable in the regard that it's always amusing in the way the characters interact with one another and the way the actors handle the absurd material they've been handed. However, in the long run, I prefer to view Gigli as a product and discuss its impact on its actors along with how its time of release greatly affected its reception.But this will be explored later on. The film revolves around Larry Gigli (pronounced Jee-lee), played by Ben Affleck, a second-rate mobster who is hired by his crime boss (Lenny Venito) to kidnap the mentally-challenged brother of a federal prosecutor to prevent the imprisonment of a New York mob boss. In addition, a woman by the name of ""Ricki"" (Jennifer Lopez), a dominant lesbian, is hired by Gigli's crime boss to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't screw this job up. It is a screenplay obligation that Gigli and Ricki eventually become attracted to one another, despite their differing sexual orientations.It's no surprise why the film was panned, seeing as casting both Affleck and Lopez in a romantic comedy as their heavily-documented marriage was approaching seemed to be nothing more than a tabloid-sponsored film catering to the same people that inhabit the checkout lines of grocery stores with several of the magazines on the conveyor belt. However, Affleck isn't the one giving the bad performance. His pseudo-tough guy appearance is intentional, something I hope people understood when the film was released and understand now. If anybody's performance should be criticized, it's Jennifer Lopez, who gives a wooden, wholly unbelievable performance as an attractive lesbian, who still finds it amusing and fun to flirt with a heterosexual male just to revert to the ""I'm a lesbian"" line. Her role is as contrived as they come, even with ten years of age.The most challenging role of the film easily belongs to Justin Bartha (who later made himself a name in The Hangover franchise), playing the mentally-handicapped brother. His performance ranges from senseless exploitation to somewhat heartfelt and believable. It all depends on what writer Brest feels like detailing at the specific time. Once in a great while, we'll see his charming innocence come through. At other times, we'll see him sing a rendition of Sir Mix a Lot's ""Baby Got Back"" and do a little wincing.The other thing to note is the film's use of music, which seems largely out of place. Consider the scene where Gigli, Ricki, and the prosecutor's brother are eating lunch and bouncy pop music plays, somewhat indicating a sex scene or a scene of seduction. The music is entirely out of place and provides an odd shift in tone. Scenes like this are rather frequent in Gigli and the jarring tonal shift is hard not to notice when it's something as quietly but noticeably abrupt as misplaced-music.On to the legacy Gigli has left. Many people involved with the making of the film felt some kind of rough, turbulent backlash on their careers once the picture was released. It took poor Affleck, as stated, years to rebound into a marketable, respectable name, and if it wasn't for stupendous directorial efforts such as Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo, his name would likely still inspire sneers and eye-rolls. Jennifer Lopez never really got back on her acting feet after this film, and became somewhat of a faded pop singer who had little to offer. But the one person that seemed to be affected the most is director Martin Brest, who made films like Meet Joe Black and Midnight Run long before this picture. Gigli is the last film he ever made and has disbanded into something of a recluse since. He has given no interviews since its release, has not participated in any film projects, and has left his whereabouts to be nothing more than a thought in a person's mind. After the studio debacle with the film's plot and creative differences, he has vanished into unknown obscurity, with no plans to direct or participate in any film again. It would definitely seem that people were too quick to label Gigli as one of the worst films ever made. It's definitely a rocky picture, very uneven, structured very peculiarly thanks to rewrites, and features performances that range from mediocre to above average. However, it's an entertaining piece of work, if one can accept the challenge of ignoring its horribly low ratings and criticisms it has garnered over the years. This is the kind of film I'll be judged for tolerating and, if that's the case, so be it. I got a handful of films at the top of my head that may make even the most hardened-Gigli hater reconsider their opinion.",review that will make my entire career questionable,i would love view writer director martin brests original version gigli which was said be black comedy with very offbeat humor no romantic subplot at all i would also love have seen how that film wouldve fared amongst critics rather than one that was released public during its release i find films extremely poor reception disastrous box office performance unsurprising gossip about relationship between ben affleck jennifer lopez was overexposed obsessive drivel tabloids raced neverending finish line publishing nonsensical articles about couple bedazzled them beyond recognition this was one key things that led ben afflecks negative public persona made it irreparable until he adopted directorial career 2007 viewing gigli decade later when news affleck lopezs relationship has long past faded into obscurity film is nowhere near as bad as people have said fact its farcry worst film ive seen this year id go as far as call it somewhat enjoyable regard that its always amusing way characters interact with one another way actors handle absurd material theyve been handed however long run i prefer view gigli as product discuss its impact its actors along with how its time release greatly affected its reception but this will be explored later film revolves around larry gigli pronounced jee lee played by ben affleck second rate mobster who is hired by his crime boss lenny venito kidnap mentally challenged brother federal prosecutor prevent imprisonment new york mob boss addition woman by name ricki jennifer lopez dominant lesbian is hired by giglis crime boss keep eye him make sure he doesnt screw this job up it is screenplay obligation that gigli ricki eventually become attracted one another despite their differing sexual orientations its no surprise why film was panned seeing as casting both affleck lopez romantic comedy as their heavily documented marriage was approaching seemed be nothing more than tabloid sponsored film catering same people that inhabit checkout lines grocery stores with several magazines conveyor belt however affleck isnt one giving bad performance his pseudo tough guy appearance is intentional something i hope people understood when film was released understand now if anybodys performance should be criticized its jennifer lopez who gives wooden wholly unbelievable performance as attractive lesbian who still finds it amusing fun flirt with heterosexual male just revert im lesbian line her role is as contrived as they come even with ten years age most challenging role film easily belongs justin bartha who later made himself name hangover franchise playing mentally handicapped brother his performance ranges senseless exploitation somewhat heartfelt believable it all depends what writer brest feels like detailing at specific time once great while well see his charming innocence come through at other times well see him sing rendition sir mix lots baby got back do little wincing other thing note is films use music which seems largely out place consider scene where gigli ricki prosecutors brother are eating lunch bouncy pop music plays somewhat indicating sex scene or scene seduction music is entirely out place provides odd shift

3.0,Not bad enough to be #88.,"I am currently on a masochistic quest to see as many of IMDb's Bottom 100 as I possibly can see. Unfortunately, a few are not available here in the US (such as the German film ""Daniel - Der Zauberer""--which is currently #1 on this infamous list), but I have so far seen nearly half the films and have finally gotten to ""Gigli"". Unfortunately, after having reviewed almost 8000 films, I can honestly say I've seen at least a few hundred that were worse than this film. I honestly WANTED to hate this film as much as the reviewers and public hated this film but couldn't. I just didn't reach the proper level of awfulness a film should have to make the list. This actually is true of MOST of the films, as films that are popular to hate (i.e., recent films) are prone to make the list. And, classic baddies of the worst directors in film history (Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Hershell Gordon Lewis, William Grefe and Arch Hall) don't even make this hallowed list--mostly because their horrible films are only known to their small cult-like following.Please, however, do not get the idea I liked ""Gigli"". It is offensive, horribly written and dumb--but not quite rotten enough that I hated the film completely. No, it's the Ivory Soap of the movie world--I only hated 99.44% of the film.First and foremost, the film was written, apparently, by chimps. This is the only thing that could explain why so much of the film made absolutely no sense. The plot meanders everywhere and shows that the film was cut and re-cut and re-cut until it really was incoherent. Some plot elements appear out of no where and just vanish (such as the crazy lady who cuts her wrists) and some actors come and go--for no particular reason (the wonderful actor Christopher Walken appears as if most of his scenes were deleted--the one remaining seemed almost pointless).Secondly, and this is a killer for any film, the characters (particularly Ben Affleck) were unlikable. Affleck and Lopez cursed and cursed throughout the film, as did just about everyone. In addition, even for a rated R film, the dialog between the leads at one point in the film is quite intense--like we're listening to foreplay between the two. It certainly is special--and a bit embarrassing. Additionally, in a big mistake, these evil people later become nice--quite inexplicably--making their characters seem like caricatures. In fact, then entire final portion of the film made absolutely no sense at all and seemed to be there to fulfill the formula--but how the characters got from their unlikable selves to likable ones seemed to come from absolutely no where.Overall, an incomprehensible film that has a few nice moments but the whole is just an awful mess.",not bad enough be,i am currently masochistic quest see as many imdbs bottom 100 as i possibly can see unfortunately few are not available here us such as german film daniel der zauberer which is currently this infamous list but i have so far seen nearly half films have finally gotten gigli unfortunately after having reviewed almost 8000 films i can honestly say ive seen at least few hundred that were worse than this film i honestly wanted hate this film as much as reviewers public hated this film but couldnt i just didnt reach proper level awfulness film should have make list this actually is true most films as films that are popular hate i e recent films are prone make list classic baddies worst directors film history ed wood al adamson hershell gordon lewis william grefe arch hall dont even make this hallowed list mostly because their horrible films are only known their small cult like following please however do not get idea i liked gigli it is offensive horribly written dumb but not quite rotten enough that i hated film completely no its ivory soap movie world i only hated 99 44 film first foremost film was written apparently by chimps this is only thing that could explain why so much film made absolutely no sense plot meanders everywhere shows that film was cut re cut re cut until it really was incoherent some plot elements appear out no where just vanish such as crazy lady who cuts her wrists some actors come go no particular reason wonderful actor christopher walken appears as if most his scenes were deleted one remaining seemed almost pointless secondly this is killer any film characters particularly ben affleck were unlikable affleck lopez cursed cursed throughout film as did just about everyone addition even rated r film dialog between leads at one point film is quite intense like were listening foreplay between two it certainly is special bit embarrassing additionally big mistake these evil people later become nice quite inexplicably making their characters seem like caricatures fact then entire final portion film made absolutely no sense at all seemed be there fulfill formula but how characters got their unlikable selves likable ones seemed come absolutely no where overall incomprehensible film that has few nice moments but whole is just awful mess,0.5750610500610499,-0.06358363858363857,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,A Break Out Movie For Good,"29 September 2015. I guess I watched a completely different movie from the vast majority of audience members. What I did see was an authentic and extensive sprinkling of coarse language and the evolving relationship between a coarse man and a human with mental disabilities as well with a sophisticated refined woman who had a lot to teach both Gigli and the audience about language, about peaceful resolution to conflict, about courage, and strong femininity. This movie really stood out for its carefully crafted treatment of mental disability in the same vein as Rain Man (1988) and its handling of violence. This movie instead of the typical rough housing, masculine action movie, this movie turns the stereotypical crime thriller into a relational drama that offers up valuable lessons for living. This movie is a substantive and worthwhile look at the awkward and amusing tension between masculinity and femininity.",break out movie good,29 september 2015 i guess i watched completely different movie vast majority audience members what i did see was authentic extensive sprinkling coarse language evolving relationship between coarse man human with mental disabilities as well with sophisticated refined woman who had lot teach both gigli audience about language about peaceful resolution conflict about courage strong femininity this movie really stood out its carefully crafted treatment mental disability same vein as rain man 1988 its handling violence this movie instead typical rough housing masculine action movie this movie turns stereotypical crime thriller into relational drama that offers up valuable lessons living this movie is substantive worthwhile look at awkward amusing tension between masculinity femininity,0.5256666666666666,0.09266666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,Don't do it. Just don't.,"You've probably seen your fair share of terrible, godawful cine-trash. You'd probably boast that you've guffawed your way through dreck like Jaws: The Revenge and Troll 2, and emerged, picking your teeth, demanding more. Maybe you've straight-faced your way through a conversation defending the 2015 Fantastic Four remake as a reflexive postmodern treatise on the autocannibalistic agony of commercial artistry without collapsing into hysterical, derisive laughter. You might jeer that you sit through an annual solo(!!) screening of The Room, seated on a throne of plastic spoons. You probably think you're invincible. And here you are, stumbling through the movie graveyard, preparing to test your mettle against The Big One. The Grandfather of Garbage, the Sultan of Cine-Sh*t. The man. The legend. Gigli. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. 'Ha', you sneer, defiantly hitting play on Netflix. Somewhere in the distance, you hear a faint skittering, as all nearby mice, birds, and insects flee in terror. 'This isn't so bad! I've already made it through the whole first scene of Ben Affleck's fourth-wall- breaking, excruciating Joiysey posturing and Big Hair with my wits intact. Gigli- schmeely!"" Oh ho. Just you wait, friend. This is the mere foreplay before the true agony begins. Now we venture into the land of Inquisitives. ""What are they saying? I can't decipher the bogus-Jersey!"" ""What is happening? Who is that man, hunched over those sunflower seeds? Is that Justin Bartha, that lovable scamp from National Treasure and The Hangover? What's he doing? Is he......is that...supposed to be like Rain Man? Why is he rapping? Oh. Oh no. Oh no no.""Yes. But if this jaw-droppingly offensive depiction of an intellectual disability face-to-Big Hair with Affleck's mawkish gangster isn't already enough to make your eyes start to bleed, don't worry: you've yet to meet Jenny From The Block. She arrives, crop-topped, with a chorus of funk guitar fanfare, here to engage in glorious battle with Affleck and his Hair. A battle of the sexes, you say? Nay - they battle to see who can be the most embarrassing actor. And the battle is fierce. You think you've stomached flat, tone deaf, emotionally gyroscopic overacting before? Not like this. NOT. LIKE. THIS! As they open their mouths, words tumble out. Words arranged so impenetrably ornately, so indefatigably nonsensical, so riotously wretched, that they extend beyond the screen like creeping Poltergeist claws, and vigorously disembowel any viewer despicable enough to be within reach. Over time, the words feed off the despair of their listeners, accruing more malevolent mass, and becoming monologues. Monologues, anointing Affleck his true title of the 'Sultan of Slick,' christening Lopez Queen 'Dykeosaurus-Rexy,' and, in a feat of Tarantino-theft that would defy belief if everything else in this movie hadn't already defied belief out of the dictionary, explaining the process of 'Digital Orb Extrusion' in Tai Moi Chai. At this point, logical thought is a distant whiff of a memory, scattered like grains of sand in the ocean of Affleck's Hair Product. You'd want to let out a silent scream. But Affleck and Lopez have stolen all the words. And all you can do is babble. But lo! A bright star emerges! Here, we are visited by a kindly extraterrestrial from the Planet Walken. Concealing his fear behind his bug-eyed Cheshire cat grin, he attempts to approximate conventional human parlance to warn you of the dangers that ensue from prolonged exposure. But your brain has already eroded too much to decipher the coded messages hidden in his talk of ice cream and pie. Desperate, he croaks out a final warning of Gigli's most devastating side effect: ""Your tongue will slap your BRAINS out trying to get TO it!"" But it is too late. The final Brain Slap has begun. You fester in your own sick in this purgatory of Gigli's apartment, slobbering and gibbering like a lobotomized bulldog, as the strains of inappropriately saccharine romantic synth music form a dubstep remix with the word ""Baywatch,"" and jackhammer a gong in your cavernous skull. Here, the movie sinks in for the kill. You hear Bartha utter the phrase ""penis sneeze,"" but you are numb. You see every other woman in the film reduced to a boorishly flirtatious or hysterical, whimsically suicidal lesbian caricature, but you are numb. Hell, you even sit through the final hallucinogenic indignity of Al Pacino(?!), clad in a Talking Heads oversized suit, actually trying (??!?!) to infuse some class or energy into the film. But you are numb. Numb, because you have sat through two of the most stupefying monologues in cinema history. Behold: Ben Affleck's fist-pumping ode to the penis, and Jennifer Lopez's yogic aria to the vagina. With their powers combined, the film finally filibusters any remaining brain cells out of your head. 'He turns her straight, 1964 James Bond style?!' you would normally incredulously gripe. Normally. But by the time you reach the sanctuary of Baywatch, it's too late. Your motor functions have run their course; you are more vegetable than human now. The Brain Slap is complete. If only you'd listened to Walken, emissary from a faraway galaxy. He would have warned you about Gigli - namely, that the effects of consumption approximate, in the words of the beloved Douglas Adams, ""having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick."" But there is no gold here. Only pain. Only suffering. Now - if you had a chance of preventing this fate, dear viewer. If you could turn back time, and avoid drinking in this unfathomable chasm of universal offensiveness, this abominable void of oblivion. If you could save not only yourself, but the world as you know it. If you could take the hype not as a comedic, drunken challenge, but as a dire, chilling warning.

1.0,The Title is Only the Beginning to How Bad This Crap Is.,"Gigli (2003): Dir: Martin Breast / Cast: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bartha, Al Pacino, Christopher Walken: Nauseating bag of horse sh*t that went through several titles until arriving at what Hollywood considers catchy. Originally it was suppose to be titled Tough Love, which would have made sense for Ben Affleck's struggle to deal with Jennifer Lopez's character as a lesbian, or the idea that they are both growing attached to their mentally challenged hostage. Instead we have jokes regarding the name Gigli, which do nothing to advance any form of plot device. Ben Affleck stars as a gangster ordered to do a kidnapping. Jennifer Lopez is sent to make sure everything goes well. Then the story caters to Affleck's difficulties in bedding her because she's a lesbian. Director Martin Breast's work here is about as creative as a drunk during happy hour. He previously directed Scent of a Woman and Beverly Hills Cop. There is unnecessary footage such as a visit from Lopez's lesbian lover. Affleck plays a complete ass and Lopez cannot convince viewers that she is even a lesbian. Justin Bartha fares better as the victim but his sentimental outcome is long predicted. Al Pacino's role is basically ten minutes of profanity, which is understandable given the film itself. Christopher Walken plays a detective and is another actor whose career is smudged with this film. The film should be cut to pieces and used as toilet paper.

Jennifer Lopez was excellent as Ricki. This is her best role. (That might not sound right to many people out there, but I mean it, and it's saying a lot.) Her delivery of her lines was great. And of course she and Ben had very very good chemestry. It is hard to beleive that they weren't in love at the time of this film. It was kind of like watching Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in VANILLA SKY where you could see both actors falling for each other. Such a thing was a joy to watch.The movie had the feeling of GET SHORTY or OUT OF SIGHT with it's quirkyness. Even something of a HUDSON HAWK feel. (Another horribly blasted movie which was really a great film. Maybe these two have something in common.) Christopher Walken and Al Pacino come in to deliver their own monologues. I always love watching Chris act. He is so funny. Al was his usual self, and I never get tired of his acting.I don't know what it is that people hate about this movie. Maybe it's because too many people are offended by how much Ben and Jenn are given so much attention because of their real life relationship. I really don't know what that has to do with hating a movie. Maybe it's because people expected something big?Like what?It's really sad that few people will be able to see into this film as being entertaining. Martin Brest hasn't directed a movie in 5 years. (MEET JOE BLACK, A very underrated film) I get the feeling that he won't be able to direct another movie for a long time. He is a very good director. The producer, Joe Roth is saying the movie's failure is his fault too, so that's a sign that Martin will be blacklisted because of this. What kind of injustice is that? Ben and Jenn will probably have to apologize about this movie too. It's a good thing they already have other movies coming out, or else their careers could be seriously hurt.ATTENTION ALL OPEN MINDED PEOPLE: This isn't the best movie of the year,but there really is a good movie in here.8 out of 10",only positive review this movie,maybe theres 2 other people who like this movie but oh well anyways whats up with all negative reviews other horrible things that have happened because reaction this movie received beginning end i though gigli was very enjoyable well acted well written with great diologue had good pace ben affleck was having good time with his role some people may say he doesnt have that tough guy persona but he showed it really well here weather he was being wisecracker or getting angry he put great performance jennifer lopez was excellent as ricki this is her best role that might not sound right many people out there but i mean it its saying lot her delivery her lines was great course she ben had very very good chemestry it is hard beleive that they werent love at time this film it was kind like watching tom cruise penelope cruz vanilla sky where you could see both actors falling each other such thing was joy watch movie had feeling get shorty or out sight with its quirkyness even something hudson hawk feel another horribly blasted movie which was really great film maybe these two have something common christopher walken al pacino come deliver their own monologues i always love watching chris act he is so funny al was his usual self i never get tired his acting i dont know what it is that people hate about this movie maybe its because too many people are offended by how much ben jenn are given so much attention because their real life relationship i really dont know what that has do with hating movie maybe its because people expected something big like what its really sad that few people will be able see into this film as being entertaining martin brest hasnt directed movie 5 years meet joe black very underrated film i get feeling that he wont be able direct another movie long time he is very good director producer joe roth is saying movies failure is his fault too so thats sign that martin will be blacklisted because this what kind injustice is that ben jenn will probably have apologize about this movie too its good thing they already have other movies coming out or else their careers could be seriously hurt attention all open minded people this isnt best movie year but there really is good movie here 8 out 10,0.5616455370026798,0.1924327744565839,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.24}"
6.0,"What happened with ""Gigli""?","When it starts; ""Gigli"" looks like an old comedy; like something from the eighties. There's a screen in blackout and a guy is talking some things; it looks like they're prepared to have fun. I'm sure they had a lot of fun, but I'm not sure if you will when you watch.I didn't have a lot of fun but the movie generates some laughs. You'll be killing me when you hear this, but it's some kind of unique experience. It was hated by everyone and it will be forever considered as one of the worst movies ever done; even when it's not that bad (as ""The Lord of the Rings"" will be considered one of the best movies ever even when it's not that good). Come on, you know there are other factors that made people reject this film. There's always a say about ""couples in real life don't have chemistry in movies"". This film's set made Affleck and Lopez fall in love. So, when the whole ""Bennifer"" thing started and this movie came upIt didn't have a chance.Hollywood is overly severe with some movies. Actually, the truth is that, even when the film hasn't got the most adequate sense of humor; and it doesn't dominate it correctly (because the script repeats the same jokes, and goes crazy with the bad words as ""fuck"" and ""shit""), the film has the best intentions. There must have been a reason (if it wasn't checking out Jennifer's ass) for Walken and Pacino to choose these roles. Their performances become stereotypes and each of them appears only once in the whole film. Probably there was a deep interest in big names for the film, and there was a deep amount of cash. Walken and Pacino are not the same as they used to be (I've talked about that before).Ben Affleck is the main star as Larry Gigli, a kind of gangster that works doing jobs that include killing people, taking money and other stuff. Affleck gives the role an incredible personality. He ends up owning the role; with his hair, his tone of voice (sometimes a little Italian) I like to remember Affleck as Kevin Smith's boy or as the guy that co-wrote with Matt Damon the script of the amazing ""Good Will Hunting"". Does Gigli ever finish a job? We never see him doing it; but he claims to be the ""gangster of the gangsters"", when he gives and absurd speech as he tries to impress Ricki. She's played by Jennifer Lopez and that's not the character's real name. Lopez, as always puts her charming comedy skills over her looks. This wasn't exactly the most convenient choice, but I say it all the time, and I'll say it now: Jennifer Lopez is a fine (just because excellent or great are longer) actress. I've only missed two of her movies, and I love how she does it. Drop the acting career girl! The starter Justin Bartha (Brian) easily steals the film. I don't know if the retards are the ones that stand out in films where hardly the rest does (I'm talking about Leonardo Di Caprio's character in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape""), but he gives a measured performance, without exceeding in something we've seen tons of times before. Just to say: Lenny Venito shouldn't be acting.And please, let's not bring down the man that brought Al Pacino to his best in ""Scent of a Woman"", took Eddie Murphy to success in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and was behind Brad Pitt's very good (one of his best) performance in ""Meet Joe Black"". Yes, I'm talking about Martin Brest, who did this movie with the best intentions. His work is lame here, shooting the arm of one character and the face of another when two characters are talking; and making the actors walk to a determined part when they're going to talk so the camera can center them The film's script is owner of an original storyline and different situations we haven't seen in a while. In the end, with the music and the stupid dramatic intensity, we realize: the film is obvious, manipulative; but somehow, you're waiting for Brian to take the jump.",what happened with gigli,when it starts gigli looks like old comedy like something eighties theres screen blackout guy is talking some things it looks like theyre prepared have fun im sure they had lot fun but im not sure if you will when you watch i didnt have lot fun but movie generates some laughs youll be killing me when you hear this but its some kind unique experience it was hated by everyone it will be forever considered as one worst movies ever done even when its not that bad as lord rings will be considered one best movies ever even when its not that good come you know there are other factors that made people reject this film theres always say about couples real life dont have chemistry movies this films set made affleck lopez fall love so when whole bennifer thing started this movie came up it didnt have chance hollywood is overly severe with some movies actually truth is that even when film hasnt got most adequate sense humor it doesnt dominate it correctly because script repeats same jokes goes crazy with bad words as fuck shit film has best intentions there must have been reason if it wasnt checking out jennifers ass walken pacino choose these roles their performances become stereotypes each them appears only once whole film probably there was deep interest big names film there was deep amount cash walken pacino are not same as they used be ive talked about that before ben affleck is main star as larry gigli kind gangster that works doing jobs that include killing people taking money other stuff affleck gives role incredible personality he ends up owning role with his hair his tone voice sometimes little italian i like remember affleck as kevin smiths boy or as guy that co wrote with matt damon script amazing good will hunting does gigli ever finish job we never see him doing it but he claims be gangster gangsters when he gives absurd speech as he tries impress ricki shes played by jennifer lopez thats not characters real name lopez as always puts her charming comedy skills over her looks this wasnt exactly most convenient choice but i say it all time ill say it now jennifer lopez is fine just because excellent or great are longer actress ive only missed two her movies i love how she does it drop acting career girl starter justin bartha brian easily steals film i dont know if retards are ones that stand out films where hardly rest does im talking about leonardo di caprios character whats eating gilbert grape but he gives measured performance without exceeding something weve seen tons times before just say lenny venito shouldnt be acting please lets not bring down man that brought al pacino his best scent woman took eddie murphy success beverly hills cop was behind brad pitts very good one his best performance meet joe black yes im talking about martin brest who did this movie with best intentions his work is lame here shooting arm one character face another when two characters are talking making actors walk determined part when theyre going talk so camera can center them films script is owner original storyline different situations we havent seen while end with music stupid dramatic intensity we realize film is obvious manipulative but somehow youre waiting brian take jump,0.5423239436619718,0.12922926447574337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.29}"
