,A Must-See Silent Comedy,"While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplin's later features, ""The Kid"" is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair, and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen. Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one, and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicely.While it's a fairly simple story, this is one of Chaplin's most efficiently designed movies. Every scene either is necessary to the plot, or is very funny for its own sake, or both. Except for Chaplin and Coogan, most of the other characters (even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance) are just there to advance the plot when needed, and the two leads are allowed to carry the show, which they both do extremely well.""The Kid"" is also impressive in that, while the story is a sentimental one, it strikes an ideal balance, maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos, which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies. Here, the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorable.This is one of Chaplin's very best movies by any measure. If you enjoy silent comedies, don't miss it.",must see silent comedy,while perhaps not as celebrated now as some chaplins later features kid is excellent achievement thoroughly enjoyable film charlie young jackie coogan make entertaining unforgettable pair there is lot good slapstick plus story that moves quickly makes you want know what will happen chaplin also wrote particularly good score this one most time music sets off action very nicely while its fairly simple story this is one chaplins most efficiently designed movies every scene either is necessary plot or is very funny its own sake or both except chaplin coogan most other characters even frequent chaplin leading lady edna purviance are just there advance plot when needed two leads are allowed carry show which they both do extremely well kid is also impressive that while story is sentimental one it strikes ideal balance maintaining sympathy characters while never overdoing it with pathos which chaplin occasionally lapsed into even some his greatest movies here careful balance makes few moments real emotion all more effective memorable this is one chaplins very best movies by any measure if you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0.6134362934362937,0.369954954954955,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,One Of The Most Memorable Silent Films Ever,"Wow, is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so. That fact that it still entertains over 80 years after it was made is quite a testimony. It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama. Charlie Chaplin's unique humor, combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember. Chaplin's humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stunts.The ""kid"" - Jackie Coogan - is just as memorable, maybe even more so. He is unbelievably cute, especially in those old-time clothes he wore. Watching the expressions on his face, even as a baby, are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent era.So, between Chaplin and Coogan, and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next, it's an amazing piece of work. This is a very fast-paced story which lasts less than an hour.The special edition two-disc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear, actually astounding for its age. Excellent entertainment.",one most memorable silent films ever,wow is this memorable film it is one most famous silent movies ever justifiably so that fact that it still entertains over 80 years after it was made is quite testimony it is wonderful blend humor drama charlie chaplins unique humor combined with involving storyline strong sentimentality make this one remember chaplins humor ranges pure slapstick some clever stunts kid jackie coogan is just as memorable maybe even more so he is unbelievably cute especially those old time clothes he wore watching expressions his face even as baby are fascinating facial expressions certainly were trademark silent era so between chaplin coogan very involving story that can break your heart one minute have you laughing out loud next its amazing piece work this is very fast paced story which lasts less than hour special edition two disc dvd has restored version print so picture is very clear actually astounding its age excellent entertainment,0.6376413690476191,0.32450148809523816,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.15}"
,Chaplin understands how close slapstick is to pathos in this classic tearjerking comedy; and remember: kids love this movie,"I've always thought there's a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies, even unsentimental ones like Keaton's ""The General"" or Laurel and Hardy's ""Way Out West."" The latter comedy has a scene where L&H perform a soft-shoe dance; it always brings me to tears. Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance. Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that I'm laughing doesn't dilute the emotional charge.One of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already. Why not marry the two things? That's what he did in some of his early short films, and that's what he does in this feature comedy. The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie (Jackie Coogan) away. Meanwhile, the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn't know if she'll ever find out what became of him.Jackie Coogan (about five in this film), with his charming manners, his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy, is one of the all-time great child actors. Want more evidence of Chaplin's genius? Coogan doesn't steal the film from him. This is true even though Chaplin, as producer, star and director, makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy's talents. Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles, like ""My Boy"" and ""Oliver Twist.""Chaplin's storytelling—even with the foolish sub-Dickensian plot twists, such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. The window-breaking scene, the flophouse scene, the dream sequence, the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene—they're perfect. Chaplin's celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.Want me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know, I can't even complain about that. It's too sweetly naïve. And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.One important note: children love this movie. Show it to them while they're young, and you'll make Chaplin fans of them. And that's better than their becoming fans of almost anything that's being peddled to them.",chaplin understands how close slapstick is pathos this classic tearjerking comedy remember kids love this movie,ive always thought theres great beauty poignancy best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like keatons general or laurel hardys way out west latter comedy has scene where l h perform soft shoe dance it always brings me tears why maybe physical comedy has same kind effect me as dance performance both art forms are very expressive fact that im laughing doesnt dilute emotional charge one many things that made chaplin genius was his understanding how close slapstick is pathos already why not marry two things thats what he did some his early short films thats what he does this feature comedy little tramp finds abandoned baby raises him into boyhood but authorities find out want take little jackie jackie coogan away meanwhile mother who abandoned him has since become wealthy singer doesnt know if shell ever find out what became him jackie coogan about five this film with his charming manners his talents as mimic his adeptness at physical comedy is one all time great child actors want more evidence chaplins genius coogan doesnt steal film him this is true even though chaplin as producer star director makes every evident attempt spotlight boys talents coogan is even better here than he is his own vehicles like my boy oliver twist chaplins storytelling even with foolish sub dickensian plot twists such as jackie suddenly taking ill deftly draws out comedy pathos maximum effect individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed window breaking scene flophouse scene dream sequence trying get rid baby scene theyre perfect chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples storytelling themselves want me criticize something how about those thudding attempts link mother with jesus but you know i cant even complain about that its too sweetly na ve movie as whole is too good allow us sneer at very few flaws one important note children love this movie show it them while theyre young youll make chaplin fans them thats better than their becoming fans almost anything thats being peddled them,0.5711018826135105,0.32631782945736426,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,Charlie Finds a Son,"THE KID (First National Pictures, 1921), a comedy-drama written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977), plays an important part his screen career. Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE (1914), a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy, THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies, but releases coming once every two to three years. A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in 1914, eventually under the supervision and direction of himself, Chaplin's methods in movie making improved with each passing film. Like himself, Jackie Coogan, Chaplin's littlest co-star and title character, made such an impression with his initial performance, nearly upstaging his impresario, that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own, becoming Hollywood's first important child star.THE KID starts off with inter-titles, ""A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear,"" followed by ""The woman whose sin was motherhood,"" titles much to the liking of a D.W. Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish, yet, in fact, might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplin's, whose very name personifies comedy. A young girl (Edna Purviance) leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms. who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father (Carl Miller), a young artist, never returns to her life. The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away. Crooks enter the scene, stealing the car, discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town. Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket, Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else, but after stumbling upon a note which reads, ""Please love and care for this orphan child,"" he decides to raise the child himself. Five years pass. The kid (whose name is believed to be John), now Charlie's adopted son and sidekick, start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money. As for the kid's mother, she's become ""a star of great prominence,"" devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts, where lives the kid. The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions, unaware of each other's identities. When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention, a middle-aged country doctor, having discovered Charlie not the boy's true father, sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child away.THE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product, especially for a silent movie made so long ago. Chaplin, who constructs his gags to perfection, has one difficult scene that comes off naturally, this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as he's lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk. The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot (a substitute for a baby bottle) back into his mouth. Another classic moment, on a serious nature, is when Charlie is being held back by authorities, being forced to watch his crying ""son"" taken away from him. Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as he's being chased by a policeman from the slanted roof-tops. The close-up where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on film.Chaplin and little Jackie (billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits) display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors. Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin, right down to his baggy pants. Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances, is so convincing that it doesn't take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp. From this point onward, he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor, at the same time, adding more plot, pathos and truly great comedy routines.As much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark, Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work. The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some, but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that follows.THE KID, which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years, was resurrected in the 1970s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in 1971. It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in 1989 as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection, double billed along with a comedy short, THE IDLE CLASS (1921). In the DVD format, the two disc set includes rare out-takes and deleted scenes. Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library, where it made its debut December 15, 2003, during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights, hosted by Robert Osborne, and later in March 2004 when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its ""Star of the Month.""For its age, THE KID holds up extremely well, thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan. There's no doubt Jackie Coogan (1914-1984) became an overnight star with this one film. He was a natural. While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again, on screen anyway, without them, there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID.

9.0,Smiling and Tearing,"""The Kid"" is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplin's oeuvre. He hadn't filled a film so fully with pathos since ""The Vagabond"" (1916), and then it was in a very limited way--subject to the confines of two reels. And, ""Sunnyside"" (1919) was a failure. The feature length of ""The Kid"" also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags, pranks and set pieces, and with the support of Jackie Coogan, it's one of his funniest comedies.The parent-child relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment, and, for me, not many have neared Chaplin's exploitation of that formula in ""The Kid"". The sequence where they take the kid, for a workhouse, away from the Tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the film--or maybe of all film. In addition to Chaplin and Coogan, Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture. Furthermore, Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totheroh's photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual, and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist, but the musical score added to the 1971 release, composed by Chaplin, taken from Tchaikovsky, gives the sentimental parts its most verve.Of the slapstick, one of my favorite scenes involves the Tramp in fear of a bully. It's reminiscent of his Mutual short ""Easy Street"" (1917), which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch. There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film. Yet, ""The Kid"" is much more than that, which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot, and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplin's previous work. This was the beginning of the Tramp as the sympathetic, pitiful hero, as well as clown, that's so recognizable and beloved to this day.Moreover, the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect. It's also funny in a silly way. It's somewhat analogous to the outer reality story, although with much ambiguity. I wasn't always sure Chaplin was making any clear point, such as with the Christ image earlier in the film, but that seems unimportant; ""The Kid"" affects the emotions and isn't especially aimed at engaging the mind. At six reels, with more sets and a developed plot, this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplin's previous work; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth, thus making ""The Kid"" Chaplin's first complete feature.",smiling tearing,kid is powerfully emotional wonderfully hilarious motion picture was tremendous breakthrough charlie chaplins oeuvre he hadnt filled film so fully with pathos since vagabond 1916 then it was very limited way subject confines two reels sunnyside 1919 was failure feature length kid also allows chaplin elaborate refine gags pranks set pieces with support jackie coogan its one his funniest comedies parent child relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment me not many have neared chaplins exploitation that formula kid sequence where they take kid workhouse away tramp is probably most powerful endearing tearjerker moment film or maybe all film addition chaplin coogan edna purviance is also quite effective dramatic side picture furthermore chaplin cinematographer roland totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at mutual chaplin was already eccentric perfectionist but musical score added 1971 release composed by chaplin taken tchaikovsky gives sentimental parts its most verve slapstick one my favorite scenes involves tramp fear bully its reminiscent his mutual short easy street 1917 which is made especially clear when bully bends lamppost with one punch there are many other great moments humorous pantomime farce this film yet kid is much more than that which makes it such breakthrough slapstick fills plot there is more developed plot here than chaplins previous work this was beginning tramp as sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable beloved this day moreover dream sequence is ingenious plot device it adds dimensionally narrative asserts its themes while delaying inevitable conclusion outer narrative poignant effect its also funny silly way its somewhat analogous outer reality story although with much ambiguity i wasnt always sure chaplin was making any clear point such as with christ image earlier film but that seems unimportant kid affects emotions isnt especially aimed at engaging mind at six reels with more sets developed plot this film was already expansion compared chaplins previous work dream sequence satisfyingly expands narrative depth thus making kid chaplins first complete feature,0.6415161466885605,0.1637725779967159,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10.0,rarely has there ever been such a deft mix of wonderful absurdity and (dark) sentiment as here,"It's easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius, but I'll say it once again: the man was a genius, if only at doing a certain particular kind of film. You wouldn't ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film, or at least one like out of Germany, or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths. His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the 20s and 30s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion. Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental, but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and (the usual kicked-around word) manipulated amid the comedic set-ups. Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer, and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the Kid.As it stands even at 50 minutes, which was trimmed by Chaplin himself 50 years after its original release and including a new musical score, it's just about a perfectly told tale. It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that 'Dreamland' sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful light-and-dark examination of all the major characters in the picture- now with angel wings and devil horns! What it's about, in complete basics, is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she won't be able to take care of him, and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at, and the Tramp decides to take care of him (he even names him, in one amusing aside, John). Then it cuts to 5 years later, and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows, eat lots of pancake, and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an ""Older Brother"" of a kid John gets in a fight with. Meanwhile, the mother is now a success, not knowing her child is somewhere- right in front of her nose.This may sound like a bit of story, but it's told briskly and without a missed beat in editing, and Chaplin's re-edit tightens it to a point where we're mostly with the Kid and the Tramp. Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be: playful, absurd, cute, and bittersweet to a degree. We know this can't exactly last, but the moment the poor maybe-sick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic (and yet partially triumphant) sequences in the movies. It's in a case like this, where we as the audience tear up, more or less, as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out, and then inter-cut with Chaplin's daring dash across the roof-tops to save him, that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other. This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film, silent or otherwise; that it's silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true: even a beat with the Kid playing with toys, an obviously ""cute"" bit, is great, and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like Chaplin.Featuring some excellent set-pieces just unto themselves (aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that belly-laugh part with the repetitive brick-hit to the head, or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin), an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin, and excellent performances from all supporting cast (including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance), it's altogether an awe-inspiring feat. To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness.",rarely has there ever been such deft mix wonderful absurdity dark sentiment as here,its easy call charlie chaplin genius but ill say it once again man was genius if only at doing certain particular kind film you wouldnt ever see charlie chaplin doing silent horror film or at least one like out germany or even big epic that ran griffith lengths his artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford price ticket back 20s 30s see his films he combined pathos that was incredible unique its spectrum humor compassion some may call films like kid even city lights sentimental but they may miss greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated usual kicked around word manipulated amid comedic set ups earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked viewer if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard find better example then kid as it stands even at 50 minutes which was trimmed by chaplin himself 50 years after its original release including new musical score its just about perfectly told tale it is short either cut form but its so simple story tell that anything else would just likely be padding even that dreamland sequence towards end film is crucial allows chaplin let loose wonderful light dark examination all major characters picture now with angel wings devil horns what its about complete basics is that woman leaves her baby backseat car thinking she wont be able take care him baby winds up by chance alleyway tramp is at tramp decides take care him he even names him one amusing aside john then it cuts 5 years later two are intrepid duo as they break fix windows eat lots pancake tramp nearly gets pummeled by older brother kid john gets fight with meanwhile mother is now success not knowing her child is somewhere right front her nose this may sound like bit story but its told briskly without missed beat editing chaplins re edit tightens it point where were mostly with kid tramp their scenes are everything that chaplin wants them be playful absurd cute bittersweet degree we know this cant exactly last but moment poor maybe sick kid is taken away orphanage becomes one most tragic yet partially triumphant sequences movies its case like this where we as audience tear up more or less as kid is being carted away crying his eyes out then inter cut with chaplins daring dash across roof tops save him that we see genius comedy tragedy combined working off each other this is assisted greatly throughout by child actor jackie coogan who may be one very best child actors any film silent or otherwise that its silent adds challenge success pure pantomime that without fault feels true even beat with kid playing with toys obviously cute bit is great up task playing off quintessential clown like chaplin featuring some excellent set pieces just unto themselves aside dreamland there is fight between chaplin brother with that belly laugh part with repetitive brick hit head or when tramp kid stop sleep night at home have sneak around try not pay extra coin absolutely beautiful musical track chaplin excellent performances all supporting cast including frequent chaplin star edna purvivance its altogether awe inspiring feat see this or city lights or modern times extent is see ideas character outlasting far beyond their time place as something far more valuable public consciousness,0.539727899551429,0.20594439873851647,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,"A picture with laughter and a few tears, indeed.","Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous. His character, the Tramp, is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early 20th century, but something all of us can overcome.In one of his first roles with this character, he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan, who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family. Taking himself and this very talented young boy, Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote, directed, starred in and composed the score for this film.Here, Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires: to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another. The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own. He hasn't got much but he does have love, which is more than can be said for the child's mother.Flash forward five years, and now the mother wants her son back. Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion. Even so, the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful. This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks, things not used much at the time in the movies. Using these little tricks and ideas, Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the story.However, at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in.

9.0,Pathos And Comedy,"Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked, The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five years.In reading Charlie Chaplin's memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid. First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted. Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him. The second thing was Chaplin's determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be done.The success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan. As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors. Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they don't totally steal the film from you.The Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid. He's the same rapscallion Tramp we all know, but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp, one of deep feeling and protectiveness. Two people who need and love each other very much. This film couldn't miss.First National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin, the studio, and his estranged wife Mildred Harris. The Robert Downey, Jr. biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines. He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms. That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itself.Till that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid.",pathos comedy,due unwed mother abandoning her child automobile said automobile being subsequently hijacked little tramp winds up with baby proceeds raise it its first five years reading charlie chaplins memoirs i learned two things about making kid first he had get child star jackie coogan away roscoe fatty arbuckle under whom lad was contracted chaplin saw him was determined make film with him second thing was chaplins determination make film that combined both pathos comedy which many said could not be done success kid is due chemistry established between chaplin coogan as chaplin said his memoirs young children their uninhibited way are natural actors part chemistry though is make sure they dont totally steal film you tramp gets his innings with kid hes same rapscallion tramp we all know but kid showed another side tramp one deep feeling protectiveness two people who need love each other very much this film couldnt miss first national pictures sure thought so as it became part three way tug war between chaplin studio his estranged wife mildred harris robert downey jr biographical film chaplin illustrates that whole bit business where charlie smuggled out negative kid took it lam across state lines he edited it was able get it back first national as finished product his own terms that whole business probably would make good movie unto itself till that one is made see enjoy tramp future uncle fester kid,0.3990972222222222,0.165546875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,"""Proper care and attention""","What makes a feature film different to a short? It isn't just length. After all, some of Charlie Chaplin's later shorts were as long as forty-five minutes, while The Kid is barely an hour. No, when Chaplin made his graduation to full-length features, he also strove to broaden the scope, scale and above all the dignity of his work. The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplin's career.The Kid begins with a bit of backstory, as a few of Chaplin's shorts do, but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this. Here we have the opening of a drama, and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture, and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy. Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child. A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life, and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him, and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief. Of course, such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short, but here that wouldn't be appropriate. Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world, but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laugh-out-loud funny, but they certainly don't belong in a straight dramatic setting. And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious, for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room scene.And never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture. The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces. Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism, with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration, but still very natural by the standards of the time. And of course, little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive, his movements, expressions and timings all spot-on, so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness, and he appears more like a human cartoon character. Coogan steals the picture with ease, and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously aside.This too is an important difference with The Kid. Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act, famously severing his partnership with the funny-in-his-own-right Ben Turpin back in 1915. Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags. Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own. The few examples, such as the routine with the policeman's wife and the window ledge, are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material. However, he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan, in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it, and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this out.Today The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful feature-length spin-off. If you look at something like the 80-minute Christmas special of The Office, it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements, and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series. By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode. Chaplin's full length features however were far more than just spin-offs, and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work.",proper care attention,what makes feature film different short it isnt just length after all some charlie chaplins later shorts were as long as forty five minutes while kid is barely hour no when chaplin made his graduation full length features he also strove broaden scope scale above all dignity his work kid is not just addition another fifteen minutes funny business it is truly turning point chaplins career kid begins with bit backstory as few chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this here we have opening drama yet one written staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance rest picture does not leave us waiting too long get onto comedy two shots title card tell us that woman this story is mother illegitimate child couple more shots tell us that father is now out her life revealing him be aspiring artist gives us idea why she may have been attracted him why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief course such seriousness was sort thing be lampooned chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate instead we are eased gradually into comedy world but having pair hoodlums who steal car slightly buffoonish characters they are by no means laugh out loud funny but they certainly dont belong straight dramatic setting throughout while drama remains very genuine chaplin takes care never allow any environment become too serious example having henry bergman turn up as flamboyant impresario dressing room scene never before has effort gone into directing actors been so evident chaplin picture performances kid are full subtle gesture timing ensemble pieces edna purviance demonstrates good sense dramatic realism with little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by standards time course little jackie coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions timings all spot so much so that it almost looks impossible child be acting with such apparent awareness he appears more like human cartoon character coogan steals picture with ease once normally egotistical chaplin steps graciously aside this too is important difference with kid chaplin had always resisted anything verging double act famously severing his partnership with funny his own right ben turpin back 1915 now however he allows his rapport with coogan become main basis gags notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences kid that feature chaplin his own few examples such as routine with policemans wife window ledge are often hilarious chaplin could easily have filled picture with such material however he does bulk comedy duet with coogan material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch it chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time limelight bring this out today kid can be looked upon as ancestor successful feature length spin off if you look at something like 80 minute christmas special office it similarly broadened out scope tv series by adding some serious dramatic emotional elements has become recognised as masterpiece better than series by comparison simpsons will always be best remembered as tv show because simpsons movie just felt like extra long episode chaplins full length features however were far more than just spin offs have always been revered regarded as most important body his work,0.524426807760141,0.15665196942974718,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,the greatest,"Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not, to different people it's gonna be different person, so I can speak only for myself. Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award: This man is the true embodiment of the ""American Dream"": Having grown up in poverty and misery and virtually without parents (without a father and with insane mother), moving to America with basically nothing but his ability to speak English (in the era of the silent movies), this man manages to establish his own film company (United Artists) and becomes one of the creators of Hollywood. He produces, directs, writes, plays the leading role and composes the music for his movies. He is the creator of the most famous movie image on the earth-the Little Tramp. As you all probably know I am talking about sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. There are attempts, sometimes I read, to make Buster Keaton candidate for the Chaplin's throne. Well, I won't comment on that for I am not familiar with Keaton's work; I grew up with Chaplin so you could say I am being biased, however I would mention only one fact here: the only time the two meet on the screen is in a Chaplin's movie ""Limelight."" I think this says a lot.Why did I choose the movie ""The Kid"" as a podium for my tribute to the great Charlie? I have to say I like all of his movies, mistake, I love all of his movies, but this one is the true purl in his work to me. I don't think of any other movie, not only Chaplin's, that made me cry, I mean really cry, and laugh, I mean really laugh, like ""The Kid."" The closest I can think of now is another Chaplin's masterpiece ""City Lights"" but unlike the later one in the former one that is only him, the tramp, and the kid; and everything is silent. Think about it: the movie making at its purest. I don't know whether I could make my point with this review-probably not. There are not enough words to describe the respect and gratitude I feel towards Chaplin.

10.0,"""A picture with a smile  and perhaps, a tear.""","Charlie Chaplin's first full length feature film, and his biggest success up to that date, is a remarkably heartwarming story , which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy. It begins with a woman who's ""sin was motherhood,"" who gives birth to a baby she can't support at a Charity Hospital which is kept pad-locked from the inside. She is forced to abandon it in an alley, and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film, as he is casually strolling by and then, through a series of odd but entirely believable situations, he is unable to get rid of it. It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin (who was in top form) playing the little boy at 5 years old. Charlie's life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby, but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together, the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements. Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run, because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money. It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplin's traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed, dramatic story. The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments (sometimes simultaneously, if you can believe that), but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival, and it is never once predictable, all the way until the last frame.There is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy, and in between ""rounds, "" Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well, and giving him hints for the rest of the fight. Meanwhile, the other kid's brother shows up, a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankenstein's monster than anything else. What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street. This is a slapstick set-up that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time, were it not for it's direct relevance to the story.At another point, there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home, as the 1921 version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackie's arms. I think this is the only time in any film that I've ever seen genuine, low-brow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident. This combination, not just here but throughout the film, is The Kid's biggest achievement. There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about, although my understanding is that volumes have been written about it's symbolic meaning, both within the movie and in reference to Chaplin's personal life. And speaking of which, supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing. I don't know which story to believe, that it was because of Chaplin's painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary (I would bet it's a little of both), but the film is here and I guess ultimately that's all that matters. In the five or six times that I've seen The Kid, I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck, if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramp's real son, either on screen or off. Then again, I am looking at it with 21st century eyes. Some of Shirley Temple's early films are also a little disturbing to me, although for not quite the same reasons. By this time, Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films, and after 36 short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond (along with a few assorted others), Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema.",picture with smile perhaps tear,charlie chaplins first full length feature film his biggest success up that date is remarkably heartwarming story which makes surprising connection between slapstick comedy dramatic tragedy it begins with woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth baby she cant support at charity hospital which is kept pad locked inside she is forced abandon it alley before long chaplin wanders by what follows is one best sequences film as he is casually strolling by then through series odd but entirely believable situations he is unable get rid it it is no secret that little jackie coogan nearly stole show chaplin who was top form playing little boy at 5 years old charlies life is thrown into turmoil by unexpected arrival baby but eventually he sort organizes his life when kid gets little older they make nice living together boy breaking windows charlie selling replacements soon police notice so they have cut run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money it is interesting watch film oscillate back forth chaplins traditional slapstick comedy much more developed dramatic story film is interspersed with pure slapstick some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is truly heartwarming tale friendship family survival it is never once predictable all way until last frame there is quick scene where kid gets into fist fight with another little boy between rounds charlie is rubbing kid down congratulating him fighting so well giving him hints rest fight meanwhile other kids brother shows up massive oaf man who looks more like frankensteins monster than anything else what follows is pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar fight between charlie town bully easy street this is slapstick set up that is so simple that it could have been thrown just take up screen time were it not its direct relevance story at another point there is pure slapstick taking place their little shack home as 1921 version child protective services shows up tear young boy crying jackies arms i think this is only time any film that ive ever seen genuine low brow slapstick so seamlessly combined with truly sad heartbreaking incident this combination not just here but throughout film is kids biggest achievement there is dream sequence near end film that i am really not sure what think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within movie reference chaplins personal life speaking which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money divorce which chaplin sped film stock utah editing i dont know which story believe that it was because chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary i would bet its little both but film is here i guess ultimately thats all that matters five or six times that ive seen kid i am always little uncomfortable with that kiss that charlie gives kid when he finally rescues him back that truck if only because i am conscious that he is not tramps real son either screen or off then again i am looking at it with 21st century eyes some shirley temples early films are also little disturbing me although not quite same reasons by this time chaplin was fully road his career full length feature films after 36 short comedies mack sennett at keystone studios dozen or so more essanay vagabond along with few assorted others charlie was fast way establishing himself as one greatest stars history cinema,0.5034500466853405,0.06615312791783377,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"

He then cares for an abandoned child , as Charlie struggling to nurture the castoff illegitimate kid (Jackie Coogan who launched as the first child superstar) . The Tramp has to face nasty cops , doctors and orphanage workers who want to carry the kid to County Orphan Asylum .

Ordinary sentimentality is made available both by the balancing presence of harsh reality and Chaplin's amusing grace of pantomimic skills . The sensitive drama is set amongst garbages , flophouses , a slum world described in Erich Von Stroheim style . Being accompanied by an adequate soundtrack , as the main theme from Charles Chaplin's score is based on a theme from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony . Duo starring is frankly magnificent . As Charlot's marvelous acting as a tramp who takes home an abandoned baby . Nice acting by Jackie Cooper as streetwise orphan that launched him as major child star , and it's easy to see why . Furthermore , agreeable Edna Purviance as unlucky mother , she acted in a lot of Chaplin shorts and in A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate .The motion picture was masterfully directed and played by Charles Chaplin . The production company tried to cheat Charles Chaplin by paying him for this six-reel film what they would ordinarily pay him for two-reel film, about half a million dollars. Chaplin took the unassembled film out of state until they agreed to the one-and-a-half million he deserved, plus half the surplus profits on rentals, plus reversion of the film to him after five years on the rental market. Deemed to be Chaplin's first real feature but he had made many shorts such as ¨The Vagabond¨, ¨Night at the show¨, ¨Burlesque on Carmen¨, ¨The immigrant¨ and ¨The circus¨ . Chaplin subsequently would make a string of successful films such as ¨The Gold Rush¨, ¨City lights¨, ¨Modern times¨, ¨The great dictator¨, ¨Monsieur Verdoux¨ , ¨A King of New York¨ and his last movie ¨Countess from Hong Kong¨.",sensitive enjoyable film which chaplin meets streetwise orphan raises him,wonderful picture mixes sentiment drama slapstick pursuits winning combination while walking slums tramp charles chaplin meets baby left by unfortunate woman edna purviance who played several chaplin films including note please love care this orphan child he then cares abandoned child as charlie struggling nurture castoff illegitimate kid jackie coogan who launched as first child superstar tramp has face nasty cops doctors orphanage workers who want carry kid county orphan asylum as events put that relationship jeopardy this sassy picture packs slapstick inter weaving gags melodrama opulent victorian sensibility lot laughters are guaranteed too kid is culturally historically or aesthetically significant drama that originated great influence wide range ordinary sentimentality is made available both by balancing presence harsh reality chaplins amusing grace pantomimic skills sensitive drama is set amongst garbages flophouses slum world described erich von stroheim style being accompanied by adequate soundtrack as main theme charles chaplins score is based theme pyotr ilyich tchaikovskys 6th symphony duo starring is frankly magnificent as charlots marvelous acting as tramp who takes home abandoned baby nice acting by jackie cooper as streetwise orphan that launched him as major child star its easy see why furthermore agreeable edna purviance as unlucky mother she acted lot chaplin shorts woman paris drama fate motion picture was masterfully directed played by charles chaplin production company tried cheat charles chaplin by paying him this six reel film what they would ordinarily pay him two reel film about half million dollars chaplin took unassembled film out state until they agreed one half million he deserved plus half surplus profits rentals plus reversion film him after five years rental market deemed be chaplins first real feature but he had made many shorts such as vagabond night at show burlesque carmen immigrant circus chaplin subsequently would make string successful films such as gold rush city lights modern times great dictator monsieur verdoux king new york his last movie countess hong kong,0.5247306397306398,0.21015993265993266,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.31}"

9.0,"""A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear."" You were too modest, Sir Chaplin ...","""The Kid"" was released in 1921, at the pinnacle of the Silent era, when emotions came to screen through looks and body language, when ""we didn't need dialog, we had faces"". And if there's one film where Charlie Chaplin's face oddly illuminates the screen, it's definitely ""The Kid"". Sure, many fans would argue that ""City Lights"" is Chaplin's masterpiece but something is too perfect, too masterfully directed, it was made during the talking era, Chaplin was in his 40's and had more experience, while ""The Kid"" features a more youthful director, It belongs to a whole other era, and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel, which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed, in 1921, Chaplin was 32, Hitchcock 22, Brando wasn't even born, discovering ""The Kid"" is like turning the pages of a dusty yellow-paged historical book, one eye is watching the film, while the other discovers a period. And I don't know if I'm the only one, but there's something in the setting, the location that makes the film look even older. For all I saw, the movie could have been set in the early century, and considering the timing of the film, maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin, himself. The film was made in a difficult personal time, when he'd just lost his son after his birth. There was a great wound in Chaplin's heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons, and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragement.The context of ""The Kid"" is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie. Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time, which is even more impressive considering his seven-year experience, a short time but enough to create an icon, the Little Tramp, an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema. Chaplin's story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and I'm sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame ... and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart, he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine, maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone, and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a film-maker.""The Emigrant"" in 1917 was like the first step back into Chaplin's past, inspired by his own experience. The movie doesn't feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future, and leaving the motherland wasn't synonym of sadness, but the emotions were there, beyond the slapstick and the comedy, and waiting for another step back, to finally explode in an emotional firework, which directly transports us to Chaplin's past. He who grew up without a father, and started working at an early age, he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living, before it cemented his talent, he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin. And this is how ""The Kid"" was made, and for the first time, Chaplin would become more than a simple clown, and get all the respect he needed from his peers, as a gifted film-maker. He could finally make his first masterpiece ""The Gold Rush"", but ""The Kid"" was this necessary last breath before taking the big dive.Many aspects of ""The Kid"" highlight Chaplin's past, and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs : a woman abandons a child, expecting him to be adopted by a rich family, until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramp's arms. But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who, despite the archetypal situations, didn't make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been, the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt, as is the father, a nice-looking fellow, and a sign that Chaplin doesn't hold any grief against his father. These things happen, and we shouldn't feel sorry, as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos : the Tramp and the Kid.In every aspect, the Kid is Chaplin's alter ego : he's smart, tender, funny, sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing. We've seen so many child performances since 1921 to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is, and Jackie Coogan is one of the best, if not the best, almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy, and that the kid didn't become as much a star as Chaplin, is one of cinema's cruelest ironies. The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic, and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene. I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying, while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense close-ups on Chaplin's face : his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen, and whatever inhabits the Tramp's heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himself.Chaplin, like Disney for animation, handled drama with the same strength as for comedy, the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy, fun, cheers, and even some dreamy escapism allowing a self-reflexive approach of the magic of childhood. ""The Kid"" is not perfect, but it's a masterpiece of sincerity, of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music. If not his best, it's his most defining film",picture with smile perhaps tear you were too modest sir chaplin,kid was released 1921 at pinnacle silent era when emotions came screen through looks body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces if theres one film where charlie chaplins face oddly illuminates screen its definitely kid sure many fans would argue that city lights is chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during talking era chaplin was his 40s had more experience while kid features more youthful director it belongs whole other era has historical feel mark twain or charles dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that movie is chronologically closer these classics indeed 1921 chaplin was 32 hitchcock 22 brando wasnt even born discovering kid is like turning pages dusty yellow paged historical book one eye is watching film while other discovers period i dont know if im only one but theres something setting location that makes film look even older all i saw movie could have been set early century considering timing film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by chaplin himself film was made difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth there was great wound chaplins heart movie evoking childhood was best way exorcise his inner demons his discovery very young gifted child named jackie coogan perfect encouragement context kid is crucial analyze comprehend personal motives chaplin beneath simple desire make movie chaplin was successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his seven year experience short time but enough create icon little tramp immediately recognizable character that put face rather young art named cinema chaplins story is also perfect illustration american dream im sure that he felt privileged having gone difficult childhood poor london district hollywood fame maybe somewhere deeply his heart he felt obliged let this part himself having occasion shine maybe he knew he was only one who could direct himself more serious tone maybe weight past was little flame that ignited his desire be film maker emigrant 1917 was like first step back into chaplins past inspired by his own experience movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because emigration carries sort hope better future leaving motherland wasnt synonym sadness but emotions were there beyond slapstick comedy waiting another step back finally explode emotional firework which directly transports us chaplins past he who grew up without father started working at early age he who learned entertainment survival more than living before it cemented his talent he needed dedicate film what made chaplin chaplin this is how kid was made first time chaplin would become more than simple clown get all respect he needed his peers as gifted film maker he could finally make his first masterpiece gold rush but kid was this necessary last breath before taking big dive many aspects kid highlight chaplins past level pathos depicted introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs woman abandons child expecting him be adopted by rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put child into tramps arms but what strikes most is level maturity chaplin who despite archetypal situations didnt make gesture as spontaneous as it could have been mother illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is father nice looking fellow sign that chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father these things happen we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed creation one greatest early cinematic duos tramp kid every aspect kid is chaplins alter ego hes smart tender funny sensitive more than anything extremely convincing weve seen so many child performances since 1921 get definitive opinion what great one is jackie coogan is one best if not best almost stealing show king comedy that kid didnt become as much star as chaplin is one cinemas cruelest ironies chemistry between two characters is genuinely authentic it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene i surrendered tears when i saw poor little kid crying while movie showed one rarest most intense close ups chaplins face his devastated look his eyes suggesting icy blueness as incarnate cold cruelty world that would allow worst happen whatever inhabits tramps heart is communicated through emotional score composed by chaplin himself chaplin like disney animation handled drama with same strength as comedy necessary tears movie mostly made joy fun cheers even some dreamy escapism allowing self reflexive approach magic childhood kid is not perfect but its masterpiece sincerity humanity that only chaplin could have made embodied through magnificent music if not his best its his most defining film,0.5538445194350706,0.1848303337082865,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.25}"
7.0,Chaplin's most emotionally resonant silent film.,"There's some genuine slapstick brilliance in 'The Kid (1921)', with Chaplin bumbling about in his typical clumsy style. The comedy is marked by an innocence, not often seen anymore, that just makes you smile. The physical comedy is to an incredibly high standard and there are some some genuinely dangerous stunts, too, seen during an exciting chase sequence. There are some heart-string tugging moments as well, because this picture as a real heart to it. It's probably the most emotionally resonant of Chaplin's silent films, with a real emotional payoff. Of course the feature is dated, it is nearly a hundred years old, and there's a bizarre fantasy sequence towards the end that stands out as an odd and unnecessary aside. The piece's silent styling and heightened reality setting allows it to more-or-less totally stand the test of time and provide some honest enjoyment, though. It's an endearing and entertaining ride that definitely fulfils its opening promise of a 'smile and, perhaps, a tear.' 7/10",chaplins most emotionally resonant silent film,theres some genuine slapstick brilliance kid 1921 with chaplin bumbling about his typical clumsy style comedy is marked by innocence not often seen anymore that just makes you smile physical comedy is incredibly high standard there are some some genuinely dangerous stunts too seen during exciting chase sequence there are some heart string tugging moments as well because this picture as real heart it its probably most emotionally resonant chaplins silent films with real emotional payoff course feature is dated it is nearly hundred years old theres bizarre fantasy sequence towards end that stands out as odd unnecessary aside pieces silent styling heightened reality setting allows it more or less totally stand test time provide some honest enjoyment though its endearing entertaining ride that definitely fulfils its opening promise smile perhaps tear 7 10,0.460141369047619,0.11437499999999999,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.43}"

9.0,Charming and truly touching,"While I don't consider The Kid Charlie Chaplin's best, along with Limelight it is his most charming and most touching film. The Kid is a wonderful film and a near-masterpiece in my opinion. If anything though I feel it could have been longer by about 5 or so minutes, but it is my only minor complaint of this film.The story is quite a sentimental one, but it is also very touching and very involving. I love the comedy which was very unique and I think holds up well, it still makes me laugh and smile. The Kid also has a lot of sentimentality and it is very strong. But it is incredibly touching too, any scene with Chaplin and Jackie Coogan makes me cry as the final scene gets to me every time. The film also moves quickly, and has many effective scenes particularly the brilliantly done dream sequence. The performances are astonishing too, Chaplin is excellent and conveys a perfect balance of sympathy and humour, but Jackie Coogan almost upstages him in one of the most adorable and heart-wrenching child performances on film. The Kid is lovely to look at too, and has a charming score.Overall, while not Charlie Chaplin's best, it is a beautiful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",charming truly touching,while i dont consider kid charlie chaplins best along with limelight it is his most charming most touching film kid is wonderful film near masterpiece my opinion if anything though i feel it could have been longer by about 5 or so minutes but it is my only minor complaint this film story is quite sentimental one but it is also very touching very involving i love comedy which was very unique i think holds up well it still makes me laugh smile kid also has lot sentimentality it is very strong but it is incredibly touching too any scene with chaplin jackie coogan makes me cry as final scene gets me every time film also moves quickly has many effective scenes particularly brilliantly done dream sequence performances are astonishing too chaplin is excellent conveys perfect balance sympathy humour but jackie coogan almost upstages him one most adorable heart wrenching child performances film kid is lovely look at too has charming score overall while not charlie chaplins best it is beautiful film 9 10 bethany cox,0.6570370370370371,0.48011574074074087,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.42, 'Fear': 0.09}"
10.0,"A picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear.","A picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear.That is the first line of the movie as it begins, and it stands true. We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling. Wow, I can't say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story. Now, we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally, recent great movie is Finding Nemo. But what's special about this movie is simplicty, honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into us.Done by the genius Chaplin, there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling, we either smile or bring tears. So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement. Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do, are done there. Winning over a fight from a neighbour, meeting angels and all. Now, look at the editing in this less than an hour film, its neat and precise. The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace. The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film. Acting is sublime by Chaplin, only few can do what he did and even today, hardly anyone can match him. It's a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch, atlas watch it before you die, you may learn something you never wanted to miss.

,Pretty Good Sentimental Comedy,"They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but I'm not so sure anymore. There has been a generational discontinuity, at least in the USA, that seems to have happened about 20 or 30 years ago. I suspect that most people over the age of 40 could identify Charlie Chaplin, and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit. Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinction.Generally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation, but Jackie Coogan is an exception.Sentimental manipulation there is, but it's mainly limited to one or two scenes. The comedy is pretty acerbic. Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby, Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it. He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again. That's not what passes for sentimentality.Besides, Coogan is cute when he's 5 or 6 years old, a ragamuffin dressed in floppy over-sized bags of clothing, so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it. And the kid can act too.Charlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him, which was all he had to do. Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because he's too inexperienced to know how to overact. Chaplain is good too, of course. How could one person be so inventive? It's said that TV ""eats up"" talent because of the constant demand for new material. One of the better series, ""Twilight Zone,"" had about three good years of collaborative effort in it. Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in 62 films and directed something like 28 of them, and he was just getting started.I'll give one example of a joke, without an iota of sentiment in it, to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together. Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid, a big bully, who knocks him about. Chaplain spots this, interrupts the fight, and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing -- go for the belly, keep your guard up -- and sends him back into the fight. At this point the bully's hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says, ""If your boy beats my boy, I'm going to beat you."" Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid, knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear. Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bully's chin and flattens him. But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back. Chaplain dashes over, puts his foot on the Coogan's chest to hold him down, quickly counts to ten, rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand -- the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy. You'll enjoy it. Especially if you're one of those rare folks under 40 with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue.",pretty good sentimental comedy,they say chaplain is cultural icon all that but im not so sure anymore there has been generational discontinuity at least usa that seems have happened about 20 or 30 years ago i suspect that most people over age 40 could identify charlie chaplin most people under that age would have stretch bit just one more item cultural data base gurgling its way through age structure towards extinction generally i disapprove kids movies as straightforward objects particularly putrid kind manipulation but jackie coogan is exception sentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited one or two scenes comedy is pretty acerbic saddled with possession abandoned baby charlie holds it his lap sits curb think about how get rid it he notices sewer grating gutter lifts lid thoughtfully second before glancing around lowering it again thats not what passes sentimentality besides coogan is cute when hes 5 or 6 years old ragamuffin dressed floppy over sized bags clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like little football with tiny feet it kid can act too charlie demonstrated every move kid was supposed make coogan did good job imitating him which was all he had do coogan is also refreshing when compared all adult actors film because hes too inexperienced know how overact chaplain is good too course how could one person be so inventive its said that tv eats up talent because constant demand new material one better series twilight zone had about three good years collaborative effort it chaplain same period time appeared 62 films directed something like 28 them he was just getting started ill give one example joke without iota sentiment it illustrate how well chaplain coogan worked together coogan gets into street fight with another kid big bully who knocks him about chaplain spots this interrupts fight takes coogan neutral corner where he gives him quick lesson boxing go belly keep your guard up sends him back into fight at this point bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over chaplain says if your boy beats my boy im going beat you coogan begins beating hell out other kid knocking him down again again while chaplain sweats twitches with fear finally coogan lands tremendous blow bullys chin flattens him but he swings with such force that he himself twirls around couple times falls flat his back chaplain dashes over puts his foot coogans chest hold him down quickly counts ten rushes befuddled bully raises his hand winner rather tight rein is kept pathos comic material is edgy youll enjoy it especially if youre one those rare folks under 40 with patience sit through movie black white that has no dialogue,0.5210132805048059,0.13513139873309366,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6.0,nowhere NEAR the standards of Chaplin's later feature films,"I have seen just about all of Chaplin's feature films and I would have to say that this is the worst of them, though it does have a rather high IMDb rating and quite a reputation. For me, the problem with the film is that it doesn't even come close to the polish and quality of films made just a few years later. THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and THE CIRCUS (1928) are masterpieces, as were his next few films. They managed to combine pathos, excellent story telling and comedy. THE KID, instead, was mostly a very superficial attempt to elicit tears and pathos--while having very little comedy and a paper-thin plot.On top of these complaints, I also was amazed how ""out of left field"" his whole dream sequence was. The flying angels and neat special effects did not in any way contribute to the plot and it served more as a distraction.So, in summary, I found the film not particularly enjoyable. See any of his other features (even the much earlier and very rough TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE) or a feature by Harold Lloyd or perhaps Keaton. Historically, this is an important film because his other features and those of Keaton and Lloyd did follow THE KID, but unless you are watching this solely for historical interest, don't.",nowhere near standards chaplins later feature films,i have seen just about all chaplins feature films i would have say that this is worst them though it does have rather high imdb rating quite reputation me problem with film is that it doesnt even come close polish quality films made just few years later gold rush 1925 circus 1928 are masterpieces as were his next few films they managed combine pathos excellent story telling comedy kid instead was mostly very superficial attempt elicit tears pathos while having very little comedy paper thin plot top these complaints i also was amazed how out left field his whole dream sequence was flying angels neat special effects did not any way contribute plot it served more as distraction so summary i found film not particularly enjoyable see any his other features even much earlier very rough tillies punctured romance or feature by harold lloyd or perhaps keaton historically this is important film because his other features those keaton lloyd did follow kid but unless you are watching this solely historical interest dont,0.4112571428571428,0.02973571428571429,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
