7,Not too bad,"Believe it or not, I've never seen the show before but love seeing movies so gave this a try. Wasn't too bad at all actually. Going to start watching the show because of it so I'm going to assume if a newcomer liked the movie then I'm sure the fans of the actual show will definitely like it. Kind of wish it had a bigger feel like Simpson's Movie and Beavis and Butthead Do America had, but the plot was fine as it was.",not too bad,believe it or not ive never seen show before but love seeing movies so gave this try wasnt too bad at all actually going start watching show because it so im going assume if newcomer liked movie then im sure fans actual show will definitely like it kind wish it had bigger feel like simpsons movie beavis butthead do america had but plot was fine as it was,0.5656565656565656,0.11060606060606064,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"

9,"Surprisingly entertaining, even the 2nd time around","Never watched a full episode, just maybe a few minutes as I was channel surfing but this was a very entertaining movie.

9,Charming and inviting for newcomers,"Was lucky enough to see this at a preview screening. The film does a great job of welcoming newcomers into the world of Bob's Burgers while also delighting fans with an endless cavalcade of one-liners. It's joyous to see the same world that we've watched for twelve seasons but told with a film budget, with some absolutely lovely shots that are only possible with more money for the animation.Hardcore fans expecting this to be 90 minutes of material for us may well be disappointed. Several notable recurring characters don't appear, or are reduced to cameos, and a couple of members of the family don't get strong plots in themselves, being largely comic relief. But I'm rather okay with this. (Of course it was a little disappointing in the moment, but I've made my peace with it.) The movie will hopefully bring newcomers to our little show, and I would much rather a strong story than a continuity festival. We have twelve seasons of that already, people! (And the film is strong; I was in a theatre with only a small number of audience members and it still flew by.)What makes the movie work so well is that the writers have not fallen prey to the great temptation for ""movies based on the popular TV series"". This isn't ""the gang wins a trip to Japan!"" or ""the gang teleport back to Ancient Egypt!"" or ""Linda becomes world famous as a shampoo commercial spokeswoman!"" This is a story that could very easily have been told in a Bob's Burgers episode, but given the room to breathe. By centering almost entirely around existing characters, and taking place entirely within recognisable landmarks, we're given the gift of a truly Bob's Burgers experience. Never once does this film try to be anything other than the show we know and love.",charming inviting newcomers,was lucky enough see this at preview screening film does great job welcoming newcomers into world bobs burgers while also delighting fans with endless cavalcade one liners its joyous see same world that weve watched twelve seasons but told with film budget with some absolutely lovely shots that are only possible with more money animation hardcore fans expecting this be 90 minutes material us may well be disappointed several notable recurring characters dont appear or are reduced cameos couple members family dont get strong plots themselves being largely comic relief but im rather okay with this course it was little disappointing moment but ive made my peace with it movie will hopefully bring newcomers our little show i would much rather strong story than continuity festival we have twelve seasons that already people film is strong i was theatre with only small number audience members it still flew by what makes movie work so well is that writers have not fallen prey great temptation movies based popular tv series this isnt gang wins trip japan or gang teleport back ancient egypt or linda becomes world famous as shampoo commercial spokeswoman this is story that could very easily have been told bobs burgers episode but given room breathe by centering almost entirely around existing characters taking place entirely within recognisable landmarks were given gift truly bobs burgers experience never once does this film try be anything other than show we know love,0.6009523809523809,0.18919047619047616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"

9,A wonderful escape,"""Bob's Burgers"" is a great comfort show. It's weird and offbeat, but the characters have such charm especially compared to other adult animation.""The Bob's Burgers Movie"" brings this wacky family to the big screen for what feels like an extended episode, but it's exactly what I needed.After a pipe burst, the Belcher family try to save their resturant and landlord. That sounds like a plot to an episode, but one that's silly and very in universe.Nothing about this movie feels super different from the show, outside of the very well done animation (God, I'm so happy to see another 2D movie on the big screen). But that's perfect. I didn't want the family to go on some adventure way out of character for the show, like fighting aliens or crossing the Burger-Verse.Nope, we just get these charming characters in the theater and that's about it. Honestly, with everything going on as of recent, we need this kind of movie.A movie that's just like ""Hey, sit down with some popcorn and watch something happy and charming for 102 mimutes.""

9,Kept the same feel from the show,"Initially, as a fan who isn't too fond of the unnecessary musical episodes, the annoyingly long opening song had me stressed this was all it was going to be. However, after that song, it seemed like the plot found its momentum. There are a couple other songs pointlessly added but sandwiched in between enough scenes early on that it doesn't feel like it's pushing it. There were a lot of popular characters missing from this but I felt it would've been excessive to force them into the storyline just for a cameo. The main conflict was large enough to fit a movie but still something on par with the crazy problems we see them get stuck in in the show. Ultimately my whole family enjoyed this film and I'm glad that people not even familiar with the show will have an opportunity to be welcomed into the fanbase.",kept same feel show,initially as fan who isnt too fond unnecessary musical episodes annoyingly long opening song had me stressed this was all it was going be however after that song it seemed like plot found its momentum there are couple other songs pointlessly added but sandwiched between enough scenes early that it doesnt feel like its pushing it there were lot popular characters missing this but i felt it wouldve been excessive force them into storyline just cameo main conflict was large enough fit movie but still something par with crazy problems we see them get stuck show ultimately my whole family enjoyed this film im glad that people not even familiar with show will have opportunity be welcomed into fanbase,0.48628117913832203,0.05623582766439909,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.46}"

7,Pickle My Funny Bone Burger,"I'm a big fan of the series and have to admit that my anticipation for the movie has been growing since it's announcement. Whilst I'd be the first to admit that it's not much more than an ambitious episode of the show, for me that was more than enough.With the bank about to foreclose on their cooking equipment, the last thing that Bob (H Jon Benjamin) and Linda Belcher (John Roberts) need is a giant sinkhole to open right outside the door to the restaurant and stop any customers from getting in. Their misery is compounded when a body is found in the hole and it becomes an active crime scene. Meanwhile all three Belcher children are undergoing a crisis of confidence. Tina (Dan Mintz) is unable to take the next step and ask Jimmy Jnr (Benjamin again) to be her summer boyfriend. Gene (Eugene Mirman) is not as confident that his band are ready for their gig as they might be and Tina (Kristen Schall) is debating whether it's time to finally lose the bunny ears that have been her trademark since preschool.Animation-wise, like ""The Simpsons movie"" before it, it sticks close to the style of the show, but add in a few expensive looking 3D CGI scenes for buildings and vehicles. Over the years, the show has become increasingly musical, so it's not surprising that there are several excellent songs in this run. I do think that they were a step up on the songs in the series too, proper catchy numbers.I would say I thought that the second half of the film was stronger than the first, not that the first half was bad, but it has a lot of work to do to set up the various strands of the story that all come together in the second half. That worked for me though, and the moments I remember laughing at were all generally in that second half.Do you need to see it on the silver screen? Perhaps not, but when it hits Disney Plus in a couple of months, it's essential viewing.",pickle my funny bone burger,im big fan series have admit that my anticipation movie has been growing since its announcement whilst id be first admit that its not much more than ambitious episode show me that was more than enough with bank about foreclose their cooking equipment last thing that bob h jon benjamin linda belcher john roberts need is giant sinkhole open right outside door restaurant stop any customers getting their misery is compounded when body is found hole it becomes active crime scene meanwhile all three belcher children are undergoing crisis confidence tina dan mintz is unable take next step ask jimmy jnr benjamin again be her summer boyfriend gene eugene mirman is not as confident that his band are ready their gig as they might be tina kristen schall is debating whether its time finally lose bunny ears that have been her trademark since preschool animation wise like simpsons movie before it it sticks close style show but add few expensive looking 3d cgi scenes buildings vehicles over years show has become increasingly musical so its not surprising that there are several excellent songs this run i do think that they were step up songs series too proper catchy numbers i would say i thought that second half film was stronger than first not that first half was bad but it has lot work do set up various strands story that all come together second half that worked me though moments i remember laughing at were all generally that second half do you need see it silver screen perhaps not but when it hits disney plus couple months its essential viewing,0.40689865689865684,0.030402930402930402,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9,As Great as It Gets for a Bob's Burgers Movie But Not Quite Cinematic Enough,"I love the animated series of Bob's Burgers, probably one of my favourite American animated series, with it's dry awkward humour, likeable as heck characters, really odd animation that has a unique flair to the style, along with many relatable episodes and strangely enjoyable ones, I'd say it's waay funnier then like Family Guy and all that, definitely one of the best animated series that's still going strong, now we come to the movie, which was heavily delayed from 2020 to 2021, but now it's finally out and we can go and see it!, exciting!, so I went to see it yesterday and..., yeah I really liked it, gave me exaclty what I needed as a Bob's Burgers fan, but there are a few things that does need work, so let's talk about it.What I like very much is that what we know and love about the show like the humour, characters and the art style all remains intact, which makes the film feel like how a film of the show would go, it's snapping on the constant humour which just gets funnier with every characters here, my favourite character was always Louise (Kristen Schaal), she's chaotic, adventurous and hilarious, in here she definitely has a arch when it comes to her hat which makes me like her even more and no, the results is not what you think it is, but still funny, the other characters are still great like the always unpredictably funny Gene (Eugene Mirman), the socially awkward Tina (Dan Mintz), the always uplifting and cheery Linda (John Roberts) and the down on his luck and often negative main character Bob (H. Jon Benjamin), the family still have their weird but slightly relatable family dynamics which makes them so likeable, the other major characters from the show are all still hilarious while always playing a key role to the big story like Mr. Fischoeder (Kevin Kline) and Teddy (Larry Murphy) along with a few cameo characters from previous episodes is always a treat, the animation is just as good as the show but with loads of 3D animation to make it blend in with the 2D animation which works fine, the characters still look the same but with actual smooth movements and big treat colours that gives the film a nice big screen look to the world of Bob's Burgers which I liked very much and it's also nice to see more 2D animation in cinemas once again, really gives the cinema experience a nice change, the story does play out like any other episode of the show but feels rather expended but works in it's own unique way that fans can get behind and the story works and is interesting enough to be movie worthy.. kind of, also this film is a musical, not much of a surprise since the show has songs in them but this one is a full blown musical and takes full advantage of it and makes the songs not only catchy but hilarious in the way that only the writers can make it, most of them are really solid.However with that said, there are a few things that felt that it might need some work on, like example, as well crafted as the film is for a Bob's Burgers film, it feels kinda underwhelming as a cinematic films, films like The Simpsons Movie while feeling like a longer episode of the series felt very much cinematic and big in terms of story and sequences, this one feels quite short and not just from how much fun I had, but I dunno I thought there would of been more of a cinematic flair to it to make it stand out, but also there is actually a bit too much going and too many plots, as entertaining as they all were, the one with Tina trying to ask Jimmy Jr. To be her summer boyfriend could've been cut out and nothing would change, that and it doesn't quite go anyway, despite it being awkwardly funny, also there is a villain song which kinda dragged on a bit and also couldn't been cut down short.But with that said, The Bob's Burgers Movie is the film we all definitely needed from the show and it's near perfect, despite the lack of cinematic flair and moments that felt either it dragged on or could've been cut despite too much going, but it is really a delightfully entertaining film that fans will love, with the amazing songs, the characters we all know and love, the animation that is just as good as the show and maybe even more so, good story and fun little plots that tie everything together nice while also staying true to the spirit of the show and being hilarious as ever!, if you are a fan of the show then definitely check it out, if not then give it a watch anyway, but I think non-fans might not get the humour of it all, but still go see it, way better then most films based off animated shows.I'm going to give The Bob's Burgers Movie a 9.4/10.",as great as it gets bobs burgers movie but not quite cinematic enough,i love animated series bobs burgers probably one my favourite american animated series with its dry awkward humour likeable as heck characters really odd animation that has unique flair style along with many relatable episodes strangely enjoyable ones id say its waay funnier then like family guy all that definitely one best animated series thats still going strong now we come movie which was heavily delayed 2020 2021 but now its finally out we can go see it exciting so i went see it yesterday yeah i really liked it gave me exaclty what i needed as bobs burgers fan but there are few things that does need work so lets talk about it what i like very much is that what we know love about show like humour characters art style all remains intact which makes film feel like how film show would go its snapping constant humour which just gets funnier with every characters here my favourite character was always louise kristen schaal shes chaotic adventurous hilarious here she definitely has arch when it comes her hat which makes me like her even more no results is not what you think it is but still funny other characters are still great like always unpredictably funny gene eugene mirman socially awkward tina dan mintz always uplifting cheery linda john roberts down his luck often negative main character bob h jon benjamin family still have their weird but slightly relatable family dynamics which makes them so likeable other major characters show are all still hilarious while always playing key role big story like mr fischoeder kevin kline teddy larry murphy along with few cameo characters previous episodes is always treat animation is just as good as show but with loads 3d animation make it blend with 2d animation which works fine characters still look same but with actual smooth movements big treat colours that gives film nice big screen look world bobs burgers which i liked very much its also nice see more 2d animation cinemas once again really gives cinema experience nice change story does play out like any other episode show but feels rather expended but works its own unique way that fans can get behind story works is interesting enough be movie worthy kind also this film is musical

6,Too Many Storylines & Lack of Big Feel,"I love that this felt like a long Bob's Burger's episode and that they kept to the snappy dialogue rather than a big goofy action premise (like The Simpson Movie did). We come for the jokes, not the budget, after all. However, there is a need for the films stakes to be bigger than normal and while the sinkhole did provide what could have been a major challenge, it's forgotten pretty early for a concept that could just be a regular episode. The mystery of whodunit is really really easy to solve. Lots of characters are missing here from the main plot (Hugo gets one measly scene). Emotionally, there are a couple of big moments (mostly from the big hero here in Louise's origin story), but most characters plots are just not that interesting or explored (an ongoing crush, a redo of a band, a burger cart). They're all fine ideas... just too many of them and not enough to make it feel like a cinema experience. I recall the episode where Bob had a fight with his dad and we learn about Big Bob's Diner... that felt bigger than anything here. Oh and by the way... Bob is missing or catatonic for waaaaaay to much of the film. The film almost forgets about him until he finally gets into the action at the end. The film needed more repeat characters, more guest characters that could hide the mystery & a focus more on one common mystery that all the characters join in on.

7,Meets expectations,"The Bob's Burgers Movie meets expectations. It's funny, purposeful, and developed enough to maintain investment. Fundamentally, it's a murder mystery, but also intertwines Bob's money issues (which is the emotional force). Plus, Louise is intrinsically motivated to prove her bravery, making her the main protagonist and giving her the clearest arc. Bob's Burgers doesn't have the tightest crafted humor, but these dynamic characters help it connect emotionally. The film is still lighthearted and silly (with skilled setup and payoff), but it peppers in enough drama to create substance. Thus, Bob's Burgers succeeds because it delivers a sincere combination of laughs and relatability.Technically, Bob's Burgers is proficient. Surprisingly, there are musical numbers that heighten the soundtrack, cinematography, editing, and direction. There is dramatic lighting, framing, and camerawork. Also, passing cuts, smash cuts, and time lapses help the comedic rhythm. Furthermore, voice acting is ranged, animation is personal, and CGI is supportive. Punchlines are heightened by exaggerated music, transitions, and surrealism. Overall, the filmmaking reinforces the humorous mood. It isn't high art, but it possesses consistent craft. Therefore, Bob's Burgers is a fairly enjoyable experience. Viewers should expect skilled comedy and decent emotions.Writing: 7/10 Direction: 6/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Acting: 7/10 Editing: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Score/Soundtrack: 8/10 Production Design: 7/10 Casting: 7/10 Effects: 7/10Overall Score: 7.2/10.",meets expectations,bobs burgers movie meets expectations its funny purposeful developed enough maintain investment fundamentally its murder mystery but also intertwines bobs money issues which is emotional force plus louise is intrinsically motivated prove her bravery making her main protagonist giving her clearest arc bobs burgers doesnt have tightest crafted humor but these dynamic characters help it connect emotionally film is still lighthearted silly with skilled setup payoff but it peppers enough drama create substance thus bobs burgers succeeds because it delivers sincere combination laughs relatability technically bobs burgers is proficient surprisingly there are musical numbers that heighten soundtrack cinematography editing direction there is dramatic lighting framing camerawork also passing cuts smash cuts time lapses help comedic rhythm furthermore voice acting is ranged animation is personal cgi is supportive punchlines are heightened by exaggerated music transitions surrealism overall filmmaking reinforces humorous mood it isnt high art but it possesses consistent craft therefore bobs burgers is fairly enjoyable experience viewers should expect skilled comedy decent emotions writing 7 10 direction 6 10 cinematography 8 10 acting 7 10 editing 8 10 sound 7 10 score soundtrack 8 10 production design 7 10 casting 7 10 effects 7 10overall score 7 2 10,0.4666091954022988,0.1537931034482759,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.46}"
5,It's like a long BB episode,"A few jokes (not a lot), some danger/action (do you really think they're going to die?), and songs (too many).

6,Fun but I expected more,"I enjoyed it, but felt I could have waited for it to come to TV.A few of the most beloved and funniest characters were missing, most notably Gayle. It felt like they concentrated too much on making big thrilling action where I would have preferred to see more character drama, as the characters are what make the show so loveable. They did do some with Louise's character and I enjoyed that.There were funny parts but very few that made me actually laugh out loud like the TV show does. Seemed like they could have let loose a little more and be more ""themselves"", rather than trying so hard to be movie-ish, if that makes sense.",fun but i expected more,i enjoyed it but felt i could have waited it come tv few most beloved funniest characters were missing most notably gayle it felt like they concentrated too much making big thrilling action where i would have preferred see more character drama as characters are what make show so loveable they did do some with louises character i enjoyed that there were funny parts but very few that made me actually laugh out loud like tv show does seemed like they could have let loose little more be more themselves rather than trying so hard be movie ish if that makes sense,0.4556358974358975,0.21535641025641028,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9,Incredibly enjoyable animated film!,"As a long time Bob's Burgers fan, this was such a fun movie. If you watched season 12, you'll see the cracks in the sidewalk start to form which is a nice detail leading up to this movie. Music numbers were great and comedy held up nicely. There was one slightly dull moment towards the end but didn't affect the quality of the movie at all. Fun whether you've seen the show or not. But definitely watch the show.
