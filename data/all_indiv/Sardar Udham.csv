10,Perfect is not just a word for Sardar Udham,"Shoojit Sircar showed us once again how a biopic should be made, and the level of Sardar Udham waa extraordinary. Vicky Kaushal is a rising star and his role of Sardar Udham showed us why he is a great contender for Bollywood's future.A dark tale of an individual, fighting for the freedom of the nation, in a different way, in a different nation is enthralling and at the same time, emotional and captivating as well. With a brilliant cinematography and strong dialogues added with terrific acting, Sardar Udham can be claimed as one of the best biopic on a freedom fighter that has ever been made.Hats off to the team of Sardar Udham, Shoojit Sircar, Vicky Kaushal and the entire cast that brought out such an outstanding example of Indian cinema with a compelling story about the struggles we had for the freedom of our nation.

10,The third act broke me permanently,"This is not an easy movie to recommend. I was on the verge of turning it off unable to take it any more but out of respect, somehow kept going. Never ever has Jallianwala Baug massacre portrayed this way in history of cinema. This is however the most important film to come out in recent times.Yes this is about Sardar Udham Sign but it is also about millions of Indians who sacrificed themselves for the freedom we enjoy in modern India and take it for granted. It is very intelligently written, the production design is on a level Bollywood hasn't seen in a long long time. The sound design and background score is skillfully done and the editing is just how I like it. Shoojit Sircar has obviously worked with DoP to capture every frame masterfully. Technically this is near perfect.I would've given minus stars but didn't have heart to give it to the marketing department, producers and distributors. This movie should be screened in all the film festivals and has potential to be India's oscar entry for this year. Wake up people.Finally, I just want to say this movie should also be in British high school curriculum. Of course, it's wishful thinking.",third act broke me permanently,this is not easy movie recommend i was verge turning it off unable take it any more but out respect somehow kept going never ever has jallianwala baug massacre portrayed this way history cinema this is however most important film come out recent times yes this is about sardar udham sign but it is also about millions indians who sacrificed themselves freedom we enjoy modern india take it granted it is very intelligently written production design is level bollywood hasnt seen long long time sound design background score is skillfully done editing is just how i like it shoojit sircar has obviously worked with dop capture every frame masterfully technically this is near perfect i wouldve given minus stars but didnt have heart give it marketing department producers distributors this movie should be screened all film festivals has potential be indias oscar entry this year wake up people finally i just want say this movie should also be british high school curriculum course its wishful thinking,0.5101515151515152,0.17015151515151516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"

10,Vicky Kaushal's Sardar Udham Is A Ticking Time Bomb Waiting To Explode !!!,"The film pays tribute to an unsung hero - Sardar Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal), an Indian revolutionary, who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London (in 1940), to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (of 1919). The former British colonial official was the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab (British India) at the time. Dwyer had said the killing of hundreds of protesters during a demonstration at Jallianwala Bagh in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, was justified.First things first - If you are looking for a talky film that can light the revolutionary fire in you, 'Sardar Udham' isn't it. Do not expect hard-hitting dialoguebaazi or emotional outbursts. The pre-independence drama based on true events, is a simmering observation of a man consumed by grief. The protagonist makes numbing pain his strength and silence, his voice. Loss and despair are so overpowering that avenging the barbaric crime he witnessed in his 20's, becomes the only reason for his existence, even 20 years later.Set at the onset of World War II, the film shuttles between past and present. The canvas is massive but meaty source material on the titular character, meagre. None of Udham Singh's chest-thumping slogans or writings (if any) was found. Here was a man, deeply scarred, who went about doing his job quietly. The challenge was to then connect the dots with whatever little information available and get into his psyche. Shoojit Sircar tries to decode the 'why' and not just how he ended up doing what he did. The aim is to understand the emotional arc of an innocent boy from Amristar who wouldn't hold a gun, let alone firing one. What led him to fire at Dwyer from point-blank range and not flee the spot? Was it driven by revenge? Why harbour the pain for two decades and not move on for good? Why is the same person a revolutionary and terrorist for different people?Shoojit SIrcar doesn't take a myopic look at heroism or freedom. His hero doesn't seem invincible or hero-like. Udham Singh didn't hate a man or his country who spurred the massacre. His fight was against the British ideology of conquering others' right to speak and live freely. Through an exhausting runtime of 2 Hr 42 Mins, Shoojit makes us meet Udham, a stoical man on a mission. He moves like a shadow, relentless in his pursuit of Dwyer and freedom from the oppressive British rule. For the longest time, we solely become a spectator of his painstaking journey. We don't feel invested enough. We see him landing odd jobs in London and being the centre of various unremarkable events leading up to the assassination.As much as we anticipate the volcano of his past to erupt eventually, the road to that heart-wrenching climax is tedious. Underplaying is an effective tool as long as it doesn't underwhelm. This film is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode but beware; the wait tries your patience. The intention is to give a lull before the storm treatment to storytelling. Silence is amplified so when Udham's inner turmoil finds an outlet, the impact reaches a crescendo. It's cleverly thought out but the execution yields mixed results. The non-linear, non-verbose narrative struggles to hold your attention even an hour into the movie. The re-enactment of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is unsettling to watch and that is the very reason why this story needed to be told.Vicky Kaushal as Sardar Udham dips his toes into uncharted waters. He tries his best to get unspoken words across but a film like this needed an Irrfan to speak through his eyes. You can trust a seasoned actor to elevate portions that demand stillness. Vicky is remarkable in certain scenes though. A drunk scene in particular, his 20 something portrayal and his climactic conversation with a British investigator extract the best out of him as an actor. Him wondering, ""Mere jawani ka koi matlab bana?"" is heart-breaking. The writing tries to avoid clichés but ends up sounding contemporary instead. Bhagat Singh's Hinglish dialogues like, ""Hum sirf exploitation ke against hai. Humein semi-independence nahi chahiye,"" sound out of place given the setting. The line that stays with you is Udham reminiscing his turbulent past and asking a British officer, ""What were you doing when you were 23?""Sardar Udham's courage never roared. It whispered. This freedom fighter traversed continents, used aliases and lied low throughout his life. He was too possessed by his singular quest for equality to make a noise. If you are as passionately curious about his quiet existence, this film is for you.",vicky kaushals sardar udham is ticking time bomb waiting explode,film pays tribute unsung hero sardar udham singh vicky kaushal indian revolutionary who assassinated michael odwyer london 1940 avenge jallianwala bagh massacre 1919 former british colonial official was lieutenant governor punjab british india at time dwyer had said killing hundreds protesters during demonstration at jallianwala bagh city amritsar punjab was justified first things first if you are looking talky film that can light revolutionary fire you sardar udham isnt it do not expect hard hitting dialoguebaazi or emotional outbursts pre independence drama based true events is simmering observation man consumed by grief protagonist makes numbing pain his strength silence his voice loss despair are so overpowering that avenging barbaric crime he witnessed his 20s becomes only reason his existence even 20 years later set at onset world war ii film shuttles between past present canvas is massive but meaty source material titular character meagre none udham singhs chest thumping slogans or writings if any was found here was man deeply scarred who went about doing his job quietly challenge was then connect dots with whatever little information available get into his psyche shoojit sircar tries decode why not just how he ended up doing what he did aim is understand emotional arc innocent boy amristar who wouldnt hold gun let alone firing one what led him fire at dwyer point blank range not flee spot was it driven by revenge why harbour pain two decades not move good why is same person revolutionary terrorist different people shoojit sircar doesnt take myopic look at heroism or freedom his hero doesnt seem invincible or hero like udham singh didnt hate man or his country who spurred massacre his fight was against british ideology conquering others right speak live freely through exhausting runtime 2 hr 42 mins shoojit makes us meet udham stoical man mission he moves like shadow relentless his pursuit dwyer freedom oppressive british rule longest time we solely become spectator his painstaking journey we dont feel invested enough we see him landing odd jobs london being centre various unremarkable events leading up assassination as much as we anticipate volcano his past erupt eventually road that heart wrenching climax is tedious underplaying is effective tool as long as it doesnt underwhelm this film is ticking time bomb waiting explode but beware wait tries your patience intention is give lull before storm treatment storytelling silence is amplified so when udhams inner turmoil finds outlet impact reaches crescendo its cleverly thought out but execution yields mixed results non linear non verbose narrative struggles hold your attention even hour into movie re enactment jallianwala bagh massacre is unsettling watch that is very reason why this story needed be told vicky kaushal as sardar udham dips his toes into uncharted waters he tries his best get unspoken words across but film like this needed irrfan speak through his eyes you can trust seasoned actor elevate portions that demand stillness vicky is remarkable certain scenes though drunk scene particular his 20 something portrayal his climactic conversation with british investigator extract best out him as actor him wondering mere jawani ka koi matlab bana is heart breaking writing tries avoid clich s but ends up sounding contemporary instead bhagat singhs hinglish dialogues like hum sirf exploitation ke against hai humein semi independence nahi chahiye sound out place given setting line that stays with you is udham reminiscing his turbulent past asking british officer what were you doing when you were 23 sardar udhams courage never roared it whispered this freedom fighter traversed continents used aliases lied low throughout his life he was too possessed by his singular quest equality make noise if you are as passionately curious about his quiet existence this film is you,0.4239872068230277,0.049858661239258244,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,Don't fall for the negative reviews,"I watched this movie on Prime and would say, it was worth an effort from director, creators and of course, actors.It's slow burn but never fall short of the subject matter or the descriptions. Every character is given ample amount of time, every scene is elaborated and the whole focus remains upon the subject. The creators have played the dice to showcase the actual events in reverse order, however, keeping in mind that no sequence remains unsitched.Moreover, I liked the depection of the first part of the 20th century, that is the locations, costumes, habits etc.Saying so, yaa, I did feel that in some places, it could have been a bit fast in pace and skipped a few incidents so as to reduce the time from 2 hrs 45 mins to like 2 hrs and 20 mins here and there. And that's where I would cut 2 points. But, a very good film and definitely watchable.

8,Shoojit Sircar's best.,"Sardar Udham review :Of all the movies Shoojit Sircar has made till date, this has to be the most technically brilliant one. Capturing the landscape from Amristar to London, the shots appear like a beautiful painting on celluloid. The art design, recreating the 1930s and early '40s when most of this film is based, is top class. Sardar Udham is also the most unconventional historical movie made in Indian cinema. If you are looking for entertainment or patriotic jingoism here, sorry but this is just not the movie for you!!Indeed, Sardar Udham is a highly realistic and at times, harrowing depiction of the relatively unknown freedom fighter who decides to avenge the Jallianwala Baug massacre. Travelling all the way to London to execute the two officials responsible for the most inhuman act in British India, Udham Singh takes a long time to execute his plan. But he is successful at the end.Narrated non-linearly, the film may get tad difficult for the aam junta not used to such treatment as well as those who are not so well versed with the historical events of that period specially those second world war references and the communists' role in it. Udham Singh's torture scenes in British jail are also extremely discomforting to watch.Vicky Kaushal, in the titular role, delivers his career best performance. This one deserves a National award, no less!! Kirsty Averton as Eileen Palmer, Udham's sympathizer from the local Communist party, is a standout. The other firangi actors are earnest and thankfully, talk in English instead of that oh-so-familiar accented Hindi patented by Bob Christo.Sardar Udham reaches its pinnacle in the last forty minutes dedicated to the Jallianwala Baug tragedy. I have read and seen this event many times before but trust me, was never ever shaken so much!! It is a heart wrenching watch sure to move you to tears.Finally, films like Sardar Udham need to be made and the sacrifice of these great freedom fighters deserve much more attention than just a footnote accorded to them in our school history books.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",shoojit sircars best,sardar udham review all movies shoojit sircar has made till date this has be most technically brilliant one capturing landscape amristar london shots appear like beautiful painting celluloid art design recreating 1930s early 40s when most this film is based is top class sardar udham is also most unconventional historical movie made indian cinema if you are looking entertainment or patriotic jingoism here sorry but this is just not movie you indeed sardar udham is highly realistic at times harrowing depiction relatively unknown freedom fighter who decides avenge jallianwala baug massacre travelling all way london execute two officials responsible most inhuman act british india udham singh takes long time execute his plan but he is successful at end narrated non linearly film may get tad difficult aam junta not used such treatment as well as those who are not so well versed with historical events that period specially those second world war references communists role it udham singhs torture scenes british jail are also extremely discomforting watch vicky kaushal titular role delivers his career best performance this one deserves national award no less kirsty averton as eileen palmer udhams sympathizer local communist party is standout other firangi actors are earnest thankfully talk english instead that oh so familiar accented hindi patented by bob christo sardar udham reaches its pinnacle last forty minutes dedicated jallianwala baug tragedy i have read seen this event many times before but trust me was never ever shaken so much it is heart wrenching watch sure move you tears finally films like sardar udham need be made sacrifice these great freedom fighters deserve much more attention than just footnote accorded them our school history books regards sumeet nadkarni,0.4423585673585673,0.2405677655677656,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
7,"Yes, bollywood can make a patriotic film far away from dramatic jigoism like Hollywood Classics Patton and Schindler's List and Sardar Udham is our first impactful attempt.","Sardar Udham (2021) : Movie Review -I am not gonna write a regular review for this one which combines things like acting, writing, screenplay, music and direction because i don't really think this is a film made to glorify that hardcore patriotism from India's history. Making a commercial jiongism patterns like 'Border' (1997), 'Uri' (2019), and 'Shershaah' (2021) is easy and safe because you that our massy audience will fall for patriotic emotions and will forgive cinematic mistakes. But making a relevant and thought-provoking film like 'Haqeeqat' is still a dream for new generation filmmakers. Sardar Udham is high-end triggering drama with strong flavour of Shoojit Sircar style. Those who are expecting a quality cinema and are ready to wait for a while are welcome and those who want to whistle and scream during mass sequences are prohibited from viewing this movie. Sardar Udham is typical Shoojit Sircar style slow burn but moreover it attempts to rediscover patriotic biographical genre in Indian Cinema on the level of what Hollywood did with film like 'Patton' (1970) and 'Schindler's List' (1993).Jalianwala Bagh massacre is one of the most brutal events ever happened in the 20th century in any corner of the world. But how many times it has made you feel that pain even today except for Anniversary trends on social media and few glimpses in any freedom fighter's biopic in Indian Cinema? We have seen this particular event in many biopics from Bhagat Singh to Gandhi to Sardar Patel and few more but Sardar Udham is probably the only film which has made a big issue out of it to create an entire plot affected by that terrible masscare. I remember watching Soviet Filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's film which showed one of that Russian Massacre in Brutal manners and who on earth knew that those scenes from a silent film made in 1920s decade would remain the most astonishing massacre scenes in cinema history. Sardar Udham might just become that for Bollywood Cinema. Especially those last 40 minutes where you feel the pain of Udham, a teenager, who didn't really understand what just happened and it kept him torturing for 2 decades. Finally, he took the revenge and yet it feels like a soft punishment because you hate British empire so much that even shooting a man dead in front of 50 people feels so less. British had killed hundreds brutally in Jalianwala Bagh massacre and any toughest punishment in the world can't justify that. Sardar Udham is about this ideology, not a revenge. There are thousands of revenge in the history of India but not all them became universal ideologies.One of the best thing i noticed in Sardar Udham is it shows that fatal state of mind British government during world war 2. You see, World War 2 is one of the major reason behind India's independence but our historians and filmmakers have always overlooked this fact. You gotta know that British saw it coming back what they did to India. In this movie there is a quote to explain this- ""Germany calling. The sun finally seems to setting at British Empire. Like an elephant, Indians never forget their enemies"" and the next two scenes when Udham Singh questions the Law twice, once in Courtroom before Judge and once during investigation in front of detective. Do you remember any Bollywood Film going in such details about ideology and morals? Leave that topic for further arguments later.So, overall Sardar Udham is quite a break from commercial potboilers and there are many reasons to make it a Must See in your watchlist as a true quality cinema lover. However, couple of flaws needs to be bashed equally as i praised good things. The film starts very slow, it looks scattered and irrelevant sometimes but maybe that's because the story of Udham never has enough documents and events available in public domain. I won't say much about acting and other aspects as said in the beginning but for Vicky Kaushal I say one thing that he has completely surrendered himself to director's uncompromised vision. I won't be surprised to see him taking a bunch of trophies home after the award ceremonies next year. Shoojit Sir, you have attempted something revolutionary and respect you for that. Nevertheless, i still say it could have been little better or a certain Classic. It misses that Mark by few inches though. Rest, highly recommended.

8,Vicky Kaushal's monumental performance does justice to the tale of a legendary freedom fighter!,"Shoojit Sircar delivers yet another nuanced, offbeat yet impactful cinema experience after Vicky Donor (2012), Madras Cafe (2013) and Piku (2015) in Udham Singh, riding on an immense performance from Vicky Kaushal.The biopic tells us the relatively unknown tale of Shaheed-i-Azam ('greatest of martyrs') Sardar Udham Singh, who gunned down one of the perpetrators of the Jalianwala Bagh massacre, Michael O'Dwyer, audaciously in the center of London.A harrowing character portrayal of a man scarred by the massacre of his people, Vicky Kaushal delves deep into the anguish, the motivations and the resolve of the legendary freedom fighter, portraying each stage of his life with dignified conviction.A story that would be unbelievable if it were not true, the film shows us the steely determination of a freedom fighter hell bent on revenge, who embarks on a perilous journey through Afghanistan and USSR to strike at his enemy's heart in London.The film never meanders to jingoistic levels instead quietly yet profoundly putting across the messages of freedom and equality propagated by Udham and a fantastic Amol Parashar who essays the role of Shaheed Bhagat Singh.Director Sircar has taken an unconventional non-linear narrative style, a format rarely used in nationalistic films. He leverages it to astutely put across not just the freedom fighter's perspectives but that also of the British administration.While the British officers are often portrayed as evil, maniacal tropes in most freedom fighter movies, Sircar again refuses to follow the norm. Shaun Scott is terrific as the banal, even dispassionate Michael O'Dwyer while Stephen Hogan is impactful as the detective charged with extracting Udham's confession.Sardar Udham is a firm reminder that our country's freedom was won by a group of men and women who were made of sterner stuff, who sacrificed everything for their motherland.The film, at 2 hours and 42 minutes will require a patient watch. But I promise you, the experience is well worth it.

10,A Masterpiece!,I just finished watching Sardar Udham streaming on Amazon Prime. To be honest I was a bit skeptical about the film's length and the pacing as brought up in most of the critic reviews. After watching the film I can safely say without a doubt that it is a masterpiece!Sardar Udham proves yet again that Shoojit Sircar is one of the finest storytellers of our times and with this one he has delivered not only his best but one of the best films in recent times. Sircar along with his leading man Vicky Kaushal pays a befitting tribute to the revolutionary freedom fighter Sardar Udham Singh. Vicky Kaushal gives a powerful performance here and is simply stunning in the sequences showing the aftermath of Jallianwala.I was in tears during the last one hour when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is shown. I haven't seen anything this heart wrenching in a long time. The effective screenwriting and brilliant performances keep you hooked inspite of a running time of 162 minutes. Not to forget the background score and cinematography which add on to the brilliance of this film.I really hope this film is elected as India's official Oscar entry next year. Don't miss this one for anything.

8,"Shoojit Sircar, Take a bow!","""Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all"" - Bhagat SinghWow! What an incredible piece of Cinema I have just been a witness of! I'm truly captivated by Sircar's direction and the way he addressed such a heroic act of patriotism. And I can't convey enough appreciation for representing such a fairly unknown story of the Martyr, Udham Singh; who against all the odds made the impossible. He shook the British empire to its core and sent out a decisive statement against their heinous colonialism.From a technical stance alone, I must admit, this was something very special! I had never seen a historical drama on such an enormous scale before. From the detailed set designs to the astounding Cinematography, the commendable art direction to the world-building; it has every right to be considered as a landmark in Indian filmography. Trust me, supervising any sets with that many people and intricacies; it's easier said than done. And this gets even more fascinating when you consider the restricted expenditures!Likewise, the performances leave quite an impression. Amongst the entire cast, Vicky Kaushal's act indisputably draws our attention the most. Particularly, towards the end. Where, in my opinion; he gives his absolute best. Speaking of the rest of the ensemble, I was amazed to observe such a capable group of foreign nationals playing their roles with utmost affection and integrity!My only criticisms are in regards to the comparatively long-winded screenplay and its Non-linear structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for Non-linear storytelling, but I'm not sure whether it was an absolute necessity in this case.Even though I gotta say, that whole Jallianwala Bagh massacre sequence is no less than a cinematic brilliance. No matter, how tough you deem yourself to be, remember the words; it's gonna break your heart. If it was up to me, I would have probably inaugurated the film with this portion rather than placing it near the climax. That way, I guess the impact would have been far greater.Lastly, I just wanna thank all the people who have contributed to such an ambitious endeavour and I wanna give my regards to Mr Shoojit Sircar as he's done plentiful to denote the atrocities of British Imperialism. Innumerable manslaughters, abscondings, tortures; the British without any question, shares a dark & sinful past with our country and its people.My heartiest admiration goes to all the martyrs and their families who sacrificed everything just to break the shackles and to get our much-awaited Sovereignty & Freedom. And most importantly they did all that while being unified, irrespective of class, religion or Identity.Today's generation should learn a thing or two!",shoojit sircar take bow,revolution is inalienable right mankind freedom is imperishable birthright all bhagat singhwow what incredible piece cinema i have just been witness im truly captivated by sircars direction way he addressed such heroic act patriotism i cant convey enough appreciation representing such fairly unknown story martyr udham singh who against all odds made impossible he shook british empire its core sent out decisive statement against their heinous colonialism technical stance alone i must admit this was something very special i had never seen historical drama such enormous scale before detailed set designs astounding cinematography commendable art direction world building it has every right be considered as landmark indian filmography trust me supervising any sets with that many people intricacies its easier said than done this gets even more fascinating when you consider restricted expenditures likewise performances leave quite impression amongst entire cast vicky kaushals act indisputably draws our attention most particularly towards end where my opinion he gives his absolute best speaking rest ensemble i was amazed observe such capable group foreign nationals playing their roles with utmost affection integrity my only criticisms are regards comparatively long winded screenplay its non linear structure dont get me wrong im all up non linear storytelling but im not sure whether it was absolute necessity this case even though i gotta say that whole jallianwala bagh massacre sequence is no less than cinematic brilliance no matter how tough you deem yourself be remember words its gonna break your heart if it was up me i would have probably inaugurated film with this portion rather than placing it near climax that way i guess impact would have been far greater lastly i just wanna thank all people who have contributed such ambitious endeavour i wanna give my regards mr shoojit sircar as hes done plentiful denote atrocities british imperialism innumerable manslaughters abscondings tortures british without any question shares dark sinful past with our country its people my heartiest admiration goes all martyrs their families who sacrificed everything just break shackles get our much awaited sovereignty freedom most importantly they did all that while being unified irrespective class religion or identity todays generation should learn thing or two,0.5330634920634919,0.1491031746031746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.49}"

10,A unique presentation!,"When Bollywood makes biopics, they tend to follow that one route --> start from childhood, show him/her rise and then show the events that follow. Shoojit Sircar is different and so are his films including SARDAR UDHAM.This film begins on a different note. It starts from mid way of Udham's life and moves forward from there and what follows is all events being slowly unraveled through investigations and through udham singh's confessions. It takes a different non linear way of presenting the events rather than the stereotypical cliche bollywood style.YES IT IS SLOW BUT YOU DONT HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COMPLAIN! If you are new to watching Shoojit's films dare not complain instead go watch his previous works first but if you are a follower of his films, you wont complain as you know you are well prepared for a film of this pace.Set designs --> havent seen such in Bollywood ever. Straight out of a Hollywood production house it seems like. Brilliant! Vicky Kaushal doesnt really have too many dialogues he's almost like a silent killer. His emotions his eyes do the talking.At 2hr 40 mins, the level of detailing is phenomenal. Making a film with lots of trivia detailing like the radio talking about Irish revolution, WW2 etc is very difficult considering your main topic is different but it sets up the mood right and makes sure you feel you are in the 1930s. Some details about Bhagat Singh's movement are there too.Undoubtedly the most haunting part comes in the last 1 hour. Brace yourselves for the long sequence that comes in the last 1 hour.Vicky as i talked has done a good job! Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh is okayish we have seen better portrayals in other films dedicated to him completely . Banita Sandhu is only in a cameo in a forced love angle that the film could have avoided or i really dont know if it was true.AN UNMISSABLE FILM!",unique presentation,when bollywood makes biopics they tend follow that one route start childhood show him her rise then show events that follow shoojit sircar is different so are his films including sardar udham this film begins different note it starts mid way udhams life moves forward there what follows is all events being slowly unraveled through investigations through udham singhs confessions it takes different non linear way presenting events rather than stereotypical cliche bollywood style yes it is slow but you dont have audacity complain if you are new watching shoojits films dare not complain instead go watch his previous works first but if you are follower his films you wont complain as you know you are well prepared film this pace set designs havent seen such bollywood ever straight out hollywood production house it seems like brilliant vicky kaushal doesnt really have too many dialogues hes almost like silent killer his emotions his eyes do talking at 2hr 40 mins level detailing is phenomenal making film with lots trivia detailing like radio talking about irish revolution ww2 etc is very difficult considering your main topic is different but it sets up mood right makes sure you feel you are 1930s some details about bhagat singhs movement are there too undoubtedly most haunting part comes last 1 hour brace yourselves long sequence that comes last 1 hour vicky as i talked has done good job amol parashar as bhagat singh is okayish we have seen better portrayals other films dedicated him completely banita sandhu is only cameo forced love angle that film could have avoided or i really dont know if it was true unmissable film,0.4775896025896026,0.12086697086697087,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"
