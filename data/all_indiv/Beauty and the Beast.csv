10.0,Be our guest,"Beauty and the Beast is without a doubt one of Disney's finest classics. The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination. Beauty and the Beast is going to be one of those films that will always be remembered, I know that it's a movie that I will show my children one day. It has unbelievably terrific animation, a beautiful story, lovable characters, and is just over all a perfect movie. I really love this film so much, I don't think anyone couldn't fall in love with it.Bell is just a simple girl in her town in France, she reads books constantly and her father is an inventor. They are sort of the outcasts of their town due to their ""oddness"". But Bell is being pursued by the town hunk, Gueston, simply because she's the one girl he cannot have. One day when her father's inventions are about to be displayed at the fair, he gets lost in the woods and stumbles across a castle and is held prisoner. Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts. Bell trades places with her father; the house also has living objects, a candle holder, a clock, a tea pot, all who are also cursed until the curse is broken. They look at Bell as the perfect opportunity for the beast to find a true love, but he must learn to be a gentleman, but Bell brings out the best in him and it turns out that this might be a happy ending after all.This was actually the first movie that I ever cried in, the ending was just so beautiful and heart felt, you'll have to see what I mean. The songs are just so lovely and perfect for the scenes that they are performed for. Beauty and the Beast, the song, was just one of the most touching songs ever. This films is a major recommendation for me, it's one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's a timeless classic that is just perfect and reached a new level of great animation.10/10",be our guest,beauty beast is without doubt one disneys finest classics first animated film ever be nominated best picture after you see it you could understand agree with its nomination beauty beast is going be one those films that will always be remembered i know that its movie that i will show my children one day it has unbelievably terrific animation beautiful story lovable characters is just over all perfect movie i really love this film so much i dont think anyone couldnt fall love with it bell is just simple girl her town france she reads books constantly her father is inventor they are sort outcasts their town due their oddness but bell is being pursued by town hunk gueston simply because shes one girl he cannot have one day when her fathers inventions are about be displayed at fair he gets lost woods stumbles across castle is held prisoner bell goes after him comes castle it turns out that her father is being held by beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds true love before rose he has welts bell trades places with her father house also has living objects candle holder clock tea pot all who are also cursed until curse is broken they look at bell as perfect opportunity beast find true love but he must learn be gentleman but bell brings out best him it turns out that this might be happy ending after all this was actually first movie that i ever cried ending was just so beautiful heart felt youll have see what i mean songs are just so lovely perfect scenes that they are performed beauty beast song was just one most touching songs ever this films is major recommendation me its one my favorite disney films all time its timeless classic that is just perfect reached new level great animation 10 10,0.629111050986051,0.44522306397306394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10.0,One of my all-time favourite movies.,"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one ""Beauty and the Beast"" is worth a thousand ""Akira""s. And ""Shrek""s. And, I'm willing to bet, ""Treasure Planet""s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - this is the real best picture of 1991.",one my all time favourite movies,only animated movie receive best picture oscar nomination it deserved it magic opening prologue final credit beauty beast is last real classic come disney crew before john lasseter came along this was one few movies i happily paid see twice cinema sitting sparsely populated friday night audience i was living barbados at time it was hardly most artistic place earth it was crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while home alone 2 went through roof second time magic remained you all know story so apart pointing out movies one flaw princes spell had be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain beast forever so if it was cast ten years before events movie wouldnt that mean he was 11 when spell was cast lets look at how well movie works you have monster whos more human than movies medallion man villain you have heroine whos pc but engaging with it you have supporting cast magic utensils who wisely never upstage couple at centre this love story despite disney animated trappings it is love story you have captivating story beautifully told movies also got wonderful design its french setting characters with ballroom scene standout tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by sight beast belle their evening wear only time ive ever seen cartoon characters get wolf whistled cinema alan menkens score is his finest work mouse with matchless lyrics late much lamented howard ashman how many musicals can you name where all songs are brilliant but ultimately its movies very real heart that makes it keeper cliche youll laugh youll cry is all too true this case lot movies called classic dont deserve that appellation but this one does ill be slaughtered by anime fans but what hell one beauty beast is worth thousand akira s shrek s im willing bet treasure planet s this is truly adult animated feature thats also one entire family forget silence lambs this is real best picture 1991,0.59015625,0.25532986111111106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Perfect mix of music and animation...a solid achievement...,"I've not seen the newly added song sequence (Human Again) featured in the latest IMAX version so my comments are based entirely on the original theatrical and VHS release.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is Disney at its peak. From the stained glass window at the opening and the beautiful narration, the viewer is drawn into the story by the appealing music and clever lyrics (""Belle's Song"") which gets the picture off to a bouncy start. The opening sequence showing Belle and the townspeople in song is masterfully handled and choreographed for maximum effect, setting the tone for the entire story.The plot becomes thicker once Belle's father enters the castle grounds where the Beast resides. The castle interiors are brilliantly Baroque and the odd characters inhabiting the grounds are delightfully rendered by a perfect blending of art and voice talent. Cogsworth, Lumiere and Mrs. Potts are delightful creations, each with strong, consistent personalities. David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury cannot be praised enough for their contributions. Two of the musical highlights are Orbach's dazzling job on ""Be My Guest"" (with French accent) and Angela's tender rendering of the title song, ""Beauty and the Beast"". Unforgettable movie moments. As Gaston, Richard White's robust baritone voice adds greatly to the effectiveness of his villainy.It's no wonder the film was the first to receive recognition by the Academy with a Best Picture nomination. Outstanding in every department, including the end title song sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson in a more ""modern"" style. Along with SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY, a top-notch fairy tale with its appeal evenly divided between adults and children--as well as the child in all of us.",perfect mix music animation solid achievement,ive not seen newly added song sequence human again featured latest imax version so my comments are based entirely original theatrical vhs release beauty beast is disney at its peak stained glass window at opening beautiful narration viewer is drawn into story by appealing music clever lyrics belles song which gets picture off bouncy start opening sequence showing belle townspeople song is masterfully handled choreographed maximum effect setting tone entire story plot becomes thicker once belles father enters castle grounds where beast resides castle interiors are brilliantly baroque odd characters inhabiting grounds are delightfully rendered by perfect blending art voice talent cogsworth lumiere mrs potts are delightful creations each with strong consistent personalities david ogden stiers jerry orbach angela lansbury cannot be praised enough their contributions two musical highlights are orbachs dazzling job be my guest with french accent angelas tender rendering title song beauty beast unforgettable movie moments as gaston richard whites robust baritone voice adds greatly effectiveness his villainy its no wonder film was first receive recognition by academy with best picture nomination outstanding every department including end title song sung by celine dion peabo bryson more modern style along with snow white sleeping beauty top notch fairy tale with its appeal evenly divided between adults children as well as child all us,0.5798295454545455,0.44514678030303034,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.44}"
9.0,A Transporting Experience,"Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply: love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.' And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale. When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return. And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation. 	The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything. Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep. Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey. Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him: If he will release her father, she will stay in his place. The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever. And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed. The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.	With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts. There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it. It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly. A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year). 	The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster). There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made: As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed. And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away. It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why `Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's all time greatest films. 	One final note: Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience. It's all a part of the magic of the movies. I rate this one 9/10.",transporting experience,indeed its tale as old as time with complex message that is as ageless as it is universal but beneath all layers it can be summed up very simply love one another refrain judging others who seem be different leave it disney present it such way that it can be embraced understood by young old alike as they have here one their best animated features ever beauty beast directed by gary trousdale when young prince fails test enchantress disguised as old hag she transforms him into hideous beast as he is destined remain until he opens his heart learns how love be loved return so that hell know where he stands as time goes by she gives him enchanted rose which will bloom until his twenty first birthday he has only until last petal falls flower effect change within himself that will be his salvation beast however seems doomed as he shuts himself away alone his castle taking up reclusive existence far everyone everything until one day beautiful young woman named belle shows up at his doorstep belle is searching her inventor father maurice who disappeared while taking one his latest inventions fair his trail leads belle castle beast where she discovers he is being held prisoner having run afoul beast by trespassing while lost during night his journey repulsed by appearance beast belle nevertheless strikes bargain with him if he will release her father she will stay his place beast agrees with stipulation that she must remain with him forever as beast casts belles father castle sends him his way belles fate seems sealed only hope now either belle or beast lies remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before last petal enchanted rose falls with help richly textured screenplay by linda woolverton that invests characters with depth humanity that is often lacking even non animated films oscar winning score by alan menken director trousdale provides some real insights into human nature this retelling familiar story how true love can change even darkest coldest hearts theres magic this film which holds enchantment its own message is presented ever so subtly with sensitivity that draws you gradually until you are so caught up story that you become immersed totally involved without being consciously aware it its film that enfolds you takes you where it will you go willingly beautifully rendered realized film that successfully transcends its genre it is first animated feature ever be recognized rewarded with oscar nomination best movie quite feat itself as it received nod over such films as fisher king fried green tomatoes thelma louise john singletons boyz n hood that year talented cast supplying voices characters includes paige ohara belle robby benson beast richard white gaston jerry orbach lumiere david ogden stiers cogsworth angela lansbury mrs potts bradley pierce chip rex everhart maurice jesse corti lefou hal smith phillipe jo ann worley wardrobe brian cummings stove alvin epstein bookseller kimmy robertson featherduster theres scene this film that is so entrancing so emotionally involving that it stands up against best any drama ever made as angela lansbury as mrs potts sings oscar winning title song belle begins perceive true nature man within beast its no longer cold hearted prince upon whom enchantress cast her spell because he has changed as they come together beast takes belle his arms sweeping her dance across elegant ballroom floor it becomes one those rare cinematic moments that are entirely transporting it does indeed take you away its memorable scene that exemplifies quality craftsmanship this film as does scene which beast is at last transformed that such emotion can be captured expressed animated film is exemplary accomplishment its all part why beauty beast is one disneys all time greatest films one final note stay credits hear alan menken howard ashmans title song once again this time performed by celine dion peabo bryson hypnotically beautiful this version has magic all its own makes perfect ending enchanting experience its all part magic movies i rate this one 9 10,0.6027777777777779,0.29734299516908214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Classy piece of animation,"When an arrogant Prince turns away an old woman looking for shelter with only a rose for a gift, she warns him not to just take the surface appearance as being the all of a person; however he rejects her a second time  only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful enchantress. She casts a spell on him, turning him into a beast with the only hope of return being to fall in love with a woman and have her fall in love with him before the rose wilts and dies. Resembling a carpet stuffed with walnuts, the prince figures he has no chance and withdraws into his castle. When an elderly man wanders into the castle, the Beast holds him prisoner and only lets him go when his daughter, Belle, offers to replace him in the Beast's castle. With time running out, the Beast's staff hope that Belle will be the one to break the curse but the Beast cannot remember how.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However with this film I was quite taken by how classy the whole affair was, with great effort being shown in every area from the animation, to the songs through to the emotionally involving story whose telling is touched with a nice sense of wonder throughout. The story doesn't really hit many bum notes (I thought Gaston's sidekick was a bit too obvious and half cooked) and it is interesting and enjoyable for the vast majority of the time. The story and comedy is aimed at both adults and children  but the stuff for kids is not basic pratfalls, nor is the adult material just a load of references or suggestive jokes. Instead the two are quite well blended with good physical comedy and plenty of wit. Again, it is the sense of spectacle and wonder that came through that I really appreciated.The animation feels more impressive for the reliance on mostly traditional animation rather than computer effects  in fact the computer effects look a bit dated now, even if they do still produce the goods in some key scenes. Mainly it is the feeling that every frame has had a lot of effort and love put into it that makes the whole affair feel classy. The songs are also great and feature quite a few memorable songs that stick in the mind; meanwhile the choreography of these scenes is generally very imaginative (Be Our Guest was my favourite). The cast don't feature many big stars and perhaps this is good because the real people don't distract from their characters. That said, I thought that Benson, O'Hara, White and a few others were quite unremarkable even if they were good enough for the film. Orbach, Stiers, Lansbury and others provided comic work in the support characters and everything worked well.Overall this is a really classy animated film that shows the effort and care put into it in many different regards. It does suffer a bit from cuteness and sentimentality but I didn't think this was a massive problem or something that was not to be expected from Disney and generally I really enjoyed the film and see it as one of the films that define Disney for people of my generation.",classy piece animation,when arrogant prince turns away old woman looking shelter with only rose gift she warns him not just take surface appearance as being all person however he rejects her second time only her reveal herself as beautiful enchantress she casts spell him turning him into beast with only hope return being fall love with woman have her fall love with him before rose wilts dies resembling carpet stuffed with walnuts prince figures he has no chance withdraws into his castle when elderly man wanders into castle beast holds him prisoner only lets him go when his daughter belle offers replace him beasts castle with time running out beasts staff hope that belle will be one break curse but beast cannot remember how being quite cynical acerbic person i must admit that i prefer modern animated films that deliver lots adult humour along with good emotional story often i struggle enjoy films that take more traditional disney route however with this film i was quite taken by how classy whole affair was with great effort being shown every area animation songs through emotionally involving story whose telling is touched with nice sense wonder throughout story doesnt really hit many bum notes i thought gastons sidekick was bit too obvious half cooked it is interesting enjoyable vast majority time story comedy is aimed at both adults children but stuff kids is not basic pratfalls nor is adult material just load references or suggestive jokes instead two are quite well blended with good physical comedy plenty wit again it is sense spectacle wonder that came through that i really appreciated animation feels more impressive reliance mostly traditional animation rather than computer effects fact computer effects look bit dated now even if they do still produce goods some key scenes mainly it is feeling that every frame has had lot effort love put into it that makes whole affair feel classy songs are also great feature quite few memorable songs that stick mind meanwhile choreography these scenes is generally very imaginative be our guest was my favourite cast dont feature many big stars perhaps this is good because real people dont distract their characters that said i thought that benson ohara white few others were quite unremarkable even if they were good enough film orbach stiers lansbury others provided comic work support characters everything worked well overall this is really classy animated film that shows effort care put into it many different regards it does suffer bit cuteness sentimentality but i didnt think this was massive problem or something that was not be expected disney generally i really enjoyed film see it as one films that define disney people my generation,0.5723917748917751,0.24818181818181811,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,One of Disney's Best!,"Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Gaston,' you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores.

10.0,Perfection.,"This is, without a doubt, the best film Disney ever made. Now that's saying a lot, as the studio also made ""Bambi"", ""Little Mermaid"" and many other great films. ""Beauty and the Beast"" represents everything they could do right in a movie. The music is fantastic and couldn't be better (mostly because many of the songs had a great sense of humor), the characters wonderful and the story promoted some of the most wonderful values you could want. Belle is a completely admirable young lady--and I was thrilled that my own daughters could watch her and learn about her strength and integrity. And, the film is fun--yet will also bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded viewer. Not surprisingly the film was nominated for Best Picture--it's just a shame that an animated film will probably never take home this Oscar.

10.0,One word=F-L-A-W-L-E-S-S!,"This movie is without doubt the best animated movie of all time. The artistry was perfect. I was spellbound at the animated sequences to the songs ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" especially. The characters were very well drawn, and because of the dark and colourful backgrounds, the film looked beautiful. The songs are fantastic. Another movie with great songs is ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""(which has the best beginning to a Disney movie). In fact, all the Alan Menken scores are brilliant, with the exception of Home On The Range, which is one of the weaker Disney efforts. My personal favourites, were the songs I just mentioned, and ""Gaston"" was great fun too. The incidental music was the best in any Disney movie, and that is the same with the other Menken scores. The music in the transformation of the Beast was phenomenal, as well as the animation, and reminded me of the last movement of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which is really frightening. Another Disney with great incidental music is ""The Lion King"". The story is quite simply one of the best love stories ever, and the characters are wonderful. Belle was voiced beautifully by Paige O'Hara, who has a beautiful singing voice. I love Belle, she is beautiful, clever and strong, and is one of the best Disney characters for those reasons. Gaston was made into a complex villain, and quite narcissistic(great idea Disney). When he was nasty he was quite frightening, and Richard White can really sing. Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers were really entertaining as Lumiere and Cogsworth,(I just love how witty, elegant and debonair Lumiere is) and Angela Lansbury gives a brilliant rendition of the title song. The best voice over was that of the Beast, who was very frightening, and there were some parts that were truly sensitive. Why are some people fussed about him as a human? Remember, true beauty comes from within. In conclusion, an essential to your Disney collection with a very poignant ending. 10/10.

9.0,The most beautiful love story ever told.,"'' The Beauty and The Beast'' is one of the greatest stories ever told and one of the best movies from Disney that I watched in my life. I always identified myself with Belle, the girl who does not belong the place where she is lives and also with a big taste of reading lots of books. Our story takes part in France in 18 century, and our main character Belle is the prettiest girl in the city she lives, being the object of the affection and interest of Gaston, an arrogant man that has the sympathy of the people of the region.(And also considered a big catch for the girls of the city)But Belle is not interested in him and always imagined her life different from the domestic life people always imagine for her.One day, Belle's father, an inventor, was going to sell one of his inventions and lost his ways, being attacked by wild animals and entering in a big dark mansion apparently without a owner. He stays there for a time, but soon the Beast comes up and attacks him,making him a prisoner in his castle.Belle stays worried and goes after her father in the mansion and there she sees the violent and awful beast who locked her father. She then makes a deal: Belle agrees to stay in the dark castle with the horrible beast in return to her father's freedom. But with the time, Belle is going to discover all the magic that is beyond the castle, including the talking objects and even a nice side that the Beast has.This story is very inspiring and very beautiful! =)",most beautiful love story ever told,beauty beast is one greatest stories ever told one best movies disney that i watched my life i always identified myself with belle girl who does not belong place where she is lives also with big taste reading lots books our story takes part france 18 century our main character belle is prettiest girl city she lives being object affection interest gaston arrogant man that has sympathy people region also considered big catch girls city but belle is not interested him always imagined her life different domestic life people always imagine her one day belles father inventor was going sell one his inventions lost his ways being attacked by wild animals entering big dark mansion apparently without owner he stays there time but soon beast comes up attacks him making him prisoner his castle belle stays worried goes after her father mansion there she sees violent awful beast who locked her father she then makes deal belle agrees stay dark castle with horrible beast return her fathers freedom but with time belle is going discover all magic that is beyond castle including talking objects even nice side that beast has this story is very inspiring very beautiful,0.5992753623188406,0.1605072463768116,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,Romantic Masterpiece: Disney's Greatest Film,"Beauty and the Beast (1991): Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Richard White, Rex Everhart, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Angela Lansbury, Jesse Corti, Bradley Pierce, Jo Anne Worley, Mary Kay Bergman, Kath Soucie Kimmy Robertson, Brian Cummings, Tony Jay, Alvin Epstein, Frank Welker, Scott Barnes, Bruce Adler, Jack Angel, Vanna Bonta....Disney entered the 1990's with ""Beauty and the Beast"", by far their most unabashedly romantic film and for many viewers, their all-time greatest achievement. There is so much to admire and love about this terrific film which was adored by the critics and hailed as an instant classic at the time of its release in 1991. It was so loved that it became the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The 18th century French fairy-tale is given a twist to cater to a more modern audience A selfish and heartless prince (Robby Benson) falls victim to an enchantress' curse and is transformed into a beast. His castle is bewitched and even his domestics are turned into household objects such as candelabras, clocks, feather dusters, teacups and kitchen utensils. Only the love of a woman can redeem the prince and only when she sees past the monster and into his humanity can he become human again. Enter Belle (Paige 0'Hara)the beautiful single daughter of an old and eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart) who lives in a small town in rural France. Belle stands out from the other townsfolk in her fondness for books, her individuality and her intellect. Bored of provincial life, she longs for ""adventure in the great wide somewhere"". She's pursued by Gaston (Richard White) a hunky but vain, self-absorbed and wicked hunter who wants to marry Belle and make her his ""trophy wife"". When Maurice sets off to sell his new invention to a fair, he becomes lost in the woods and stumbles into the Beast's castle. Before long he becomes his prisoner. Belle comes to the rescue but in order to save her father she must replace him as the Beast's prisoner. What ensues is a ""tale as old as time"". Despite his monstrousness, Belle learns to see past all that and in time tames the Beast herself. Their relationship is based on respect for one another as human beings, exemplified when Beast saves Belle's life and she in turn saves his. But it's not long before the villagers discover the Beast's existence and Gaston leads a murderous mob to attack the castle. The late Broadway singer Jerry Orbach provides comic relief as Lumiere, an amorous French candelabra and David Ogden Stiers portrays the stuffy British clock Cogsworth. Broadway icon and British actress Angela Lansbury portrays the kindly voice of reason, Mrs. Potts and young Bradley Pierce portrays her son Chip. Jesse Corti plays Lefou, Gaston's awkward and goofy sidekick. These minor characters, purely there for comic relief and cuteness, not only entertains younger audiences but they are so wonderfully portrayed by the actor's voices that even adults can enjoy them. It is through voices that can act as well as sing (Paige O'Hara, Richard White, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury are all Broadway singers) in harmony with a solid plot and superior animation that this film truly shines. Beauty and the Beast still ranks as Disney's all-time greatest after 16 years. In fact, Disney does not make films like this anymore, owing to the excess use of computer graphics which can often dominate the story itself. Shortly after the success of the film, a Broadway musical was made, one that is still enjoyed to this date. And this film contains many wonderful song numbers: ""Belle"" - a gossip song as the villagers follow Belle on her way to the bookstore, ""Gaston"" sung by Gaston and his drinking buddies in his honor, ""Be Our Guest"" as the enchanted castle's staff entertains Belle for dinner, ""Something There"" a duet sung by the leads as they begin to fall in love and the title song ""Beauty and the Beast"" sung by Mrs. Potts as the newfound friends waltz beneath an opulent chandelier. This romantic song was popularized when a young Celine Dion, not yet a major star, sang a duet with Peabo Bryson for the soundtrack. With its theme of beauty found within, a woman's courage and virtue rewarded, the movie is also a sort of women's empowerment film for girls. Belle, the first Disney princess of the 90's, is strong, resourceful and dares to be different. Far from being a damsel in distress, it is she who rescues the Beast from doom and fights the villain Gaston by firmly renouncing him as a lover. Brilliant music and songs by Alan Menken and a splendid cinematography that used stunning computer-graphic art for such scenes as the ballroom waltz, this film was ahead of its time and marked the beginning of the great Disney films of the 90's - Aladdin, Lion King, Pocahontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame and others, all which used special effects made of computer graphic art. For this film, animators drew inspiration from Romantic 19th century art(Fragonard and Bouche) and from Loire Valley castles. Animators also drew from Cocteau's 1946 live-action version. The look of this film, the attention to detail, is a real winner and it's a pity that Disney does not return to pure animation. For me, this is the zenith of Disney animation and a representation of classic Disney at its best in the 1990's. This is a wonderful film for both young and old and looks as great as it ever did, thanks to restorations as seen on the new DVD version, where you can enjoy seeing how the film was made and scenes that were never part of the original theatrical release.

Then in 1941, the Academy gave ""Fantasia"" a couple of special awards as another watermark animated film. ""Beauty and the Beast"" deserves to stand along side both of those films as one that changed animated films forever. For me, there are animated films before ""Beauty"" and after. Not since Disney's very first animated films (""Snow White,"" ""Pinnochio"") had one blended music and story so masterfully.

10.0,Breathtaking,"When I saw the first advertising for Beauty and the Beast -- a cardboard stand-up in a movie theater -- I nearly burst into tears. Just the ADVERTISEMENT was hauntingly beautiful, tapping into some deep human reality. Hasn't everyone, at some time, felt like a hideous beast hungry for someone to love us as we are and in doing so, transform us into something beautiful?The film itself more than delivered. Belle was the first Disney heroine who wasn't either boy-crazy or a doormat/victim. She has brains, heart, and above all, character. The Beast's transformation from monster to hero is believable and poignant. In a world where possessiveness has become the norm (witness the selfish custody battles of birth parents tearing children from the only homes they've ever known), the Beast's heart-wrenching insistence that he had to let Belle leave because he loves her is a breath of fresh air.The music is perfection, the animation astonishing. Together they raise filmmaking of any kind to new challenges. The ballroom scene is heartbreakingly beautiful.If you've been in a coma for ten years or have some other excuse for never having seen this gem of a movie, correct that omission as soon as possible.

10.0,"An exceptional, beautiful animated film","Anyone can tell you that 1991's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed animated film from that year, is a modern-day classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a film I saw throughout my childhood growing up in the '90s (I was six when the film was originally released in 1991), and I often regarded it as just another Disney fairy tale movie.Boy, was I wrong.Yes, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is an animated Disney fairy tale, but it's an animated Disney fairy tale like no other. The film came out during a time that is often regarded in film history as the Disney Renaissance period, when the company was putting out top-of-the-line animated features that were of the highest degree of excellence after a nearly-30-year decline in quality, had stellar production values and animation, stellar star/no-name voice talent, and the films were just of overall better quality than in times past. As a result, Disney was beginning to see critical acclaim and box office profits that at the time were unprecedented in the company's history, or animated-film history, for that matter.It supposedly began with ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989) and ended with ""Tarzan"" in 1999 (and I also don't want to forget about 1992's ""Aladdin"" or 1994's ""The Lion King""; ""Beauty and the Beast"" is easily the best film from this time.""Beauty and the Beast"" is of course an adaptation of the classic French fairy tale, and the animation screenplay here (ultimately penned by Linda Woolverton and co-directed by Gary Trousdale & Kirk Wise) is credited to no less than 11 writers. In the film, an unnamed and selfish young prince (Robby Benson) is transformed into a Beast by a beautiful young enchantress who had disguised herself as an old hag. This curse has not only transformed him into a monster closely resembling a humanoid lion, but it has affected his entire castle - turning it into a darkly ominous and Gothic house of horrors (that is obviously meant to match his inner turmoil, hatred, and contempt for the world) and turned his servants and everyone else in it into everyday household items like silverware, furniture, and other decorations.In the nearby town, Belle (Paige O'Hara), the town beauty who is regarded as somewhat of an oddball and a goof - due to her love of books and gaining knowledge (my kind of woman, personally!) - is growing tired of her assigned lot in life and wonders if there's anything better out there. Still, she is generally pleased with what she already has, living with her eccentric inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart). When Maurice leaves town to attend a nearby science exhibition, he gets lost and winds up at the Beast's castle. The angry Beast takes him prisoner, but agrees to let him go in exchange for letting Belle remain in his castle forever.Although Belle is initially repulsed by the Beast, not so much by his looks but by his violent temper, she gradually begins to warm up to him and his kindly staff who begin tending to her every need. Underneath his horrid exterior, she begins to see that he is indeed a kind and gentle soul, and a very lonely one at that, and predictably begins to fall in love with him and vice-versa. Meanwhile back in town, forces led by the town's ultra-vain hot-shot alpha-male, Gaston (Richard White), are conspiring to get Belle to marry him at any cost, while also masterminding the Beast's downfall.""Beauty and the Beast"" is an extraordinary motion picture event, which had the distinction of being the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (that was until Pixar's ""Up"" in 2010). It was also one of the earliest pictures to make use of hand-drawn imagery that was seamless integrated with computer-generated special effects. To me, while I usually detest musicals and even though ""Beauty and the Beast"" has some musical numbers in it, by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, the songs don't slow the film down at all. In fact, they actually enhance the film by actually continuing to tell the story (and they are in fact pretty catchy, which is a rarity in films like this - I might actually go out and by the soundtrack pretty soon).Another aspect of the film that makes it so extraordinary is how dark it is, and also worth mentioning is the fleeting violence of the film's climax (which does include a slapstick showdown at the Beast's castle between the household staff and Gaston's goons, but I'm specifically referring to the climatic fight between the Beast and Gaston on the roof of his castle). And the Beast himself is actually quite scary, especially in the film's earliest moments. I'm quite surprised that ""Beauty and the Beast"" didn't receive at least a ""PG"" rating considering how dark this picture is, both in its subject matter and presentation. Notice how ugly and how drenched in darkness the Beast's castle is when the story begins. But the story is also about beauty, specifically the love of inner beauty. The film and Beast's castle begin to brighten up and come back to life once Belle arrives and begins falling for the Beast.It may be rated ""G,"" but it's still a mature-minded animated feature that doesn't play dumb to its audience and spoon-feed them crappy, sugar-coated moralistic messages about the true ugliness that is sometimes referred to as life.""Beauty and the Beast"" is very easily one of my favorite Disney animated films, very easily one of my favorite animated films of all time, for sure. I especially appreciated its message about inner beauty, a theme that has always been particularly of interest to me in the few love stories I actually like but has never been realized so brilliantly as it has been here.A true Disney classic.10/10",exceptional beautiful animated film,anyone can tell you that 1991s beauty beast most commercially successful critically acclaimed animated film that

9.0,Disney as its most 'classic'... whatever it means...,"Because she was unfairly judged by her horrid looks, an old witch casts a spell on an arrogant prince, turning him into a horrendous beast, and the spell extends to every person working in the castle, turned to the furniture they usually handle in their respective job. The ways of magic are impenetrable in Disney's world. But like any Disney spell, it can be broken if the Prince finds true love: if he's capable to love someone and in return, inspires similar feelings. This is a doomed-to-fail mission as no possible girl could ever love a beast.But Belle isn't any girl; she's a French village's local oddity, a free-spirited, fresh and charming girl who keeps her nose stuck on books while wandering on the streets, attracting all the astonished reactions. Belle doesn't care for material stuff, she's a dreamer, in reading, she seeks escapism in its most extraordinary forms, and that she's the daughter of a goofy inventor accentuates her peculiarity, and her charm. And one man fixed his choice on Belle, his name is Gaston and he's the village macho icon, a colossal brute whose strength equals his stupidity, and who can't stand seeing Belle playing ""hard to get"". Gaston slowly turns from a comical buffoon to a more sinister villain. And this is what ""Beauty and the Beast"" is all about: transformations, evolution, but never at the expenses of disbelief. This is the magic of Disney, we can accept a teapot with the voice of Angela Lansbury, a candlestick with the facial features and unmistakable accent of Maurice Chevalier or the failed jokes of a clock-shaped butler. We can accept the extraordinarily horrific face of the Beast who's an improbable combination of a lion's mane, wolf's legs, buffalo's face and boar's mug. But there's one thing that all the 'Fantasy' can't buy and it is the growing chemistry between Belle and the Beast. We know when she becomes the hostage in the castle, it's a matter of time before the romance blooms but it's all in the way this is handled. There's indeed more than 'Stockholm Syndrome'.""Beauty and the Beast"" takes an old classic theme but turns into a serious and legitimate drama: to earn the princess' love, the Beast will have to risk his furry neck, to learn to accept his mistakes, and even to let 'her' leave the castle as sometimes, this is the greatest proof of love. On her side, Belle will also discover the strange attraction and its final blossoming at the film's climax. The romance is handled in such a way that it never feels like a rehash of the older Disney. But if I had to mention the previous movies, I would say that ""Beauty and the Beast"" is to ""The Little Mermaid"" what ""Pinocchio"" was to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", the proof that the former film's success wasn't just a strike of luck and that the animators still got it and could surprise you when you thought it was impossible to match the delights and thrills of the previous one. With ""Mermaid"", Disney inaugurated the Renaissance period and established new grounds, that only Disney could ever break or surpass. And with ""Beauty and the Beast"", they created a formidable precedent by making the first ever animated feature to be nominated to a Best Picture Oscar, along with such other prestigious titles as ""Silence and the Lambs"" and ""JFK"". Many Pixar movies achieved the same stunt (""Up"" and ""Toy Story 3""), but it's easier to sneak in when you have eight to ten available spots. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was certainly no filler.I insist on these Oscar considerations because ""Beauty and the Beast"" is really one of a kind, it is such a big-scaled prestigious visual feast that it might leave smaller audiences craving a bit underwhelmed. Speaking for myself, as I had the chance to be the target core of the Disney Renaissance, ""Beauty and the Beast"" has never been one of my favorites, not in the sense that I disliked it but because I would always find better reasons to enjoy ""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"" or ""The Jungle Book"". Revisiting this classic 25 years after its release (time flies), I understand why: this is a great film on its own right, and not just as a Disney animated feature.And it wasn't just nominated for Best Picture, but it was also included in major lists from the American Film Institute: Songs, Romances but is the only animated feature to have made it in the ""Musical"" category, which says a lot because all the previous Disney movies have been musicals. But in the case of ""Beauty and the Beast"", the musical moments are staged like in Broadway comedies, the opening song even borrows from ""West Side Story"" and Belle has something of Maria from ""Sound of Music"". But ""Beauty"" didn't just reused common staples of musical, it became a staple itself as the film would be parodied countless times, from the unforgettable ""See my Vest"" where Mr. Burns reveals his devilish puppy scheme to the ""Mountain Song"" in ""South Park"", and one can even see similar plot lines between the film and the movie ""Shrek"".""Beauty and the Beast"" is an instant classic and the living incarnation of Disney's magic, it doesn't have the zaniness or little spice that can create an extra appeal, but that's because the film had more serious ambitious and doesn't even deny it in its titular song, as the tale is 'as old as time', stories or 'seemingly impossible loves'. And maybe like Belle, now, I can see the beauty of ""Beauty in the Beast"", if only because it's so magnificently hand-drawn and Belle looks more expressive than any 3D princess. (And don't get me started on that moment where we get to see the real 'Featherduster', perhaps the Disney moment that most turned me on)",disney as its most classic whatever it means,because she was unfairly judged by her horrid looks old witch casts spell arrogant prince turning him into horrendous beast spell extends every person working castle turned furniture they usually handle their respective job ways magic are impenetrable disneys world but like any disney spell it can be broken if prince finds true love if hes capable love someone return inspires similar feelings this is doomed fail mission as no possible girl could ever love beast but belle isnt any girl shes french villages local oddity free spirited fresh charming girl who keeps her nose stuck books while wandering streets attracting all astonished reactions belle doesnt care material stuff shes dreamer reading she seeks escapism its most extraordinary forms that shes daughter goofy inventor accentuates her peculiarity her charm one man fixed his choice belle his name is gaston hes village macho icon colossal brute whose strength equals his stupidity who cant stand seeing belle playing hard get gaston slowly turns comical buffoon more sinister villain this is what beauty beast is all about transformations evolution but never at expenses disbelief this is magic disney we can accept teapot with voice angela lansbury candlestick with facial features unmistakable accent maurice chevalier or failed jokes clock shaped butler we can accept extraordinarily horrific face beast whos improbable combination lions mane wolfs legs buffalos face boars mug but theres one thing that all fantasy cant buy it is growing chemistry between belle beast we know when she becomes hostage castle its matter time before romance blooms but its all way this is handled theres indeed more than stockholm syndrome beauty beast takes old classic theme but turns into serious legitimate drama earn princess love beast will have risk his furry neck learn accept his mistakes even let her leave castle as sometimes this is greatest proof love her side belle will also discover strange attraction its final blossoming at films climax romance is handled such way that it never feels like rehash older disney but if i had mention previous movies i would say that beauty beast is little mermaid what pinocchio was snow white seven dwarfs proof that former films success wasnt just strike luck that animators still got it could surprise you when you thought it was impossible match delights thrills previous one with mermaid disney inaugurated renaissance period established new grounds that only disney could ever break or surpass with beauty beast they created formidable precedent by making first ever animated feature be nominated best picture oscar along with such other prestigious titles as silence lambs jfk many pixar movies achieved same stunt up toy story 3 but its easier sneak when you have eight ten available spots beauty beast was certainly no filler i insist these oscar considerations because beauty beast is really one kind it is such big scaled prestigious visual feast that it might leave smaller audiences craving bit underwhelmed speaking myself as i had chance be target core disney renaissance beauty beast has never been one my favorites not sense that i disliked it but because i would always find better reasons enjoy aladdin lion king or jungle book revisiting this classic 25 years after its release time flies i understand why this is great film its own right not just as disney animated feature it wasnt just nominated best picture but it was also included major lists american film institute songs romances but is only animated feature have made it musical category which says lot because all previous disney movies have been musicals but case beauty beast musical moments are staged like broadway comedies opening song even borrows west side story belle has something maria sound music but beauty didnt just reused common staples musical it became staple itself as film would be parodied countless times unforgettable see my vest where mr burns reveals his devilish puppy scheme mountain song south park one can even see similar plot lines between film movie shrek beauty beast is instant classic living incarnation disneys magic it doesnt have zaniness or little spice that can create extra appeal but thats because film had more serious ambitious doesnt even deny it its titular song as tale is as old as time stories or seemingly impossible loves maybe like belle now i can see beauty beauty beast if only because its so magnificently hand drawn belle looks more expressive than any 3d princess dont get me started that moment where we get see real featherduster perhaps disney moment that most turned me,0.49806080283352994,0.14411304604486425,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Such a Belle after All These Years,"You know, two of the best aspects of Disney's version of Beauty & the Beast, seemed small and insignificant to most, but have stuck with me since I saw this in 1991. #1 They freely admit that this is a ""tale as old as time"" – they're not hiding that fact and #2 they're also completely up front with stating ""she's the one"" to break the curse, i.e. they don't make us wait until the end (LIKE MOVIES DO ALL THE TIME) to reveal what we've known from minute one. I respect that.Those are just two things of, I dunno, 50 great things about this near-masterpiece of filmmaking. A beautiful score, fantastic and timeless songs, gorgeous cinematography, hilarious dialogue and ""sidekicks"" and secondary characters, a story very moving, strong leads, adventure, suspense, love, funthis movie is all of those plus so much more.Watching it (for the 20th+ time but) now in the usual-Disney ""We Want Even More of Your Dollars"" way, the re-release, of course in 3D, it still held up for me. My friend and I in the theatre were rocking back and forth with the wonderful musical segments while mouthing the words – trying desperately, albeit probably failing, not to disturb other movie-goers.I will say this, despite my 10/10 Star ratingthe movie did look 21 years old, unfortunately. Some of the background characters did not move while the foreground was in motion. This was, sadly, unintentionally humorous. That said, I am a huge supporter of hand-drawn animation, or, movies people put their heart, soul, sweat & tears in VS clicking the mouse. This was old-school animation and I am fine with that. I just think this was better served, in 2012, at home to appreciate.Sure, I love re-watching classics or even movies I just like a lot, on the silver screen, but this wasn't one of those. Anyone that knows me knows I do like 3D, but I have NOT seen a single Disney 3D movie that impressed me. Especially converted ones. The ONLY good 3D imagery here was the rain & snow, and I said the same thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas's re-release in 3D. Sad, there were a lot more 3D to choose from, but I ONLY liked the rain & snow which, to me, was the only 3D that had depth.So I will NOT recommend this to be seen in theatres. I will NOT go see another Disney Classic on the big screen converted to 3D and I am no longer upset I missed The Lion King's same 3D re-issue last year. I will, however see Finding Nemo's 3D re-release later this year for several reasons: I DO NOT consider that Disney, it's my favorite Pixar film – though I haven't seen it since the original release in 2003 and the less than 2 minute preview before Beauty & the Beast looked far better in 3D than ALL of Beauty & the Beast. (On a side note, it's absolutely easier to convert that – it was 100% digital and computerized.)Stick with this classic on BluRay. I just hope they put that fantastically hilarious Tangled Ever After short (shown before this movie in the theatre.) It was a lot of fun and had us cracking up.For the movie itself: 10/10 Stars. For the 3D conversion: 2/10 Stars.",such belle after all these years,you know two best aspects disneys version beauty beast seemed small insignificant most but have stuck with me since i saw this 1991 they freely admit that this is tale as old as time theyre not hiding that fact theyre also completely up front with stating shes one break curse i e they dont make us wait until end like movies do all time reveal what weve known minute one i respect that those are just two things i dunno 50 great things about this near masterpiece filmmaking beautiful score fantastic timeless songs gorgeous cinematography hilarious dialogue sidekicks secondary characters story very moving strong leads adventure suspense love fun this movie is all those plus so much more watching it 20th time but now usual disney we want even more your dollars way re release course 3d it still held up me my friend i theatre were rocking back forth with wonderful musical segments while mouthing words trying desperately albeit probably failing not disturb other movie goers i will say this despite my 10 10 star rating movie did look 21 years old unfortunately some background characters did not move while foreground was motion this was sadly unintentionally humorous that said i am huge supporter hand drawn animation or movies people put their heart soul sweat tears vs clicking mouse this was old school animation i am fine with that i just think this was better served 2012 at home appreciate sure i love re watching classics or even movies i just like lot silver screen but this wasnt one those anyone that knows me knows i do like 3d but i have not seen single disney 3d movie that impressed me especially converted ones only good 3d imagery here was rain snow i said same thing about nightmare before christmass re release 3d sad there were lot more 3d choose but i only liked rain snow which me was only 3d that had depth so i will not recommend this be seen theatres i will not go see another disney classic big screen converted 3d i am no longer upset i missed lion kings same 3d re issue last year i will however see finding nemos 3d re release later this year several reasons i do not consider that disney its my favorite pixar film though i havent seen it since original release 2003 less than 2 minute preview before beauty beast looked far better 3d than all beauty beast side note its absolutely easier convert that it was 100 digital computerized stick with this classic bluray i just hope they put that fantastically hilarious tangled ever after short shown before this movie theatre it was lot fun had us cracking up movie itself 10 10 stars 3d conversion 2 10 stars,0.5412026862026862,0.21915750915750917,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10.0,Tale as old as time...,"This animated masterpiece is and will always stay one of the best romantic movies ever created.This is one of those rare movies in which everything comes perfectly together. The characters, the music, the humor, the pace, the story everything in this movie is just perfect. It's a highly memorable movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.The movie is beautifully animated and it features some of the best Disney characters. Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere and of course Belle and the Beast are highly memorable and very well constructed characters. Also the villain role Gaston which is always one of the most important elements of a Disney movie is a good one. However the villain isn't as prominent to the story as in most other Disney animated movies is the case. This movie truly is about love and the beauty inside. The movie its love story is nicely supported by the very good songs composed by Alan Menken and with lyrics by Howard Ashman. Unfortunately this was Howard Ashman's last project and he died before he could receive his well deserved Oscar for this movie. Unique fact is that this movie was also even nominated for the 'Best Picture' Oscar. Something that was really well deserved by the way. The story is quite 'mature' but also there is still plenty to enjoy for the little one's here. The movie is filled with lots of humor and imaginative characters. The movie is told in very good quick pace and features some of the best editing I have ever seen in an animated movie.The voice cast consists out of some good actors; Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach are especially perfect for their roles.The movie features some unforgettable classic moments and is a milestone in animated movie making. An highly recommendable animated romantic movie that shall always remain one of the best romantic movies ever made.

10.0,"""The Perfect Animated Movie""","In the opening of Beauty and The Beast, we find out more about the characters in the first five minutes, then many movies tell us in half an hour. Taking a risk, and opening an animated film with a long musical number was a risky move, but as it turns out, a perfectly wonderful idea. From the opening to the end, we are totally captivated by this wonderful achievement in music and animation as we have never been before.Unlike many animated Disney movies where a song may be thrown in here and there, and do little to move the story along, each song here is directly related to the story line, moves the movie along, and leaves us anticipating the next big number. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman deserve every bit of the praise they received for this film, and then some.All the characters in this film are so well animated and voiced, you never once think about the fact that you are watching an animated movie, as is often the case. From the town that Belle lives in, to the Beast castle, the backgrounds are beautifully rendered in detail, and vibrant alive colors. In 1991, this was a ground breaking, animated film, and over ten years later, as much as I enjoy many of the new computer animated movies such as Shrek and Toy Story, none has come close to the accomplishments of Beauty and the Beast, which mixes romance, music, comedy and drama, in a perfect blend that may never be seen again.",perfect animated movie,opening beauty beast we find out more about characters first five minutes then many movies tell us half hour taking risk opening animated film with long musical number was risky move but as it turns out perfectly wonderful idea opening end we are totally captivated by this wonderful achievement music animation as we have never been before unlike many animated disney movies where song may be thrown here there do little move story along each song here is directly related story line moves movie along leaves us anticipating next big number alan menken howard ashman deserve every bit praise they received this film then some all characters this film are so well animated voiced you never once think about fact that you are watching animated movie as is often case town that belle lives beast castle backgrounds are beautifully rendered detail vibrant alive colors 1991 this was ground breaking animated film over ten years later as much as i enjoy many new computer animated movies such as shrek toy story none has come close accomplishments beauty beast which mixes romance music comedy drama perfect blend that may never be seen again,0.4735151515151515,0.2999545454545455,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"

It's a nice tale, and as always, has something to teach us. The songs are really great too. Every one in this movie, is beautifully sung and well orchestrated. Everyone knows the song ""Be our guest"" and it brings a smile to my face every time I hear/see it.The villain of the piece is of course Mr Universe with his bulging biceps and pearly white teeth, and we as an audience can't wait for the inevitable confrontation between him and the Beast.But to me, the real star of this film is Mrs Potts (Angela Lansbury). She sings THAT song wonderfully, and sends a shiver down my back, and brings a tear to my eye every time!!This is, I must say, Disney at their best, they don't make them like this anymore, and it shows that when people care about something that they make, it'll all work out, and everyone will be happy ever after.10/10Enjoy!",this film me is one finest disney films ever made,this film its opening narration end credits is beautifully animated adaptation well known classic when i first saw this i was captivated by both animation story its nice tale as always has something teach us songs are really great too every one this movie is beautifully sung well orchestrated everyone knows song be our guest it brings smile my face every time i hear see it villain piece is course mr universe with his bulging biceps pearly white teeth we as audience cant wait inevitable confrontation between him beast but me real star this film is mrs potts angela lansbury she sings that song wonderfully sends shiver down my back brings tear my eye every time this is i must say disney at their best they dont make them like this anymore it shows that when people care about something that they make itll all work out everyone will be happy ever after 10 10enjoy,0.5492592592592591,0.444074074074074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,"One of Disney's best, and my favorite.","This is what I think one of Disney's best animated features, either cartoon short or full-length animated feature film. It is also my favorite Disney movie, about a Beast (an enchanted prince) who has been losing hope to learn to love and be loved in return in order to break the enchanted spell, until he meets Belle. Belle offers to stay in the castle with the Beast in exchange for her imprisoned father to be set free. What follows is a beautiful love story in how Belle attempts to tame the Beast as he learns the proper manners to be a gentleman from her, and attempting to learn to love and be loved in return.Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise did a marvelous job directing this movie, providing a solid plot that offered a captivating, exciting and heartwarming story of adventure, courage and love. The chemistry between Belle and the Beast will capture your heart and probably put a lump in your throat; it is captured in a way that sent a strong message of changing one's way for the better, humility and acts of selflessness.The characters, especially the enchanted objects, are very lovable and extraordinary, each one giving his/her own unique charm, including: Lumiere, a lovestruck, suave-talking candelabra; Cogsworth, a pompous and prim table clock; Mrs. Potts, the kind-hearted and warm teapot; and Chip, Mrs. Potts' son and an inquisitive teacup. I love the constant competition between Lumiere and Cogsworth as they try to win Belle's liking and command of the castle's duties. All the objects provided the right touch of humor and comedy for a dramatic love story.Alan Menken did a great job on the music score - very spirited, lively and moving. And, my hat is off to some of the greatest songs, by Menken and Howard Ashman, in cinema history: Be Our Guest and Beauty and the Beast. Lumiere and Mrs. Potts (Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury) sang ""Be Our Guest"" during a grand dinner for Belle. As the enchanted objects performed dances and acrobats to the song, it gave what I think are some of the best pieces of animation work in history. Just the unveiling of the chandelier and the Eiffel Tower forming under a bevy of wineglasses are breathtaking. And, the song ""Beauty and the Beast,"" sung by Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), is a beautiful and stirring song that basically summarizes the entire movie - ""tale as old as time,"" ""sweet and strength,"" ""finding you can change,"" ""Beauty and the Beast."" Other memorable characters I like to mention are the conceited and villainous Gaston (Richard White), the slapstick and somewhat clueless LeFou (Jesse Corti) and the brilliant and bold inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart).There is never a slow or dull moment in this movie - it is thoroughly entertaining and exciting from start to finish. This movie definitely has that ""Disney touch,"" which makes it that much more special. It is the perfect one for audiences of all ages, one to watch again and again and, for myself, will remain my favorite Disney film, animated feature in general and one of my favorite movies of all time.Grade A+",one disneys best my favorite,this is what i think one disneys best animated features either cartoon short or full length animated feature film it is also my favorite disney movie about beast enchanted prince who has been losing hope learn love be loved return order break enchanted spell until he meets belle belle offers stay castle with beast exchange her imprisoned father be set free what follows is beautiful love story how belle attempts tame beast as he learns proper manners be gentleman her attempting learn love be loved return gary trousdale kirk wise did marvelous job directing this movie providing solid plot that offered captivating exciting heartwarming story adventure courage love chemistry between belle beast will capture your heart probably put lump your throat it is captured way that sent strong message changing ones way better humility acts selflessness characters especially enchanted objects are very lovable extraordinary each one giving his her own unique charm including lumiere lovestruck suave talking candelabra cogsworth pompous prim table clock mrs potts kind hearted warm teapot chip mrs potts son inquisitive teacup i love constant competition between lumiere cogsworth as they try win belles liking command castles duties all objects provided right touch humor comedy dramatic love story alan menken did great job music score very spirited lively moving my hat is off some greatest songs by menken howard ashman cinema history be our guest beauty beast lumiere mrs potts jerry orbach angela lansbury sang be our guest during grand dinner belle as enchanted objects performed dances acrobats song it gave what i think are some best pieces animation work history just unveiling chandelier eiffel tower forming under bevy wineglasses are breathtaking song beauty beast sung by mrs potts lansbury is beautiful stirring song that basically summarizes entire movie tale as old as time sweet strength finding you can change beauty beast other memorable characters i like mention are conceited villainous gaston richard white slapstick somewhat clueless lefou jesse corti brilliant bold inventor maurice rex everhart there is never slow or dull moment this movie it is thoroughly entertaining exciting start finish this movie definitely has that disney touch which makes it that much more special it is perfect one audiences all ages one watch again again myself will remain my favorite disney film animated feature general one my favorite movies all time grade,0.661830357142857,0.43261803300865803,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,"Like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within.","It has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword, but when this age-old phrase is converted to modern times, it translates to ""the desktop is mightier than the pencil."" There's no denying that the computer has become a tool used across the world, whether for political reasons, or for business or especially for educational purposes. Computers have also been adopted by the film industry to give their works of art a shinier feel and along with the visual effects wizards, the filmmakers who use these electronic devices the most are the animators. After a while, it was uncertain whether the cel-based animation used to create such classics like The Little Mermaid and Pinocchio would be completely dropped in favour of the quicker and slicker style. While studios like DreamWorks may have given up on them, the folks at the world's pioneering animation studio are still behind the pencil-and-paper animation that has enchanted families for generations. Looking back at one of their essential works, Beauty and the Beast brings back memories of not only nostalgia, but also warmth. Quite possibly the greatest love story ever told, this ""tale as old as time"" has always been told by bringing pen to paper. From its candle-lit beginnings by a French writer many years ago to the Disney animators who brought joys to people of all ages, Beauty and the Beast has always touched the heart.The main part of what makes Beauty and the Beast such a brilliant film is the fact that the relationship between the two title characters doesn't feel artificial or one-dimensional, even though they're drawn on paper. Unlike other famous fairy tales, Beauty and the Beast feels quite realistic in its definition of love. The story breaks all conventions by not going the ""love at first sight"" route and letting the romance progress at a reasonable pace. Belle also proves to be the most interesting Disney heroine, as she doesn't fit the norm of typical princesses like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Unlike the aforementioned characters, Belle is not bland, but actually as a personality. She defines individuality and seeks to do more than just marry a prince. Her annoyance at Gaston is not only humorous, but also shows that her ideas of romance don't consist of ""a rustic hunting lodge... my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife, massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs... we'll have six or seven,"" as Gaston puts it. The Beast is also a rather stubborn, but loving personality. Despite his tough exterior is a nice person at heart which Belle begins to realise the more into the relationship they enter.Adding to the brilliance of the chemistry between Beauty and the Beast are the songs from Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Although both did terrific work on The Little Mermaid and their cult musical Little Shop of Horrors, the music in Beauty and the Beast stands as their best. The title theme song is quite possibly one of the most romantic songs ever written, combining beautiful lyrics with a very memorable melody. This song enhances the film's famous ballroom scene to ever impressive heights, already helped by the breathtaking animation in the sequence. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was not written as just a way to sell soundtracks and win Oscars. It adds another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other. It is both moving and deep. The other songs provided by the team also contribute wonderfully to the film, from a show-stopping Broadway number called ""Be Our Guest"" to the very funny ode to ""Gaston."" They're bursting with energy and humour made even more poignant by the fact they would feature the last lyrics written by Ashman (who had also already contributed some work to Aladdin). It's a brilliant way to end his career and the end credits homage him perfectly: ""To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)""Probably one of the most important ingredients that make Beauty and the Beast such a success is the startling animation. The animators at Disney did a terrific job at making everything absolutely perfect, from the character designs to the sets. Each character has their feel, whether comedic or dramatic, and the animators allow them to breath, seamlessly combining the actor's voice to the moving drawings. The sets are also worthy of mention, particularly the look of the Beast's castle. The Gothic castle is drawn and painted beautifully from top to behind, so much so you're forgetting you're watching an animated film. The film is bright and colourful, but also dark and dreary when necessary. As mentioned before, the ballroom sequence combines Menken and Ashman's music with the animation flawlessly, giving a completely magical feel to it. When computers are brought into the scene, it seams in perfectly, not feeling distracted in the least. Beauty and the Beast most certainly stands as Disney animation at its finest.Some of the best animated films in the world have come from the Walt Disney studios and Beauty and the Beast is deservedly one of their crown jewels. At the film's release, it was honoured with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, a rare feat for an animated film. It proves that like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within.",like its heroine beauty
