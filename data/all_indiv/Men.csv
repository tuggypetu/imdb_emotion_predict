4.0,What in the ****-ing ****,"I'm a huge fan of writer/director Alex Garland. Annihilation is one of my all-time favorite movies. And I love Sunshine, Ex Machina, Dredd, Devs and 28 Days Later. I saw this movie on opening night on his name alone. I did not watch a single trailer or read any reviews. I didn't even know what it's about. (This is the best way to watch a movie)To my dismay, this movie doesn't work for me at all. It's extremely slow with very little happening for most of the movie. I spent the majority of the time trying to figure out what was happening or what kind of story was unfolding. I impatiently made it to the end, hoping the movie could be salvaged. Instead I was given some of the weirdest stuff I've ever witnessed in a movie, and not in a good way. The best word to describe my feeling was befuddled.The movie overall is competently made with good directing and performances. But there isn't enough story or substance to balance out the abstract and metaphorical. I compare it to Annihilation which was juicy with metaphors and symbolism, but was also filled with story and substance. And while both movies have scenes and images that I've never seen or even imagined, the ones in Annihilation mesmerized and terrified me, while the ones in Men made me raise an eyebrow and say what I wrote in the headline.Alex Garland is now 3 for 4 in the director's chair. I should stop hoping that every new director prodigy will be the next Christopher Nolan with almost every movie being amazing. It's not reasonable. I should expect misses like Men. And I still look forward to seeing more from Garland. But I can't like a movie if after I've watched it, I have no idea what I just witnessed.

3.0,Intriguing film totally ruined by the last half hour,"I was really looking forward to seeing ""Men"" after reading promising reviews but walked out of the theater feeling very disappointed.The film starts out very promisingly. The main character Harper (beautifully played by Jessie Buckley) witnesses her husband either kill himself or possibly slip from an upstairs apartment after she informs him she wants a divorce. Dealing with immense guilt and grieving his loss, she rents a large house in the English countryside to get away from everything and get respite. The caretaker, Geoffrey (Rory Kinnear), is a peculiar character but she takes it in stride and looks forward to her time alone.Later while walking in the woods she encounters a naked man who follows her back to the house. She calls the police when he appears to be trying to break into the residence, and they arrest him and take him away. As the film progresses there's an increasing atmosphere of dread as ensuing interactions between Harper and a series of different males become more and more bizarre. Each character seems to turn on her in one way or another, in particular a vicar who suddenly blames her for her husband's suicide. To add to the surreal, almost nightmarish vibe, every male character in the film (including a young boy, whose face disturbingly appears much older than it should be) is played skillfully by the actor Rory Kinnear.I won't go into any further plot details but suffice to say the suspense continues to build. Then the last twenty or thirty minutes of the film suddenly take a complete turnaround with no logic or explanation of what is actually happening. It becomes a different film altogether and loses all of its creepy subtlety. It's not clear if the character of Harper is fantasizing what follows, if she's lost touch with reality or if these episodes are actually happening. If the remainder of ""Men"" is supposed to represent manifestations of the main character finally working through her grief and her guilt, it was very poorly imagined. Disconcertingly, ""Men"" abruptly turns into just another routine horror film relying on one bloody cgi scene after another, none of which are particularly original. After fifteen or twenty minutes I realized not only I had stopped caring about what was happening to the main character but I had totally lost respect for the film.Like another reviewer here has written, I've also become really tired of watching films that directors explain away by claiming they ""leave the meaning of the film up to the viewer."" It's become a very lazy and self-indulgent way to avoid taking responsibility toward creating any real plot structure or logic to a film's storyline. In this case it almost looks like Alex Garland really didn't know how to conclude ""Men"" and just decided to rely on making some kind of an impression using the same old horror movie cgi effects we've seen so many times before. For me, it completely ruined what could have been a very good film.",intriguing film totally ruined by last half hour,i was really looking forward seeing men after reading promising reviews but walked out theater feeling very disappointed film starts out very promisingly main character harper beautifully played by jessie buckley witnesses her husband either kill himself or possibly slip upstairs apartment after she informs him she wants divorce dealing with immense guilt grieving his loss she rents large house english countryside get away everything get respite caretaker geoffrey rory kinnear is peculiar character but she takes it stride looks forward her time alone later while walking woods she encounters naked man who follows her back house she calls police when he appears be trying break into residence they arrest him take him away as film progresses theres increasing atmosphere dread as ensuing interactions between harper series different males become more more bizarre each character seems turn her one way or another particular vicar who suddenly blames her her husbands suicide add surreal almost nightmarish vibe every male character film including young boy whose face disturbingly appears much older than it should be is played skillfully by actor rory kinnear i wont go into any further plot details but suffice say suspense continues build then last twenty or thirty minutes film suddenly take complete turnaround with no logic or explanation what is actually happening it becomes different film altogether loses all its creepy subtlety its not clear if character harper is fantasizing what follows if shes lost touch with reality or if these episodes are actually happening if remainder men is supposed represent manifestations main character finally working through her grief her guilt it was very poorly imagined disconcertingly men abruptly turns into just another routine horror film relying one bloody cgi scene after another none which are particularly original after fifteen or twenty minutes i realized not only i had stopped caring about what was happening main character but i had totally lost respect film like another reviewer here has written ive also become really tired watching films that directors explain away by claiming they leave meaning film up viewer its become very lazy self indulgent way avoid taking responsibility toward creating any real plot structure or logic films storyline this case it almost looks like alex garland really didnt know how conclude men just decided rely making some kind impression using same old horror movie cgi effects weve seen so many times before me it completely ruined what could have been very good film,0.48963680387409186,0.03594834543987086,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.32}"
4.0,A kiddie pool that thinks it's deep.,"I'm a fan of Alex Garland's previous films; I liked Ex Machina and I loved Annihilation. With Men, he lost me.The film has a monstrously effective first 30 minutes. The characters are introduced with airtight exposition and riveting dialogue. The atmosphere is developed with gorgeous, haunting cinematography that envelopes each scene in dread.After this near-perfect first act, the film falls flat on its stupid face.The artistic presentation remains technically gorgeous throughout, but any sense of narrative cohesion or character consistency is thrown out the window in favor of the simple rote routine of throwing strange metaphorical imagery at the screen and having our protagonist run away from it while avoiding doing something rational...Over...And over...And over again...for about the entire second half of the movie.The story reaches its thematic heights about halfway through and then Garland has nothing else to say, so he keeps hammering in the exact same overly simplified message of ""misogyny being passed down via cultural acceptance through generations"" with increasingly bizarre imagery that deflates any sort of tension or sense of true danger.To top off the insult to the audience's intelligence, the movie ends with a line of dialogue that gives us the exact same message we got in one of the film's first scenes.This is a movie that is almost an hour longer than it needs to be. It's so convinced of its own intelligence, yet so shallow and stupid, lacking any sense of nuance whatsoever.Do you, like 99.9% of western people, believe that hitting women and emotionally manipulating people is bad?Congratulations. You're smarter than Alex Garland thinks you are, and I saved you 100 minutes.",kiddie pool that thinks its deep,im fan alex garlands previous films i liked ex machina i loved annihilation with men he lost me film has monstrously effective first 30 minutes characters are introduced with airtight exposition riveting dialogue atmosphere is developed with gorgeous haunting cinematography that envelopes each scene dread after this near perfect first act film falls flat its stupid face artistic presentation remains technically gorgeous throughout but any sense narrative cohesion or character consistency is thrown out window favor simple rote routine throwing strange metaphorical imagery at screen having our protagonist run away it while avoiding doing something rational over over over again about entire second half movie story reaches its thematic heights about halfway through then garland has nothing else say so he keeps hammering exact same overly simplified message misogyny being passed down via cultural acceptance through generations with increasingly bizarre imagery that deflates any sort tension or sense true danger top off insult audiences intelligence movie ends with line dialogue that gives us exact same message we got one films first scenes this is movie that is almost hour longer than it needs be its so convinced its own intelligence yet so shallow stupid lacking any sense nuance whatsoever do you like 99 9 western people believe that hitting women emotionally manipulating people is bad congratulations youre smarter than alex garland thinks you are i saved you 100 minutes,0.481949531949532,0.13682336182336177,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
6.0,Simultaneously too much and not enough,"The climax of ""Men"" has a certain sequence that can only be described as grotesque - it was a real labor of love, if you will (read between the lines, my friend). And seeing this specific scene take up the entire width of the silver screen in extreme closeup was not something I particularly expected, or wanted, to see in theatres. However, in a weird way I admired this film for throwing caution to the wind - ""Gosh darn it,"" this movie seems to say, ""You'll watch what I want you to watch, and you'll like it!"" And so I didn't mind the initial sequence, until director Alex Garland portrayed it three more times.""Men"" is simultaneously an exercise of too much and yet not enough. Because when Garland goes for it, he really goes for it; throwing everything and the kitchen sink at his audience in terms of visuals and sound design, on one hand this movie satisfies on a purely primal level. Crisp, bright colors permeate this movie, and coupled with the booming and borderline intrusive score, you have something that your eyes and ears will happily soak up. And in fact, from the moment this film started I was immediately in awe of just how good it looked. But on the other hand, all the visuals and sounds in the world can't make up for a poor plot, and ""Men"" has a poor plot.Well, let me backtrack. The plot isn't inherently poor - actually, it's pretty interesting. Starring the beautiful Jessie Buckley as Harper, ""Men"" follows her as she retreats to a vacation home in the English countryside after experiencing a personal tragedy. Things just seem to go from bad to worse for poor Harper, though, as she soon stumbles across a town where the men look strikingly similar. It's an intriguing premise, especially since the film employs a heavy use of emotional dramatic tension to drive the story forward. You'll find yourself invested in the puzzle that's being put together before your eyes, and engaged in Harper's story and the very human drama that comes from it. And with this expert combination of horror and drama, ""Men"" seems to make you a promise of a satisfying conclusion. And would you be surprised if I told you that ""Men"" doesn't deliver?Looking past the striking visuals, euphoric soundtrack, and Oscar-worthy acting from Jessie Buckley, you have yourself a movie that lacks development. Too long on the draw, the movie takes its time in setting up its main character. In doing so, the film becomes, primarily, a character piece with thriller elements to it - in fact, the horror doesn't really kick in until the latter half of the movie. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the movie actually had a satisfying story that tied the drama and horror together in a conclusive way, but it doesn't. Instead, ""Men"" feels like two separate movies: a study of grief, and a home invasion thriller. And to be honest with you, the purely dramatic sections of this movie were my favorite simply because the horror elements felt like a narrative afterthought.Sure, you'll get all the suspense and bloodshed you want out of this type of premise; you'll also get a stunning lack of explanation as to why what's happening is happening. Actually, strike that. You will get an explanation, one that you'll find in one of the laziest cop outs for an ending that I've seen in quite some time. With the subtlety of an atom bomb, the ultimate reveal is uncreative to the extreme. Put it this way: I had my suspicions that the movie would go in the route I thought it was going in, and when my suspicions were confirmed, I couldn't help but groan.""Men"" crumbles under its own weight with a unique premise that the filmmakers, clearly, didn't know what to do with. A lack of satisfying narrative development means that ""Men"" doesn't wholly succeed as either a drama or a horror film. However, it's so well acted, so pretty to look at, and so nice to listen to that I can't outright reject this movie, because I will certainly be watching this again at home one day. My recommendation? Give this a watch solely for its sights and sounds, and temper your expectations in terms of its storyline. Doing so, you may find just enough to like, but not enough to love.",simultaneously too much not enough,climax men has certain sequence that can only be described as grotesque it was real labor love if you will read between lines my friend seeing this specific scene take up entire width silver screen extreme closeup was not something i particularly expected or wanted see theatres however weird way i admired this film throwing caution wind gosh darn it this movie seems say youll watch what i want you watch youll like it so i didnt mind initial sequence until director alex garland portrayed it three more times men is simultaneously exercise too much yet not enough because when garland goes it he really goes it throwing everything kitchen sink at his audience terms visuals sound design one hand this movie satisfies purely primal level crisp bright colors permeate this movie coupled with booming borderline intrusive score you have something that your eyes ears will happily soak up fact moment this film started i was immediately awe just how good it looked but other hand all visuals sounds world cant make up poor plot men has poor plot well let me backtrack plot isnt inherently poor actually its pretty interesting starring beautiful jessie buckley as harper men follows her as she retreats vacation home english countryside after experiencing personal tragedy things just seem go bad worse poor harper though as she soon stumbles across town where men look strikingly similar its intriguing premise especially since film employs heavy use emotional dramatic tension drive story forward youll find yourself invested puzzle thats being put together before your eyes engaged harpers story very human drama that comes it with this expert combination horror drama men seems make you promise satisfying conclusion would you be surprised if i told you that men doesnt deliver looking past striking visuals euphoric soundtrack oscar worthy acting jessie buckley you have yourself movie that lacks development too long draw movie takes its time setting up its main character doing so film becomes primarily character piece with thriller elements it fact horror doesnt really kick until latter half movie this wouldnt be bad thing if movie actually had satisfying story that tied drama horror together conclusive way but it doesnt instead men feels like two separate movies study grief home invasion thriller be honest with you purely dramatic sections this movie were my favorite simply because horror elements felt like narrative afterthought sure youll get all suspense bloodshed you want out this type premise youll also get stunning lack explanation as why whats happening is happening actually strike that you will get explanation one that youll find one laziest cop outs ending that ive seen quite some time with subtlety atom bomb ultimate reveal is uncreative extreme put it this way i had my suspicions that movie would go route i thought it was going when my suspicions were confirmed i couldnt help but groan men crumbles under its own weight with unique premise that filmmakers clearly didnt know what do with lack satisfying narrative development means that men doesnt wholly succeed as either drama or horror film however its so well acted so pretty look at so nice listen that i cant outright reject this movie because i will certainly be watching this again at home one day my recommendation give this watch solely its sights sounds temper your expectations terms its storyline doing so you may find just enough like but not enough love,0.5845218002812939,0.1020192887281495,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"
4.0,"Could've been great, but is completely incomplete","First off, let me say, that was the strangest ending to a film I think I have ever seen. How this movie got an R rating is beyond me because it is graphic! Secondly, what the hell did I just watch??? The movie was going so well for the first hour or so, beautiful cinematography, a sweeping sound mix and some very brilliant acting and writing all around. But then things start to get... weird. It completely loses it's footing and the film turns into what I can only describe as the worst allegory for depravity and misogyny I think ever put to film. It just didn't make any sense and the more I think about it, the less sense it makes. There is no outright conclusion, only a bunch of nonsense thrown at you in hopes that you'll think it's cool, but it comes off as pretentious and pandering. I would've loved to know what happened afterwards, but alas the movie is unfinished. If you do go to see this one, be prepared for an ending that will either leave you gagging or wanting. It really leaves nothing to the imagination and everything to your imagination at the same time. I only recommend it for the strong acting and beautiful camera work, but other than that, the film falls flat on it's face in the last half hour. 2.5 birthings out of 5.",couldve been great but is completely incomplete,first off let me say that was strangest ending film i think i have ever seen how this movie got r rating is beyond me because it is graphic secondly what hell did i just watch movie was going so well first hour or so beautiful cinematography sweeping sound mix some very brilliant acting writing all around but then things start get weird it completely loses its footing film turns into what i can only describe as worst allegory depravity misogyny i think ever put film it just didnt make any sense more i think about it less sense it makes there is no outright conclusion only bunch nonsense thrown at you hopes that youll think its cool but it comes off as pretentious pandering i wouldve loved know what happened afterwards but alas movie is unfinished if you do go see this one be prepared ending that will either leave you gagging or wanting it really leaves nothing imagination everything your imagination at same time i only recommend it strong acting beautiful camera work but other than that film falls flat its face last half hour 2 5 birthings out 5,0.5233870967741936,0.11935483870967742,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.19}"
5.0,This one might not MENT To Be!,"LIKES:The Acting: Weird as it may be, the acting is another fine example of awesome acting making the nightmare inducing tale come to life in so many ways. This time setting the roots in English acting territory, the execution of the characters was that blend of culture, quality, and panache that this band of actors can bring. Essiedu needed more time, but holds a lot in the time he has for making a very large component of the story that drives much of this ambiguous delivery and plot. Certainly, welcoming the drama element, there was much potential in this actor for future projects. Kinnear is a perfect casting for the creepy element, a character that holds a lot of potential in this creepy thriller. His presentation matches the mood of the entire movie, mannerisms, look, and the delivery all intertwined together to make a character that is unsettling in so many ways that you aren't quite sure what is in store. Throw in the other element he executes in this movie, and we have another prime horror/thriller champion for future projects to come. The winner is Buckley though, a strong character who plays the entire premise well and holds the movie up with her massive talent. She is collected at times to be endearing, brings out the hurt of the demons that plague her, opens up the terror in just the right levels, and brings out the wolf in that manner that feels real and welcoming. That culmination was the star for the film for me and an example of elevated acting.The Music/Sound Editing: Certainly creepy, Men holds a lot of tactics to really get under your skin and establish the mood/elements of the film. The lack of sound is perfectly timed, opening up the isolation this movie brings, and not using it for jump scare bait. Then the music settles in, a haunting cacophony of synthesizer, orchestra and who knows what else to add that foreboding occult element these films thrive on to make them as disturbing as they can be. Finally, the small touches of a throat gasp, a disturbing squeal, or some other bump in the night to drop the security of the house even further. It's fantastic use of the audio element for setting the mood, and will probably get annoying to some who don't like these elements.The Elevated Horror: This is not the thing I go for, but I have to agree with other reviewers that Men goes for that deeper horror element than the usual slasher/popcorn flicks. A24 really dedicates their resources to making that elevated feel to the movie, and those who love layers and teaching horrors are in for a treat. It breaks that common mold and rolls deep in the mud with it accomplishing much in the 105-minute run time. You'll think, have to analyze, and certainly study the original tactics brought out to make this horror movie one to interpret for a while. If that is the style you want this movie is for you.Creepy: It's the type of horror that sticks with you and A24 continues to find ways to make films that stain themselves in your memory. Men does not shy away from the creepiness, but rather leans into it, going down rabbit holes you may not want to see to establish the discomfort they want to bring. Skin crawling antics, cringe worthy moments that will leave many squirming and an environment that robs you of practically any safety all await those bold enough to give this film a try. It's the type of horror that still gets a seasoned pro like me, but there are many things that may be sickening, so you've been warned.The Cinematography: Hands down the strongest element of this film is the camera work and the art of bringing all the disturbances to life. Garland's writing and direction maximize so much on the capture work, using the right filters, finding the right angles, and taking the right views to really get the best approach to the works. All those elements I have liked are pulled together by the awesome camera work to really give you the perfect dive into the wicked mind of Garland. All the inner turmoil our protagonist has get their own life with the direction he took, and seeing the final moments come to life, no matter how bizarre they are, is found to be presented in the best angle to maximize the moment.DISLIKES:Not Enough Character Time: I mentioned earlier that some actors hold potential, they just did not get a lot of time to execute it. Men's character usage is kind of lame at times and there were more elements to dive into had they balanced them more. While I get that there are more story elements that guide the limited character elements, I could see elements that would have worked with these guys and would have liked just a little more character interaction.Not As Much Story Elements: Men does not spoon feed you the story, and demands you do some work to figure out what is going on in this quaint little cottage. This is much of what ""elevated"" horror does, but I can't say this was the story element that blew my mind in the long run. Men's tale is kind of simple in the long run, and while it's deep and realistic in regards to the topics it faces, there are still elements that needed more to really be that quality tale like Hereditary. This weaker story element really falls at the end, and while it again goes with the theme of the story, it just does not have the punch their better works have held.Slow At Times: There is seldom an A24 film that does not have some very slow parts, and this movie is no exception. The artistic approach opens up for many detours from the linear tale, trying to take that metaphysical approach to set the stage and throw you curveballs in hopes of being original and mind melting. However, those gambits sometimes get a little out there for me, and going the extra mile of the shock factor took away from the story and pacing I was enjoying. That element for a tired reviewer makes the movie feel a little sluggish, which thankfully the chaos at the end alleviates as you run for the finish line.Disturbing Levels Going Too Far: Tied for my least favorite element of the movie, A24 pushes cinema on many frontiers including the shock factor elements that fill their horror movies. Once again, some of these moments I can handle and find perfect such as the appearance of the antagonist, the filters to evoke emotions, and even some of the defense maneuvers are unique and original. However, other times the movie goes way too far and in this case two elements that are not my beef are the nudity and the body horror they shoved into this film. It's not the classy or good nudity in my opinion, more of that too much focus on genitalia and seeing people we don't want to see naked again. And for the body horror, I can't say much, but it approaches Human Centipede level of horrors that does little but annoy, gross, and pull me away from the film.The Ending: It's an A24 ending and you know their love of dropping the ending without so much as a finesse fairy tale ending, but just sort of cutting you off and letting you piece things together. Men happily does this again, but the other thing is the messed up, trippy, and lackluster finish to get to the final scene. The climactic sequence accomplishes disturbing, but the heat is missing in terms of putting me at the edge of my seat, which was boring. And once the body horror elements come in, the ending is more disgusting in the symbolic approach than thrilling, but for those that like that level of artistic scares it's perfect in so many ways.The VERDICT: Men is not my favorite A24 project and quite honestly falls on the lower end of the spectrum. In regards to being an elevated horror, it hits these levels to great heights that fans of the genre and presentation are going to love. The ambiguous story is a canvas for the artistic nature of the pains that Harper is facing, with great acting to make it come to life. Yet the music, environment, and cinematography greatly help bring the creepiness this film was trying to achieve and runs with it in spades. However, it might have run a little too far for my tastes, dropping story elements and characters to replace with the detours and wide topic scenes that A24 wants to tease your brain with. Then comes the body horror, the pace, and of course the ending, which seemed to muddy the waters and lose me to the grotesque and symbolic stuff he crammed in. It's going too far that I think got in the way for me, but again, if you want that original, off the wall, and ambiguous interpretations to your scare flick, you'll find this movie a valuable addition to your collection. My scores as a film as a whole are: Drama/Sci-fi/Horror: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0.",this one might not ment be,likes acting weird as it may be acting is another fine example awesome acting making

,A tour-de-force of allegory and symbolism. And just darn good horror.,"Men is a home horror brew, imperfect for its load of figurative tropes but pleasing to the metaphoric obsessions of an English major who loves allegory. Auteur Alex Garland has crafted a film so enjoyably horrific and thematically loaded as to please those tired of goody-two shoes super-heroes and limitless CGI.This intense treatise on the wrong's men do to women uses the standard object of fear, a single woman, Harper (Jessie Buckley), in a secluded English Cotswold cottage mending a heart devastated by the death (or suicide) of her husband, James (Paapa Essiedu). Various men enter her life, not one redeemable and most just downright ugly even when they physical aren't.The predominantly evil alpha male is a naked middle-aged man with scars to scare, who stalks her in a tunnel on the path and back to her house, even after the police roust him out but have to let him out. Even a seemingly benign local prelate has sexist views about her driving her husband to suicide, so she seems to have no protector except another female on a smart phone 4 hours away. Harper is alone with demented men, a perfect scenario for the horror-flick formula.Garland has done a yeoman's job larding his tale with symbols right down to when he offers pagan imagery of green men and Sheela-Na-Gigs, which help counter the misanthropy in favor of the men, who are misogynists. In effect, Garland has spent an entire film deriding the men but finds women also with some horrific responsibility.You're not quite sure what I mean when I characterize Garland as sated with symbols? Consider this obvious allegory: As Harper arrives at the cottage, she spies an apple tree from which she plucks and eats an apple, only to be chided by the owner, Jeff (Rory Kinnear).As a former English major, I delighted in the figurative gymnastics and multiple themes. However, the final birth scenes are almost too graphic for most women to stomach, much less delicate English major men. But the stuff of hard-core horror the images are.Anyway, if you're a female, you may enjoy the men in Men as stalking, walking misogynists, and if you're a male, just run and hide, but not in the Cotswolds.",tour de force allegory symbolism just darn good horror,men is home horror brew imperfect its load figurative tropes but pleasing metaphoric obsessions english major who loves allegory auteur alex garland has crafted film so enjoyably horrific thematically loaded as please those tired goody two shoes super heroes limitless cgi this intense treatise wrongs men do women uses standard object fear single woman harper jessie buckley secluded english cotswold cottage mending heart devastated by death or suicide her husband james paapa essiedu various men enter her life not one redeemable most just downright ugly even when they physical arent predominantly evil alpha male is naked middle aged man with scars scare who stalks her tunnel path back her house even after police roust him out but have let him out even seemingly benign local prelate has sexist views about her driving her husband suicide so she seems have no protector except another female smart phone 4 hours away harper is alone with demented men perfect scenario horror flick formula garland has done yeomans job larding his tale with symbols right down when he offers pagan imagery green men sheela na gigs which help counter misanthropy favor men who are misogynists effect garland has spent entire film deriding men but finds women also with some horrific responsibility youre not quite sure what i mean when i characterize garland as sated with symbols consider this obvious allegory as harper arrives at cottage she spies apple tree which she plucks eats apple only be chided by owner jeff rory kinnear as former english major i delighted figurative gymnastics multiple themes however final birth scenes are almost too graphic most women stomach much less delicate english major men but stuff hard core horror images are anyway if youre female you may enjoy men men as stalking walking misogynists if youre male just run hide but not cotswolds,0.43792794895736076,-0.003470276999688772,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"

Then she begins to sight naked men, and they proceed to attack her.It's a horror film, of course, but not a particularly original one.

This gets repeated about a dozen times over the movie's length.I have commented before that horror movies are not a genre I like, and this movie is a good example of why.

5.0,A film that's not theatre worthy....,"I was vastly disappointed with this film. Biggest takeaway. The build-up took too long and the release of that build-up was too smooshed together. While there unsettling moments that took place that were necessary to the build-up. There was a lot of space where, at least for myself, nothing relevant was happening and it caused me to reach moments of pure boredom.The basis to the story was intriguing, but overall I wasn't a fan of the open interpretation concept. For this film it feels like lazy storytelling.The acting wasn't half bad, but there was just too much dependence on one person's ability to hold the entertainment line. Eventually boredom settled in and I didn't care what happened to the characters.If I had to compare this movie to another film it would be ""Midsommar"" in the sense it builds-up in just a weird way that it eventually becomes more weird than spooky.Overall, I found this film to be a waste of time. Too long a film with a lot of empty space even with the weird, gruesome aspects that didn't settle right in the end. My recommendation is to wait for a home release. Don't waste the time seeing this in theatres.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time....

6.0,Panders To Nasty Misandrist Feminist Ideology,"The latest film to be directed by Alex Garland, director of highly acclaimed films Ex Machina (2014) and Annihilation (2018).The film follows the character Harper, a young woman who escapes to a country cottage after the death of her husband after he physically assaults her. While she vacationing, she has a multitude of experiences with men and boys that treat her disgustingly.This film was very curious from its preview trailer which gave almost nothing of the story away, so it's no surprise that just by the title alone, it's obvious the film has something negative to do with, yep, you guessed it - men.The film is creepy and has some very shocking scenes involving a nude man following Harper around the cottage and also a scene where a priest blames her for her husband being killed.It plays perfectly into the tired idea of male malevolence that feminist and mainstream propaganda would use circa 2016 to label all men ""dangerous"" and ""toxic"".Though the film has it interesting moments, it's nothing but a shocking and provocative tale of a woman surrounded by questionable males with questionable intentions with a run time of 100 minutes that is seven years late in relevance.Not a bad film, just another morbidly incorrect take on the idea that men are nothing but monsters whose apparent only purpose in life is to pursue, harass, invade, interrupt, and impose on women.If anything, I'd recommend going into this movie understanding it's a story for a certain kind of audience, looking to provoke and satisfy the ""I blame all men"" urges of both men and women who have fallen deep into the nastiest parts of misandrist feminist ideology.3/5.",panders nasty misandrist feminist ideology,latest film be directed by alex garland director highly acclaimed films ex machina 2014 annihilation 2018 film follows character harper young woman who escapes country cottage after death her husband after he physically assaults her while she vacationing she has multitude experiences with men boys that treat her disgustingly this film was very curious its preview trailer which gave almost nothing story away so its no surprise that just by title alone its obvious film has something negative do with yep you guessed it men film is creepy has some very shocking scenes involving nude man following harper around cottage also scene where priest blames her her husband being killed it plays perfectly into tired idea male malevolence that feminist mainstream propaganda would use circa 2016 label all men dangerous toxic though film has it interesting moments its nothing but shocking provocative tale woman surrounded by questionable males with questionable intentions with run time 100 minutes that is seven years late relevance not bad film just another morbidly incorrect take idea that men are nothing but monsters whose apparent only purpose life is pursue harass invade interrupt impose women if anything id recommend going into this movie understanding its story certain kind audience looking provoke satisfy i blame all men urges both men women who have fallen deep into nastiest parts misandrist feminist ideology 3 5,0.6472742200328405,-0.13985221674876852,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.46}"

Fleeing back to the house a further attempted break-in results in come physical trauma worthy of a Saw movie, followed by an extended sequence of body-dysmorphia horror before, well...Writer/director Alex Garland has acquired a vocal fanbase after Ex Mach8na, which I liked well enough, and Annihilation, which I felt needed rather more narrative clarity. Here, he dips his toe into horror. Specifically, this is that old favourite ""Is she going mental, or is there something genuinely peculiar going on?"" This conflict is helped along by the fact that there is something odd - let's call in the Arkay Factor - which connects the villagers together, and which can only be explained by one of those two possibilities.Which makes it all the more frustrating that the film chooses not to provide any clarification. I'm OK with ambiguous conclusions and unhappy endings but, when the entire premise of your film is ""Is it A or is it B?"" you owe your audience clarification, and the unresolved ending here didn't play fair.The atmosphere was good (if a little leisurely), Jessie Buckley was very good, Rory Kinnear showed breadth one had never previously expected from him, there were some well-executed effects and creative sound design, and wonderfully scripted and played flashback sene between Harper and her husband.But I deserved an explanation and not this cop-out.
