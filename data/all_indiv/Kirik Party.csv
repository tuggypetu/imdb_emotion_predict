4,Interesting Premise but overall a huge letdown!,"I don't watch a lot of kannada films...I pick and choose and look for kannada films that are popular and we'll appreciated, hence happened to stumble on Kirk Party! The IMDB ratings ensured that I gave it a try and I did. Result: A little disappointed!To start off I am really surprised that this film has such a cult following among audience...while everyone has a different taste but over the years I have seen that the really successful films have something unique that appeals to almost everyone the quantum of appeal could be different but appeal is undeniable.What works for Kirk Party is without a doubt the premise of engg college, boy meets girl and heartbreak that kind of is a magic formula...add to it popular actors you have a recipe for success! However when I started watching this film the initial set up was fine, infact the first half keeps you hooked without absolutely blowing you away. However, the second half is a real dampener....the lethargic pace does no good...I almost had to wait when the movie would end... The story in the second half is very uneven and slow ...the life goes out of the film.... Technically everything is in place without being spectacular....Actors have done justice. May be I had very high expectations, I expected it to be a lot more fun...the heartbreak angle did not land effectively... thought was over stretched the second half was whimsical to say the least.",interesting premise but overall huge letdown,i dont watch lot kannada films i pick choose look kannada films that are popular well appreciated hence happened stumble kirk party imdb ratings ensured that i gave it try i did result little disappointed start off i am really surprised that this film has such cult following among audience while everyone has different taste but over years i have seen that really successful films have something unique that appeals almost everyone quantum appeal could be different but appeal is undeniable what works kirk party is without doubt premise engg college boy meets girl heartbreak that kind is magic formula add it popular actors you have recipe success however when i started watching this film initial set up was fine infact first half keeps you hooked without absolutely blowing you away however second half is real dampener lethargic pace does no good i almost had wait when movie would end story second half is very uneven slow life goes out film technically everything is place without being spectacular actors have done justice may be i had very high expectations i expected it be lot more fun heartbreak angle did not land effectively thought was over stretched second half was whimsical say least,0.44686363636363635,0.10648863636363637,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,One hell of a fun ride!,"I wasn't around when Premaloka was released and pulled people to theaters big time. But, I assume it was the similar situation as today when you see people cheering, enjoying and celebrating the KIRRIK PARTY with such indulgence in and outside the theaters. I had been to the premier show and couldn't thank my friend more for asking me to join. The best part was the whole crowd sang in chorus for Sananvi as she appeared onto the stage after the premier, You know the same way the freshers sing for her in the film. Of-course she blushed in her typical killer way. Well, Though the film has its own plus and minuses, It keeps you smiling, laughing and heartbroken at times all through the 'Party's journey. Each and every character is so awesomely performed. The new boys are very much fun to watch. I was longing to see the gang more than Rakhsith himself. The beautiful girls, the well carved cinematography, the actors, dialogues, songs and most of all the screenplay, This movies has so much to take you off this world into its own college cocoon. Kudos to the Director Rishabh Shetty and the writers of the film. I am sure I will watch this one at-least 2 more times in cinemas.

9,Rakshit and team is a new year gift to the engineering students,"Kirik Party is a perfect mixture of comedy, emotion and action. Kirik party gives a big feast to the youngsters especially to the people of engineering background. The movie brings the feeling of their college days.Karna(rakshit shetty) starts being a naughty guy, later faces some tough situations and ends up to bring fear when someone hears his name.The story has unexpected twists which keeps the audience alive throughout the film. Few scenes in the second half seems to bore a bit but then the twists and emotions bring back the interest.Somewhere you get a feeling of Malayalam movies like Premam and Bangalore Days. Rakshit shetty has again given a stellar performance. He continues to keep the faith of his audience in every movie. Rashmika mandanna and samyuktha hegde gave the justice to their part. Execution of every scene has been incredible thanks to the Cinematography by karm chawla. Music and the background score by ajanish is simply great. Songs have been taken a big advantage in expressing the scenes.Overall Kirik party movie has lived up to those expectations and is not at all a 'Kirik' to any class of audience.",rakshit team is new year gift engineering students,kirik party is perfect mixture comedy emotion action kirik party gives big feast youngsters especially people engineering background movie brings feeling their college days karna rakshit shetty starts being naughty guy later faces some tough situations ends up bring fear when someone hears his name story has unexpected twists which keeps audience alive throughout film few scenes second half seems bore bit but then twists emotions bring back interest somewhere you get feeling malayalam movies like premam bangalore days rakshit shetty has again given stellar performance he continues keep faith his audience every movie rashmika mandanna samyuktha hegde gave justice their part execution every scene has been incredible thanks cinematography by karm chawla music background score by ajanish is simply great songs have been taken big advantage expressing scenes overall kirik party movie has lived up those expectations is not at all kirik any class audience,0.4127272727272728,0.13404040404040404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10,The Perfect Movie!,"It had been years since a movie as good as Kirik Party was screened across the theaters in Karnataka. It is evident that this film is nurtured and molded with care. Once the movie starts, nostalgia sets in. Like a sweet ride, it takes us back to the time in our lives I'm sure where most of us would want to revisit. This story blends with finesse a tale of friendship, love and a route to self discovery with ease, riddled with plenty of laughs right through to the end without a dull moment cropping up. You are guaranteed to exit the hall with a laugh. Director Rishab Shetty does a very good job of grabbing hold of your attention from scene one and not letting it go till the end credits roll. All the elements added to the story are pretty much what college goers go through collectively as a bunch. Coming to the acting, most of the cast are new comers and do more than just a decent job. The 'chemistry' between the characters is not forced and you can actually make out the bond the cast shares with one another. Again the credit must go to the director for extracting the best out of them. Both the leading ladies shine in their roles. The versatile actor Achyuth Kumar as always does a wonderful job in this comparatively smaller role. The music takes second place in this race to entertain the audience. Its refreshingly fresh. No song feels dragged on or repetitive. Each are of a different tune and melody. Music Director Ajaneesh Loknath brings something new to the table with every song that has something for everybody's liking. The nostalgic 'Katheyonda Helide' setting the tone for the movie, to the brilliant 'Hey Who are You' that has a sort of 90's feel to it, right to 'Kaagadada Doniyalli' sung by the upcoming singer Vasuiki Vaibhav penned by the wonderful Jayanth Kaikini are all perfect to the T. Last but not the least, the leading man, Rakshit Shetty takes the cake and eats it too. His work is as good as he did in 'UK'. He literally carries the movie on. From writing the story which is the true Winner here, to penning 'Katheyonda Helide' and 'Thirboki Jeevana' he shows his immense potential and his love for the craft. A man of many talents as he showed the world with his incomparable film 'UK', he's just scratching the surface of his potential I'm sure. Here's to a cult classic and hoping that Rakshit Shetty and the Seven Odds bring us more such visual treats.",perfect movie,it had been years since movie as good as kirik party was screened across theaters karnataka it is evident that this film is nurtured molded with care once movie starts nostalgia sets like sweet ride it takes us back time our lives im sure where most us would want revisit this story blends with finesse tale friendship love route self discovery with ease riddled with plenty laughs right through end without dull moment cropping up you are guaranteed exit hall with laugh director rishab shetty does very good job grabbing hold your attention scene one not letting it go till end credits roll all elements added story are pretty much what college goers go through collectively as bunch coming acting most cast are new comers do more than just decent job chemistry between characters is not forced you can actually make out bond cast shares with one another again credit must go director extracting best out them both leading ladies shine their roles versatile actor achyuth kumar as always does wonderful job this comparatively smaller role music takes second place this race entertain audience its refreshingly fresh no song feels dragged or repetitive each are different tune melody music director ajaneesh loknath brings something new table with every song that has something everybodys liking nostalgic katheyonda helide setting tone movie brilliant hey who are you that has sort 90s feel it right kaagadada doniyalli sung by upcoming singer vasuiki vaibhav penned by wonderful jayanth kaikini are all perfect t last but not least leading man rakshit shetty takes cake eats it too his work is as good as he did uk he literally carries movie writing story which is true winner here penning katheyonda helide thirboki jeevana he shows his immense potential his love craft man many talents as he showed world with his incomparable film uk hes just scratching surface his potential im sure heres cult classic hoping that rakshit shetty seven odds bring us more such visual treats,0.543638719557087,0.317261683894337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"

6,A Better 'Looking' Kannada Film,"I waited 7 days to watch the film because I had second thoughts of watching the film. The trailer showed glimpses of fun during engineering days and nothing to know what's so special about it. The previous film by this gang (though not by Rakshit Shetty's home production Paramvah which this film is) was Ricky and it was SO BAD. I hated it. And hence I went to watch Kirik Party with zero expectations. The film was delightful. There was nothing so unique or great about the story (Story by Rakshit Shetty & the 7 odds) or even the screenplay. I think Rakshit learnt a lesson that people of Karnataka don't appreciate good cinema (post a wonderfully executed Ulidavaru Kandanthe) and hence he has put his worth into the dialogues (which were written by Abhijit Mahesh & Dhananjay Ranjan. Hats off to them) and the looks of the lead character (played by Shetty). AND this works. The two newcomer actresses have acted to their character beautifully. Kudos to them. The supporting cast have played exceptionally. Achyuta plays a small character and no doubt he knows how to act brilliantly. Ajaneesh's work is worth more than an applause. Now the story. So much of Premam into it. Well, am not comparing Kirik to Premam. Premam was a class act. But Kirki has it's own platform yet it feels like a diluted version of Premam. The female characters, the style, the fights, the college days moments and Rakshit Shetty's looks. At one point I was taken back to 3 idiots with one scene. The film has its moments of laughter and even though there are incidents that hurt the lead character it doesn't make us feel the same. Unfortunately, it reminds me a lot of Premam. Apart from that, the film was worth a watch. It is definitely so much better than the remakes done by superstars of Kannada Film Industry. At least Rakshit and Rishab have self-respect. Next time Rakshit signs a 'Vaastu Prakaara' or a 'Godhi Banna..' or even a 'Ricky' he should look at Kirik Party and think twice before signing those kinds of films.",better looking kannada film,i waited 7 days watch film because i had second thoughts watching film trailer showed glimpses fun during engineering days nothing know whats so special about it previous film by this gang though not by rakshit shettys home production paramvah which this film is was ricky it was so bad i hated it hence i went watch kirik party with zero expectations film was delightful there was nothing so unique or great about story story by rakshit shetty 7 odds or even screenplay i think rakshit learnt lesson that people karnataka dont appreciate good cinema post wonderfully executed ulidavaru kandanthe hence he has put his worth into dialogues which were written by abhijit mahesh dhananjay ranjan hats off them looks lead character played by shetty this works two newcomer actresses have acted their character beautifully kudos them supporting cast have played exceptionally achyuta plays small character no doubt he knows how act brilliantly ajaneeshs work is worth more than applause now story so much premam into it well am not comparing kirik premam premam was class act but kirki has its own platform yet it feels like diluted version premam female characters style fights college days moments rakshit shettys looks at one point i was taken back 3 idiots with one scene film has its moments laughter even though there are incidents that hurt lead character it doesnt make us feel same unfortunately it reminds me lot premam apart that film was worth watch it is definitely so much better than remakes done by superstars kannada film industry at least rakshit rishab have self respect next time rakshit signs vaastu prakaara or godhi banna or even ricky he should look at kirik party think twice before signing those kinds films,0.5095622119815668,0.218778801843318,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6,A decent coming of age musical romance!,"Its over a century now since the medium of Cinema is known. It has been explored, improvised and exploited in various means. Whatever or however we talk about creativity, skilled writing the most important of it is the business side or the commercial part of it which is the end means. There is this growing feedback loop from audience to filmmakers within Sandalwood and the neighboring states which gives a sort of direction on which are the possible areas to explore for new projects. 2016 so far has been a good year with many experimental and break from usual theme films. The year ends with KirikParty one of the most expected, hyped and biggest film. Straight to the point the teams efforts are clearly felt on big screen and deserves to be appreciated.Every film has a framework or a genre and a target audience base.. The framework of the film has a direct influence on the audience base. The larger the window of the audience base the more likelihood of the film succeeding. The joyful youth is a green phase of life which most of us can connect and relate too. And there is a sizable student / youth community which is out there and ready to relish on a film that is on this theme. The success rate of a much similar kind of film by name ""Premam"" in Malayalam or ""3 idiots"" are evident benchmarks. I always had this thought why such themes are not attempted by filmmakers here. Glad that R & R (Rakshit and Rishab) took the challenge of realizing it. As a result we see Kirik falling in the category of coming of age college drama packed with music and romance, a flavor hardly attempted by anyone in Sandalwood in recent years. The college backdrop films has its own set of characteristics which are the same across the globe. Barring the crime angle the aspects that are prominent are the comical sequences in the class rooms, falling in love (does not matter it is junior or senior), the elections, the senior junior conflicts and the HOD / principal conflicts. This is a small and sweet world which is filled with unforgettable situations which etch through your mind your whole life. Kirik Party makes an honest attempt to take the audience through all these aspects. Its very surprising to see that there will be this one lecturer who stands out as a terrific comic (In Kirik its the lecturer in mechanical department). So many years have passed by but still such characters exist in real life. Just having the narrative with mindless fun does not get the film to create a hook to make you sit through. The disturbances, the transformation of the protagonist makes it a full circle. Kirik does have that element but the flow and the pace the narrative goes through does seem to have some issues. The dialogues probably lays the strong foundation for the film and that seems to work with the target audience. It was like a laugh riot. It is another thing that i hardly felt like laughing maybe i have a bad sense of humor or maybe there is a problem with my funny bone that i don't find things funny but rather silly. I have a strong feeling that a few of the audience may be with me in my small boat where as there is this huge jam packed crowd in mammoth sized ship cursing us, the people in the small boat that we have lost it. Completely understandable and i share that attribute! The film looks colorful and neat on big screen and exhibits great production quality. The locations in MCE Hassan gives an added flavor to the atmosphere. The casting is perfect. Its amazing to see Rakshit pulling off this role at ease. He looks very confident and when he is confident there is no doubt that he will go deep into the character that he portrays. New comers Rashmika Mandanna and Samyukta Hegde are great find. The freshness and the attitude in their performance is worth appreciating. Arvind Iyer also delivers a decent performance. I was impressed by him again. Pramod Shetty looks a bit out of place but manages to squeeze in with the limited scenes he is in. Sorry I could not get the names of the folks in the last bench and the pineapple party but they have ensured that the right support is provided. Karam Chawla is awesome with his amazing cinematography. I have always loved his work and he manages to surprise me again and again. The same is with Ajaneesh. The unique theme, the fun beats, the overall background score and the songs, he has given his best yet again. The art design and production design also shows off significance. The length of the film is an overkill but for most of the watchers that will not be a issue at all. Over all its a pretty decent effort.Paramvah is set to make history with its debut production and Personally i might not have had a high kick watching this film but this does not mean that it should be the same with other audience. I had to tone down to an extent to be with the film and it was a decent Okayish experience that i was left out with. But as said earlier this targets for a certain audience base.. R&R already having executed a UK kind of film on which i have a hangover even now and I have strong faith that we will get to watch a film of that kind of caliber owing to big business that Kirik will do.",decent coming age musical romance,its over century now since medium cinema is known it has been explored improvised exploited various means whatever or however we talk about creativity skilled writing most important it is business side or commercial part it which is end means there is this growing feedback loop audience filmmakers within sandalwood neighboring states which gives sort direction which are possible areas explore new projects 2016 so far has been good year with many experimental break usual theme films year ends with kirikparty one most expected hyped biggest film straight point teams efforts are clearly felt big screen deserves be appreciated every film has framework or genre target audience base framework film has direct influence audience base larger window audience base more likelihood film succeeding joyful youth is green phase life which most us can connect relate too there is sizable student youth community which is out there ready relish film that is this theme success rate much similar kind film by name premam malayalam or 3 idiots are evident benchmarks i always had this thought why such themes are not attempted by filmmakers here glad that r r rakshit rishab took challenge realizing it as result we see kirik falling category coming age college drama packed with music romance flavor hardly attempted by anyone sandalwood recent years college backdrop films has its own set characteristics which are same across globe barring crime angle aspects that are prominent are comical sequences class rooms falling love does not matter it is junior or senior elections senior junior conflicts hod principal conflicts this is small sweet world which is filled with unforgettable situations which etch through your mind your whole life kirik party makes honest attempt take audience through all these aspects its very surprising see that there will be this one lecturer who stands out as terrific comic kirik its lecturer mechanical department so many years have passed by but still such characters exist real life just having narrative with mindless fun does not get film create hook make you sit through disturbances transformation protagonist makes it full circle kirik does have that element but flow pace narrative goes through does seem have some issues dialogues probably lays strong foundation film that seems work with target audience it was like laugh riot it is another thing that i hardly felt like laughing maybe i have bad sense humor or maybe there is problem with my funny bone that i dont find things funny but rather silly i have strong feeling that few audience may be with me my small boat where as there is this huge jam packed crowd mammoth sized ship cursing us people small boat that we have lost it completely understandable i share that attribute film looks colorful neat big screen exhibits great production quality locations mce hassan gives added flavor atmosphere casting is perfect its amazing see rakshit pulling off this role at ease he looks very confident when he is confident there is no doubt that he will go deep into character that he portrays new comers rashmika mandanna samyukta hegde are great find freshness attitude their performance is worth appreciating arvind iyer also delivers decent performance i was impressed by him again pramod shetty looks bit out place but manages squeeze with limited scenes he is sorry i could not get names folks last bench pineapple party but they have ensured that right support is provided karam chawla is awesome with his amazing cinematography i have always loved his work he manages surprise me again again same is with ajaneesh unique theme fun beats overall background score songs he has given his best yet again art design production design also shows off significance length film is overkill but most watchers that will not be issue at all over all its pretty decent effort paramvah is set make history with its debut production personally i might not have had high kick watching this film but this does not mean that it should be same with other audience i had tone down extent be with film it was decent okayish experience that i was left out with but as said earlier this targets certain audience base r r already having executed uk kind film which i have hangover even now i have strong faith that we will get watch film that kind caliber owing big business that kirik will do,0.5684252613857875,0.18952040771119733,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"

1,One of the worst films ever made,"This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever watched. From the trailer, I was expecting an entertainer with good humour, but was horrified as the movie was peppered with terrible jokes. Some of the good ones too went wide off the mark as the actors failed to deliver them with proper timing. There was also the feeling that the movie was trying more to set up for the jokes, with the incorporation of the jokes into the plot not being done smoothly. Because the movie seemed to come off as stylish and fresh, it was surprising the director chose to go with the old-fashioned and cringy ""romantic"" shots: zoomed in face as hair blows across the female's face as she smiles shyly, dozens of boys following women around, infatuated girl rests her chin on crossed arms as she tries to conjure a dreamy smile staring at the male. The characters lack depth and personality, with every male in the gang being essentially the same, but the most-paid and best-looking having better fortune and more importance. Karna, the protagonist,stalks the girl around uninvited, beats people up mercilessly, breaks into college to rewrite his exam, cheats his friends among other vices. But he is a good person. We have no reason to believe this, except for the female lead telling us he has another side, and him once driving a pregnant woman to the hospital (not by choice). There is no plot to speak of, no well- developed characters to be interested in and no humour to entertain. Totally lost faith in the Kannada movie industry after this disaster",one worst films ever made,this is undoubtedly worst movie ive ever watched trailer i was expecting entertainer with good humour but was horrified as movie was peppered with terrible jokes some good ones too went wide off mark as actors failed deliver them with proper timing there was also feeling that movie was trying more set up jokes with incorporation jokes into plot not being done smoothly because movie seemed come off as stylish fresh it was surprising director chose go with old fashioned cringy romantic shots zoomed face as hair blows across females face as she smiles shyly dozens boys following women around infatuated girl rests her chin crossed arms as she tries conjure dreamy smile staring at male characters lack depth personality with every male gang being essentially same but most paid best looking having better fortune more importance karna protagonist stalks girl around uninvited beats people up mercilessly breaks into college rewrite his exam cheats his friends among other vices but he is good person we have no reason believe this except female lead telling us he has another side him once driving pregnant woman hospital not by choice there is no plot speak no well developed characters be interested no humour entertain totally lost faith kannada movie industry after this disaster,0.4651960784313725,0.09877450980392156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"
