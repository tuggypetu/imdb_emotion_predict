4.0,Slender Man: Another missed opportunity,"This latest version of the Slender Man mythology seems to be universally reviled though I don't entirely understand why. It's not great but it's simply not THAT bad.Alike Lovecraft Slender Man seems to be one of those commonly used subject matters that always seeems to miss the mark. Filmmakers just don't seem to be able to make the most out of the fantastic material presented before them.So yet again we see a tale of a group of young folks on the run from the Slender Man and spooky things happen. Yadayadayada.With a decent young cast including Joey King and Annalise Basso we're presented with the glossiest and most high budget Slender Man movie yet. Sadly along with the budget comes all the usual Hollywood horror flaws, demonstrating once again how badly Hollywood have lost their way when it comes to the entire genre.Sure it looks great, but the plot tail spins out of control by about the halfway mark and that's such a shame as up until then it was showing real potential. Hollywood need to go back to the drawing board, hire indie filmmakers to adapt material otherwise we'll just keep getting this Insidious/Conjuring tripe.Slender Man has it's moments and the concept is pure gold, this however is more squandered potential.The Good:It's Slender Man!AtmosphericGreat castThe Bad:Plot falls apart badlyPotential isn't metToo many common tropes and clichesThings I Learnt From This Movie:Slender Man mythology is fantastic but really inconsistent, no wonder they get it so wrong with adaptationsJoey King and Annalise Basso are going to be big starsSlender Man is like Aliens (Xenomorphs), he needs keeping in the shadows or he looks a bit sillyThis should have been called The Ring: Slender Man",slender man another missed opportunity,this latest version slender man mythology seems be universally reviled though i dont entirely understand why its not great but its simply not that bad alike lovecraft slender man seems be one those commonly used subject matters that always seeems miss mark filmmakers just dont seem be able make most out fantastic material presented before them so yet again we see tale group young folks run slender man spooky things happen yadayadayada with decent young cast including joey king annalise basso were presented with glossiest most high budget slender man movie yet sadly along with budget comes all usual hollywood horror flaws demonstrating once again how badly hollywood have lost their way when it comes entire genre sure it looks great but plot tail spins out control by about halfway mark thats such shame as up until then it was showing real potential hollywood need go back drawing board hire indie filmmakers adapt material otherwise well just keep getting this insidious conjuring tripe slender man has its moments concept is pure gold this however is more squandered potential good its slender man atmosphericgreat castthe bad plot falls apart badlypotential isnt mettoo many common tropes clichesthings i learnt this movie slender man mythology is fantastic but really inconsistent no wonder they get it so wrong with adaptationsjoey king annalise basso are going be big starsslender man is like aliens xenomorphs he needs keeping shadows or he looks bit sillythis should have been called ring slender man,0.5597576147576148,0.060115830115830125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.28}"
2.0,How to ruin a completely simple formula,"It's not Slenderman himself that's scary, it's the alone-in-the-dark deafening silence and dread that made the game frightening. Freddy Krueger was scary in the first Nightmare because they didn't focus on the character, but rather the psychological terror. Slenderman tries and fails to build a story around something that only needed to bring a feeling. It tried to get us involved in the lives of shallow and boring cookie-cutter horror-movie fodder characters. The horror genre needs to be left to the artistically gifted and intelligent artists. Slenderman is yet another mass produced generic label product waiting to be forgotten. Watch the trailer, it's way better than the movie. Or better yet, watch The Ritual for a better example of what Slenderman should have looked like.",how ruin completely simple formula,its not slenderman himself thats scary its alone dark deafening silence dread that made game frightening freddy krueger was scary first nightmare because they didnt focus character but rather psychological terror slenderman tries fails build story around something that only needed bring feeling it tried get us involved lives shallow boring cookie cutter horror movie fodder characters horror genre needs be left artistically gifted intelligent artists slenderman is yet another mass produced generic label product waiting be forgotten watch trailer its way better than movie or better yet watch ritual better example what slenderman should have looked like,0.5595238095238095,-0.046666666666666676,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"

5.0,Derivative and predictable...but certainly NOT Bottom 100 worthy.,"Currently, ""Slender Man"" has the distinction of being on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...the 100 worst rated major release films. While I certainly didn't enjoy the film, it seems odd that this one made the list when there are so many worse modern horror films which somehow avoided the list. I just can't see this as the 50th worst film....let alone 500th.The idea of the film is taken from a pre-existing story of a 'Slender Man' who will kill or make folks crazy who are dumb enough to call upon him. In many ways, the film is a very derivative project--using the existing notions as well as infusing it with ample parts ""The Ring"" as well as the ""Bloody Mary"" story that's been floating around for decades. With ""Bloody Mary"", a person supposedly calls the name out repeatedly until some murderous other worldly thing appears.The story begins with four very dumb high school girls having a sleepover. They find some info on the internet about a Slender Man and despite being warned, they summon the creature...and the rest of the film is about them each disappearing or going mad one after the other.The movie has a scary style to it, with its pulsing music and bass....though after a while it does become annoying instead of scary. The story itself is nothing new...consisting of lots of ideas from other stories, urban legends and films. The acting and direction are fair. My only serious complaint is that I wish it HAD been awful...that would have made it a lot more interesting.",derivative predictable but certainly not bottom 100 worthy,currently slender man has distinction being imdbs infamous bottom 100 list 100 worst rated major release films while i certainly didnt enjoy film it seems odd that this one made list when there are so many worse modern horror films which somehow avoided list i just cant see this as 50th worst film let alone 500th idea film is taken pre existing story slender man who will kill or make folks crazy who are dumb enough call upon him many ways film is very derivative project using existing notions as well as infusing it with ample parts ring as well as bloody mary story thats been floating around decades with bloody mary person supposedly calls name out repeatedly until some murderous other worldly thing appears story begins with four very dumb high school girls having sleepover they find some info internet about slender man despite being warned they summon creature rest film is about them each disappearing or going mad one after other movie has scary style it with its pulsing music bass though after while it does become annoying instead scary story itself is nothing new consisting lots ideas other stories urban legends films acting direction are fair my only serious complaint is that i wish it had been awful that would have made it lot more interesting,0.6129041283919332,-0.16129658958927248,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.47, 'Fear': 0.25}"
6.0,Bland,"Slender Man is okay. Basic formula you've seen before in these cheap horror movies. It's not scary, nor is it bad enough to be enjoyable in that sense. Surprisingly some of the cinematography looks good and there's some interesting surrealist moments, but the acting is okay at best and the dialogue is sometimes quite cringey. ""Scares"" are mostly just jump scares and a lot of the scenes felt the same. The source material is hard enough to work with so those familiar with Slendy's origins will find this strangely adapted. Slender works more for creepypastas and video games, not so much cinematically. Far from the worst horror movie made, but definitely disappointing, although what would you expect from a Slender Man movie coming out in 2018? Some will hate this movie because of how bland it is, and I could totally understand that, but from a more objective perspective, it's a functional film that lacks spirit. Not really worth seeing.",bland,slender man is okay basic formula youve seen before these cheap horror movies its not scary nor is it bad enough be enjoyable that sense surprisingly some cinematography looks good theres some interesting surrealist moments but acting is okay at best dialogue is sometimes quite cringey scares are mostly just jump scares lot scenes felt same source material is hard enough work with so those familiar with slendys origins will find this strangely adapted slender works more creepypastas video games not so much cinematically far worst horror movie made but definitely disappointing although what would you expect slender man movie coming out 2018 some will hate this movie because how bland it is i could totally understand that but more objective perspective its functional film that lacks spirit not really worth seeing,0.5233870967741936,0.1064516129032258,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2.0,This was ridiculous...,"Right, well first of all a movie based on a laughable urban myth or legend hardly makes for much of a foundation for success. Then top that off with having a movie that was downright laughable in script, plot, character-wise and fully devoid of scary moments, and you have the 2018 movie ""Slender Man"" from director Sylvain White.I had to divide this movie into two, I couldn't suffer through the hardships of sitting down and watching it in one prolonged go. It was just that painful to bear witness to. I managed to endure 50 minutes in the first sitting, then had to give up. And I had essentially given up on the movie entirely, but my wife convinced me to watch the rest of it on the next day. So I did... And let's just say that the rest of the movie didn't do anything to lift up the ordeal that was the first 50 minutes.The entire movie was wholly and fully devoid of anything that would be scary to a grown up, which leads me to believe that this movie was intended for the same kind of airheaded audience whom would also believe that the Slender Man legend is actually true.The characters in the movie were unbelievably stupid, one-dimensional and completely devoid of any sense of intelligence and common sense. It was just painful to witness their actions and the way they milled about on the screen. Now, I am not saying that the actresses were subpar or inadequate. No, not at all. I am saying that the characters written for the story could just as easily have been portrayed by cardboard cutouts.Once the movie ended, you didn't even fell that the movie had come full circle. It had just dragged you along by the nose for the entire duration that it ran for, without providing any kind of proper entertainment.Do not succumb to the same mistake that I did when I went to watch this movie. The trailer actually made it look interesting. The actual movie, well let's just say that watching grass grow is far scarier...",this was ridiculous,right well first all movie based laughable urban myth or legend hardly makes much foundation success then top that off with having movie that was downright laughable script plot character wise fully devoid scary moments you have 2018 movie slender man director sylvain white i had divide this movie into two i couldnt suffer through hardships sitting down watching it one prolonged go it was just that painful bear witness i managed endure 50 minutes first sitting then had give up i had essentially given up movie entirely but my wife convinced me watch rest it next day so i did lets just say that rest movie didnt do anything lift up ordeal that was first 50 minutes entire movie was wholly fully devoid anything that would be scary grown up which leads me believe that this movie was intended same kind airheaded audience whom would also believe that slender man legend is actually true characters movie were unbelievably stupid one dimensional completely devoid any sense intelligence common sense it was just painful witness their actions way they milled about screen now i am not saying that actresses were subpar or inadequate no not at all i am saying that characters written story could just as easily have been portrayed by cardboard cutouts once movie ended you didnt even fell that movie had come full circle it had just dragged you along by nose entire duration that it ran without providing any kind proper entertainment do not succumb same mistake that i did when i went watch this movie trailer actually made it look interesting actual movie well lets just say that watching grass grow is far scarier,0.5220143613000756,0.014011715797430083,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1.0,Worse than the Bye Bye Man,"I never thought I'd see a horror movie worse than Bye Bye Man...Where to start... I don't have a single positive thing to say, everything is terrible! There are no characters, the acting sucks, the writing is terrible, the effects are bad, the direction is boring, it's all tedious garbage.It's as if huge chunks of the film have been cut out, there's barely any gore, characters straight up disappear for no reason, and alot of footage from the trailer is missing. Instead of a cliché horror movie, we have a ""nothing"" horror movie.While The Bye Bye man was hilariously bad in all aspects, Slender man is just boring and frustrating. It's a film that was made 5 years too late, containing the absolute bare minimum amount of effort. I do not recommend it.Thanks for another hit Sony!",worse than bye bye man,i never thought id see horror movie worse than bye bye man where start i dont have single positive thing say everything is terrible there are no characters acting sucks writing is terrible effects are bad direction is boring its all tedious garbage its as if huge chunks film have been cut out theres barely any gore characters straight up disappear no reason alot footage trailer is missing instead clich horror movie we have nothing horror movie while bye bye man was hilariously bad all aspects slender man is just boring frustrating its film that was made 5 years too late containing absolute bare minimum amount effort i do not recommend it thanks another hit sony,0.5792306178669815,-0.3020070838252656,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.21}"
1.0,It's as lifeless as Slender Man's blank face,"Sometimes a single line of dialogue can stand out in such a way that you instantly realize that a movie is awful. For 'Slender Man,' that line came from Joey King.""He's like a computer virus except he gets inside your body and messes with you!"" Oh, so you mean like a virus? Why didn't you just say, ""he's a like a virus.""Several times throughout the film, that sort of hack writing shows its ugly face (as opposed to Slender Man, who technically can't be ugly because he has no face). There are zero clever lines delivered. Most of dialogue sounds like it was written by a Twitter bot designed to simulate mundane teen talk.The putrid writing isn't limited to the dialogue-the characters themselves contain about as much detail as one could write on a Post-it note. I think of the four main characters as, girl A, girl B, girl with a sister, and token non-white girl. They're essentially indistinguishable from one another. The only difference is that some are slightly more talented performers, and, of course, the most talented girls are the first to disappear from the story.What's really striking about the girls is that, even though they're allegedly best friends, they don't even seem to like each other. At one point, I girl makes a catty, resentful remark about her ""friend's"" trophies. Later, she says, ""I thought you didn't care about track. I thought you cared about Chloe."" (It's a miracle that I remember her name).That moment is striking for a couple reasons. One, it doesn't seem like something that should be said between good friends, and, two, I hardly realized the girl ran track. Probably because it's never shown in the movie. I imagine the track angle played a larger role in an earlier draft then removed, but this line was left in. Editing isn't the movie's strength.When the girls aren't making odd comments to each other or expressing all the liveliness of a folding chair, they're attempting to appear scared. To show that they're scared, they basically do an impression of a panting dog that's trying to speak. It's a lot of breathing and stammering. Acting is also not this movie's strength.All the above flaws are enough of a turnoff, but the worst offense of this movie is that it's a scary movie that's not scary. It's painfully dull and devoid of anything that may actually make it entertaining. It's as if all the interesting scenes were removed. Why, I'm not sure. Maybe they also cut out the parts that made this appear to be a coherent story.'Slender Man' is one of the worst movies of 2018. It's not a scary movie that's so bad that it's secretly kind of fun. It's just a bad, boring movie.

1.0,"Awful, with Fake Reviews","The first point that highlights in ""Slender Man"" is the awfully dark cinematography that makes impossible to distinguish what is happening for example in the woods during the night.

,"Poorly Made, Not Scary and Rather Annoying","Slender Man (2018) 1/2 (out of 4)Four teenage girls are having a sleepover when they decide that it's a good idea to jump online and search out the Slender Man. They come across a website that will call to him so they do it. A week later one of the girls go missing so the other three set out to contact Slender Man in hopes of getting her released.SLENDER MAN got released to some of the worst reviews in recent history and there's no question that it's quite awful but at the same time the film was mildly better than SMILEY. If you've never heard of that horror movie then go check it out. In all honesty, SLENDER MAN deserves all of the horrible reviews that it has gotten because it's pretty darn awful from start to finish. I will say that it avoids a BOMB rating from me because, believe it or not, it does move at a fast pace at least and I'll also say that I didn't expect the outcome of the film.With all of that being said, there's no question that the filmmakers of this really didn't know what they were doing as the story itself is quite dull and even worse is the fact that the story never makes too much sense. The Slender Man is never really explained so it seems they are expecting the viewers to already know the myth. One of the biggest problems with the film is the fact that the Slender Man isn't creepy and the first time we see him it's done so poorly that you have to wonder how this film got released. Even worse is the video that the girls watch to contact him. Jeez, really?The screenplay is pretty darn bad and so are the four lead characters. There's not an interesting one among them and even the supporting players are bad. Not for a second did I care for any of them and I certainly didn't care if the lost girl was ever found. The CGI effects are all pretty bad, the cinematography is poor and the overly dark look of the picture certainly doesn't help things. In all honesty there's not much to recommend here.Is SLENDER MAN the worst horror film ever made? Absolutely not as there are hundreds more out there that are a lot worse.

3.0,Don't bother.,"Is it that I'm getting older, and simply don't have the same enjoyment for horror films? Or is it the case that I still love horror films, but the genre is well and truly down the pan right now? I think the latter is true.This isn't what I would call a badly made movie, for the most part the acting is acceptable, it's nicely edited. The trouble is it's just so incredibly dully, the scares are quite literally non existent, they had some decent ideas, but didn't go for it, everything is tame.Once again, as is so often the case, the characters aren't likeable in any way, shape or form, so the quicker the Slender Man gets them the better.As for the Slender Man, did they pinch The Silence from Doctor Who?

2.0,Lifeless man,"Despite 'Slender Man' being one of the year's most poorly received films, more than once cited as one of the worst films of 2018, the premise was actually really intriguing and did have potential to work. So this is not coming from someone who wanted 'Slender Man' to fail, far from it. Also have an appreciation for horror and saw it with an open mind, just want to make all of that clear before somebody else tries to invalidate and criticise the opinions of those who disliked it. Seeing it, 'Slender Man' turned out to be that bad, for me it is one of the year's worst along with 'The First Purge' (have seen a lot of 2018 films so this is hardly coming someone hopefully with a sheltered life) and deserving of the panning it's gotten. Not quite worst of SyFy or The Asylum bad, it's not as amateurish, intelligence-insulting or non-trying-ish. It is however difficult to believe that it got a cinema release when it could easily pass for direct to video.The only halfway decent things with 'Slender Man' are the spooky setting and the atmospheric and moody lighting. Both not shining as much as they should have done, thanks to camera work that's at times chaotic and at other times self-indulgent, sloppy editing that made me physically ill and nausea-inducing use of flashing images. The sound is over-bearing and too obvious that it affects the horror.It is also very cheesy and awkward-sounding in the dialogue. The direction is pedestrian and while the cast try gamely their performances are thin and ill-served by having little to work with, clunky script-writing and poorly developed and bland characters doing them in. Worst of all is the story and the atmosphere. On top of not being ""fun"", 'Slender Man' fails badly at its two main objectives, being scary and being interesting. There is no tension, suspense or sense of dread for the horror to work, the reactions are too indifferent, the pacing is deadly dull and there is far too much of an over-reliance on jump scares, all without build up and incredibly predictable.From start to finish, 'Slender Man' feels like a short film over-stretched to lifeless breaking point. As said there are real issues with pacing and that there is far too little in the storytelling to sustain the length.

It seems to have really polarised reviewers, looking through the 300+ reviews on IMDB it seems to score either 10 or 1. I'm not sure exactly what people were expecting from this movie, but for me it was an very enjoyable watch, suspenseful, creepy, disturbing at times. Perhaps the negative reviewers would be more happy with a 10th installment of SAW, or another generic slasher movie. A couple of reviews mention bad acting, which I disagree strongly with. I thought it was well acted, not too over the top screamy, with a certain degree of naivety. It is a bit of a slow burner, but engaging, and builds the suspense all the way through.

3.0,More is less,"Much like the Blair Witch, Slender Man has always been scarier as an idea within the lore built around it than as a literal and physical presence of it. We laud what the Creepypasta community has done to up the ante with the character originally created by Victor Surge (properly credited at the end of the film as an early billing), and there have been positively freaky spins on the subject matter such as the YouTube project Marble Hornets, yet there have also been negative effects attributed to the character in the attempted murder in Wisconsin by prepubescent female friends. The tormenting figment of our minds is spooky enough to carry throughout 90 minutes of film with flashes here and there. Apparently Sylvain White (director) and David Birke (screenwriter) didn't get the memo.I won't pretend like I could have written or made a better film, but I don't know if the right plot was chosen here. This is a story where SM is already embedded in the national consciousness and skeptical friends decide to attempt to summon him, only to bear the burden of his haunting, kidnapping and/or killing. I personally would have liked to see this have gone in one of three different directions: (1) have a tone more like The Ring where the demonic evil is not known as a figure but simply as a watched video with a curse (they even mention ""virus"" that would be a lot like the Ringu series and get into the anatomy of it), with no alias or concrete image in association to it; (2) let it play out more like a psychological horror, even if it means recapturing elements inspired by the stabbing incident four years ago; (3) found footage fashion, but Marble Hornets already did that, so I'll annex that recommendation immediately. There would be larger opportunities to provide a certain cloud of mystery and intrigue to explore something further, rather than simply to have too tangible of a grasp on the subject matter. Idea #2 might glorify and inspire that notion a little more than we need though, and since idea #1 would tie more closely to the film's actual events I'd say that #1 would be my personal go-to. In fact, when the girls watch the video it actually reminded me of The Ring to begin with, and that was a good thing; too bad they did not continue much down that path.Characters also never really had any kind of realistic dialogue. The opening conversation between two schoolmates just has you thinking: ""This feels like they're reading a script."" That's never a good thing. Like many horror movies, characters have trouble elaborating what they see and feel with each other, and it comes at an unnerving level here. Only one character ever tries to really cope with what's going on in a verbal manner, but she simply doesn't push enough to bring the others to her side and it feels like a lost cause. I'll admit that she tries, but she doesn't articulate herself well enough and from the outside looking in just comes off as sounding irrational. Well-written horror movies have characters who can actually think and speak rationally, yet still have trouble being able to overcome their villainous adversities.The way it was shot was another concern of mine. This film is dark, and by that I mean it is dimly lit to a fault. I know they probably opted for more natural lighting at times, but even then there are no carefully-constructed shots to contrast silhouetted characters with some sort of lighter background from a light or a dusk evening sky. Even many interiors seem like people forget to pay their electricity bills as they only light up the bare minimum amount. Forget tone, this was just a slighted level of realism that probably could have resolved a lot of the characters' dumb moments if they just turned on a couple of more lights at times. They're also always going out on their lonesome after sunset, which tends to be a recipe for disaster. White chose to let sound play a major role in the film, but often did not establish a shot for us to sense our place in the scene. Everything looked too same-ish to lack the feeling of impact moments take place as they should. I think the choice of shots got better as the film went on, but at that point it was too little too late.There were three scenes in the middle of the film that are almost back-to-back-to-back that probably provide the best overall tension. All three scenes have great buildup, but unfortunately only one executes strongly and the other two flatten out rather quickly. This mostly has to do with the fact that they try too hard to show more, and the effect is lessened as a result. That, or like many horror films it is just poorly edited (sorry to stray off-topic, but speaking of poorly edited... in the beginning of the film there is a ""One week later"" moment that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen and it fades away the moment it comes on that you might actually miss it). The scene that pulls off its moments well works because of SM really only appearing soft in the background if that, and a lot of mentally-jarring moments for the character that make the sequence feel nightmarish. If more scary moments in the film were like this or if there were less attempts at scaring the audience in general, it would have heightened these moments much more and become extremely effective. Alas, it was not meant to be and we are resorted to cheap thrills. What makes matters worse is that I think some moments would have been great without inserting eerie music alongside them, and I don't want to call them jump-scares because to be honest there aren't too many here (most times they are intentionally telegraphed as they creep into the frame, but the ones that are there could have served better without the score).Before those three scenes that I mentioned (and outside of watching the main video), the story really had trouble grabbing me; past those three scenes (outside of a great 'mentally disturbing images' sequence and one of the visual shots near the end of the film), the story really begins to whimper out. It tries to work in two other characters to an extent and does not deliver on carrying out their arcs throughout (add in one of the main characters as well), parent involvement is set to a bare minimum and they are useless when present (in fact, there's a weird bit where someone thinks they are at the wrong address because they didn't see any cars in the driveway... ever hear of a garage??), there is little to no conveyed emotion for the loss of people near and dear to the main characters to feel their motivation as a great driving force, nobody ever listens to anybody in the film except when it's a detriment to their cause, and for some strange reason the girls all know the passwords to each others' laptops (just a small nitpick on my end). Worst of all, Slender Man was only slightly imposing and just not very scary, and he appears far too often. When I watch the Marble Hornets series on YouTube and he rarely appears in a quick couple of frames, I get the most unsettling chill in my body. When I play Slender and am traveling the forest as the stomps begin happening, the tension ramps up and gets me in the right mood to freak me out when something actually happens, no matter how scary. As a constant, Joey King was the only onscreen redeeming quality of this abhorrent mess.They should have gone with ""less is more,"" and they instead went for the reverse tactic. That did not work for Blair Witch (2016), and it's no surprise that it didn't work here as well. This wasn't even in the ""so bad it's good"" camp unfortunately, and I am someone who will be curious to watch this regardless of any ratings. I do ask that you try and heed my warning when I say there is not much you are going to get from this movie. It wasn't scary, gripping, fun, exciting, or anything like that. Just a morose form of cinematic poppycock that probably came out five years later than it should have, and with the wrong story to boot. I just feel like they missed the mark on what makes Slender Man spooky, or they tried too heavily to rely on his spookiness to tell the story that they did.Oh, and the first trailer ending shots of the girl in the dress is not in the film. I don't even know who that girl is suppose to be, because she is not in the film either heh. Sorry to spoil you there (more of an anti-spoiler).",more is less,much like blair witch slender man has always been scarier as idea within lore built around it than as literal physical presence it we

5.0,Not as bad as they'll have you believe,"At the time of writing this 'Slender Man' currently has an IMDb rating of 2.9. For anyone unfamiliar with the site that is incredibly low, for any film of any genre. Does the film deserve a rating that low? Not in my opinion, no. It is far from a perfect film and has many, many flaws, but what exactly has got it that low I can't say. The first thing you'll notice about this film is that it doesn't have the most attractive cast. We are used to horror movies having abnormally beautiful casts with actors and actresses who are perhaps not so great at acting. That really can't be said here and I think it was a good thing for the film. It made the characters feel more real and down to earth (mind you considering the subject matter for the film that goes out the window pretty quickly anyway).The films biggest sufferings come in the form of the writing. For one thing there are far too many dream sequences. I find most horror films have at least one these days unfortunately and that is bad enough. 'Slender Man' has at least half a dozen and they can be seen coming from a mile away. The dialogue is also especially sloppy in certain scenes.The character of 'Slender Man' is suitably creepy and definitely good enough to make a film out of. There are a couple of really good jump-scares, but there are a few appallingly bad ones too, like one where a woman simply walks past a character in a library.

7.0,Keep Your Blindfold On,"Slender Man was surprisingly decent, especially considering how clearly it's cashing in on the recently-declining, once-giant internet creepypasta phenomenon. It features horror alumni Joey King (The Conjuring, Wish Upon) and Annalise Basso (Oculus, Ouiji: Origin of Evil) and introduces Jaz Sinclair and Julia Telles to the genre, the latter turning in a great lead. I never would've guessed that she was 23; makeup and wardrobe did wonders helping her fit into a high school setting, as well as everyone else, for that matter. Joey King's characters have always ridden the fence between strong and annoying, but this was one of her best performances I've seen. Annalise Basso in particular has always been one of my favorite actresses, and here she delivers a more minor yet important role with ease. The story wasted almost no time ratcheting up the oppressive mood, starting as early as the third scene and not letting up for the rest of the movie. Aside from a few unintentionally silly moments, the camera work, audio, and transitional effects were mostly great, with one fantastic scene near the end reminding me strongly of the 1990 Tim Robbins movie Jacob's Ladder. Slender Man isn't the new Blair Witch, but it's likely to stick with you for a good while.
