10,So much better than Badla,"I didn't like Badla that much. Something was missing. Evaru is one of the very few movies which managed to be better than the original movie. The truth is I completely forgot about Badla because it wasn't that memorable movie for me. I only got to know that it's the remake after I watched Evaru. I haven't watched The Invisible Guest though. The only problem I felt with Evaru is that some camera angles were set so that we can see Reginna Cassandra's cleavage. Well, that's understandable cause the makers might have thought at least that will bring audience into the theaters. There are a few plot holes here and there. But Evaru is an awesome thriller.",so much better than badla,i didnt like badla that much something was missing evaru is one very few movies which managed be better than original movie truth is i completely forgot about badla because it wasnt that memorable movie me i only got know that its remake after i watched evaru i havent watched invisible guest though only problem i felt with evaru is that some camera angles were set so that we can see reginna cassandras cleavage well thats understandable cause makers might have thought at least that will bring audience into theaters there are few plot holes here there but evaru is awesome thriller,0.5407692307692307,0.17038461538461538,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.22}"

8,A Classic Telugu adaption (not a remake) of Classic Spanish Thriller 'The Invisible Guest' with much needed advanced theories.,"Evaru (2019) : Brief Review -A Classic Telugu adaption (not a remake) of Classic Spanish Thriller 'The Invisible Guest' with much needed advanced theories. Bollywood remade The Invisible Guest as 'Badla' but it was a simple copy-paste with just the gender change. There was nothing sort of advanced changes or thinking but Evaru managed to gamble with that. Evaru is an adaption, not a remake, i repeat not a remake. Those who understands the difference between adaption and remake would understand what i mean. It has lot of changes done in the original screenplay and all are much more advanced, realistic and reliable. Sub-inspector Vikram Vasudev is entrusted with the task of investigating the murder of a high ranking officer who was killed by his alleged rape victim. When he delves deeper into the case he uncovers some surprising facts. I have seen The Invisible Guest and Badla both, but still Evaru took me by surprise with couple of unpredictable twists. Yes, i am not kidding. And the changes are more realistic than the original. If you remember An Invisible Guest too had a few artificial twists which look little over the top, if not fully, but we forgave them by giving the excuse of cinematic liberty. Evaru is very responsible in that sense. It hardly has just one or two unclear theories but rest of the narrative is impeccable. I liked the idea of how they gave proper negative shades and past to the antagonist's character. That entire affair thing made more sense here than the previous two films. Adivi Sesh, Regina Cassandra and Naveen Chandra have delivered fine performances. The entire police angle is beautifully used by the writer and kudos for trying to look at the things with advanced vision. Venkat Ramji as director is simply fabulous. Not a single boring or dull moment in those 155 minutes. Overall, a Must Watch even if you have seen the original and that's a Big Thing you know.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",classic telugu adaption not remake classic spanish thriller invisible guest with much needed advanced theories,evaru 2019 brief review classic telugu adaption not remake classic spanish thriller invisible guest with much needed advanced theories bollywood remade invisible guest as badla but it was simple copy paste with just gender change there was nothing sort advanced changes or thinking but evaru managed gamble with that evaru is adaption not remake i repeat not remake those who understands difference between adaption remake would understand what i mean it has lot changes done original screenplay all are much more advanced realistic reliable sub inspector vikram vasudev is entrusted with task investigating murder high ranking officer who was killed by his alleged rape victim when he delves deeper into case he uncovers some surprising facts i have seen invisible guest badla both but still evaru took me by surprise with couple unpredictable twists yes i am not kidding changes are more realistic than original if you remember invisible guest too had few artificial twists which look little over top if not fully but we forgave them by giving excuse cinematic liberty evaru is very responsible that sense it hardly has just one or two unclear theories but rest narrative is impeccable i liked idea how they gave proper negative shades past antagonists character that entire affair thing made more sense here than previous two films adivi sesh regina cassandra naveen chandra have delivered fine performances entire police angle is beautifully used by writer kudos trying look at things with advanced vision venkat ramji as director is simply fabulous not single boring or dull moment those 155 minutes overall must watch even if you have seen original thats big thing you know rating 8 10 by,0.4386838624338625,0.12047619047619046,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
