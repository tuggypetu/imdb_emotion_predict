7,Not even a tenth as bad as others make it seem.,"To call this the worst movie of the year, or the worst movie ever shown in theaters, is sheer pompousness at its best.That being said; this is by no means a great movie. It is hilariously crude, random, and quirky, but the humour is obviously not for everyone. The Love Guru uses a tried, but true, comedy formula and rarely strays from it. However; some of the off-the-wall jokes will have you laughing your face off, and will keep returning to your mind, making you laugh days after you watched the film. The acting is par, and Steven Colbert delivers the funniest performance I've seen in a long while.Don't go into this film looking for genius or groundbreaking comedy mastery; go into this film expecting a decent laugh which you won't regret.",not even tenth as bad as others make it seem,call this worst movie year or worst movie ever shown theaters is sheer pompousness at its best that being said this is by no means great movie it is hilariously crude random quirky but humour is obviously not everyone love guru uses tried but true comedy formula rarely strays it however some off wall jokes will have you laughing your face off will keep returning your mind making you laugh days after you watched film acting is par steven colbert delivers funniest performance ive seen long while dont go into this film looking genius or groundbreaking comedy mastery go into this film expecting decent laugh which you wont regret,0.6046296296296296,-0.012962962962962938,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.08}"
7,It is what it is supposed to be! A Silly Parody!,"I read self-help books, I study religions and spirituality, and I thought this was a funny movie. Movies such as these teach us to not take life so seriously. It would seem that anyone who claims to have any sense of spirituality or enlightenment, and was offended by this movie, doesn't really understand Truth. To be pro the movie, or neutral to the movie is one thing, but to attack the movie, to be against the movie, would seem to be self-defeating. Attacking the movie gives energy (and publicity) to it, for which, I'm sure the makers are very grateful. I thought the headlines of certain people being 'outraged' by the movie were as humorous as the movie. Deepak knows...he took it in good fun.",it is what it is supposed be silly parody,i read self help books i study religions spirituality i thought this was funny movie movies such as these teach us not take life so seriously it would seem that anyone who claims have any sense spirituality or enlightenment was offended by this movie doesnt really understand truth be pro movie or neutral movie is one thing but attack movie be against movie would seem be self defeating attacking movie gives energy publicity it which im sure makers are very grateful i thought headlines certain people being outraged by movie were as humorous as movie deepak knows he took it good fun,0.6501653439153439,0.09424603174603174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.4}"
1,No love to be found here,"Mike Myers can't seem to get enough of himself in The Love Guru. He's constantly giggling at his own jokes, and mugging for the camera as if he thinks his latest comedy creation is the funniest thing he's invented. I had a very different reaction. Pitka was born in America, and traveled to India to study under the cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudah (Ben Kingsley), who taught his students lessons by having them hit each other with urine-soaked mops. Pitka devotes his life and his teachings to helping other people out with their relationship troubles, and hopes his words of wisdom will become so popular, he'll wind up on Oprah.This is information we learn early on in the film (after Pitka serenades us with a Bollywood-style musical number of Dolly Parton's Nine to Five during the opening credits), and I pretty much knew right there that The Love Guru was going to be a very long 90 minutes. The movie makes a grave miscalculation with its lead character. Guru Pitka is not funny or likable. It's simply Myers talking in a funny accent, and coming up with as many alternate ways for saying ""penis"" as he can without losing the film's PG-13 rating. Pitka is not even a real character. Myers plays him more as an experiment, as if he's still testing the character out, and we the audience are the guinea pigs being subjected to the experiment. It's been widely reported that the reason why Myers hasn't done a live action film in five years is because he's been fine tuning his Guru Pitka at various comedy clubs until he felt he was ready. He was not ready, and he probably should have spent another five years if the end result is any indication.Pitka is approached by Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), the owner of the struggling Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Her star player, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), hasn't been performing up to the best of his abilities ever since his wife, Prudence (Meagan Good), left him for the goalie on the rival team - a French player named Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake, embarrassing himself here) who is known for his over-sized ""manhood"" as much as he's known for his talent in the game. The character exists simply so that Myers and co-screenwriter Graham Gordy can have the characters say cock a lot more than humanly necessary. The Maple Leafs have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup, but not if Darren doesn't have his head in the game. The team's pint-sized coach (Verne Troyer) doubts that Pitka can turn the situation around, but the Guru is determined to help. He'll do this by finding a way to distract Darren from his problems (By forcing him to watch two elephants having sex, thereby taking his mind off of his problems with his wife. You figure it out.), and help him confront his over-bearing mother (Telma Hopkins), who has long cast a shadow over the star player.The Love Guru is not a comedy, it is a cry of desperation on behalf of Myers and everyone involved. Comedy is funniest when it seems to come naturally out of the material, but everything seems so forced and strained here. It's almost like if they can't think of something funny to do, they'll throw in elephants humping each other, or light a midget on fire. And if that doesn't work, they'll throw in another couple references to male genitalia. If there's a bigger cry of comic desperation than limp innuendo humor, then it has to be out of the blue musical numbers that are not funny in themselves, the movie just expects us to laugh at the fact that the characters are suddenly singing for no reason. You know, I think I'm going to have to take that last statement back. There's an even more desperate form of comedy, and that would have to be building an entire scene around the fact that Guru Pitka has a different kind of food stuck in his beard each time we see him, building up to a sight gag where his entire beard is cotton candy. This movie has so many scenes of just plain wrong-headed desperation, you'd almost think it was intentional.While Myers cackles and mugs his face with glee, pretending that he's having a great time, the rest of the cast kind of look like they wish they were somewhere else. Jessica Alba looks uncomfortable, and her scenes where she's supposed to be warming up to Pitka look more like she's hanging out with him out of pity more than anything else. It's not unusual in a comedy to have the supporting players stand in the background so the star can do his thing, but the cast here seem just as confused as I was as to what we were supposed to be watching Myers doing. There is not a single laugh or moment of inspiration in The Love Guru. It's just a sad, depressing slog through material that's not funny to start with, taken by actors who seem to know it's not funny. It's bad enough when a comedy can't generate any laughs, but it gets even worse when you start feeling sorry for everyone up on the screen. You want to ask them and their agents what they were thinking when they signed up. You want to remind Myers of just how funny he can be, and why this material and character don't suit him. But most of all, you want to be able to somehow turn back time to before you gave the ticket counter your money, walk back out the door, and figure out another way to spend 90 minutes.",no love be found here,mike myers cant seem get enough himself love guru hes constantly giggling at his own jokes mugging camera as if he thinks his latest comedy creation is funniest thing hes invented i had very different reaction pitka was born america traveled india study under cross eyed guru tugginmypudah ben kingsley who taught his students lessons by having them hit each other with urine soaked mops pitka devotes his life his teachings helping other people out with their relationship troubles hopes his words wisdom will become so popular hell wind up oprah this is information we learn early film after pitka serenades us with bollywood style musical number dolly partons nine five during opening credits i pretty much knew right there that love guru was going be very long 90 minutes movie makes grave miscalculation with its lead character guru pitka is not funny or likable its simply myers talking funny accent coming up with as many alternate ways saying penis as he can without losing films pg 13 rating pitka is not even real character myers plays him more as experiment as if hes still testing character out we audience are guinea pigs being subjected experiment its been widely reported that reason why myers hasnt done live action film five years is because hes been fine tuning his guru pitka at various comedy clubs until he felt he was ready he was not ready he probably should have spent another five years if end result is any indication pitka is approached by jane bullard jessica alba owner struggling toronto maple leafs hockey team her star player darren roanoke romany malco hasnt been performing up best his abilities ever since his wife prudence meagan good left him goalie rival team french player named jacques le coq grande justin timberlake embarrassing himself here who is known his over sized manhood as much as hes known his talent game character exists simply so that myers co screenwriter graham gordy can have characters say cock lot more than humanly necessary maple leafs have chance at winning stanley cup but not if darren doesnt have his head game teams pint sized coach verne troyer doubts that pitka can turn situation around but guru is determined help hell do this by finding way distract darren his problems by forcing him watch two elephants having sex thereby taking his mind off his problems with his wife you figure it out help him confront his over bearing mother telma hopkins who has long cast shadow over star player love guru is not comedy it is cry desperation behalf myers everyone involved comedy is funniest when it seems come naturally out material but everything seems so forced strained here its almost like if they cant think something funny do theyll throw elephants humping each other or light midget fire if that doesnt work theyll throw another couple references male genitalia if theres bigger cry comic desperation than limp innuendo humor then it has be out blue musical numbers that are not funny themselves movie just expects us laugh at fact that characters are suddenly singing no reason you know i think im going have take that last statement back theres even more desperate form comedy that would have be building entire scene around fact that guru pitka has different kind food stuck his beard each time we see him building up sight gag where his entire beard is cotton candy this movie has so many scenes just plain wrong headed desperation youd almost think it was intentional while myers cackles mugs his face with glee pretending that hes having great time rest cast kind look like they wish they were somewhere else jessica alba looks uncomfortable her scenes where shes supposed be warming up pitka look more like shes hanging out with him out pity more than anything else its not unusual comedy have supporting players stand background so star can do his thing but cast here seem just as confused as i was as what we were supposed be watching myers doing there is not single laugh or moment inspiration love guru its just sad depressing slog through material thats not funny start with taken by actors who seem know its not funny its bad enough when comedy cant generate any laughs but it gets even worse when you start feeling sorry everyone up screen you want ask them their agents what they were thinking when they signed up you want remind myers just how funny he can be why this material character dont suit him but most all you want be able somehow turn back time before you gave ticket counter your money walk back out door figure out another way spend 90 minutes,0.5137947962690231,0.09711518721828008,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"

1,Mariska HargitayThe Love Guru,"I've always been told that if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. So, I have to tell you all the best parts of the new Michael Myers vehicle, The Love Guru. You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer, Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs, Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities, and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given. If Jacques ""le coq"" Grande had his own film, I'd pay to see it. Being that he is included in one that relies on physical humor, asinine wordplay, sexual innuendo, and Myers making a complete idiot of himself as he kills the funny out of every only slightly funny gag he does, Timberlake becomes the only reason I can say it was worth going to a free preview. The Love Guru is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen and once I'm done writing this review I am going to crawl into bed and cry as I remember So I Married an Axe Murderer and the times when Myers could do no wrong (thanks for the Wayne's World callback Mike, you actually made me realize how inferior this film is more).There is truly no point in describing a plot because there isn't one. The film exists as a series of set-pieces allowing Myers to act up his schtick and try to cause uproarious laughter in the audience. Besides some faint giggles at the fact that Myers himself smiles and winks at the camera, telling us he just told a joke, there is not too much to go on here. Sure there is a ton of uncomfortable laughter and gasps of awe at the wordplay""can't face"" said real fast to sound likeahemthat you are shocked to hear in a PG-13 film, but does that really make you think the this was a success? I mean, the main focus is supposed to be the idea that Pitka has been hired to get the star player on the Toronto Maple Leafs back with his ex-girlfriend so that his hockey skills will return and win his owner, the second generation of a cursed family, ""Stanley's Cup"". You almost believe this thread has some merit until the resolution is glossed over quickly and rectified without the bat of an eye. The thing is held together by concert interludes of Myers singing in his way over-the-top Indian accent for entire songs. Can you say filler? (Although I will admit, ""More Than Words"" was fantastic, especially the visual nods to the actual Extreme video.) I might be wrapping this review up quickly to rest. My neck has some pain from too much shaking out of embarrassment for those collecting their paychecks on the screen. You could literally see the ca-ching dollar signs popping out of their eyeballs with every awkward moment. Some of the sight gags were funny, the first time they were used. I enjoyed the motorized magic carpet, the utter stupidity of Verne Troyer's office being half size, and the ""Kelestrator"" of course, (I wonder why they didn't TM that one). Admittedly, though, this is not my kind of comedy. While I enjoy a good low-brow laughfest like the next guy, I still would rather have a somewhat decently constructed story, something this tale lacks completely. Had the gags been separated and shown on a TV skit show, I might be calling them genius, however, when you string them together with the only common denominator being that the same characters are used, it gets old fast. Unfortunately, this film will work for a good chuck of America, but I just can't condone the spending of millions of dollars on something so trite and unenjoyable as this packaged and sold mess.Now I don't want to leave Timberlake as the only good thing here. That would be doing a disservice to Manu Narayan who played Myers' assistant. With spot-on timing and perfect facial expressions, it was good to see someone having fun playing off of the grotesque guru. A nice companion, he actually makes Pitka better each time they are doing a skit together. I'm not really sure what to say about Myers himself. On one hand, he totally commits to this character and must be given credit for that fact. The problem is, though, that the role itself is paper-thin and very, very tiresome. As for Romany Malco, our second leadalthough he got the shaft of no top-billinghe does well for what he has been given. Come on man, you were in the amazing 40-Year Old Virgin and have a hit TV show ""Weeds"" for which you are a big part of its success. Please take the time to do some work that has merit. I mean, wow, who'd have thought I'd be saying Get Smart might be your best movie option this weekend.Oh, and Ben Kingsleycan I have a word? I am going to have to take away your knighthood. Yes, I know how much you like it and how hard you worked to achieve the title, but I can't allow someone with as little self respect as you keep the ""Sir"". Why, oh why, would you continue to do drivel like this? You are an Academy Award winning thespian.

1,Bad karma or just bad movie-making? The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made,"I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2: The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by no-talents. In comparison, The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers, the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.With The Love Guru, you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers, but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing, we get the Guru Pitka, a Charles Manson look-alike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about ""life"" or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters, where the Guru doesn't really have any character; he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.Speaking of plot, the storyline is almost as ill-conceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every cliché ever known to cinema-goers, but it is. The Guru has a self-revelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course, Blur's ""Song 2"" plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used (and groan-inducing) tune for any sports-related film.Even if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as ""Dick Pants"" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of ""TM"" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"", the other a ear-splitting variation on ""Space Cowboy"" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).The other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.It really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy, yes, but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley.

7,Surprisingly Funny ONLY If You Don't Mind Stupid Humor,"I can see this movie is being murdered by reviewers on this board. Well, I'll give you my point of view on the film that I saw last night. Going in with low expectations, I actually found myself laughing VERY hard at certain parts of the film.Sure, most of the humor is stolen straight out of the Austin Powers series, but it's still funny. The performances by Mike Myers, Justin Timberlake, and Verne Troyer are hilarious. Mike Myers is great as always and Timberlake is surprisingly very funny. The interaction between Myers and Troyer (stolen straight from AP) is absolutely hilarious.If you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking movie, you're going to be sadly disappointed. But if you can't tell that from the preview, then maybe you should get your head checked out. The movie is all about ""moments"" and plays out like a long SNL sketch. If you can leave your mind at the door and accept the toilet humor, you might find yourself enjoying it.Most people reviewing the film 1/10 have probably not even bothered to see it. Others are coming on the board and marking high ratings as ""not useful"" and lower ratings as ""useful"". I will bet money that many people find review ""not useful"" by just looking at the 7 stars I gave it. There are many people just destined to see this movie fail because they think it looks stupid.

1,"If you were expecting a bad movie, well... you were actually right","The Love Guru, when I saw the trailer, I wasn't exactly laughing, but it was Mike Myers, the clever man who has brought us Austin Powers and Wayne's World, I had to have hope. Well, Mike Myers, I have no choice, I really wanted to slap the heck out of him when I was watching this painful movie. Now I'm convinced that Mike must have some obsession with the penis, because there are so many penis jokes in this movie it just becomes painfully unfunny. Now there was a decent audience in the movie theater, like twenty something people, I did not hear one laugh, seriously, I even kept sighing, wondering when this movie was going to be over. Five people left early complaining, I wished I had joined them, but something inside me was just hoping that something would make me laugh, I was really pulling for Mike, but he has just made me so unhappy with this bad movie that was just his pathetic attempt of constantly reminding people of his good comedic days.Guru Pitka is a self help guru who is very successful, but he is ranked as the number two self help guru of the world. The only way he feels like he can be successful is to be on Oprah. So he has to save a man, Darran, on a loosing hockey team in Canada to get him back with his ex girlfriend who is with this ""cocky"" winning goalie, Jacques Grande. Guru also meets the owner of the team, Jane, who he just falls for, so in order for him to get famous, he has to get Darran back with his girl and the team will start winning.Yeah, I'm serious, that's the ""plot"", sad, isn't it? I just seriously cannot believe how low Mike Myers has sunk, the cast was bad and the story was just, I don't think it was even existent. Now, I hate it when people call movies racist without even thinking what the movie is supposed to be, but you know what?! I was friggin' offended by this movie, it was just plan sad, Mike Myers has lost his game and cannot admit it. He should have just stuck to the animated voices, because his characters now are just lame. There is nothing I could say more than please just stay away from this film, I know I said this before, but this is just a painful and unfunny movie. Good luck to Mike Myers, he'll need it big time after more critics review this bad movie.1/10",if you were expecting bad movie well you were actually right,love guru when i saw trailer i wasnt exactly laughing but it was mike myers clever man who has brought us austin powers waynes world i had have hope well mike myers i have no choice i really wanted slap heck out him when i was watching this painful movie now im convinced that mike must have some obsession with penis because there are so many penis jokes this movie it just becomes painfully unfunny now there was decent audience movie theater like twenty something people i did not hear one laugh seriously i even kept sighing wondering when this movie was going be over five people left early complaining i wished i had joined them but something inside me was just hoping that something would make me laugh i was really pulling mike but he has just made me so unhappy with this bad movie that was just his pathetic attempt constantly reminding people his good comedic days guru pitka is self help guru who is very successful but he is ranked as number two self help guru world only way he feels like he can be successful is be oprah so he has save man darran loosing hockey team canada get him back with his ex girlfriend who is with this cocky winning goalie jacques grande guru also meets owner team jane who he just falls so order him get famous he has get darran back with his girl team will start winning yeah im serious thats plot sad isnt it i just seriously cannot believe how low mike myers has sunk cast was bad story was just i dont think it was even existent now i hate it when people call movies racist without even thinking what movie is supposed be but you know what i was friggin offended by this movie it was just plan sad mike myers has lost his game cannot admit it he should have just stuck animated voices because his characters now are just lame there is nothing i could say more than please just stay away this film i know i said this before but this is just painful unfunny movie good luck mike myers hell need it big time after more critics review this bad movie 1 10,0.5974603174603176,-0.040132275132275116,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.19}"
7,Surprisingly funny,"Even before the movie was released, this movie had bad publicity. I myself thought this was going to be a crappy movie. From the trailer, it looks as if Mike Myers is recycling his old jokes for this movie.So after The Love Guru was released, the critics ripped the movie apart, saying Mike Myers is a ""has been"" and has lost his comedic touch. They complained that he keeps doing the some jokes over and over again in his movies, and they have a point there.So after watching it, I was surprised at how funny I found it. Sure he rehashes some of his old jokes, but the rehashes worked well in the movie. These jokes worked better in this movie than in his Austin Powers movies. In his Austin Powers movies, he kinds of over-do it with his jokes, it's like ""Yeah, I get the joke already"", but he keeps banging the joke on your head until it loses its funniness. It seems that he's learned from his mistakes and the jokes are done very well in this movie. He has learned when to stop.Plus, compared to his previous movies, this movie is heavier on word-play jokes than physical jokes.

7,Another reason to ignore arrogant critics,"I saw this movie today (opening day) because I just felt like getting a good laugh. This movie is beyond stupid and very over the top, but guess what? It's still funny. It's simple humor and cheap laughs that doesn't rely on overdone profanity and never takes itself seriously. Some people may prefer ""intelligent"" comedy, and I'm all for that... go rent a Woody Allen flick from the 70s. If you like simple sight gags and silly comedy you'll like this movie. Mike Myers may not have been as funny as he was as Wayne Campbell or Austin Powers, but he can still get laughs. I have been critical of Justin Timberlake in the past, but he finally seems to have found a movie style that fits him.No, this movie will not be sweeping the awards shows or breaking any box office records, but if you're able to appreciate simply laughs you may want to check this movie out. While I found nothing offensive about the movie at all apparently some disagree. If you're easily offended then stay home or stay outside the theater holding a sign.Funny cameos also make this film and Jessica Alba looks her best in a long time.

But they were oh-so-right. Don't waste your hard-earned money or time on this one.The sight of Ben Kingsley playing a silly cross-eyed Indian guru (who has his apprentices fight with mops dipped in his bodily fluids) is very depressing indeed. To go from playing Gandhi to this is just so, so, so sad.The presence of two gratuitous anti-gay jokes turned an otherwise innocuous movie into an unpleasant experience. Call me crazy, but I don't go to the expense of going to a theatre in order to be insulted. Do Mike Meyers and this film's makers think that gay audience members LIKE to be insulted as we sit there watching their movies? (which we PAID to see!!) I thought the Guru Pitka schtick might be fun, but it wasn't.

Many moments in this film will having you looking around the theater wondering if anyone else finds this movie as stupid as you do.That's really the bottom line. This movie is stupid. Take every fear you've had watching the trailer, times it by 10 and you will get an idea of how bad this film is.By the way, the hockey in this movie will leave any one who loves the game sick to there stomach. The hockey portrayal left me in tears. Its brutal ! The film is a HUGE slap in the face to hockey. Thanks Mike Myers ! On a positive note though, Justin Timberlake and Stephen Colbert are hilarious.

1,One of the main characters is named 'Jacques 'Le Coq' Grande'---I think this says all you need to know about this lovely and incredibly subtle film...,"Didn't someone during the entire production process stop to realize that it just wasn't funny?! I mean, it's pretty obvious from all the many, many lame jokes that fall flat that there is something seriously wrong with this film. Instead of being funny, it all comes off as incredibly self-indulgent and sad--especially since you see so much of Mike Myers. You see Myers singing and dancing, pulling floss out of his butt, a long segment featuring a child with Myers' head superimposed on him, Myers' CONSTANT mugging as if he is saying ""Wow...ain't I cute?!"" and a constant barrage of Myers in every single season! After a very short time, it becomes very, very tiresome--like an Austin Powers movie without a single joke.As far as the plot goes, it's all about Myers trying to reconcile a hockey player with his estranged wife....if anyone really cares. And, due to a huge number of Razzie awards and poor box office returns, no one did. Don't waste your time unless you are 100% obsessed with Mike Myers and want to watch nothing but what look like outtakes. How could a movie with this big a budget and this many guest appearances be this bad?! Crap.",one main characters is named jacques le coq grande i think this says all you need know about this lovely incredibly subtle film,didnt someone during entire production process stop realize that it just wasnt funny i mean its pretty obvious all many many lame jokes that fall flat that there is something seriously wrong with this film instead being funny it all comes off as incredibly self indulgent sad especially since you see so much mike myers you see myers singing dancing pulling floss out his butt long segment featuring child with myers head superimposed him myers constant mugging as if he is saying wow aint i cute constant barrage myers every single season after very short time it becomes very very tiresome like austin powers movie without single joke as far as plot goes its all about myers trying reconcile hockey player with his estranged wife if anyone really cares due huge number razzie awards poor box office returns no one did dont waste your time unless you are 100 obsessed with mike myers want watch nothing but what look like outtakes how could movie with this big budget this many guest appearances be this bad crap,0.6130983709273184,-0.01110588972431077,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.42}"
7,better than what the trailer shows,"when I saw the trailer for the love guru I thought it would be a somewhat bad movie compared to what mike myers provided in austin powers, but I saw an early screening today (mainly because I saw my fav and one of the best stand up comedians out there, Daniel tosh, the dude with the cowboy hat) and I was impressed. I like when I go see a movie and expect something bad and come out pleasantly surprised and the love guru did just that. The intro took me by surprise with great jokes from mike. The rest of the movie was a fun ride filled with humorous names and puns and cameos from many many comedians and artists and actors. I was very amused by stephen colbert and jim gaffigan's (another great stand up comedian) sports newscasting, hilarious. If anybody gets a chance to see an early screening you should def go, if not then go when it officially is released.,",better than what trailer shows,when i saw trailer love guru i thought it would be somewhat bad movie compared what mike myers provided austin powers but i saw early screening today mainly because i saw my fav one best stand up comedians out there daniel tosh dude with cowboy hat i was impressed i like when i go see movie expect something bad come out pleasantly surprised love guru did just that intro took me by surprise with great jokes mike rest movie was fun ride filled with humorous names puns cameos many many comedians artists actors i was very amused by stephen colbert jim gaffigans another great stand up comedian sports newscasting hilarious if anybody gets chance see early screening you should def go if not then go when it officially is released,0.6033333333333334,0.35333333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.23}"
7,The Slap-stick Swami,"I found this movie to be crude, but interesting. Mike Myers didn't exactly reach the same level of cultural achievement as George Harrison here, but still there was some interesting work on cultural stereotypes.Basically it's a story of a white swami (Mike Myers) who helps a black hockey player (The 40-Year-Old-Virgin's Romany Malco) get his baby back. So in a way it's one of those white-guy-hangs-out-with-black-guy flicks, with the added layer that both of them have, I guess you could say, racially unstereotypical roles.Actually the theme of breaking social barriers is something of a theme of the film. (And obviously this is also done by the rather cheap jokes, but I suppose you could look at that as the attempt to sell the unpopular.) Justin Timberlake plays the French Canadian hockey player who steals the black guy's wife, creating a sideplot of an interracial relationship. The love guru himself is a white American inheritor of thousands of years of Indian tradition. Possibly even more different, is that a black gentleman becomes a student of these Indian teachings. To do this, he must confront his past, in the form of his mother, who is a very strident woman active in the black church (with his non-black non-Christian friend in tow). And then, to process this encounter, the pair repair back to a bar (where the hockey player, oddly enough, is the only non-white). More examples of this sort of playing with stereotypes could be multiplied, since it's essentially what the movie's about. In fact, I might guess at if it's relative lack of popularity might have something to do with the sense that it's not always very positive in its portrayal of the average hockey fan.... Of course, the film's budget made the inclusion of a Beatles song out of the question, but it is interesting that they named the wife Prudence, which for me, at least, brings to mind the song ""Dear Prudence"", which John Lennon wrote while the band was visiting an ashram in India. But of course all that doesn't make the film a *good* picture. The constant reaching for cheap laughs marks it as a film meant simply for laughing, perhaps, rather than a really insightful picture of daily life, which many comedies are. But it also doesn't deserve the sort of heartless vitriol which some comedies so easily attract to themselves from the perhaps pompous sort. It deserves to be seen as a movie with *some* merit.

8,I really enjoyed it,"I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I've seen that it's getting bad reviews and I don't know why.Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka (""The Love Guru"") who is always playing second fiddle to Deepak Chopra. So in an attempt to get the recognition he seeks he takes on the task of helping the star of the Toronto Maple Leafs, played by Romany Malco, whose personal problems are effecting his game during the championships.So the film mixes the kind of advice you'd get in all the self-help books from people like Deepak Chopra with jokes. So it's kinda making fun of it, but it isn't because it shows that the advice is pretty good, but it's still funny. I'm actually someone who has read a lot of those books and maybe you have to be to get how hilarious Guru Pitka is. But he's also Mike Myers and if you don't like Myers, you should probably know that by now, and shouldn't be seeing this movie. If you do like him however, I can't see a real reason why you wouldn't like it. Justin Timberlake has a small role as the opposing goalie, who is causing a great deal of Romany Malco's character's stress. Timberlake's sorta funny but kinda overdid it.The film has some bathroom humor but not as much as you normally see in a Mike Myers film. It's much more about self-esteem and overcoming your baggage in order to succeed. I know it's a silly comedy but that stuff is in there. I guess people wouldn't want to take kids to it, because of some sexual humor, but otherwise I thought it was really funny and laughed throughout.",i really enjoyed it,i dont know what everyone is complaining about ive seen that its getting bad reviews i dont know why mike myers plays guru pitka love guru who is always playing second fiddle deepak chopra so attempt get recognition he seeks he takes task helping star toronto maple leafs played by romany malco whose personal problems are effecting his game during championships so film mixes kind advice youd get all self help books people like deepak chopra with jokes so its kinda making fun it but it isnt because it shows that advice is pretty good but its still funny im actually someone who has read lot those books maybe you have be get how hilarious guru pitka is but hes also mike myers if you dont like myers you should probably know that by now shouldnt be seeing this movie if you do like him however i cant see real reason why you wouldnt like it justin timberlake has small role as opposing goalie who is causing great deal romany malcos characters stress timberlakes sorta funny but kinda overdid it film has some bathroom humor but not as much as you normally see mike myers film its much more about self esteem overcoming your baggage order succeed i know its silly comedy but that stuff is there i guess people wouldnt want take kids it because some sexual humor but otherwise i thought it was really funny laughed throughout,0.590625,0.22083333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.25}"
