10.0,Ozu's Quietly Brilliant Masterpiece Deserves Your Attention,"I think this movie is amazing for reasons I was not expecting. I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.The plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as ""narrative ellipses"", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them.I just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting. In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"") displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.But the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.",ozus quietly brilliant masterpiece

9.0,Universal appeal of Tokyo Story,"As with every great work, the film has its own unique perfection in style, rhythm, details, and artist's vision - but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal - it is for every parent, every son or daughter - for everyone. It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning.Ozu's film does not require one to be a movie buff or to try to solve complex symbolism to appreciate and love it. It brings smiles because it is a comedy (for at least the first 2/3) and sadness with a high drama of the last 1/3 of the film.Yasujiro Ozu's quiet and deceptively simple film tells a story of an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to see their grown up children and their families - son, daughter and daughter-in-law who is a widow of their middle son that was killed during the World War II. Their children love them, of course but they are too busy with their own lives and jobs to spend much time with them. Their young grandchildren don't know them and not too eager to try to know their grandparents better. Only the widowed daughter-in-law is the one who is really happy with their arrival and tries to make their visit pleasurable. After parents return home, children receive a telegram with the sad news that the mother became critically ill. Now it is their turn to make a journey.Ozu does not judge anybody, but beneath the quiet politeness, smiles, and soft voices there is a sad, inevitable, and powerful alienation of generations in the modern world of big cities. The simple family melodrama has been told with intensity, humanity, and honesty of character.P.S. The first thing I wanted to do after I finished watching this film was to pick up the phone and call my mom. Just to hear her voice.",universal appeal tokyo story,as with every great work film has its own unique perfection style rhythm details artists vision but tokyo story is very universal its appeal it is every parent every son or daughter everyone it was made 50 years ago japan about people who lived far away but it is also about all us our families our problems our guilt our search love meaning ozus film does not require one be movie buff or try solve complex symbolism appreciate love it it brings smiles because it is comedy at least first 2 3 sadness with high drama last 1 3 film yasujiro ozus quiet deceptively simple film tells story elderly couple who travel tokyo see their grown up children their families son daughter daughter law who is widow their middle son that was killed during world war ii their children love them course but they are too busy with their own lives jobs spend much time with them their young grandchildren dont know them not too eager try know their grandparents better only widowed daughter law is one who is really happy with their arrival tries make their visit pleasurable after parents return home children receive telegram with sad news that mother became critically ill now it is their turn make journey ozu does not judge anybody but beneath quiet politeness smiles soft voices there is sad inevitable powerful alienation generations modern world big cities simple family melodrama has been told with intensity humanity honesty character p s first thing i wanted do after i finished watching this film was pick up phone call my mom just hear her voice,0.5198496240601503,0.11144736842105267,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Things are the way that they are and it is perfect,"Ozu's Tokyo Story is a serene and contemplative look at the breakdown in the relationship between grown children and their elderly parents shortly after World War II. The film concerns itself with problems many of us must face: the struggle to maintain a self-fulfilling life independent of parental expectations, the changes in relationships wrought by time, and the inevitability of separation and loss. Ozu does not point the finger at either parents or children but, like many of his films, offers a thoughtful meditation on the transitory nature of life.As the film opens, we see an empty street, empty train tracks and an empty pier, perhaps an early indicator of the sense of loss that pervades the film. An elderly father, Shukishi Hirayama (Chishu Ryu) and his wife Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) are preparing to travel by train to visit their children in Tokyo. When they arrive, they are met with indifference by daughter Shige (Haruko Sugimura), their grandchildren Minoru (Zen Murase) and Isamu (Mitsuhiro Mori), and son Koichi (So Yamamura), a Tokyo pediatrician. When Koichi is called to visit a patient and Shige cannot leave her beauty salon, the Harayamas postpone a sightseeing trip and start to complain that they expected the children would be living in more comfortable circumstances. Their widowed daughter-in-law Noriko (Setsuko Hara), however, welcomes them warmly and gives them the experience of being appreciated.To give themselves some breathing room, the children pool their resources and send their parents to Atami, a health spa. Their visit, however, is cut short when the noise and crowds make going home seem like a better alternative. When they get back to Tokyo, Shige tells them she has a meeting scheduled at her house and Tomi decides to spend the night with Noriko. Shukishi, in a very humorous scene, goes out drinking with old friends and shows up late at night at Shige's house completely drunk. When the elderly parents return to Onomichi, the mother suddenly becomes very ill and the entire family, including youngest son Keizo from Osaka, must come and visit them. The moment of epiphany comes when the youngest daughter Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa) asks Noriko whether or not life is disappointing. Her answer mirrors Ozu's concept of mono no aware, that we cannot avoid the sadness of life, but her beaming face tells us that things are just the way that they are and that it is perfect.",things are way that they are it is perfect,ozus tokyo story is serene contemplative look at breakdown relationship between grown children their elderly parents shortly after world war ii film concerns itself with problems many us must face struggle maintain self fulfilling life independent parental expectations changes relationships wrought by time inevitability separation loss ozu does not point finger at either parents or children but like many his films offers thoughtful meditation transitory nature life as film opens we see empty street empty train tracks empty pier perhaps early indicator sense loss that pervades film elderly father shukishi hirayama chishu ryu his wife tomi chieko higashiyama are preparing travel by train visit their children tokyo when they arrive they are met with indifference by daughter shige haruko sugimura their grandchildren minoru zen murase isamu mitsuhiro mori son koichi so yamamura tokyo pediatrician when koichi is called visit patient shige cannot leave her beauty salon harayamas postpone sightseeing trip start complain that they expected children would be living more comfortable circumstances their widowed daughter law noriko setsuko hara however welcomes them warmly gives them experience being appreciated give themselves some breathing room children pool their resources send their parents atami health spa their visit however is cut short when noise crowds make going home seem like better alternative when they get back tokyo shige tells them she has meeting scheduled at her house tomi decides spend night with noriko shukishi very humorous scene goes out drinking with old friends shows up late at night at shiges house completely drunk when elderly parents return onomichi mother suddenly becomes very ill entire family including youngest son keizo osaka must come visit them moment epiphany comes when youngest daughter kyoko kyoko kagawa asks noriko whether or not life is disappointing her answer mirrors ozus concept mono no aware that we cannot avoid sadness life but her beaming face tells us that things are just way that they are that it is perfect,0.5103448275862068,0.1370689655172414,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,A cinema of tears,"I can vividly remember the first time i saw this movie - it was during a festival of Japanese movies in an art house cinema here in Dublin. I must admit to never having heard of Ozu before, i went out of boredom and casual curiosity. I was embarrassed at the end to find myself in tears. I quickly wiped them away in that subtle way guys do when they don't want anyone to know, and got out to leave. What struck me was that even as the credits were finishing, I was one of the first to go. As i walked up the aisle I realized that most of the nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly, without the usual post movie chatter - and more than half of the audience had tears pouring down their faces. I have never, ever witnessed that in a cinema.Since then, i've watched it on DVD, and had to think a lot about why such a simple movie is so powerful, and so many people rate it as one of the greatest ever. And why i find myself agreeing with that rating, i truly think it is in the top 10 ever made - certainly the top 5 of any I've seen. But its hard at first to know why. It doesn't have the greatest script of any movie, there are few things in it that are truly original. The acting is great, but not the greatest ever seen, and the technical qualities are just average. I've come to the conclusion that the reason for its greatness is that it comes closest to pure art in cinema. By pure art, i mean art that in its simplicity but technical genius still reveals deep truths about our lives. When i think about Tokyo Story I don't find myself comparing it to other movies, instead I think of a Rembrandt self portrait, a Vermeer painting, or my favourite short story, 'The Dead' by James Joyce. It is simple, unadorned, and deeply wise. I realise in writing this I'm rapidly approaching pseuds corner, but this is my genuine conclusion (writing as someone who is shamefully uneducated in most of the arts).Of course there have been many great movies about families, about growing old, about the nature of life.... but I think somehow Ozu achieved a sort of perfection with Tokyo Story. Thats why its the only movie I would give a '10' to.",cinema tears,i can vividly remember first time i saw this movie it was during festival japanese movies art house cinema here dublin i must admit never having heard ozu before i went out boredom casual curiosity i was embarrassed at end find myself tears i quickly wiped them away that subtle way guys do when they dont want anyone know got out leave what struck me was that even as credits were finishing i was one first go as i walked up aisle i realized that most nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly without usual post movie chatter more than half audience had tears pouring down their faces i have never ever witnessed that cinema since then ive watched it dvd had think lot about why such simple movie is so powerful so many people rate it as one greatest ever why i find myself agreeing with that rating i truly think it is top 10 ever made certainly top 5 any ive seen but its hard at first know why it doesnt have greatest script any movie there are few things it that are truly original acting is great but not greatest ever seen technical qualities are just average ive come conclusion that reason its greatness is that it comes closest pure art cinema by pure art i mean art that its simplicity but technical genius still reveals deep truths about our lives when i think about tokyo story i dont find myself comparing it other movies instead i think rembrandt self portrait vermeer painting or my favourite short story dead by james joyce it is simple unadorned deeply wise i realise writing this im rapidly approaching pseuds corner but this is my genuine conclusion writing as someone who is shamefully uneducated most arts course there have been many great movies about families about growing old about nature life but i think somehow ozu achieved sort perfection with tokyo story thats why its only movie i would give 10,0.48279183201058196,0.16202463624338623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,The excuses we make to justify our neglect of others,"An appreciation of this movie may demand some understanding of Japanese culture. The Japanese are rather reserved, and were even more reserved back in the early 1950's, when this film is set. No embracing, even of parents, children, siblings; no dramatic histrionics; even a death scene in this movie is much quieter than a Westerner might expect.Consequently I can't really blame several reviewers here for calling this movie boring and slow-paced. But it is not at all slow-paced from a different cultural perspective. It just depends on what you're used to.If you do take the time to watch and try to understand it, you'll find an engrossing analysis of the dynamic of a middle-class family, the rift that grows up between generations, and of the many excuses we find ourselves making to justify our neglect for others, even those dearest to us. These themes are universal, but are couched in a postwar Japanese idiom, and so probably less accessible to the average Western viewer.I have wondered awhile about a speech at the end by Noriko, the widowed daughter-in-law, in which she denies that she's such a good person (though her actions in the movie indicate otherwise). I'm still not sure I understand her motives in saying this. For the most part, however, this movie will not leave you puzzled, but it may leave you a bit wiser, and a bit more reluctant to make those excuses.",excuses we make justify our neglect others,appreciation this movie may demand some understanding japanese culture japanese are rather reserved were even more reserved back early 1950s when this film is set no embracing even parents children siblings no dramatic histrionics even death scene this movie is much quieter than westerner might expect consequently i cant really blame several reviewers here calling this movie boring slow paced but it is not at all slow paced different cultural perspective it just depends what youre used if you do take time watch try understand it youll find engrossing analysis dynamic middle class family rift that grows up between generations many excuses we find ourselves making justify our neglect others even those dearest us these themes are universal but are couched postwar japanese idiom so probably less accessible average western viewer i have wondered awhile about speech at end by noriko widowed daughter law which she denies that shes such good person though her actions movie indicate otherwise im still not sure i understand her motives saying this most part however this movie will not leave you puzzled but it may leave you bit wiser bit more reluctant make those excuses,0.3274904214559387,0.08017241379310344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"

10.0,Beautiful and deeply moving,"Why did it take so long for me to see this film? I don't know why that is, other than being behind with my movie watching due to studying, and I am still kicking myself because Tokyo Story was one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. I haven't seen enough of Yasujiro Ozu's work to judge him as an overall director, but seeing Tokyo Story it is very easy to see why anybody would consider it one of his finest achievements or him as a master film-maker. Tokyo Story is beautifully shot, everything looks homely and evocative and the shots, frame and cinematography are done to perfection. And Ozu directs very sensitively and assuredly, it is said that he specialised in middle-class family melodramas and I have no trouble believing that. The story is quiet and meditatively paced but never bored me, because every bit of writing, family scene and character was dealt with in such a poignant and intelligent manner. Tokyo Story is also helped by some truly wonderful acting. Setsuko Hara just epitomises gentle kindness, making us warm to Noriko easily, while Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama play their roles with nuanced and affecting dignity.

10.0,beautiful meditation on old age and family; simple and moving,"I can't take my mind off this movie. The story is both universally human (old age, the end of life, parents and children) and specifically Japanese. The movie tells the viewer so much about Japanese middle class life in the 1950s: eating and sleeping; mourning the war dead; clothes and home furnishings; spoiled kids; a doctor's office; a schoolroom; life in Tokyo and small towns; how family members talk to each other; old men's drinking habits; a resort hotel. But while we see all these details of a real time and place, we are constantly drawn into reflection on the meaning of human life and relationships. The reflection emerges effortlessly from the simple narrative and the specifics. The director never annoyingly tells us how to feel, he is not preaching and not drawing attention to himself. (There is none of that ""hey, I'm making a moving movie"" crud that you get in Hollywood treatment of these topics). He just lets the story unfold in a quiet, natural way. It's not for folks who only like ""action"" movies.

His use of cinematic space is incredible. He breaks all sorts of conventions with his cinematography such as violating the axis of action. This gives the viewer the sense of a large, open, unrestricted world.Going with this realism, the characters seem real; not for a moment did I see the people on the screen as actors.

10.0,Extraordinary Portrayal of Real Life,"A fantastic film that belies the simplicity of its plot, Tokyo Story is the tale of a vacation gone sadly awry, with an elderly man and woman visiting from the countryside pushed to the sidelines by their busy children in the city. The younger generation (and by extension the ""new"" Japan) turns its back on the family from which it arose- because of selfishness, because of necessity, or because it's simply the way of the world. The movie provides no easy answers- its melancholy ambiguity is part of its charm. Whatever the case, Ozu delights in portraying the details of everyday life. The emotional resonances of this movie are extraordinary, and some shots (a child picking flowers, an old couple framed by the sea, a woman sitting forlornly at her work desk) are enough to give a sensitive film-goer the shivers. Despite the testimony of some critics, the film is not totally devoid of melodramatic elements (some stock characters and cloying musical motifs spring readily to mind), but the film is founded upon such an obvious love and respect for the importance of real-world interactions that it's hard not to be anything other than enthralled by it.",extraordinary portrayal real life,fantastic film that belies simplicity its plot tokyo story is tale vacation gone sadly awry with elderly man woman visiting countryside pushed sidelines by their busy children city younger generation by extension new japan turns its back family which it arose because selfishness because necessity or because its simply way world movie provides no easy answers its melancholy ambiguity is part its charm whatever case ozu delights portraying details everyday life emotional resonances this movie are extraordinary some shots child picking flowers old couple framed by sea woman sitting forlornly at her work desk are enough give sensitive film goer shivers despite testimony some critics film is not totally devoid melodramatic elements some stock characters cloying musical motifs spring readily mind but film is founded upon such obvious love respect importance real world interactions that its hard not be anything other than enthralled by it,0.5004675324675325,0.052787878787878786,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Too subtle and yet too obvious,"This film is commonly called one of the masterpieces of international film. Indeed, a well-known ""intro to film"" textbook uses it as a case study in notable film-making. But, as more than one reviewer so far has pointed out, 'Tokyo Story' is slow, obscure, and sometimes seemingly sterile. Understanding how a great classic could be seemingly soulless requires some study - of Japanese culture, as others have pointed out, of film technique, and of ourselves. Fortunately, that understanding more than fully repays itself, as is true of any great piece of art.I should begin by warning the first time viewer that the film is not in any familiar style. Other reviewers have mentioned the camera, the angles, the acting, the elision - I hardly need dwell on these. Those used to Hollywood films of almost any era will find 'Tokyo Story' odd and unsettling, just because the style is so different. And of course the culture is radically different. In this forum one can hardly even begin to discuss the way that Japanese fathers discuss their children amongst themselves, or the marriage culture of 1950s Japan. But I think the film is great even if one has no understanding of continuity editing, or post-war Japan, or a dozen other obscure topics. This is, after all, the central feature of great art: Even those of us who do not fully understand still realize, in some unspeakable way, that we are in the presence of something great.The most common accusations leveled against this film, oddly, assert alternatively that it is a cold, soulless exercise in technique or, on the other hand, that it is a soap opera, with no real substance. I think neither of those is true. There can be no question that it is easily seen as cold. Nothing really happens, by modern standards. It is merely a family that comes and goes and lives and dies. Of course, to those who accuse it of being a soap opera, that death is the foremost evidence of its manipulative guilt. But, for those who have seen it, recall the mother's stroke, or where Keizo is told to look one last time - would a soap opera elide such a supremely emotional scenes?No, 'Tokyo Story' is neither cold nor manipulative. Rather, it slowly brings you into a family that, while perhaps totally unlike your own, is at its base just the same. Then it allows those things to happen that must someday happen to all of us - growing up, moving away, and that unspeakable, inescapable end. It is not easy; it is not obvious; but it is not obscure, either. After it all, I can only tell you this: If you have lived long enough to know how it feels to leave your parents and only realize far too late, as it seems we all do, the value of what you have left behind, then 'Tokyo Story' will reward you perfectly. And these things - we all do these very things, so 'Tokyo Story' is universal, is Art.",too subtle yet too obvious,this film is commonly called one masterpieces international film indeed well known intro film textbook uses it as case study notable film making but as more than one reviewer so far has pointed out tokyo story is slow obscure sometimes seemingly sterile understanding how great classic could be seemingly soulless requires some study japanese culture as others have pointed out film technique ourselves fortunately that understanding more than fully repays itself as is true any great piece art i should begin by warning first time viewer that film is not any familiar style other reviewers have mentioned camera angles acting elision i hardly need dwell these those used hollywood films almost any era will find tokyo story odd unsettling just because style is so different course culture is radically different this forum one can hardly even begin discuss way that japanese fathers discuss their children amongst themselves or marriage culture 1950s japan but i think film is great even if one has no understanding continuity editing or post war japan or dozen other obscure topics this is after all central feature great art even those us who do not fully understand still realize some unspeakable way that we are presence something great most common accusations leveled against this film oddly assert alternatively that it is cold soulless exercise technique or other hand that it is soap opera with no real substance i think neither those is true there can be no question that it is easily seen as cold nothing really happens by modern standards it is merely family that comes goes lives dies course those who accuse it being soap opera that death is foremost evidence its manipulative guilt but those who have seen it recall mothers stroke or where keizo is told look one last time would soap opera elide such supremely emotional scenes no tokyo story is neither cold nor manipulative rather it slowly brings you into family that while perhaps totally unlike your own is at its base just same then it allows those things happen that must someday happen all us growing up moving away that unspeakable inescapable end it is not easy it is not obvious but it is not obscure either after it all i can only tell you this if you have lived long enough know how it feels leave your parents only realize far too late as it seems we all do value what you have left behind then tokyo story will reward you perfectly these things we all do these very things so tokyo story is universal is art,0.53025641025641,0.04974358974358977,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Life is simple and unique. That's very true.,"TOKYO STORY is a film that has a moderate tone, unobtrusive style and quiet family story. An elderly couple from the provinces coming to Tokyo to visit their grown children. The story shows how the children, preoccupied with their daily lives, do not show enough care for their parents, as opposed to the former daughter-whose husband died in the war. At first glance, everything in this film seems simple and clear, but on the other hand is a sensitive topic and family discord, somewhat generational conflict with fairly deep emotions without excessive melodrama.Staff are interesting, a little strange, however, show sincere emotion without many words. Of course, you need to understand Japanese culture, which I somehow fascinated. The story can be identified three generations of which is the oldest in a harmonious relationship. Although it can be concluded that it is not always the case. The younger do not have time for yourself and not for others.Most people do not live. Survive. Understanding and tranquility in fact represent the fund in relation to the sentiment and satire. People consciously or unconsciously influence the lives of others. People woven in one's life are there, even when they are not physically present.Setsuko Hara as Noriko Hirayama really is a beauty. She plays a woman who has all the prerequisites that clearly says ""Life is disappointing"", but again full of mercy, kept calm and beautiful smile that does not come off from the face.

10.0,"I need to see it again even after two times; a beautiful mix of simplicity, nuance, style and humility","I was shown Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story- my first Ozu film- in an Art-film class some years ago, and I watched it again a couple of months ago. This has to be a truly indelible Japanese film, even to those who might dismiss it dimly as 'slow' or one where nothing happens. Actually, if you're going by traditional plot, not a lot does happen. But then again, not a lot happens on Seinfeld, either. In fact, maybe on repeat viewings, this could become the serene, Japanese tragic-comic equivalent of Seinfeld. After two viewings I get the 'jist' of the characters, their simple objectives and how they live their lives, but there's still much that can be taken in, it's hard to describe. While I'm not sure I've seen one of the ten best films ever made, as it has been for some critics and audiences, I do think it's a very unique film, one that moves in a way akin to an Italian neo-realist film, but filmed with a very particular eye that sets it apart from them.In terms of how its characters go about in the story, it is really closer to a work of De Sica or other, as it is centrally about the importance of family, and how a family and its members through the petty parts and especially through the tragic times has to stick together. The family unit here involves a couple of grandparents (Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama, who have those funny, dependent, though truthful ways about them as elders of the common ilk) who come to visit the rest of their family, and aside from (more than any other) daughter-in-law Noriko (played in such a wonderfully every-day, compassionate way by the great Setsuko Hara), they're dealt with the 'it's the old folks again'. This is particular by their own real daughter, who seems most ungrateful for their arrival. They send them to a resort, but then something un-expected happens, which turns the situation around and ground the henpecking to an immediate halt.Some scenes still stick in my head even when I least expect them going about my days, much as the aforementioned Seinfeld episodes seem to do. I loved the gentleness in one scene where Noriko is offered a gift by the grandmother, it rings perfectly true to the everyday, but it's handled in such a way that could not have been done as well in another film. There's also a great deal of humility, with moments of amusement, when two male characters (one of them the grandfather I believe) get drunk. And throughout the film, Ozu creates impressionable compositions, setting him apart with just this film alone for me as a remarkable artist; I still remember certain shots of the houses and scapes (his specific way of shooting characters in the interiors is really neat too). In the class our teacher told us this was part of what were called 'handkerchief films' or something close to that in Japan, where audiences would bring hander-chiefs with them from crying so much during the film. I can see why; probably the best that can be said of Tokyo Story is how he pulls so much out of so little, and the interest that is always constant, even through little domestic squabble scenes, quiet moments with the elders (the old man has a look that's perfect throughout), and the more intense ones later on. In short, it's definitely at least one of the very best Japanese films of the 1950s, in the same rank as Kurosawa's best films.",i need see it again even after two times beautiful mix simplicity nuance style humility,i was shown yasujiro ozus tokyo story my first ozu film art film class some years ago i watched it again couple months ago this has be truly indelible japanese film even those who might dismiss it dimly as slow or one where nothing happens actually if youre going by traditional plot not lot does happen but then again not lot happens seinfeld either fact maybe repeat viewings this could become serene japanese tragic comic equivalent seinfeld after two viewings i get jist characters their simple objectives how they live their lives but theres still much that can be taken its hard describe while im not sure ive seen one ten best films ever made as it has been some critics audiences i do think its very unique film one that moves way akin italian neo realist film but filmed with very particular eye that sets it apart them terms how its characters go about story it is really closer work de sica or other as it is centrally about importance family how family its members through petty parts especially through tragic times has stick together family unit here involves couple grandparents chishu ryu chieko higashiyama who have those funny dependent though truthful ways about them as elders common ilk who come visit rest their family aside more than any other daughter law noriko played such wonderfully every day compassionate way by great setsuko hara theyre dealt with its old folks again this is particular by their own real daughter who seems most ungrateful their arrival they send them resort but then something un expected happens which turns situation around ground henpecking immediate halt some scenes still stick my head even when i least expect them going about my days much as aforementioned seinfeld episodes seem do i loved gentleness one scene where noriko is offered gift by grandmother it rings perfectly true everyday but its handled such way that could not have been done as well another film theres also great deal humility with moments amusement when two male characters one them grandfather i believe get drunk throughout film ozu creates impressionable compositions setting him apart with just this film alone me as remarkable artist i still remember certain shots houses scapes his specific way shooting characters interiors is really neat too class our teacher told us this was part what were called handkerchief films or something close that japan where audiences would bring hander chiefs with them crying so much during film i can see why probably best that can be said tokyo story is how he pulls so much out so little interest that is always constant even through little domestic squabble scenes quiet moments with elders old man has look thats perfect throughout more intense ones later short its definitely at least one very best japanese films 1950s same rank as kurosawas best films,0.45994157848324513,0.14937244468494465,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,A few observations,"(some spoilers)Why would anyone want to write anything about a film released half a century ago? There are two most obvious reasons: (a) the author has only recently seen it and (b) the film is timeless, just as relevant today as when it was first released. In this case, it is both.Over the last half-century, Tokyo Story has found its way into the top ten list of numerous film critics. Much have been said about the reason why. What I'm trying to do here is just to make several observations, about things in this film that particularly strike me.One is on the scene at the Tokyo train terminal, when the old couple returns home after their visit in Tokyo. Most of us in today's world would have plenty of experience is saying farewell. Less of us would have experience in saying farewell to people whom we just may not see again. Still less of us (only those who have been around long enough) would have experience in saying farewell to people who expect that they may not see us again. Those of us in this last category would probably sense what I am referring to about the scene. The old women, in a completely matter-of-course manner, said to her children that now that they have had this reunion, if anything happens afterwards, they need not come (to the small town where the old couple lives). So plainly delivered, this line is one of the things that make Tokyo Story stand above other films with similar situations and similar dialogues.Another is a very haunting static image. Leading towards it is the part when the old couple's son, a very busy medical doctor, scraps the plan of a family outing. While the somewhat rebellious older grandson sulks, the grandmother successfully coaxes the younger son to go outside to play in a somewhat desolate industrial area. The grandmother, somewhat predictably, asks the little guy what he wants to do when he grows up, and equally predictably, the question is beyond his grasp, as he continues to pluck at the tall grasses. Then comes this last shot of the sequence, a distant shot of old on the right side of the screen and the young on the left. Regardless of what message you get out of this shot, the image is haunting.",few observations,some spoilers why would anyone want write anything about film released half century ago there are two most obvious reasons author has only recently seen it b film is timeless just as relevant today as when it was first released this case it is both over last half century tokyo story has found its way into top ten list numerous film critics much have been said about reason why what im trying do here is just make several observations about things this film that particularly strike me one is scene at tokyo train terminal when old couple returns home after their visit tokyo most us todays world would have plenty experience is saying farewell less us would have experience saying farewell people whom we just may not see again still less us only those who have been around long enough would have experience saying farewell people who expect that they may not see us again those us this last category would probably sense what i am referring about scene old women completely matter course manner said her children that now that they have had this reunion if anything happens afterwards they need not come small town where old couple lives so plainly delivered this line is one things that make tokyo story stand above other films with similar situations similar dialogues another is very haunting static image leading towards it is part when old couples son very busy medical doctor scraps plan family outing while somewhat rebellious older grandson sulks grandmother successfully coaxes younger son go outside play somewhat desolate industrial area grandmother somewhat predictably asks little guy what he wants do when he grows up equally predictably question is beyond his grasp as he continues pluck at tall grasses then comes this last shot sequence distant shot old right side screen young left regardless what message you get out this shot image is haunting,0.33508699633699635,0.06260760073260073,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7.0,From the If-It's-Boring-It-Must-Be-A-Masterpiece school of filmmaking,"SPOILERSUnfortunately, I'm from the If-It-Doesn't-Move,-Poke-It-With-A-Stick school of film criticism. No, I'm just kidding. I like a lot of slow-moving movies. No, Tokyo Story has problems up the wazoo. It's not that it's a bad movie, either. I actually liked it, marginally. 7/10, for sure. I do feel that it's vastly overrated - about as overrated as movies come. It's very often considered one of the ten best films ever made. Personally, I don't think Yasujiro Ozu gives human existence enough credit. Life is never this uninteresting, nor are people. I have lost family recently, and I could relate stories about funerals that have such enormous depth that they would blow this thing away.I've heard so much about the amazing restraint of Ozu's style that I really just have to question it. I have seen one other Ozu film - Bakushu is its Japanese name; I can't remember whether it's Late or Early Spring. It was boring, too, but interesting culturally. It really was stale, with almost no movement whatsoever. Tokyo Story is clearly Ozu's most famous film, and, I have to say, the style here is not restrained at all. There are only two tracking shots in the whole film - that's what people usually point to when they're looking for stylistic techniques to point out. One person I've talked to said: ""In Tokyo Story, there's only one tracking shot [sic], and it cuts like a knife."" I'd say that the one he's talking about does add to the poignancy a little, and so does the one he forgot. It didn't, however, affect me greatly. In fact, only a couple of individual shots touched me at all. As for the rest of Ozu, he does position his camera lower to the ground than probably any other director - a technique that isn't really very noticeable. Otherwise, it's not too much different from Hollywood. In fact, most Hollywood films of the era have limited or no tracking shots just based on their budgets. The editing patterns are almost identical to anything you'd find anywhere else, except for this odd and annoying type of cross-cutting that pops up whenever two people converse. I don't get that; it's really choppy, rather jarring for a movie that seems to want to be so realistic.And that's where I think this film's critical prominence lies, in its realism. I don't understand it, but whenever any film tries to be realistic or naturalistic, critics and most film buffs develop a raging erection. I know what real life is like, and I'd much rather see it exaggerated. To tell you the truth, as I said above, I don't think Ozu is presenting real life in Tokyo Story (or Bakushu). Real life has much more drama than this film. This is doing the opposite of hyperbolizing; it's minimizing real life. In real life, when a family meets around the dinner table, as the family does at the end of this film, there're a million circumstances effecting the outcome of that meal. Not so in this film. Ozu reduces them to types: the nice old couple, the too-busy adults, the selfish wife, the compassionate widow, etc. They do have character. I wouldn't want to undermine that too much. But in real life, they'd be so much more complex and interesting. I suggest that you attend a relative stranger's Christmas dinner, as a ghost, if necessary. It would be infinitely more complex.I do have to give the film credit for the complex issues that it raises. Its main themes have to deal with the callousness of the adult generation, and the disappointment in the elderly generation. It deals with these themes well whenever it gets around to dealing with them. A more brilliant writer would have had more with the grandchildren, but Ozu is content to have just a bit of it at the beginning. But, really, what does he bring out in the film that you didn't know already? I have a feeling that the same people who love this movie are right at the moment as I write this (12/19/2001) apprehensive about their parents or in-laws showing up for Christmas, and will breathe a sigh of relief when they leave. And I bet those same people will watch this movie when they're older and say, ""Hey, my kids are just like those a**holes!""There are better movies about aging out there. Check out the Icelandic film Children of Nature, about an old man whose family is so annoyed at his presence in their home that they quickly move him to a nursing home, where he meets his high school sweetheart. They had been forced out of their homes in a more inhospitable part of the island years before, and together they conspire to go back there and die. Tokyo Story fans will certainly hate it, for the mere fact that it is, well, entertaining and fantastical. Another one I like a lot is by the Ozu-enthusiast's greatest enemy - the dreaded Akira Kurosawa, who often delivered amusing quips against Ozu when he was interviewed by the press; he thought Ozu was a bore, too. The film is Rhapsody in August, and I can hear the laughter already from the Ozu sector. I promise you all that that film will become more beloved and important as the years go on. Right now, it is in critical limbo for the silliest reason: Richard Gere is in the movie for about 15 minute. And it's actually one of his best performances, if you'd just give him a chance. That film is much better in dealing with the paradoxes of the three generations's relationships.",if its boring it must be masterpiece school filmmaking,spoilersunfortunately im if it doesnt move poke it with stick school film criticism no im just kidding i like lot slow moving movies no tokyo story has problems up wazoo its not that its bad movie either i actually liked it marginally 7 10 sure i do feel that its vastly overrated about as overrated as movies come its very often considered one ten best films ever made personally i dont think yasujiro ozu gives human existence enough credit life is never this uninteresting nor are people i have lost family recently i could relate stories about funerals that have such enormous depth that they would blow this thing away ive heard so much about amazing restraint ozus style that i really just have question it i have seen one other ozu film bakushu is its japanese name i cant remember whether its late or early spring it was boring too but interesting culturally it really was stale with almost no movement whatsoever tokyo story is clearly ozus most famous film i have say style here is not restrained at all there are only two tracking shots whole film thats what people usually point when theyre looking stylistic techniques point out one person ive talked said tokyo story theres only one tracking shot it cuts like knife id say that one hes talking about does add poignancy little so does one he forgot it didnt however affect me greatly fact only couple individual shots touched me at all as rest ozu he does position his camera lower ground than probably any other director technique that isnt really very noticeable otherwise its not too much different hollywood fact most hollywood films era have limited or no tracking shots just based their budgets editing patterns are almost identical anything youd find anywhere else except this odd annoying type cross cutting that pops up whenever two people converse i dont get that its really choppy rather jarring movie that seems want be so realistic thats where i think this films critical prominence lies its realism i dont understand it but whenever any film tries be realistic or naturalistic critics most film buffs develop raging erection i know what real life is like id much rather see it exaggerated tell you truth as i said above i dont think ozu is presenting real life tokyo story or bakushu real life has much more drama than this film this is doing opposite hyperbolizing its minimizing real life real life when family meets around dinner table as family does at end this film therere million circumstances effecting outcome that meal not so this film ozu reduces them types nice old couple too busy adults selfish wife compassionate widow etc they do have character i wouldnt want undermine that too much but real life theyd be so much more complex interesting i suggest that you attend relative strangers christmas dinner as ghost if necessary it would be infinitely more complex i do have give film credit complex issues that it raises its main themes have deal with callousness adult generation disappointment elderly generation it deals with these themes well whenever it gets around dealing with them more brilliant writer would have had more with grandchildren but ozu is content have just bit it at beginning but really what does he bring out film that you didnt know already i have feeling that same people who love this movie are right at moment as i write this 12 19 2001 apprehensive about their parents or laws showing up christmas will breathe sigh relief when they leave i bet those same people will watch this movie when theyre older say hey my kids are just like those holes there are better movies about aging out there check out icelandic film children nature about old man whose family is so annoyed at his presence their home that they quickly move him nursing home where he meets his high school sweetheart they had been forced out their homes more inhospitable part island years before together they conspire go back there die tokyo story fans will certainly hate it mere fact that it is well entertaining fantastical another one i like lot is by ozu enthusiasts greatest enemy dreaded akira kurosawa who often delivered amusing quips against ozu when he was interviewed by press he thought ozu was bore too film is rhapsody august i can hear laughter already ozu sector i promise you all that that film will become more beloved important as years go right now it is critical limbo silliest reason richard gere is movie about 15 minute its actually one his best performances if youd just give him chance that film is much better dealing with paradoxes three generationss relationships,0.4911500721500721,0.1091439393939394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,My first Ozu's masterpiece,"The omission of Ozu's oeuvre is definitely an unerring embarrassment for any movie aficionado, thankfully TOKYO STORY comes to my rescue, presumably Ozu's most renowned work, tellingly it merits all kudos it gets, gracefully scrutinizing the post-WWII mental disposition of Japanese people, and quietly tear-jerking in eliciting recollections and rumination between parents and their children. Parenthood is not for everyone, but we all have parents, we forever hold a sense of regret towards them, especially in the oriental culture, filial piety is the foremost virtue to measure an individual's worth, at least viewed by other family members.Ozu's camera stands or stays in a perpetual static angle, aka. the now famous ""tatami-mat"" shot, collectedly watches the motions of its objects, the Hirayama family, Shukichi (Ryû) and Tomi (Higashiyama) is an elderly couple living in Onomichi, taken care by their youngest unwed daughter Kyöko (Kagawa), as the film starts, they set about visiting Tokyo for the very first time, to stay with their grown-up children there, it is a big deal for them, nevertheless, when sojourning in with their eldest son Köichi (Yamamura) and eldest daughter Shige (Sugimura), the couple find themselves become a nuisance towards their families and their busy business, only Noriko (Hara), the wife of their deceased second son (who died in the war 8 years ago), treats them sincerely, brings them to sightseeing, hosts them in her small single apartment. After being sent to Atami for a hot spring spa which turns out to be too rowdy for the elderly, they decide to cut their trip short and return home. However Tomi falls ill on the train, so they have a layover in Osaka, where they meet their youngest son Keizö (Ôsaka), when they reach home, Tomi's illness deteriorates, all the children head back and Tomi passes away shortly. The story can be derived from every ordinary family, the common dilemma is when we grow up, parents are slowly slipping from our priority list, for the successful ones, Köichi is a neighborhood doctor, Shige opens a beauty salon, they are both married and the former has two young children, but they could not spare one day to spend with their parents, either swamped by urgent appointments or find it hard to close her business even for one day. It is a quotidian trepidation can happen in the much-urbanized city, but Shukichi and Tomi take it lightly, in their simple-minded, you can sense their disappointment, but all they do is enduring it calmly, claim that it is a natural course when children grow up, parents should not be in the way of their lives, beyond all the offhand pleasantries and formal proprieties, the bond of blood relations is sharply lopsided, one cannot help but interpreting it as a faddish mindset of Japanese at that time, but, over 60 years has passed, the film is still distressing to watch as our world barely changes into a better one. Ozu never married in his entire life, so overtly he had been defying this detrimental malady all his life, in the film, Noriko is a sheer opposite of Hirayama's self-seeking offspring (bar Kyöko), it testifies that blood doesn't mean anything at all, which is a lightning bolt to those who deems bloodline as their purest and ultimate legacy in this world.Performances are uniformly high-end, Ryû radiates with utter aplomb and understanding although it is against his own age to act as a sexagenarian (he was in his early 40s then); Higashiyama calls forth great compassion in audience for her simple and unadorned charisma, Yammer and Sugimura superbly represents two very different kinds of self- obsession, the former is more depicted in a way of thoughtlessness whereas the latter parades her self-pleasing philosophy reeking with a whiff of opportunistic shallowness, but if one observes carefully, the more spiteful one is the former, more than often he awaits the latter to broach on some ill-considered remarks or ideas and then echoes with a genial smile.The most emotive of all comes from Hara, she is the exemplar of a golden-hearted soul, through her Noriko, Ozu consummately sheds light on the true, the good and the beautiful essence of human nature, Hara has a magnetic affinity on screen, which facilitates herself as one of the most indelible and iconic goddess in the Japanese cinema, now at the age of 95 and let us truly hope she will always stay with us with good health and longevity.",my first ozus masterpiece,omission ozus oeuvre is definitely unerring embarrassment any movie aficionado thankfully tokyo story comes my rescue presumably ozus most renowned work tellingly it merits all kudos it gets gracefully scrutinizing post wwii mental disposition japanese people quietly tear jerking eliciting recollections rumination between parents their children parenthood is not everyone but we all have parents we forever hold sense regret towards them especially oriental culture filial piety is foremost virtue measure individuals worth at least viewed by other family members ozus camera stands or stays perpetual static angle aka now famous tatami mat shot collectedly watches motions its objects hirayama family shukichi ry tomi higashiyama is elderly couple living onomichi taken care by their youngest unwed daughter ky ko kagawa as film starts they set about visiting tokyo very first time stay with their grown up children there it is big deal them nevertheless when sojourning with their eldest son k ichi yamamura eldest daughter shige sugimura couple find themselves become nuisance towards their families their busy business only noriko hara wife their deceased second son who died war 8 years ago treats them sincerely brings them sightseeing hosts them her small single apartment after being sent atami hot spring spa which turns out be too rowdy elderly they decide cut their trip short return home however tomi falls ill train so they have layover osaka where they meet their youngest son keiz saka when they reach home tomis illness deteriorates all children head back tomi passes away shortly story can be derived every ordinary family common dilemma is when we grow up parents are slowly slipping our priority list successful ones k ichi is neighborhood doctor shige opens beauty salon they are both married former has two young children but they could not spare one day spend with their parents either swamped by urgent appointments or find it hard close her business even one day it is quotidian trepidation can happen much urbanized city but shukichi tomi take it lightly their simple minded you can sense their disappointment but all they do is enduring it calmly claim that it is natural course when children grow up parents should not be way their lives beyond all offhand pleasantries formal proprieties bond blood relations is sharply lopsided one cannot help but interpreting it as faddish mindset japanese at that time but over 60 years has passed film is still distressing watch as our world barely changes into better one ozu never married his entire life so overtly he had been defying this detrimental malady all his life film noriko is sheer opposite hirayamas self seeking offspring bar ky ko it testifies that blood doesnt mean anything at all which is lightning bolt those who deems bloodline as their purest ultimate legacy this world performances are uniformly high end ry radiates with utter aplomb understanding although it is against his own age act as sexagenarian he was his early 40s then higashiyama calls forth great compassion audience her simple unadorned charisma yammer sugimura superbly represents two very different kinds self obsession former is more depicted way thoughtlessness whereas latter parades her self pleasing philosophy reeking with whiff opportunistic shallowness but if one observes carefully more spiteful one is former more than often he awaits latter broach some ill considered remarks or ideas then echoes with genial smile most emotive all comes hara she is exemplar golden hearted soul through her noriko ozu consummately sheds light true good beautiful essence human nature hara has magnetic affinity screen which facilitates herself as one most indelible iconic goddess japanese cinema now at age 95 let us truly hope she will always stay with us with good health longevity,0.46617389993972286,0.15360006027727544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,Honor thy father and thy mother,"""Tradition is the illusion of permanence."" - Woody AllenYasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" finds an elderly Japanese couple visiting their adult children in Tokyo city. They intend to spend time with their offspring, but the kids are too engulfed in their own lives to make much time for their mother and father.Having seemingly lost the ability to relate to their parents, the self-absorbed kids thus shuttle the couple off to a luxury spa and hotel, all the while resenting their parents for the expense. Even the couple's grandchildren treat them with a great deal of scorn. The eldest grandson grows angry when he learns that he has to share his study with his grandparents and later throws a tantrum when the family cancels plans to visit a restaurant.Ignored by their family, the elderly couple wander about Tokyo city, visiting friends and soaking up the scenery. They receive more affection from strangers, old friends and the wife of one of their dead sons, than they do from blood relatives. The film ends with the family's frail mother predictably dying. Though her children take a few moments to mourn her loss, stating that they regret not treating their mother better whilst she lived, they promptly return to their old selves, their dead mother quickly forgotten.So what we have here is a simple morality tale. Ozu is a traditionalist, and the majority of his films view with bittersweet sadness how the traditional family unit has disintegrated in an increasingly urbanized post-war Japan. And yet, while Ozu waxes nostalgically for some ideal familial bond, his films are also about the ""inevitability of change"". One need only look at the titles of Ozu's better known films (Early Spring, Late Spring, Early Autumn and Late Autumn) to see that he's attached to a very specific form of Japanese seasonality. In ""Tokyo Story"" he makes this point quite literally when he has one character state that all families unavoidably drift apart, pulled in their own individual directions. The result is that ""Tokyo Story"" has an oddly counterproductive tone, Ozu both acknowledging the inevitability of change and mourning the loss of some idealized good old days. Typical of Ozu, the director's camera is always distant, austere and motionless. He doesn't sledge hammer his points and maintains a very remote tone throughout. This has led to critics and fans applying buzzwords like ""un-sentimental"" and ""restrained"" to ""Tokyo Story"". But is the film really ""restrained"", or is Ozu's emotionally inert quietness fooling us into thinking we're watching something of depth and complexity?Consider, for example, a scene in which the daughter pokes fun at her mother's weight, only for the mother to die at the end of the film. Instead of delving into the couple's relationship, Ozu opts for simple button pushing, forcing us into the easy position of hating the daughter and pitying the mother. Ozu's aloof style therefore disguises the shallowness of his material, whilst also denying us the satisfaction of what is really shameless domestic melodrama.Like Dreyer, Ozu thus has a tendency of packaging very sentimental and simplistic morality lessons in what can at times be a very challenging aesthetic. In other words, ""Tokyo Story"" is more challenging stylistically, than it is intellectually, morally, or emotionally. It is neither complex nor nuanced, its solemn style completely at odds with what is really a very easy and agreeable lesson.Still, it's not all black and white. If the sons and daughters don't have time for their parents its only because they are genuinely busy. Ozu even makes one son a hectic doctor in an attempt to absolve the boy of all guilt. Afterall, how can we hate a kid for cancelling a diner date with his parents when he's absent only because he's out saving lives?The waters are muddied further when late in the film the father reveals that he is disappointed that his children are not more successful. It gradually becomes clear that he has relied on the success of his children to validate his own life. Throw in the fact that the mother is a bit of an airhead, the father was once a drunk and that both parent's constantly put on a ridiculous facade of kindness, and it's hard not to empathise with their offspring. The kid's may be dismissive of their parents, but the parents, we learn, are equally dismissive of them.7.9/10 – An influential film, viewed as a masterpiece by many. Still, peel back its uptight stoicism and ""Tokyo Story"" reveals itself to be a pretty condescending message movie. Much of Ozu's filmography is like this, hiding sentimentality behind an austere aesthetic. Consider all the pavlovian heart attacks and wistfulness in ""End of Summer"", his sentimentalizing of the unemployed in ""Tokyo Chorus"", his fondness for abandoned, kindly old parents (Tokyo Story, Late Spring), the way he scorns (and celebrates!) modernisation (Good Morning) and mourns the way time rips all children away from the elderly (Late Autumn).

10.0,A meditative masterpiece,"I first watched Tokyo Story in a classroom some time ago and witnessed something curious. I have never seen a group of people so choked up over a film, ever. The most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional. There are moments in Tokyo Story in which you are hit with a wall of emotions, surprised and overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings. It's something about the characters, the honesty, the way everything hits home despite the cultural and time-period barriers.Tokyo Story takes a deep look at familial relations in postwar Japan. Simply, it boils down to this: two aging parents (played by Ryu Chishu and Higashiyama Chieko) live far away from their children, who are in a quickly modernizing Tokyo. The children in Tokyo are quite selfish and focused on their own busy lives in the hustle-and-bustle of the city. The key character in this film, though, is Noriko (Hara Setsuko), the widow of one of the parents' sons who died in the war. Noriko turns out to be more active with her husband's parents than their own children are.The parents decide to make their first, and possibly final, trip to Tokyo in order to see their children and view the spectacle of the city. The only person that can make significant time for them, however, is Noriko; the children are busy with work and even send their parents away to a spa! In one heartfelt scene, the mother, Tomi, spends the night at Noriko's in which she begs her to re-marry and apologizes for the burden that her son has caused. During this time, the father, Shukichi, is out drinking with old friends and admits to them that he is disappointed with his children, agreeing with his friends who feel the same way.Ozu Yasujiro is considered to be one of the world's greatest filmmakers and Tokyo Story is considered his masterpiece. There is no reason to deny this. Ozu's camera is often a topic of discussion–it usually sets itself at the level of people sitting on the floor (tatami), which allows the viewer to feel like they are sitting right with the characters. It is usually always a calm camera, and very rarely pans. His films are also often slowly paced and meditative, choosing to avoid showing important events which later are revealed through dialogue. Ozu's direction of children has always been brilliant, they are never a weak point in his films and he often bases his stories on child characters (though not here).Tokyo Story contains all of the elements that make Ozu's films popular with film students and cinephiles today. His calm, observant camera; his real-life, non-embellished characters; his attention to detail and the emotional emphasis on certain objects; his perfectly timed music; among other things, contribute ultimately to the warmth and effectiveness of the film. Ozu's passion for filmmaking knew no bounds.Tokyo Story will not appeal to everybody, especially today. The typical moviegoer will either dismiss the film because it is ""old"" or ""black and white,"" or find it boring. To the cautious and attentive viewers who allow themselves to connect with the characters and feel the story, Tokyo Story is a rewarding experience. Tokyo Story, along with Ozu's other films, is a good example of film as an art. Aimed at telling a story and depicting true life on camera, it is much less of the ""entertainment"" experience that people have come to expect from the movies today. There are no explosions, violence, chase scenes, or over- the-top characters here. This is Ozu. This is one of the greatest films ever made.",meditative masterpiece,i first watched tokyo story classroom some time ago witnessed something curious i have never seen group people so choked up over film ever most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional there are moments tokyo story which you are hit with wall emotions surprised overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings its something about characters honesty way everything hits home despite cultural time period barriers tokyo story takes deep look at familial relations postwar japan simply it boils down this two aging parents played by ryu chishu higashiyama chieko live far away their children who are quickly modernizing tokyo children tokyo are quite selfish focused their own busy lives hustle bustle city key character this film though is noriko hara setsuko widow one parents sons who died war noriko turns out be more active with her husbands parents than their own children are parents decide make their first possibly final trip tokyo order see their children view spectacle city only person that can make significant time them however is noriko children are busy with work even send their parents away spa one heartfelt scene mother tomi spends night at norikos which she begs her re marry apologizes burden that her son has caused during this time father shukichi is out drinking with old friends admits them that he is disappointed with his children agreeing with his friends who feel same way ozu yasujiro is considered be one worlds greatest filmmakers tokyo story is considered his masterpiece there is no reason deny this ozus camera is often topic discussion it usually sets itself at level people sitting floor tatami which allows viewer feel like they are sitting right with characters it is usually always calm camera very rarely pans his films are also often slowly paced meditative choosing avoid showing important events which later are revealed through dialogue ozus direction children has always been brilliant they are never weak point his films he often bases his stories child characters though not here tokyo story contains all elements that make ozus films popular with film students cinephiles today his calm observant camera his real life non embellished characters his attention detail emotional emphasis certain objects his perfectly timed music among other things contribute ultimately warmth effectiveness film ozus passion filmmaking knew no bounds tokyo story will not appeal everybody especially today typical moviegoer will either dismiss film because it is old or black white or find it boring cautious attentive viewers who allow themselves connect with characters feel story tokyo story is rewarding experience tokyo story along with ozus other films is good example film as art aimed at telling story depicting true life camera it is much less entertainment experience that people have come expect movies today there are no explosions violence chase scenes or over top characters here this is ozu this is one greatest films ever made,0.6149549869699122,0.14545982210161315,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Prototypical Ozu,"Mathematicians have a saying, ""Happiness is proving the same theorem over and over again,"" by which is meant that proving a significant result early on allows for embellishing, extending, and recasting the result in different contexts for almost a whole career. If Ozu had been a mathematician, I suspect he would have understood this idea. I have seen five Ozu movies and they all seem to be variations on a theme, that theme being an examination of the family dynamics of a particular Japanese family, frequently highlighting the frictions between generations and concerns about parents marrying off their daughters.""Tokyo Story"" is my favorite of the Ozu movies I have seen and it is prototypical. All the techniques are here: meticulously framing each shot, shooting from a low level, using only direct cuts, minimizing camera movement, jumping ahead in time. The story has an aging Japanese couple traveling from Onomichi to Tokyo to visit their children, after a lapse of eighteen years. When in Tokyo the parents find that their children are busy with their own lives and are not terribly excited about the visit. The only person to receive them with much affection is the widow of a son lost in the war. This movie could easily be updated to the current time.The story is simply told, but it did require my attention. It took me a while to sort out the relationships between the son and daughter in Tokyo and their spouses and the single daughter-in-law. And sometimes the jumps in time were a little disorienting. For example, when the parents arrive in Tokyo a visit to a son in Osaka along the way is referenced, but scenes from that visit were not shown.I would have thought that the movie's having been made only eight years after the war, and only a year or two after the allied occupation of Japan, that there would have been more references to the war, but clearly Ozu was not out to provide much direct post-war analysis in this movie. He did treat the audience to a brief bus trip through Tokyo. The city then seemed already well on its way to becoming the modern city it is today.This movie is so skillfully shot in black and white that I was surprised to see in some of the later Ozu movies that he has an artist's eye for color.Some of the scenes in ""Tokyo Story"" will stay with me, like the scene of the parents sitting on the sea wall and discussing their decision to go home, basically admitting that the trip had been somewhat of a failure.Know that if you like this movie, there are a lot more Ozus like it.",prototypical ozu,mathematicians have saying happiness is proving same theorem over over again by which is meant that proving significant result early allows embellishing extending recasting result different contexts almost whole career if ozu had been mathematician i suspect he would have understood this idea i have seen five ozu movies they all seem be variations theme that theme being examination family dynamics particular japanese family frequently highlighting frictions between generations concerns about parents marrying off their daughters tokyo story is my favorite ozu movies i have seen it is prototypical all techniques are here meticulously framing each shot shooting low level using only direct cuts minimizing camera movement jumping ahead time story has aging japanese couple traveling onomichi tokyo visit their children after lapse eighteen years when tokyo parents find that their children are busy with their own lives are not terribly excited about visit only person receive them with much affection is widow son lost war this movie could easily be updated current time story is simply told but it did require my attention it took me while sort out relationships between son daughter tokyo their spouses single daughter law sometimes jumps time were little disorienting example when parents arrive tokyo visit son osaka along way is referenced but scenes that visit were not shown i would have thought that movies having been made only eight years after war only year or two after allied occupation japan that there would have been more references war but clearly ozu was not out provide much direct post war analysis this movie he did treat audience brief bus trip through tokyo city then seemed already well its way becoming modern city it is today this movie is so skillfully shot black white that i was surprised see some later ozu movies that he has artists eye color some scenes tokyo story will stay with me like scene parents sitting sea wall discussing their decision go home basically admitting that trip had been somewhat failure know that if you like this movie there are lot more ozus like it,0.481265664160401,0.12092731829573934,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,One of the Best Japanese Films Ever,"An old couple visit their children and grandchildren in the city; but the children have little time for them.Like all of Ozu's sound films, ""Tokyo Story"" has a pacing that is slow, yet has a rhythm which made Ozu's film a popular entertainment in Japan. Important events are often not shown on screen, only being revealed later through dialogue. For example, the train journeys to and from Tokyo are not depicted. A distinctive camera style is used, in which the camera height is low and almost never moves; film critic Roger Ebert notes that the camera moves once in the film, which is ""more than usual"" for an Ozu film.This is a very beautiful film, and the title is perfect, as it captures the city of Tokyo in all its 1950s beauty.
