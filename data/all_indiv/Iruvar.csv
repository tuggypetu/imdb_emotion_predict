Mohanlals act in this film is a guide for all budding actors. The soundtrack of the film is amazing. Every shot of this masterpiece looks like picture postcards. Thanks to Santosh Sivan. I don't mind watching this film a hundred times. Iruvar is Aiswarya Rai's first film & its definitely her career best film. Mani Ratnam , Mohanlal & Rahman deserved national awards. Its a pity that they were not given national awards.Another thing which surprises me is that the movie was a flop, which is a wonder aspect of Tamil Cinema.",cinema paradiso indian cinema,undoubtedly best movie i have ever watched mani ratnam mohanlal prakash raj r rahman santosh sivan at their best mohanlals act this film is guide all budding actors soundtrack film is amazing every shot this masterpiece looks like picture postcards thanks santosh sivan i dont mind watching this film hundred times iruvar is aiswarya rais first film its definitely her career best film mani ratnam mohanlal rahman deserved national awards its pity that they were not given national awards another thing which surprises me is that movie was flop which is wonder aspect tamil cinema,0.3592592592592593,0.45000000000000007,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.7, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10.0,a benchmark movie from India to the world cinema,"actually while writing this,i was trying to find out any faults with the Mohanlal,Aishwarya Rai,Prakash Raj stare'IRUVAR',a film by the Indian Spielberg 'manirathnam'.but i couldn't find anything wrong because the film is superb.first to talk about the star cast,it was one of the most biggest performer studded movie in Tamil cinema.stars other than the above mentioned include Gowthami,Revathi,Tabu,Delhi Ganeshan and more. the movie is based on the real life story of legendary actor mgr,Jayalalitha and Karunanithi.as the title says, the story is about the relationship of mgr and Karunanithi.the names were changed in the movie to avoid controversy but still the movie brought out some political problems in Tamilnadu.the opposition from party of Karunanidhi,led the movie to fail in the box office. one of India's greatest actor MOHANLAL plays the lead, Anandan who is from middle class family in 1940's.his ambition was to be a hero in Tamil films and with the help of his friend as well as writer, Tamil Selvan,who is also a politician,he becomes superstar.the party of Tamil Selvan,takes advantage of Anandan's popularity to get votes for the election and later they succeeds.this eventually leads anandan to come to politics.and gradually the ideas of Anandan and tamilselvan differs and they form separate parties.due to anandan's popularity and kindness to people,anaNdan gets crowned.this leads Tamil to think of killing Anandan and some how Anandan survives from the attempt. in this movie,story moves on character of Anandhan from his young age to his old age.Mani Rathnam decorates the IRUVAR with a love story of Kalpana with Anandan.Anandan falls in love with Kalpana,who resembles his late wife Pushpa. the movie scores one gr8 star for the genius actor MOHANLAL for his extraordinary performance.two stars for the director MANIRATHNAM for his good written script.a glowing star for AR Rahman,proving that he is really GOD OF MUSIC.an exclusive star for AR Rahman's back ground score.Prakash Raj as Tamil selvan is also worth a proud star because of his acting excellence.Aishwarya Rai also gets a superb star for her good acting in her debut film.rest of the three stars are given to the dialogues,camera and art direction.

It is an experimental work with almost true storyline, mellow music score and wonderful performances from the cast.The movie might not be of interest and significance by the audience who aren't familiar with the political history of Tamilnadu.

Lal and Prakash have done their best. However talented actresses like Tabu and Revathi appear in few scenes and don't have much scope to show their acting skills.

10.0,Excellent movie,"I think this is one of Mani's best films ever. Everything about it was astounding. Rehman's music - transported you to the period. Prakash Raj's acting was amazing, he's a class act in this one. Mohan Lal, needless to say was sparkling, some of his emotions, like when he says they expelled him for asking a question and in numerous other instances, were superb. Aish was great... and the accolades goes on.Also the movie was remarkable for Mani's raw power / edge in showing a movie that so loosely piles incident upon incident, scene after scene - more like a real life documentary, and less like a feature film. Great experimenting and also great final product. Was enjoyed more by film scholars and film students, and not so much by the general public. In the end, it's just good to know that one of India's most successful commercial directors is also experimenting with new themes, new presentation styles, thereby pushing the frontiers of what can be done film-wise.",excellent movie,i think this is one manis best films ever everything about it was astounding rehmans music transported you period prakash rajs acting was amazing hes class act this one mohan lal needless say was sparkling some his emotions like when he says they expelled him asking question numerous other instances were superb aish was great accolades goes also movie was remarkable manis raw power edge showing movie that so loosely piles incident upon incident scene after scene more like real life documentary less like feature film great experimenting also great final product was enjoyed more by film scholars film students not so much by general public end its just good know that one indias most successful commercial directors is also experimenting with new themes new presentation styles thereby pushing frontiers what can be done film wise,0.5580062410707571,0.35236671930220315,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,Mani Ratnam's best,"'Iruvar' is easily Mani Ratnam's best work to date- well researched, well planned, tight screenplay, wonderful classic resembling songs, great camera-work, above all, stellar star cast and performances. The scene on the rooftop of Tamil Selvam (Prakash Raj)'s house where Anand (Mohan Lal) is urged to greet his fans is indeed, a masterpiece of a scene. I should say that 11 years has passed since this movie was made but i have loved every one who has worked on this movie. I believe Santosh Sivan is the best cameraman in India, and I am also saddened that he is not doing cemeraworks for Mani Ratnam anymore (this and Dil Se were both class). I loved Mohan Lal, and ever since then, any of his movies failed to come anywhere near as impactful as this. Above all, there is Aishwarya Rai. There are many people who doubt her acting prowess, claiming her to be nothing but glamorous and beautiful. This is, I admit, the second best all-time single film performance by an actress that i have witnessed in my life thus far (ranking first is the Clementine Wozniacki played by Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine). Ash is tremendous in enacting the role of both a village girl and a seductive actress. There is not a single scene which she fails to impress. Considering this her debut movie, i would say that she always carried great potential, i have seen rushes on the sets of the films that she has worked and i observe that she certainly is a very committed lady trying to portray the role in the best way possible. It's only sad that directors get stuck up when giving her roles. Sanjay Leela Bhansali only gave her HDDCS and Devdas where she played beautiful, exuberant young ladies but did not give her the role he gave to Rani in Black. Ash is easily the most talented of all the actresses, not only the most beautiful, her performances in Mani Ratnam's films (Guru) proves that. He seems to be the only director who knows how to use her talent and also beauty both appropriately. The thing about Iruvar is that the songs never look out of place. They are not abrupt nor mindless. This film, as i have witnessed, has changed a common perception that a good movie shouldn't have song and dance sequences. This is a good movie, and it is even a better movie for its song and dances. They are not out of place because all the songs refer to movies which Anand was acting in, and at the same time, all were gorgeously shot. 'Aayirathil Oruvan' had great locations and camera-work, so did 'Venilla', while 'Aayirathil Oruvan' too is the best shot-under-pouring-rain song i have seen so far. And i am writing this 11 years after the movie released, and five years after i watched it for the first time. I still can't erase it off my memory (I played the movie so many times that i ended up tarnishing the VCD), so i feel it deserves an IMDb review.",mani ratnams best,iruvar is easily mani ratnams best work date well researched well planned tight screenplay wonderful classic resembling songs great camera work above all stellar star cast performances scene rooftop tamil selvam prakash raj s house where anand mohan lal is urged greet his fans is indeed masterpiece scene i should say that 11 years has passed since this movie was made but i have loved every one who has worked this movie i believe santosh sivan is best cameraman india i am also saddened that he is not doing cemeraworks mani ratnam anymore this dil se were both class i loved mohan lal ever since then any his movies failed come anywhere near as impactful as this above all there is aishwarya rai there are many people who doubt her acting prowess claiming her be nothing but glamorous beautiful this is i admit second best all time single film performance by actress that i have witnessed my life thus far ranking first is clementine wozniacki played by kate winslet eternal sunshine ash is tremendous enacting role both village girl seductive actress there is not single scene which she fails impress considering this her debut movie i would say that she always carried great potential i have seen rushes sets films that she has worked i observe that she certainly is very committed lady trying portray role best way possible its only sad that directors get stuck up when giving her roles sanjay leela bhansali only gave her hddcs devdas where she played beautiful exuberant young ladies but did not give her role he gave rani black ash is easily most talented all actresses not only most beautiful her performances mani ratnams films guru proves that he seems be only director who knows how use her talent also beauty both appropriately thing about iruvar is that songs never look out place they are not abrupt nor mindless this film as i have witnessed has changed common perception that good movie shouldnt have song dance sequences this is good movie it is even better movie its song dances they are not out place because all songs refer movies which anand was acting at same time all were gorgeously shot aayirathil oruvan had great locations camera work so did venilla while aayirathil oruvan too is best shot under pouring rain song i have seen so far i am writing this 11 years after movie released five years after i watched it first time i still cant erase it off my memory i played movie so many times that i ended up tarnishing vcd so i feel it deserves imdb review,0.5673214285714285,0.32441468253968253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,A film that will stand the test of time,"Mani Rathnam has told a fine story about two friends. One who is a film actor whom the people love dearly and harbours political ambitions. One who is an accomplished writer, poet and politician. sounds familiar?Anand is played by Malayalee actor Mohan Lal and Tamil Selvam's role by the very talented Prakashraj.One cannot miss the resemblance to the real lives of M.G. Ramachnadran and Karunanithi. However very little is revealed of Pushpa who plays the love interest of Anand. Perhaps Manirathnam was playing his cards carefully, avoiding possible repercussions from Ms Jayalalith, who was the real life mistress of MGR.There is also some fine acting by Naser who portrays the real life Tamil leader, Anna Durai. Indian cinema has few directors who can make a film that will stand the test of time. Manirathnam is one of them. The story for this film has been well researched and planned. Most Indian films skip these vital steps prior to production. Some may complain about the typical indianess of the film with the usual song and dance sequences in a good film like this. But do bear in mind that the intellectual crowd who sees the usual song and dance as a distraction is a minority. Majority of our desi brothers go to see Aishwarya Rai shaking about. And a movie can make money only by pleasing the Lowest common Factor of the society: The typical desi. Unless Mani Rathnam entertains them we won't have the opportunity to see more movies from this fine director.",film that will stand test time,mani rathnam has told fine story about two friends one who is film actor whom people love dearly harbours political ambitions one who is accomplished writer poet politician sounds familiar anand is played by malayalee actor mohan lal tamil selvams role by very talented prakashraj one cannot miss resemblance real lives m g ramachnadran karunanithi however very little is revealed pushpa who plays love interest anand perhaps manirathnam was playing his cards carefully avoiding possible repercussions ms jayalalith who was real life mistress mgr there is also some fine acting by naser who portrays real life tamil leader anna durai indian cinema has few directors who can make film that will stand test time manirathnam is one them story this film has been well researched planned most indian films skip these vital steps prior production some may complain about typical indianess film with usual song dance sequences good film like this but do bear mind that intellectual crowd who sees usual song dance as distraction is minority majority our desi brothers go see aishwarya rai shaking about movie can make money only by pleasing lowest common factor society typical desi unless mani rathnam entertains them we wont have opportunity see more movies this fine director,0.47758620689655173,0.16406609195402302,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Ratnam's absolute best -,"This film tells the story of two friends and the parallel events in their lives. Although Rathnam states officially that this film is not a true story, it is generally believed that it was inspired by the real life stories of M. R. Karunanidhi and MGR during the beginning days of the DMK and their respective film careers.Everyone always calls this film a ""documentary"" and tends to emphasize the fact that it supposedly tells the story of Karunanidhi and MGR. I think this film has very little to do with politics. It goes beyond the popular perception of two famous political figures in TN and tells their personal stories and attempts to disconnect these two characters in the movie from the superficial symbols of power we may perceive them as.People that stubbornly hold onto to the idea that this film is about former Tamil Nadu chief ministers Karunanidhi and MGR (M.G. Ramachandran) will most probably not enjoy this film as much as people who view it as a drama about two ordinary men who turned out to do extraordinary things.Some of the finer points in the movie are the unsaid words between Mohanlal and Prakash Raj (not their role in politics!). All the invisible dialog that goes on between the two of them is reflected in the background music. Mohanlal plays Anand with a high level of sensitivity. Prakash Raj is also brilliant. Good, controlled performances from the rest of the cast. This film also has two wonderful songs--""Narumugaye"" & ""Poo Kodiyin Punnagai."" Both have amazing lyrics by Vairamuthu and good visuals, as well. Santosh Sivan's camera-work is spectacular, as usual. He impresses in a nicely-captured, post-lovemaking scene with Tabu and Prakash Raj.",ratnams absolute best,this film tells story two friends parallel events their lives although rathnam states officially that this film is not true story it is generally believed that it was inspired by real life stories m r karunanidhi mgr during beginning days dmk their respective film careers everyone always calls this film documentary tends emphasize fact that it supposedly tells story karunanidhi mgr i think this film has very little do with politics it goes beyond popular perception two famous political figures tn tells their personal stories attempts disconnect these two characters movie superficial symbols power we may perceive them as people that stubbornly hold onto idea that this film is about former tamil nadu chief ministers karunanidhi mgr m g ramachandran will most probably not enjoy this film as much as people who view it as drama about two ordinary men who turned out do extraordinary things some finer points movie are unsaid words between mohanlal prakash raj not their role politics all invisible dialog that goes between two them is reflected background music mohanlal plays anand with high level sensitivity prakash raj is also brilliant good controlled performances rest cast this film also has two wonderful songs narumugaye poo kodiyin punnagai both have amazing lyrics by vairamuthu good visuals as well santosh sivans camera work is spectacular as usual he impresses nicely captured post lovemaking scene with tabu prakash raj,0.5425,0.27587797619047616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,The Best Indian Movie Ever!,"I have seen this movie about 10 times in the last 5 years. One of the most inspiring movie ever made in Indian movie history. The best part which sets this movie apart is the fact that it is in Tamil and about two of the greatest pioneers of Tamil Nadu, yet it is unbiased and brings out the psyche of two of the greatest minds of Tamil Nadu. Although the movie claims that it is not a true story (in the very first scene), it is intuitive to anybody who lived or are aware of the golden age of Tamil Nadu. Mohanlal and Prakash Rai play Anandan and Tamizh Chelvan respectively. Impeccable performances by them portraying the real life characters. Every bit of this movie says that it is a classic and this will only be realized in years to come. The film showcases the kind of films Maniratnam is capable of making. A.R.Rahman's music will haunt the ears of the viewers. This movie was not appreciated by the movie goers in India as it was a little too slow. There are no racy songs, unwanted characters or unrealistic scenes to woo the viewers. Suhasini Maniratnam's dialogues in Tamil takes this movie to a pedestal where only the connoisseurs can admire. A very straight forward approach by the best film-maker in India.Arvind Swami lends his masculine voice to Vairamuthu's verses to bring out the intensity in the scenes that show Thamizh Chelvan's prowess as a poet.On the whole, a wonderful movie to have in your DVD rack.

9.0,What every Indian commercial film should aspire to be .....,"Dear Manirthanam, I remember the day before Iruvar released. I was in 11th standard. Usually there would be a buzz in my school when a Mohanlal film was about to release. And this was no ordinary Mohanlal film. It was directed by you. Your previous film Bombay had been a blockbuster across the nation and also created a lot of controversies. Iruvar had Aishwarya Rai as Mohanlal's heroine. The music was by A.R.Rehman. It was obviously one of the biggest films of Mohanlal's career. But Iruvar did not create any buzz. I remember the film was not marketed very well. The posters had come in pretty late. Nobody seemed to know about it except for a few hardcore fans of you and Mohanlal. You did a great job hiding what the film was about (which might have worked against the film from a marketing point of view since Indian audiences usually like to know what they're going to watch).Minsaarakanavu was also releasing on the same day. That could also have been a reason for the lack of interest in Iruvar. I first watched Iruvar a week after it had released and flopped. It had been relegated to playing at the small Sangeetha theater in Ernakulam. It was a spellbinding experience. The film had one of Mohanlal's greatest performances. Prakash Raj in an equally praiseworthy performance, measured up to Mohanlal. Aishwarya Rai made a great debut in two very different roles. Rehman's music was tremendous. His background score was the sort that most Indian filmmakers would kill for. And you used it to great effect to underscore the power of Aanandam and Tamil Selvam when they gave their speeches. I don't think the film is an authentic portrayal of MGR or Karunanidhi and their relationship. It is a film that looks at these giants as well ..... the towering figures they were. Without dwelling on their dark side. Adoor Gopalakrishnan said you were able to extract Mohanlal's greatest performance and I agree. He is so refined in this film. Iruvar is one of India's greatest commercial films even though it was a flop. This is the sort of film every Indian commercial filmmaker should aspire to make. Best regards, Pimpin.

10.0,Mani rathnam at his very best,"I actually heard about this movie that it is directed by the legend manirathnam. And it is based on real life story of MGR and Karunanithi and film was not a huge commercial success. Being a die hard manirathnam fan I wanted to see it at least once which is his only movie I didn't watched, after asking my several friends I at last bought a DVD to watch this movie almost 20 years after the movie was released. After watching this I was totally angry with myself for not watching this movie earlier. I thought his best biopic kind movie was nayagan. But this movie was even better than that. It was his one of the very best works . Right from the beginning to end he amassed me with his screenplay.After watching this first thing came to my mind is 'this movie is 20 years old?' He explained everything in detail how anadhan struggled to emerge as a big star and how his popularity helped to create a political change and this was the first time a state party won the election in Tamil nadu(political history the state was so long ruled by national parties). But still he didn't bore you.First otherthing to mention in the movie apart from manirathnam was santhosh sivan camera the way he picturised the movie will get you to that period itself( he won a national award for this movie I know after I searched in web). Next thing to mention is the performance of lead stars everyone lived their character in this manirathnam has extracted their best from them I think. Rahman's bgm and songs ( one of his best work too for a periodic film) was the real soul of the movie.I really wonder how this kind of masterpiece doesn't become a commercial success. If anyone searching a review how the movie was movie was so good and must watch please see it at least once it will amaze you for sure . I would have even rated 20 for it if permitted.",mani rathnam at his very best,i actually heard about this movie that it is directed by legend manirathnam it is based real life story mgr karunanithi film was not huge commercial success being die hard manirathnam fan i wanted see it at least once which is his only movie i didnt watched after asking my several friends i at last bought dvd watch this movie almost 20 years after movie was released after watching this i was totally angry with myself not watching this movie earlier i thought his best biopic kind movie was nayagan but this movie was even better than that it was his one very best works right beginning end he amassed me with his screenplay after watching this first thing came my mind is this movie is 20 years old he explained everything detail how anadhan struggled emerge as big star how his popularity helped create political change this was first time state party won election tamil nadu political history state was so long ruled by national parties but still he didnt bore you first otherthing mention movie apart manirathnam was santhosh sivan camera way he picturised movie will get you that period itself he won national award this movie i know after i searched web next thing mention is performance lead stars everyone lived their character this manirathnam has extracted their best them i think rahmans bgm songs one his best work too periodic film was real soul movie i really wonder how this kind masterpiece doesnt become commercial success if anyone searching review how movie was movie was so good must watch please see it at least once it will amaze you sure i would have even rated 20 it if permitted,0.367917202917203,0.23227155727155724,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.48, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8.0,"Probably, the most compelling political drama ever made in Tamil Cinema. Although it lacks the nest of intrigue, Mohanlal and Prakash Raj rides it on high.","Iruvar (1997) : Brief Review -Probably, the most compelling political drama ever made in Tamil Cinema. Although it lacks the nest of intrigue, the power-packed performances of Mohanlal and Prakash Raj rides it on high. A political drama is supposed to have tricks of conspiracies when it comes to the political battle between two giants. I mean it's not compulsory, but a natural assumption from any Political Drama. Iruvar is weak in that zone and couple of other, so better look out for other strong zones. Political Drama is a genre with less classics, even when you consider Hollywood cinema. So, the potential for a Classic film is very less, i mean look at Hollywood's Oscar winner 'All The King's Men'. How much sense that film makes? Hardly some. Anyways, like I said the potential is less in this genre so obviously our expectations should not cross a certain limit. And i think a genius filmmaker like Mani Ratnam had realised it and so he added Cinema world factor to extend that limited potential. Fortunately, it works, and it work very well. If Indian Cinema had to make a Political drama in 90s, then the expected outcome couldn't have been better than Iruvar. Iruvar lacks smart tricks in the writing but still it offers an interesting script. Of course, there are some cliches such as Rivalry after greed and the mental battle between those two and especially their love-life. It sucks. I don't see any logic in those female roles, that extramarital affairs section, it's a complete letdown. Mohanal and Prakash Raj both delivered performances to remember forever which helps you to overlook some weak chapters of writing. Mani Ratnam's direction is very sensible. He understands the needs of the script and provides that much needed momentum to this engrossing drama. Overall, it's a Classic, it's special but just don't hype it as 'Extra Special'.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",probably most compelling political drama ever made tamil cinema although it lacks nest intrigue mohanlal prakash raj rides it high,iruvar 1997 brief review probably most compelling political drama ever made tamil cinema although it lacks nest intrigue power packed performances mohanlal prakash raj rides it high political drama is supposed have tricks conspiracies when it comes political battle between two giants i mean its not compulsory but natural assumption any political drama iruvar is weak that zone couple other so better look out other strong zones political drama is genre with less classics even when you consider hollywood cinema so potential classic film is very less i mean look at hollywoods oscar winner all kings men how much sense that film makes hardly some anyways like i said potential is less this genre so obviously our expectations should not cross certain limit i think genius filmmaker like mani ratnam had realised it so he added cinema world factor extend that limited potential fortunately it works it work very well if indian cinema had make political drama 90s then expected outcome couldnt have been better than iruvar iruvar lacks smart tricks writing but still it offers interesting script course there are some cliches such as rivalry after greed mental battle between those two especially their love life it sucks i dont see any logic those female roles that extramarital affairs section its complete letdown mohanal prakash raj both delivered performances remember forever which helps you overlook some weak chapters writing mani ratnams direction is very sensible he understands needs script provides that much needed momentum this engrossing drama overall its classic its special but just dont hype it as extra special rating 8 10 by,0.40488505747126446,0.08433497536945812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
