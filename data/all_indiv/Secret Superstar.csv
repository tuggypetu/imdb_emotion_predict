A slue of other fine actors give absolutely divine performances, especially Zaira Wasim. The story centers around a 15 year old girl. The film highlights her talents while also showing the painful problems that comes with being a female in a patriarchal society.

8.0,Delicious slice of life,"Mr. Advait Chandan has done very fine work as a writer and director. Every minute detail is taken care but it makes film slow sometimes, especially in first half. Without being violent, this film smarty and effectively tackles, sensitive issues like domestic violence and female feticide. Story was very clear but screenplay and dialogues induce life in it. Characterization is very intelligently conceived. Initially old grad mother seems filler but when she tells Insiya, about her mother's plight, you feel that no one could have been better than her to do it. Younger brother also looks just added to show a family but when his gift secret got reveled to her sister, it was very touching which clearly established family bonding. Due to clear cut vision of characterization and details, film became lively. Like teacher giving home tuition while peeling peas. Undertone love track starts with very abrupt note but till end you feel its cute, worthy and fresh. Insia couldn't able to sing in studio her first song, where lots of oomph was asked, which again balances her character because she was in restrict upbringing. Her point of view to music director showcases her character intelligence while realizing and accepting her point of view, established soft side of rude music director, it leads great bonding between them. In very first scene of mother and daughter, covered bruise mark on mother's eye, establishes, three main characters, mother, daughter and father, smartly. First half is good but slow at places, second half is very good with lots of emotional quotient. Performance wise Amir Khan is brilliant. He has been sculpting characters in the way that in future performance lovers will take inspiration and reference. This character was out of his comfort zone but he achieved it. Zaira Wasim as Insia is first rate. She is cute, fiery yet vulnerable. In climax or when parting away from friend, her lines and expression make your eyes moist. Meher Vij as his mother is impressive. Her chemistry is so good that you feel that she is real mother and wife. Raj Arjun as her father Farookh, is mind blowing. In his first scene, he puts eye drops and squeezes his nostril, like it happens in real life. He will terrorize you without a word. Kabir Sajid as Guddu and Tirth Sharma as Chintan's performances, are cute and endearing. 'Nachdi Phira' and 'O Re Manwa' tracks are melodious. Credit goes to music director Amit Trivedi and lyricist Kausar Munir.",delicious slice life,mr advait chandan has done very fine work as writer director every minute detail is taken care but it makes film slow sometimes especially first half without being violent this film smarty effectively tackles sensitive issues like domestic violence female feticide story was very clear but screenplay dialogues induce life it characterization is very intelligently conceived initially old grad mother seems filler but when she tells insiya about her mothers plight you feel that no one could have been better than her do it younger brother also looks just added show family but when his gift secret got reveled her sister it was very touching which clearly established family bonding due clear cut vision characterization details film became lively like teacher giving home tuition while peeling peas undertone love track starts with very abrupt note but till end you feel its cute worthy fresh insia couldnt able sing studio her first song where lots oomph was asked which again balances her character because she was restrict upbringing her point view music director showcases her character intelligence while realizing accepting her point view established soft side rude music director it leads great bonding between them very first scene mother daughter covered bruise mark mothers eye establishes three main characters mother daughter father smartly first half is good but slow at places second half is very good with lots emotional quotient performance wise amir khan is brilliant he has been sculpting characters way that future performance lovers will take inspiration reference this character was out his comfort zone but he achieved it zaira wasim as insia is first rate she is cute fiery yet vulnerable climax or when parting away friend her lines expression make your eyes moist meher vij as his mother is impressive her chemistry is so good that you feel that she is real mother wife raj arjun as her father farookh is mind blowing his first scene he puts eye drops squeezes his nostril like it happens real life he will terrorize you without word kabir sajid as guddu tirth sharma as chintans performances are cute endearing nachdi phira o re manwa tracks are melodious credit goes music director amit trivedi lyricist kausar munir,0.5472839506172839,0.24825056116722777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

Everyone has the right to dream!,"SECRET SUPERSTAR Duration : 150 Minutes Genre : Drama Zaira Wasim : the fresh face which we all first saw in Dangal has now turned into a star, she shines completely, and justifies the term ""Superstar"" in the title.

8.0,Zaira's dream with Aamir's comic tadka!,"An ordinary, small budget movie, but associated with the biggest name in the industry- Aamir Khan. That is why a holiday release is must. And Diwali is the only festival of India, when people go to theaters with entire family. So, a film based on relationships between a girl and her dream, a girl and her mother & a girl and a boy in school, is a perfect choice for the family entertainer.Insia is a Muslim girl, living in Vadodara. She has supportive mother, adorable brother, strict as well as orthodox father, caring friend and talent in the name of Voice. She starts her You Tube channel and because of that she gets lot's of fans. Shakti Kumar is a music director, and he approaches her for his album. It is then father vs dream, and it's not that simple, too. Lot's of emotions are there in the story, which make it a worthy watch.Zaira Waseem is superb. In the movie, she is playing guitar fabulously with perfect striking of strings. The best scene of her is when she explains to her mother to sign on divorce papers. In the role of her mother, Meher Vij does her job effortlessly. This pair of mother-daughter is so perfect that you will always remember these two person as per the relationship described here. Kabir Sajid is adorable small kid. Raj Arjun as her father is also delivering an effortless performance. The school friend, Tirth Sharma will make you say awww with his tricks and simplicity.And the heart of SS, Mr. Aamir Khan, as Shankti Kumar, is hilarious! I was laughing too loud whenever he's there on screen. Comic timing of perfectionist is perfect! I was getting the feel of Andaz Apna Apna. Without him, this film could have become boring! The major plus point is songs. Amit Trivedi has given solid bunch of tunes, while Kausar Munir has written wonderfully, as if they were written by Insia itself. Every song has meaning and each song also pushes the story forward. Meghna Mishra is a secret superstar here, whose voice is melodious and matches perfectly with Zaira. 'Meri Pyari Ammi' is very well. My favorite is 'Main Nachida Phiraa'. The scene is also absolutely fantastic. After watching the whole movie, if someone will ask about the movie, you would definitely tell them the scene of one day trip to Mumbai for recording the song! It was perfectly written, shot and performed.Kudos to the makers! If Aamir was not associated with this one, this film also would face the problem to survive, as lot's of good movies had been rejected by audience. Many are saying on twitter that this is the best film, but I don't think so! It is a good one time watch film. Not the best film of the year! Chase your dreams. Do what is right for you, for your loved-ones. Stay blessed!",zairas dream with aamirs comic tadka,ordinary small budget movie but associated with biggest name industry aamir khan that is why holiday release is must diwali is only festival india when people go theaters with entire family so film based relationships between girl her dream girl her mother girl boy school is perfect choice family entertainer insia is muslim girl living vadodara she has supportive mother adorable brother strict as well as orthodox father caring friend talent name voice she starts her you tube channel because that she gets lots fans shakti kumar is music director he approaches her his album it is then father vs dream its not that simple too lots emotions are there story which make it worthy watch zaira waseem is superb movie she is playing guitar fabulously with perfect striking strings best scene her is when she explains her mother sign divorce papers role her mother meher vij does her job effortlessly this pair mother daughter is so perfect that you will always remember these two person as per relationship described here kabir sajid is adorable small kid raj arjun as her father is also delivering effortless performance school friend tirth sharma will make you say awww with his tricks simplicity heart ss mr aamir khan as shankti kumar is hilarious i was laughing too loud whenever hes there screen comic timing perfectionist is perfect i was getting feel andaz apna apna without him this film could have become boring major plus point is songs amit trivedi has given solid bunch tunes while kausar munir has written wonderfully as if they were written by insia itself every song has meaning each song also pushes story forward meghna mishra is secret superstar here whose voice is melodious matches perfectly with zaira meri pyari ammi is very well my favorite is main nachida phiraa scene is also absolutely fantastic after watching whole movie if someone will ask about movie you would definitely tell them scene one day trip mumbai recording song it was perfectly written shot performed kudos makers if aamir was not associated with this one this film also would face problem survive as lots good movies had been rejected by audience many are saying twitter that this is best film but i dont think so it is good one time watch film not best film year chase your dreams do what is right you your loved ones stay blessed,0.710254329004329,0.3590503246753246,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,A Warm Embrace,"On my walk home from the cinema, I thought about why I loved Secret Superstar so much despite it being a sometimes-absurd, cliché-heavy fantasy film imparting the dubious message that only if a female is a potential entertainment superstar does she have the chance to escape her sordid existence in the Indian Muslim world. It's obvious - there is so much to love about this film that made me cast aside any reservations I had about declaring it a masterpiece. The subjects of domestic abuse and the subjugation of women in Indian Muslim culture are dealt with adroitly, and they provide the perfect foundation and vortex for an extraordinary story to unfold. I loved the mingling of conventional Indian Muslim culture and Internet culture, and the mingling of provincial values and culture with the Mumbai lifestyle and attitude within the entertainment industry. Overall, I did not feel manipulated by this film nor did I feel bombarded by a Let-Us- Entertain-You vibe; behind the Bollywood blockbuster production guise I witnessed tremendous genuineness. The tears that I shed did not happen because the filmmakers are clever pushers of emotion buttons. I was genuinely touched. The joy that I experienced was more from being moved than from being entertained.

10.0,Aamir Khan's Diwali gift to all Mothers & Motherhood ★★★★★,"Debutant director Advait Chandan has hit the right chords by beautifully portraying the mother-daughter relationship and setting the story in a middle class locality where not only you, your dreams and emotions are also trapped by the 'man' of the house. This is a story of a teenage girl Insia (Zaira Wasim) who tackling massive challenges imposed by her overtly potent father (Raj Arjun) finally fulfils her dreams of becoming a superstar singer with the support of her helpless mother (Meher Vij), best friend Chintan (Tirth Sharma) and an out of luck music director Shakti Kumar (Aamir Khan). All the performances are so enthralling that it keeps you glued to the screen and makes you give a victory jump at the climax. On the whole, Secret Superstar is a brilliantly crafted film inspiring people to chase dreams as they do come true, highlighting relevant social issues of patriarchal society and showing the importance of mothers. It's a mother's unconditional love and sacrifice that holds the family together. She sacrifices all her passions and dreams for the sake of her husband and child.

8.0,A secret recipe for success,"Bollywood has been going through some tough times during 2017 starting from Salman Khan's disaster dilemma to Varun Dhawan's cheesy acting. Luckily some films during the year created some satisfaction such as Baahubali 2 and Mom.So the story revolves around a 14 year old named Insia who resides in a suburban city that goes by the name of Vadodara which is in Gujarat. Insia's dream was to pursue a career in singing and her mother is highly supportive of Insia's decision to become a singer but her abusive and cold- hearted father invades her comfort zone which results in her dreams being crushed. So Insia decides to secretly pursue signing by posting a video and uses a burqa to hide her identity so her father don't find out. The video goes viral and it catches the attention of a failing and dim-witted Casanova music director Shakti Kumar. With the help of her mother and Kumar, how Insia manages to pursue her dream and what happens afterwards is basically what this film is about.Honestly, the teaser and trailer made me more excited for Aamir Khan but watching this movie made me realize that Aamir Khan wasn't the only important factor in the film. I loved this movie for how it was and how it looked. Advait Chandan deserves a bow because this debut filmmaker managed to master the craft of producing a screenplay that kept all the emotional factors in its place which also kept the audience engaged throughout the 143 minutes of the film.The acting in the movie was phenomenal.Zaira Wasim steals the show completely. Her acting had a clear justification to never fear anyone before pursuing a dream and her Dangal mentality managed to cover that.Meher Vij was nice and heartwarming as the mother for Zaira. Luckily in my opinion, she was not bad in Bajrangi Bhaijaan where she did the role of the little girl's mother but in this movie she manages to execute the mother role according to our expectations.Despite Aamir Khan's role only appearing half of the film, he still managed to act like the same khan who we all adore a lot. His flirty and sleazy humor managed to ma laugh a lot of times.Raj Arjun's first attempt as an abusive father figure kept the film smooth.The music was nice but I felt some tracks had weak compositions and Amit Trivedi has done it in some films like Qaidi Band and Shaandaar. Lyrics were fantastically produced by Kaiser Munir.Anil Mehta's cinematography keeps the script of the integral and consistent. Overall, I loved this movie.1) Beautifully written and directed. 2) Well performed 3) Nice Camera workEnjoy your Diwali with this film at a theater near you.Golmaal Again will surpass the box office for this film.

8.0,Long Review: Secret Superstar,"Towards the end of Secret Superstar, a character utters few lines about the basic need of having and chasing dreams. She is doubtlessly inspired by another character who uttered those same lines previously during a heated verbal tiff. The authenticity of drama and the power that these characters have in you, much like how they have it on their co-characters, even while shouting at each other, are remarkable.Advait Chandan's debut feature, Secret Superstar, which tackles two heavy subjects of domestic violence and chasing dreams at once is a definitive reflection of the patriarchal pit that we, or our women rather, live in. Self-learned amateur bass guitar player, occasional school-goer, and full-time dreamer Insia looks up to Bollywood music singers and follows them on awards circuit, albeit on TV, with a dream to become one herself some day. There are many obstacles that are limiting her chances, but the most virulent and relentless one is in her own middle-class household, a hypocritical sadist father who beats his wife at the drop of a spoon and controls his family like a merciless fascist government. Seeing Insia play with her guitar when she should be studying mathematics instead is already a good reason for him to lash out, so what happens when she creates a YouTube channel and moves an inch forward to her dream? The heated setting explodes, and the explosion is an arresting spectacle.Director Chandan uses women living in oppression in a patriarchal household to craft a narrative that is a bit unrealistic and contrived from time to time. A theme last seen in Rima Das's festival-favorite indie drama Village Rockstars, the film hopes to shed light into the dreams of young girls suppressed by their own people. A girl who prefers her father's permanent absence and who is forced to travel miles without letting her folks know for fear of rebuke is the perfect example of the combination of audacity and determination required to tackle the obstacles, and Secret Superstar conveys that point across with some palpable drama and shades of quirkiness.Aamir Khan is absolutely phenomenal as an idiosyncratic music producer known for his sexual escapades and bad temper. His presence on screen is like drinking Kool-Aid in scorching heat, and every time he appears, thirst automatically finds its way. It is characters like him that Chandan uses to support his ship that is determined it will not sink. From the gaudy metallic print t-shirts that he wears to his oddball demeanor, Khan plays a character that is only second to Zaira Wasim's. She steals the limelight with her cheeks that go scarlet when she dreams and surprises herself, quarrels with her mother and close friend Chintan, and takes a stand for herself against the oppression, unlike her mother competitively rocked by the talented and sweet-nosed Meher Vij. The duo look like they are mother-daughter in real life, what with their seamless connection and similar complexion. If Wasim is the captain of this ship then Vij is the second captain with Khan sitting in the corner as an adviser with wisdom and energy to drown in. Special mention to Raj Arjun, who is the mole in this ship, for pulling off the father character so impeccably that you want to beat him up.One of the many reasons why Secret Superstar works and never bores you is the tiny references that it makes to life in general. Taking potshots at the music industry, surface touching the current Weinstein-inspired scenario, the oppressed family living in a society called ""Modern Colony"", and the sexism that is so prevalent around us are to name a few. These references are tidbits that make the broth tastier and prevents you from focusing on the mannered narrative. The soundtrack is thankfully not cheesy and gels wells with the screenplay. Music is an integral part of what Insia dreams to achieve, and that's one thing that the film gets correct in terms of picturisation and flow.It tugs at your heart as you root for this charming little lady with a guitar in one hand and grit in another. Secret Superstar is a warm and engaging film about being fearless and moving toward your dream no matter what, and with a sweet little love story hidden in the core, it scores. It scores big.

9.0,"Moving, thought provoking, emotional and inspiring.","Secret Superstar is one of the finest films in recent times that makes you laugh, cry and at the end you go home with a feel-good emotion and give your mother the tightest hug ever. The film is about an emotional journey of a teenage girl Insiya Malik from a middle class family of Vadodara who attempts to hurdle her way past some monumental challenges to pursue her dream of becoming a famous singer.As an Aamir Khan film, you always expect it to be different from others and socially relevant at the same time - 'Secret Superstar' being no exception. Promoted as a film about women empowerment, it does not only revolve around that topic but also speaks volumes about various other social issues such as domestic violence, female foeticide etc that no mainstream cinema has ever dared to put lights upon. Drawing a completely refreshing plot line, debutante Director Advait Chandan has shown some really good directorial skills for his first film. Maintaining a watertight screenplay, the film never lets you shift your focus and keeps you on the edge rooting for Insiya. A few sequences might seem to be little dragged out and could have been edited for perfection.When it comes to acting, all the lead actors - Zaira Wasim, Meher Vij, Raj Arjun have given their career best performances. Zaira as Insiya is charming and her acting in the singing sequences look extremely believable with her lip-syncs and guitar movements being spot on. Meher Vij as Najma plays mother to Insiya and delivers a memorable performance. Raj Arjun is the stand out performer in the film. He was totally convincing as the demon of a father and makes the audience hate him bad. Tirth Acharya as Chintan too has done a great job as Insiya's supportive friend. Aamir Khan, as music director Shakti Kumar, in his 20 minutes role of a never-seen-before character truly plays 'dal me tadka' and gives the audience some rare bursts of laughter.Music of the film is very simple, soulful and extremely situational. They tend to grow on you each time you hear and makes a definite impact during the sequences on big screen. The only different song in the album is 'Sexy Baliye' which comes during the end credits and the quirkiness of it makes the audience standing on the aisle till the very end of it.Overall, the film leaves a long lasting impact on your heart letting the story teller succeed in his attempt.

10.0,Great Movie,"Film: Secret Superstar Writer & Director: Advait Chandan Producer: Aamir KhanRating: 3/3Advait Chandan's witty, melodramatic, musical drama ""Secret Superstar"" focuses on a teenage girl who wishes to become a singing sensation, in spite of having numerous hurdles in her life. Zaira who plays Insia, a wannabe singer is always being pushed back because of her father's conservative mindset. The film shows how she purposely tries to reach success. Debutante Advait Chandan has written a beautiful, lovely and meaningful screenplay which amuses me for about two and a half hours. Story actually seems to be usual, but after the second climax it doesn't. It completely makes you feel like Insia. The way the girl feels depressed because of her arrogant father makes you narky. Advait's direction is also praise-worthy. He has handled the film with utmost care. Aamir Khan who plays the role of Shakti Kumar, a funny and substandard music director is nice. He will always be there to tickle your funny bone.Comprehensively, I've actually got no words to say for this pleasurable musical drama. Just go and watch this film, I guarantee you that you would come out of the theater with a smile.

8.0,Although AAMIR KHAN - NAAM HI KAAFI HEI. But seriously this movie is so much more then that..,"Although AAMIR KHAN - NAAM HI KAAFI HEI. But seriously this movie is so much more then just him.. Its a really simple story. Never trying to be something out of the box. Just trying to be a good , truthful and good hearted film by doing all the things right. And that it did, with some flaws , Yes. Advait Chandan is a debutante director , and he is certainly not great. In fact he cant control his scenes from turning itself from Drama to Melodrama. So yes , there were some minor melodrama here and there. That aside , the film is lengthy , a lot of songs ,which were not awesome , sweet but not awesome , not as good as i would like them to be for sitting extra minutes in the hall , that's a very average work from Amit Trivedi. But not all of them taste your Patience. Some are really good , MAIN KAUN HOON is an exceptional piece of compositions , And NACHDI PHIRAN is really melodic . Also songs are placed well . Its just that although they fulfill their purpose but not without slowing the film. Then again , its not a fast film by itself. Some other faults were , the relationship between INSIA (ZAIRA WASIM) and SHAKTI KUMAR (AAMIR KHAN) is established too quickly which is hard to believe , when it comes to Music Industry. But the movie had its heart in the right place. In fact it had its heart in more then one place (and all those places were the right one). First and Foremost , its a movie about believing your dream and standing up for it. But my favorite theme was the MOTHER-DAUGHTER relationship. The way Mother and her Teenage daughter talks in this film , the topic they discuss , all the way from childish things like making faces on LAPTOP CAM to all the serious discussion about the mother must give Divorce to his husband because she deserves better life , i have never seen such practice relationship between Mother and a Teenage daughter in any Bollywood film. Then there is the Domestic Violence issue. Including how Woman in some part of Indian society doesn't have a freedom to live on their own terms and have to be submissive to their husbands. Its one of those topics which our society doesn't want to accept as a reality even after everybody knows its a truth , and the Bollywood also usually shy away from this topics . But we have seen this topic in few number of films. Its done in a slight subtle manner here , as its a movie about teenage Girl's dream , also u know , its a Diwali Film. And lastly there was teenage love-story too. Which was also not the best i have seen in Bollywood films but believable enough..The way Zaira Wasim have started her carrier in Bollywood with such strong two film , i don't think any other child artist have got such a launch. Thanks to Aamir Khan of coarse who in many interviews have said she is like a daughter to him, interestingly enough i can see his love to her in many scenes of the film too. But that doesn't take any credit from her. Zaira did a really fine Job. Even in the scenes where she had to act like a singer singing a song. Playing a singer is not that easy , even adult actors sometime do it wrong. Meher Vij is a loving mother everybody wants. She has been shown as an illiterate woman , but it was shown very nicely that , its not the education you need to be a great mom, rather its good heart , love for your children , fighting for their dream and ability to sacrifice which makes a great Mom. Thankfully , i have got one of my own. Aamir Khan was deliberately Overacting here. And he was hilarious. Every time he opens his mouth , will make you laugh. Which makes me wanting an out an out Comedy film from Aamir. We only get bit and pieces of Shakti Kumar's own life as he was not the central character. There was one scene where Aamir says to Zaira that they have a same kind of life , but he never completely explain her how. And yes there were some emotional scenes of him too . He was there in the movie exactly as much as required. It was not a cameo. Not even an extended cameo. More then that.So that's it. Bear some melodrama , some cliché , some predictability , some unnecessary but well placed songs and you will get a movie which far better then Bollywood offers every Diwali. 7.6/10By ANuP APu KuMaR",although aamir khan naam hi kaafi hei but seriously this movie is so much more then that,although aamir khan naam hi kaafi hei but seriously this movie is so much more then just him its really simple story never trying be something out box just trying be good truthful good hearted film by doing all things right that it did with some flaws yes advait chandan is debutante director he is certainly not great fact he cant control his scenes turning itself drama melodrama so yes there were some minor melodrama here there that aside film is lengthy lot songs which were not awesome sweet but not awesome not as good as i would like them be sitting extra minutes hall thats very average work amit trivedi but not all them taste your patience some are really good main kaun hoon is exceptional piece compositions nachdi phiran is really melodic also songs are placed well its just that although they fulfill their purpose but not without slowing film then again its not fast film by itself some other faults were relationship between insia zaira wasim shakti kumar aamir khan is established too quickly which is hard believe when it comes music industry but movie had its heart right place fact it had its heart more then one place all those places were right one first foremost its movie about believing your dream standing up it but my favorite theme was mother daughter relationship way mother her teenage daughter talks this film topic they discuss all way childish things like making faces laptop cam all serious discussion about mother must give divorce his husband because she deserves better life i have never seen such practice relationship between mother teenage daughter any bollywood film then there is domestic violence issue including how woman some part indian society doesnt have freedom live their own terms have be submissive their husbands its one those topics which our society doesnt want accept as reality even after everybody knows its truth bollywood also usually shy away this topics but we have seen this topic few number films its done slight subtle manner here as its movie about teenage girls dream also u know its diwali film lastly there was teenage love story too which was also not best i have seen bollywood films but believable enough way zaira wasim have started her carrier bollywood with such strong two film i dont think any other child artist have got such launch thanks aamir khan coarse who many interviews have said she is like daughter him interestingly enough i can see his love her many scenes film too but that doesnt take any credit her zaira did really fine job even scenes where she had act like singer singing song playing singer is not that easy even adult actors sometime do it wrong meher vij is loving mother everybody wants she has been shown as illiterate woman but it was shown very nicely that its not education you need be great mom rather its good heart love your children fighting their dream ability sacrifice which makes great mom thankfully i have got one my own aamir khan was deliberately overacting here he was hilarious every time he opens his mouth will make you laugh which makes me wanting out out comedy film aamir we only get bit pieces shakti kumars own life as he was not central character there was one scene where aamir says zaira that they have same kind life but he never completely explain her how yes there were some emotional scenes him too he was there movie exactly as much as required it was not cameo not even extended cameo more then that so thats it bear some melodrama some clich some predictability some unnecessary but well placed songs you will get movie which far better then bollywood offers every diwali 7 6 10by anup apu kumar,0.515751322751323,0.16429822029822028,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"

My colleague told me about it and seeing that it was an Aamir Khan production, why in my right mind would I miss it? Terrific acting performances by everyone, and those who saw the gigantic hit Dangal wouldn't be too surprised by the stunning performance by the young newcomer Zaira Wasim! Also an amazing performance by the actress who played her mother. And of course, the ever so powerful Mr. Aamir Khan plays an eccentric, sort of creepy but hilarious character which is the complete opposite of his last outing. The way he disappears into each and every one of his characters is beyond greatness. The film has it all- it's really emotional (I'm not Indian so maybe I'm not used to emotionally strong films but this one really had me crying...), it's entertaining, funny, and just not even a single part of the film dragged.

8.0,Count One More Classic in APK's Bucket. Birth of A Genius Director and Great Actress.,"SECRET SUPERSTAR REVIEW : Watch it as an Aamir fan, you will not be disappointed. Watch it as Aamir Hater, you will not be disappointed. Watch it as Neutral quality cinema lover, still you won't be disappointed.Acting- I won't be surprised if despite being a Child Actress (not fully) Zaira Wasim wins Best Actress Awards for the film by crushing many senior actresses of Bollywood. First film as a lead actor and she delivers performance to remember for years. Meher mam you deserved big films, big roles and i'm sure you will totally nail it just like you did as Nazma. Supporting star cast highly appreciated. Aamir as Shakti Kumarrr is completely Hilarious. He hardly has 20 minutes role and 10-12 minutes goes in Overacting (Character need), few people even asked in theater, Why is he doing so much overacting? Yet he has got few moments to explore an Actor in him, and he makes you laugh out loudly in few scenes for complete 5-6 minutes.Writing- It is Powerful. Story is realistic (has some illogical moments but very very small and forgettable) and has enough twists which increases curiosity among audience.Screenplay- You may not see it regularly that a film with run time of 150 minutes keeps you engaged throughout. Secret Superstar manages to do so, a slight let down in 2nd half while moving towards climax it looks 5 or 10 minutes longer than expected. But come on emotions takes time.Music- Dear Amit Trivedi you have failed to deliver a chartbuster but thanks for Melodious 'Nach Di Fira'. Every song is situational so doesn't make you bore, though we expected Hit songs which are actually not required for the film.Cinematography- Fairly Good, nothing impressive, extraordinary or noticeable.Direction- Advait Man, you just arrived with a Bang. What a debut man, may be i'm making an overstatement but you could be Best after Hirani in Future. The way you crafted the Story, used twist at the right moments, the way you used Nach di Fira song in 2 version that vision is just Outstanding. No big sets, No expensive things yet a perfect cinematic frame on screen. All The Best for your Future, i wish to meet you soon and thank you for this Classic.Final Words- As a whole, Secret Superstar is 'Classic' and Best Film of the year so far (Leveled with Hindi Medium). This one deserves to be watched by entire family this Diwali especially by classes. Mass lovers might not be pleased as it lacks that high entertainment value but still got Aamir Khan's Hilariousness. I'm giving 8/10* to this well made Classic and Strongly Recommend you to watch it at any cost.",count one more classic apks bucket birth genius director great actress,secret superstar review watch it as aamir fan you will not be disappointed watch it as aamir hater you will not be disappointed watch it as neutral quality cinema lover still you wont be disappointed acting i wont be surprised if despite being child actress not fully zaira wasim wins best actress awards film by crushing many senior actresses bollywood first film as lead actor she delivers performance remember years meher mam you deserved big films big roles im sure you will totally nail it just like you did as nazma supporting star cast highly appreciated aamir as shakti kumarrr is completely hilarious he hardly has 20 minutes role 10 12 minutes goes overacting character need few people even asked theater why is he doing so much overacting yet he has got few moments explore actor him he makes you laugh out loudly few scenes complete 5 6 minutes writing it is powerful story is realistic has some illogical moments but very very small forgettable has enough twists which increases curiosity among audience screenplay you may not see it regularly that film with run time 150 minutes keeps you engaged throughout secret superstar manages do so slight let down 2nd half while moving towards climax it looks 5 or 10 minutes longer than expected but come emotions takes time music dear amit trivedi you have failed deliver chartbuster but thanks melodious nach di fira every song is situational so doesnt make you bore though we expected hit songs which are actually not required film cinematography fairly good nothing impressive extraordinary or noticeable direction advait man you just arrived with bang what debut man may be im making overstatement but you could be best after hirani future way you crafted story used twist at right moments way you used nach di fira song 2 version that vision is just outstanding no big sets no expensive things yet perfect cinematic frame screen all best your future i wish meet you soon thank you this classic final words as whole secret superstar is classic best film year so far leveled with hindi medium this one deserves be watched by entire family this diwali especially by classes mass lovers might not be pleased as it lacks that high entertainment value but still got aamir khans hilariousness im giving 8 10 this well made classic strongly recommend you watch it at any cost,0.46488688295831154,0.13343083900226757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"

Reasons that prevent from millions of people to reach their potential. It's an ode to a mother, an ode to a girl child and hopefully a lesson for a lot of people to be more accepting.

8.0,Secret Superstar is certainly superhit in terms of its content and superlative performances.,"Secret Superstar, a film by Advait Chandan, is a perfect treat to movie lovers in this festive season of Diwali. Diwali is a festival of not only lighting lamps outside but it is all about how we deal with the darkness inside. This festival is also about the inner triumph and winning over one's fears, insecurities, compulsion to succumb to situations and accepting defeat. In this film, we see a 15 year old girl who dares to fulfill her dream of becoming a singing superstar. It is about her journey to be the singing sensation through her you tube videos and finally becoming the playback singer. A very simple film but it showcases serious issues underlying in our patriarch society. The story has lot of heartwarming moments, rather some heartbreaking moments as well. The film has some beautiful mother-daughter moments. One gets amazed at the kind of maturity a 15 year old girl has in understanding her mother's ordeal who constantly suffers due to domestic violence. The film prompts us to question our own existence, do we die even when we are breathing and is there any life left within us when we don't dare to dream, don't stand up for our rights. The film does take certain cinematic liberties, certain conflicts getting resolved in not-so-realistic manner, and of course making certain scenes a bit melodramatic. But, these minor flaws don't snatch away the potential of Secret Superstar to be a superhit. Secret Superstar showcases domestic violence, female infanticide, hypocrite patriarch society, indiscrimination between a girl and a boy child, imposing marriage on teenage girls etc. On the other hand, it also projects the spirit to live life on one's own terms and conditions, with the feeling of power of liberation from inside, set oneself free from all negativities and toxicities around and pursue passion in a focused manner etc. Watch Secret Superstar.The film begins with a few students singing Antakshari in train. Insiya's (Zaira Wasim, Dangal fame – young Geeta Phogat) entry happens with her singing a beautiful song 'Sapna re'. Chintan (Tirth Sharma), her classmate, seems to be smitten with her. Insiya's mother Najma Malik (Meher Vij) waits at Vadodara railway station to receive Insiya. Insiya gets troubled to see the scar of domestic violence on Najma's face. The initial scenes make it very clear that Insiya belongs to a conservative family. Her Father Farookh Malik (Raj Arjun) does not give a damn to his wife, humiliates her, physically abuses her for even small things. He is against Insiya playing guitar and following music. He does create hurdle for Insiya. But Najma is a big support system for Insiya. She finds out her own ways to support Insiya without Farookh's knowledge. Still, both of them are unable to stand up in front of Farookh who just can't tolerate Insiya's musical interests. Insiya has her paternal grandmother Farrukh Jaffar and a younger brother Guddu (Kabir Sajjid) at home. Guddu brings his innocence to the story. Shakti (Aamir Khan) is an arrogant Music Director who has lost his credibility. His personal as well as professional lives are under the media scrutiny. He picks up fight with other artists as well. As per one of the dialogue of the film, he creates remix of those songs which never got released.What paths Insiya choose to fulfill her dream? How does Shakti become instrumental in facilitating her journey and giving a boost to her dream? How does Najma support Insiya in fulfilling her dream? How does Najma manage to fight her humiliations by husband? What role Chintan play and how he manages to grow to be a good friend of Insiya? Farrukh Jaffar plays the role of paternal grandmother of Insiya. Initially her character seems to be that of a mere spectator but her one dialogue towards the end makes her presence and character clear. I think, it is intentionally chosen to keep the characters not –so - perfect. For example, Insiya is not shown as a perfect daughter, sister or granddaughter. This makes the character look realistic. What appeared unrealistic in the film is certain aspects viz. Insiya becoming overnight you-tube singing sensation, and how she gets the support of an otherwise arrogant and flamboyant Shakti. The plot is certainly predictable, but yes, the film does keep the audience intrigued. The best performance comes from Mehar Vij as mother Najma. She is so expressive. Zaira Wasim also gives a great performance. She brings lot of maturity to the character of Insiya. Zaira is good in projecting her vulnerabilities, her excitement, irritation, impatience and passion etc. Raj Arjun is good as father, one tempts to hate him for his typical dominating behaviour. What to talk about Aamir Khan? He is one actor in our country, whose preparation and transformation for every role is absolutely incredible. In Secret Superstar also, he has very few scenes, but his presence is felt throughout the film. He has so convincingly projected the brat, arrogant, flirt, short-tempered as well as compassionate Shakti. He loves real talents. He has his grievances of not getting his due from the industry since he has not received any awards. Tirth Sharma as Chintan is also very good and noticeable as a teenage friend, admirer and supporter of Insiya. Secret Superstar is the story of triumph over inner and outer toxicities which keep us away from following our dreams and passion and henceforth not living life at all. Secret Superstar is certainly superhit in terms of its content and superlative performances. Secret Superstar is about how a teenager achieves her dreams in spite of all odds. She is not ready to play victim card but she takes up the charge of the situation and chooses the best possible option. The film belongs to Zaira and Meher. A wonderful gift on Diwali, the festival of lights.",secret superstar is certainly superhit terms its content superlative performances,secret superstar film by advait chandan is perfect treat movie

10.0,Do Not Miss This Movie. A Must Watch,"When a movie has Aamir Khan's name associated with it, expectations are naturally sky high. Post wowing one & all with Taare Zameen Par, Aamir's latest movie deals with teenage ambitions & realising your dreams by overcoming all obstacles. While the trailer depicted that the movie is about a talented Muslim teen who has to put up with an abusive father & her journey towards becoming a singing superstar we were excited to watch how well Zaira Wasim's movie turns out. The movie is set in Vadodra. The story revolves around Zaira Wasim(Insiya) who closely follows singing competitions & award shows with the hopes of making it big herself. She has a supportive mother Najma(Meher Vij), a loving brother Guddu(Kabir Sajid), abusive father Farookh(Raj Arjun) & a granny(Farrukh Jaffer). She also has a classmate - Chintan Parekh(Tirth Sharma) who is totally smitten by her. While she has a voice & talent which is one in a million, her conservative father plays deal breaker. The movie captures the innocence of youth, small town lives, dreams, ambitions very well. The story builds up gradually. There are no songs to disrupt the flow of the movie. Some scenes provide a satirical look at singing competitions, musicians & tuition classes. The scenes involving Insiya & Chintan will put a smile on your face. Zaira Wasim as the protagonist is top notch. You will find it difficult to believe that it is just her second film. Meher Vij as Najma is good. The scenes involving the mother-daughter duo are very well written. You will cringe at the sight of Raj Arjun(Farrukh) in the movie. Due credit must be given to him for a fine performance. The one scene involving domestic violence will make you hate Farrukh & pity those who have been victims of domestic violence. Chintan is the most lovable character in the film. His selfless devotion towards his sweetheart will make a lot of women & men think about their puppy loves. The screenplay is excellent. The writers need to be lauded for coming up with such a tight script. It is a movie which can be enjoyed by people across age groups. Advait Chandan does a fantastic job in what probably is his debut film as a director. Last but not the least, Aamir Khan must be thanked for giving us another terrific film. One can't help but admire him for taking a backseat & let others shine. Despite being in limited scenes in the movie, he is a complete scene stealer. His act of an air headed music composer-singer which seems to be a caricature of several artistes will make you guffaw with laughter at times. His mannerisms are too funny & are to be seen to be believed. The only drawback is that barring 1 or 2 songs the music is not what would one would expect from a movie which has music at its core. We would advise everyone to watch this movie in a theatre near you in the next available show along with their entire family.

5.0,"Average film with high dose of melodrama, few good scenes here and there","My rating- 2.5/5 (Average film)Positives- 1.) Zaira Wasim- Acting was superb 👍 2.) Aamir Khan- His comedy role was good and funny. Few good comedies here and there and his role was a comic relief in this highly melodramatic film.😂😂 3.) Meher vij( mom) , Raj Arjun(dad) , kabir(young brother) and tirth (boyfriend)- All were excellent and their acting was in par with Zaira's acting. Raj Arjun's Serious role as angry father is definitely one of the best performance he has done and he needs to applauded for that. Meher Vij as innocent mother gave her natural performance in this film (her emotional performance was superb).4.) Music and bg score 5.)Cinematography Negatives- 1.) Advaith Chandan (director and script writer)- His script was full of dramatic dialogues but thanks to those actors whose natural performance didn't show any sign of it. His vision about this movie was completely filled with sentimental clichés trying to make people cry (Just like tubelight). But luckily it wasn't as bad as Tubelight because tubelight was king of melodrama. His casting of actors was perfect and relief for the audience otherwise my rating would have gone below 2.5.2.)Climax- Film had few good scenes here and there and towards the end i was expecting a good ending and it was almost going to the right track when suddenly they shifted to the highly melodramatic track where it reminded me of 90's Bollywood climax .3.)Length of the film Overall- I was disappointed because i heard good reviews and people were giving 4 stars and i though it will be a good film.(Some critics said that it was the one of the best Bollywood film of 2017) But my opinion is going to be exact opposite of it. Those who love highly melodramatic films can go for it. Others please stay away and wait for its DVD print. (Watch it only for the best performances of the cast) My rating- 2.5/5",average film with high dose melodrama few good scenes here there,my rating 2 5 5 average film positives 1 zaira wasim acting was superb 2 aamir khan his comedy role was good funny few good comedies here there his role was comic relief this highly melodramatic film 3 meher vij mom raj arjun dad kabir young brother tirth boyfriend all were excellent their acting was par with zairas acting raj arjuns serious role as angry father is definitely one best performance he has done he needs applauded that meher vij as innocent mother gave her natural performance this film her emotional performance was superb 4 music bg score 5 cinematography negatives 1 advaith chandan director script writer his script was full dramatic dialogues but thanks those actors whose natural performance didnt show any sign it his vision about this movie was completely filled with sentimental clich s trying make people cry just like tubelight but luckily it wasnt as bad as tubelight because tubelight was king melodrama his casting actors was perfect relief audience otherwise my rating would have gone below 2 5 2 climax film had few good scenes here there towards end i was expecting good ending it was almost going right track when suddenly they shifted highly melodramatic track where it reminded me 90s bollywood climax 3 length film overall i was disappointed because i heard good reviews people were giving 4 stars i though it will be good film some critics said that it was one best bollywood film 2017 but my opinion is going be exact opposite it those who love highly melodramatic films can go it others please stay away wait its dvd print watch it only best performances cast my rating 2 5 5,0.5162713387241691,0.2206109613656783,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10.0,"A perfect Diwali gift from A ""Secret Superstar""!!!","Secret Superstar is one of the few movies that travel far with you and you just carried away along with them. It is a story about motherhood (an unceasing and endearing relationship between a mother and a daughter), about dreams and struggles to achieve them. This movie marvelously illustrates if you really have a dream and you have the will to fulfill it, then no matter how bad the circumstances are, you will turn your dreams into reality. It beautifully explains the sacrifices a mother can make to make her child happy and his/her dream come true. Now coming to the plot/story which is a backbone of this wonderful movie: The story is very engaging and mesmerizing. It is highly inspiring and filled with a lot of emotions and unforgettable moments. Some scenes are the real heart-stealer like scenes between Insiya (Zaria Wasim) and her mother (Meher Vij), the first meeting of Shakti Kumar (Aamir Khan) and Insiya and last few minutes. This film will also make you nostalgic for your school love and crushes. 10/10 for Advait Chandan's highly inspiring and emotional story. Phenomenal -10/10. Direction: Advait Chandan's direction is terrific and beyond expectations. It doesn't seem that it is his first movie as a director. I didn't expect SO MUCH from him. He has captured the mother- daughter bond brilliantly and framed emotional and tear- jerking moments beautifully. And also, he has put the right dose of humor into the movie. Performances: The film is loaded with brilliant and mind-blowing performances. After Dangal, Zaria Wasim once again proved that she is a brilliant actor and upcoming ""superstar"". Her acting is impeccable and extraordinary. She has lived the character of a teenage girl caged by his orthodox and short-tempered father but dares to dream big and tries to fulfill it against all odds. Meher Vij is very natural and realistic. She is very adorable and reminds you of your mother. But, Aamir Khan despite being in a supportive and short role, creates magic. He makes you laugh with his raunchy face expressions and dance moves but also makes you cry with his tearful and heart-warming eyes at the same time. Also, Raj Arjun (Zaria's father) and Tirth Sharma (Zaria's School friend) have played their parts wonderfully. 10/10 in performances. Music: The music of the film is good. Although, except ""Nachdi Phira"" none of the songs seems to be a perfect choice for the playlist and to be listened in a repetitive mode. But, when you listen to them in the movie, the songs seem completely different and soothing due to their perfect timings and great lyrics. It would have been terrific if all the songs were as good as ""Nachdi Phira"". But still, they are pleasurable when you hear them in the movie. The last verdict: ""Secret Superstar"" is a very special movie and a perfect Diwali gift from Aamir Khan and Zaria Wasim. It inspires you and makes you nostalgic for your school days. This movie makes you cry and laugh at the same time and connects with you in the best possible way. Don't dare to skip this masterpiece at any cost. Go with your family and loved ones and come out of the theater with tears in your eyes but smile on your face. A MUST MUST WATCH.

10.0,Amazing Movie!,"I have never written reviews for any movie but this one is an exception. I really want everyone to watch this movie and thus the review.. Secret Superstar is the best movie that I've watched this year so far. Actresses Zaira Wasim and Meher Viz have done justice to their characters- Simply phenomenal acting. This movie has beautifully casted light on a major issue prevailing in our society since years- Patriarchy. Very well written and directed. Its not just a movie but there is a very meaningful take away from this film. This movie does not just boosts women empowerment but it speaks volumes about various other issues like domestic violence , female foeticide, gender inequality, etc that no mainstream cinema has ever dared to show on the big screen. In short its a must watch for all age groups and all genders.",amazing movie,i have never written reviews any movie but this one is exception i really want everyone watch this movie thus review secret superstar is best movie that ive watched this year so far actresses zaira wasim meher viz have done justice their characters simply phenomenal acting this movie has beautifully casted light major issue prevailing our society since years patriarchy very well written directed its not just movie but there is very meaningful take away this film this movie does not just boosts women empowerment but it speaks volumes about various other issues like domestic violence female foeticide gender inequality etc that no mainstream cinema has ever dared show big screen short its must watch all age groups all genders,0.46064814814814814,0.2243055555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.53, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Secret Superstar is another best Aamir Khan Film to watch out with your family this weekend!,"Secret Superstar looks like it is a sequel to Aamir Khan's 2007 psychological film ""Taare Zameen Par"" where Darsheel Safary is replaced by a not-so-unknown ""Fresh-Face"" Zaira Wasim. Zaira Wasim totally steals the show. Also, the contribution to the film's elegance made by Meher Vij is worth-applauds. Secret Superstar is a story of a young girl named Insiya (Zaira Wasim) who wants the whole world to listen to her fresh voice. She is strongly supported by her on-screen mother (Meher Vij). But, Insiya's wings are pulled off by her father (Raj Arjun). But, the twist in the by-time extra-emotional film, is added by a funky-chunky musician and singer Shakti Kumaarr who is better known for his unusual behavior but strongly supports the ideas of Insiya.The movie is a best for to be known ""psychologically emotional.""
