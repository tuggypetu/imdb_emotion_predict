10.0,This might become one of the most underrated movie of Tamil cinema,The narration and the thought process of the director is so unique and intriguing. The movie keeps up on the edge even though we are able to guess certain elements in the screenplay. The songs were surprisingly quite fresh and added another dimension of emotion to the plot.

9.0,"Classic, taut, mindblowing and outstanding supense thriller. Not to be missed!!!! Every chance of being remade in other languages if it gets due recognition","Genre: Suspense crime thrillerNo spoiler alerts Premise: In a murder case, police arrests civil engineer Ezhil (Arun Vijay) based on a photograph evidence. Twist comes when his look alike Kavin (again Arun Vijay), a petty but intelligent criminal, is also arrested. This makes the case stand still as there's no strong evidence against them and they don't have strong alibis. Who's the real culprit? Why do they look alike and why was the murder committed forms the plot What worked well? 1. Tight, screenplay and sharp editing: Screenplay has no loopholes- No unwanted songs, no lengthy romance sequence, no heroism, no unnecessary comedy (barring first few mins), no guns or gadgets. The director has stuck to basic discipline i.e. screenplay and story. Simply brilliant!!! 2. Twists and turns in the movie creates an interest and you will be glued to screen. None of them are unrealistic or predictable!!! 3. Performances: It made me wonder this is an usual run of the mill story when twins looked exactly the same but you will realize it's the actual strength in the movie and much warranted. Arun Vijay is the soul of the movie and he has fully used the opportunity and is at his best!!!! 4. Director: His earlier venture with Arun Vijay was a good one and his last venture was in the lines of Departed. Both didn't get it's due recognition. It's the best among his works!!!! (Trivia: Director gave voice for Anurag Kashyap in Imaikka Nodigal) 5. It's based on real events and they quote real life judgements at the end of the movieWhat didn't work well? 1. BGM was good in parts but still could have been better. 2. There are some loophole and clues behind the suspense - trust me audiences won't even be able to think till the end of the movieI hope audience appreciate this movie given Arun Vijay is popular now.

The plot takes time to settle down in the first half, the second half is outstanding with the interesting investigation developments which makes you anxious.Arun Vijay is a revelation during the entire course of the movie, he displays brillant variations in the characters of Ezhil and Kavin with subtlety. Fefsi and Vidya provide brilliant performances as the Police Officials.

7.0,"Probably, the best use of twins theme ever done in cinematic Liberty. A fulfilling twisty ride.","Thadam (2019) : Brief Review -Probably, the best use of twins theme ever done in cinematic Liberty. A fulfilling twisty ride. Twins theme is not new for cinema world, it's been more than 6 decades we have been seeing multiple stories driven by the same idea. However, it became cliched after some time when filmmakers didn't think about doing something new with it. Finally, Magizh Thirumeni's Tamil Crime Thriller Thadam has ended that dry spell. The murder of a youngster creates confusion among cops when they discover the suspect has an identical twin brother. Thadam lacks quality in cinematic aspects but that doesn't matter much as the film was never supposed to entertain art lovers. It's pretty enjoyable and massy film with lots of twists and logical segments. It also has loopholes though, not quite arguable. But that hurts its overall impact for sure because the twist becomes predictable at one moment. It was like, yeah i doubted that at the beginning only and funnily it turned out exactly the same. But isn't it lovable? I mean sometimes predicting things is more fun than unpredictable twists and especially when it comes to light toned film like Thadam. Yes but we have to agree that director could have made it more accurate and outstanding thriller by covering the loopes such the heroine's character and pretty unintelligent nature of all the cops. Arun Vijay shines in the film in both the roles. The varieties are as real as it could get and the situations are ingrained too. Supporting cast is decent, background music is okay and technical aspects are fine. Thadam is hurt by low grade framework and mass oriented execution but that's forgivable. As a matter of fact, it's all about unfolding thrill in audience friendly manners than getting immense accuracy. Thirumeni deserves all the Love for making such a nice twisty ride on typical theme like Twins.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",probably best use twins theme ever done cinematic liberty fulfilling twisty ride,thadam 2019 brief review probably best use twins theme ever done cinematic liberty fulfilling twisty ride twins theme is not new cinema world its been more than 6 decades we have been seeing multiple stories driven by same idea however it became cliched after some time when filmmakers didnt think about doing something new with it finally magizh thirumenis tamil crime thriller thadam has ended that dry spell murder youngster creates confusion among cops when they discover suspect has identical twin brother thadam lacks quality cinematic aspects but that doesnt matter much as film was never supposed entertain art lovers its pretty enjoyable massy film with lots twists logical segments it also has loopholes though not quite arguable but that hurts its overall impact sure because twist becomes predictable at one moment it was like yeah i doubted that at beginning only funnily it turned out exactly same but isnt it lovable i mean sometimes predicting things is more fun than unpredictable twists especially when it comes light toned film like thadam yes but we have agree that director could have made it more accurate outstanding thriller by covering loopes such heroines character pretty unintelligent nature all cops arun vijay shines film both roles varieties are as real as it could get situations are ingrained too supporting cast is decent background music is okay technical aspects are fine thadam is hurt by low grade framework mass oriented execution but thats forgivable as matter fact its all about unfolding thrill audience friendly manners than getting immense accuracy thirumeni deserves all love making such nice twisty ride typical theme like twins rating 7 10 by,0.5304859822716965,0.19008194186765617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7.0,Clever,"Review By Kamal KMagizh Thirumeni's Thadam is a whodunit thriller with ample engaging moments, thanks to its gripping screenplay. Kavin (Arun Vijay) is a petty thief who indulges in various financial dealings with the help of his aide Suruli (Yogi Babu). A selfish person, he doesn't value Ananthi's (Smruthi Venkat) true love for him. Meanwhile, Ezhil (Arun Vijay in another role), who is into construction business, dreams of settling down with Deepika (Tanya Hope)One of them murders a youngster, which becomes a sensational case. The police, under the guidance of Gopalakrishnan (FEFSI Vijayan), nabs Ezhil first based on his image, which is found on the deceased person's phone. The police officer, who had been waiting for a chance to take revenge on Ezhil for a personal reason, plots to get him maximum punishment. However, he gets the shock of his life when other cops takes Kavin also to the custody.Gopalakrishnan asks his junior Malarvizhi (Vidya Pradeep) to take up the case. With hardly any evidence, thanks to the perfectly executed crime, Malar struggles to find who, between Ezhil and Kavin, is the real culprit. The case reaches a stage when she has to give up the case due to lack of evidence.Thadam has an intriguingly written flow of events that begin from the pre-interval point and the film maintains the suspense factor till the end. The movie, however, would have been better with a little more care given to the writing. It takes a long time to get to the plot, which makes the beginning a bit slow. The film also hassome spoon-feeding moments as the director wants the audience to differentiate between Ezhil and Kavin even in scenes where they do not appear together.Arun Vijay steals the show with dual roles which are poles apart in mannerisms and body language. Vidya Pradeep as the smart cop, too, stands out.
