1,Nightmare,"It was a nightmare but a comedy film. Mehmet Ali Erbil continued his mission to destroy Turkish cinema and he is very successful.First of all the script is not original. It is copied from Cem Yılmaz's stand up shows. None of the artists done their job, they were awful. Cüneyt Arkın, made himself disgraced. This movie was a shame for Turkish cinema and should not be watched. Whatever you do in 110 minutes, would be more useful than you spend to watch this piece of trash. The director (Kartal Tibet) should not feel comfortable after this movie. Nobody can erase these awful scenes from my mind. I gave one point for this movie because there was no zero.I hope Mehmet Ali Erbil would not act on a film again.",nightmare,it was nightmare but comedy film mehmet ali erbil continued his mission destroy turkish cinema he is very successful first all script is not original it is copied cem y lmazs stand up shows none artists done their job they were awful c neyt ark n made himself disgraced this movie was shame turkish cinema should not be watched whatever you do 110 minutes would be more useful than you spend watch this piece trash director kartal tibet should not feel comfortable after this movie nobody can erase these awful scenes my mind i gave one point this movie because there was no zero i hope mehmet ali erbil would not act film again,0.5981481481481481,0.004166666666666676,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"
1,Worst movie ever made,"For Keloglan Kara Prens'e Karsi, I thought that, this movie is the worst movie ever made and in my whole life, I won't be able to see another one this bad. But now I understand, I was totally wrong. ""Dunyayi Kurtaran Adamin Oglu"" is much more successful in being a bad movie than Keloglan Kara Prens'e Karsi. Now I think, as long as the Turkish film producers continue to make movies, I'll continue to see unbelievably bad movies. The money, which I gave for this film was not much, but I feel sorry for my 2 hours spent for nothing. Yes, this movie is nothing. Please take my recommendation: Even if someone gives you money to watch this movie, don't even think about it. I can tell you numerous reasons about why I like a movie. But for this one, there's simply nothing to say. It was supposed to be a comedy film, but I didn't even smile!! Come on guys, is the script writer an 8 year old boy or what? What were you thinking? The original cult film ""The man who saves the world"" was also a bad movie but at least it was funny, not boring. There were scenes, which one wants to see. But for this, there's nothing to say.

1,Mindbogglingly awful,"Every major cult film fan has watched ""Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam"" (Man who saves the world) aka Turkish Star Wars. Quarter a century after that was released ,we get a sequel -""Dunyayi Kurtaran Adamin oglu"" (Son of the man who saves the world). While the original was meant to be a serious science fiction adventure, this one attempts to be a parody of the old film and various other science fiction films in the vein of G.O.R.A. Needless to say, the result is cinematic sewage.The film is a basically a serious of gags , none of which are close to being remotely funny. The acting is even worse. Erbil has already sealed his spot in the acting hall of shame with the lame shrek-wannabe Keloglan (he was even worse than Petek Dincoz, which should tell you how amazingly bad he was). Cuneyt Arkin seems to be sleepwalking. Sinem Kobal who is one of the most promising young Turkish actresses working today, would want to erase this off her resume for her career's sake.The sad news is that this film actually did well at the box office, so we will soon be hit with the inevitable sequel. Let's hope that it completely flops so that the public is spared from another 2 hours of garbage.",mindbogglingly awful,every major cult film fan has watched dunyayi kurtaran adam man who saves world aka turkish star wars quarter century after that was released we get sequel dunyayi kurtaran adamin oglu son man who saves world while original was meant be serious science fiction adventure this one attempts be parody old film various other science fiction films vein g o r needless say result is cinematic sewage film is basically serious gags none which are close being remotely funny acting is even worse erbil has already sealed his spot acting hall shame with lame shrek wannabe keloglan he was even worse than petek dincoz which should tell you how amazingly bad he was cuneyt arkin seems be sleepwalking sinem kobal who is one most promising young turkish actresses working today would want erase this off her resume her careers sake sad news is that this film actually did well at box office so we will soon be hit with inevitable sequel lets hope that it completely flops so that public is spared another 2 hours garbage,0.5376666666666666,-0.12416666666666665,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.29}"
3,Crass and Trashy,"I tried to watch this film, I really did - I happened to be at someone's home and their young nephew had brought this movie to keep himself entertained. In goes the DVD, and there upon the TV screen I see Mehmet Ali Erbil prancing around in all his glory. The movie banks heavily on Mr. Erbil's ""irresistible"" charm - To say that the filmmakers overestimated Erbil's abilities is the understatement of the decade.Basically, the film is a campy 'remake' of Dünyayi Kurtaran Adam (AKA: ""Turkish Star Wars""; Semi-literal translation ""The Man Who Saved the World"" ) that retains none of the original film's crude charm. This movie is just so poorly constructed it isn't even as unintentionally funny as the original - There is simply no way to excuse the people behind this film for being so lazy and crass.However, I don't think it deserves to be in the Bottom 100 - It's a trashy movie, there is no sense in debating that point, but there are many other titles more deserving of such an 'honor' both within and outside of the world of Turkish cinema. Seriously, some of the sleazy movies that come on late at night make this movie look like a Shakespearean classic on film.This is type of film that will act as late night filler for years to come in Turkey, but it's hardly the worst thing out there. I do not recommend this movie to anyone other than rabid Mehmet Ali Erbil fans and people who have their heart set on seeing what all the fuss is about.",crass trashy,i tried watch this film i really did i happened be at someones home their young nephew had brought this movie keep himself entertained goes dvd there upon tv screen i see mehmet ali erbil prancing around all his glory movie banks heavily mr erbils irresistible charm say that filmmakers overestimated erbils abilities is understatement decade basically film is campy remake d nyayi kurtaran adam aka turkish star wars semi literal translation man who saved world that retains none original films crude charm this movie is just so poorly constructed it isnt even as unintentionally funny as original there is simply no way excuse people behind this film being so lazy crass however i dont think it deserves be bottom 100 its trashy movie there is no sense debating that point but there are many other titles more deserving such honor both within outside world turkish cinema seriously some sleazy movies that come late at night make this movie look like shakespearean classic film this is type film that will act as late night filler years come turkey but its hardly worst thing out there i do not recommend this movie anyone other than rabid mehmet ali erbil fans people who have their heart set seeing what all fuss is about,0.5600198412698413,-0.04652777777777778,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.24}"

1,"As a sequel it fails, as a comedy it fails and as a comedic sequel IT JUMPS THE MEGA SHARK","Once upon a time there was a film called Turkish Star Wars at least thats what everyone calls it) The film is one of the most loved bad films for its ripping of stock footage from Star Wars, the poor effects, the silly action and the ridiculous plot! So 20 years later they try to make a sequel and not just a sequel A COMEDIC SEQUEL even though the first movie was taken seriously! That is a bad idea from the start a it differs too much from the tone of the first movie which while it was silly it was taken seriously which adds to the appeal. The first flaw in this movie is the jokes are horrible! The jokes are so forced you would probably be seriously injured from the sudden force! The timing is awful as well mainly because they either go on for too long or they are so quick you would not even realize they were jokes. The movie relies on too many stereotypes and predict-abilities like a dog on the spaceship who is pissing on the equipment or an old lady who is the maid or a child soldier or heck an old man who is always asleep LOLROFLMAOBBQ!!!!!! the production value are decent but they are too good because the original was had a dirt poor budget which adds to the film's appeal but production values in this movie are not used for comedic effect even!!!! In case you have not realized there is no plot!!! The movie is just an hour and a half long three stooges skit in space (and if I wanted to watch that I would have watched The Three Stooges in Orbit!) the movie pretends it has one with the son of the protagonist from the first movie but he is painfully dull and random stuff just happens! Do not watch this movie! If you want comedy sci fi than go watch Red Dwarf, Mars Attacks!, Spaceballs, Galaxy Quest or The movie version of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy just anything but this!!!!",as sequel it fails as comedy it fails as comedic sequel it jumps mega shark,once upon time there was film called turkish star wars at least thats what everyone calls it film is one most loved bad films its ripping stock footage star wars poor effects silly action ridiculous plot so 20 years later they try make sequel not just sequel comedic sequel even though first movie was taken seriously that is bad idea start it differs too much tone first movie which while it was silly it was taken seriously which adds appeal first flaw this movie is jokes are horrible jokes are so forced you would probably be seriously injured sudden force timing is awful as well mainly because they either go too long or they are so quick you would not even realize they were jokes movie relies too many stereotypes predict abilities like dog spaceship who is pissing equipment or old lady who is maid or child soldier or heck old man who is always asleep lolroflmaobbq production value are decent but they are too good because original was had dirt poor budget which adds films appeal but production values this movie are not used comedic effect even case you have not realized there is no plot movie is just hour half long three stooges skit space if i wanted watch that i would have watched three stooges orbit movie pretends it has one with son protagonist first movie but he is painfully dull random stuff just happens do not watch this movie if you want comedy sci fi than go watch red dwarf mars attacks spaceballs galaxy quest or movie version hitchhikers guide galaxy just anything but this,0.49083333333333334,-0.10624999999999996,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1,This movie has disturbed my inner peace,"""Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam"" was so naive and childish that you can almost like that film for its mistakes and cheesiness. Nothing can render infringement valid but it is so absurd and made out of nothing, you can, in a way, understand the state of mind in which they produced that movie to begin with.But is there really an excuse of this one in any meaningful way? Obviously they have the budget and every kind of opportunity. I won't go into detail, because even discussing the fact that there are people in this country, who feel easy of depicting themselves like this proudly and call the film ""turks in space"", simply frustrates me. If they could just donate the entire money they spent on this film to an orphanage, not only they could have the blessing of many unfortunate kids but also they would avoid a million's hatred.One thing I can't really comprehend is that how they dared to shoot such a film after GORA. This movie is not only an unimaginably unsuccessful sequel to a movie that is unimaginably naive and problematic but also uses the very fundamental elements of GORA, like main actor starring both as the antagonist and the protagonist.All those unbearable jokes, bad acting, CG worse than those used in the worst series in the worst Turkish channels...

I just don't get how anyone can make a movie like this, and think the end result is good enough to show it to the public. There is nothing in this movie worth the audience' time or money.The synopsis tell us that it is about a Turkish spaceship captain who searches the galaxy for a lost crew member. In reality it is just a bunch of paper thin, stereotypical, poorly acted characters going through an unfunny comedy routine, mixed in with a bit of promotion for Turkey and Turkish culture. The inane story is just something that happens in the background for mot of the running time, then ends with an underwhelming Disney style climax.

4,Answer to a comment on 'Dunyayı Kurtaran Adamın Oglu,"Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..",answer comment dunyay kurtaran adam n oglu,okay first i want say even if im turk i dont like these type movies but still i wanted say few things first movie d nyay kurtaran adam was total disaster everyone turkey makes fun it because it was made seriously as sci fi movie they stole many things star wars but second movie is comedy now most important thing world class comedy film is make everyone planet laugh but it doesnt mean that you have make everyone laugh make ordinary comedy movie i read that one commenter said that its not even close funny now im turkey believe me there are many european american movies people here dont laugh at there are many movies you people dont laugh at this films aim is turkish population because turkish sense humor isnt same with others actually every countries sense humor is different with other countries so my opinion is that it doesnt make sense say not even close funny comedy movie that isnt your country because it may not suit your sense humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it so please make your comments comedy movies according these things im sorry if my english was bad,0.4270104895104894,0.12431041181041178,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.09}"

1,Oh my god,"Awful,disgusting,pointless I can write more negative words but it would be a waste of time... Has to be the worst movie and it shocked me when I saw the movie in the middle of the bottom list because it has to be the 1 in the list. My little brother has slept in the cinema and said 'Can we get our money back?'. Mehmet Ali Erbil's masterpiece(!). Don't watch this movie... It is a waste of time... By the way I want to talk about Turkish Sci-Fi movies. When I saw the trailer of 'Dünyayı Kurtaran Adamın Oğlu' I was pretty happy because finally Turkish Cinema leveled up and shoot a film about space but I was wrong. It was a stupid comedy movie with a very low quality of Space Ship graphics and area. If we see 'Dünyayı Kurtaran Adamın Torunu' it won't be a surprise.

1,why ?,"Even if some productions are bad, you don't want to give 1 point because of the respect you have for the effort spent on that production.

9,Turks in Space (composition of our culture),"I am really proud of the scenarist who wrote this movie. It requires an educational background and maturity with good knowledge of our culture to understand it. I read the other comments as well. The only thing I can say is that the movie is a really perfect summary of the characteristic behavior and thinking of our people. It is well done with all kinds of details with really nice criticisms of our culture. Besides, it balances the negative and positive sides of our people and culture objectively. Therefore, I recommend all foreigners to watch it if they wanna know Turkish people more. The film is a really really good reflection of Turkey. I would like to thank to all people who worked for and in the film.Yours sincerely",turks space composition our culture,i am really proud scenarist who wrote this movie it requires educational background maturity with good knowledge our culture understand it i read other comments as well only thing i can say is that movie is really perfect summary characteristic behavior thinking our people it is well done with all kinds details with really nice criticisms our culture besides it balances negative positive sides our people culture objectively therefore i recommend all foreigners watch it if they wanna know turkish people more film is really really good reflection turkey i would like thank all people who worked film yours sincerely,0.5955086580086579,0.3418290043290043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
