8.0,Jack is back. This time they did it right.,"Nice addition to the saga but still not as good as the old ones...I m a 30+ old big fan of the Pirates of Caribbean movies and absolutely love what Gore Verbinski did with the first 3. I was utterly disappointed with the previous potc movie (#4). I went to watch this new one with a lot of prejudice. But luckily it was an epic and fun movie to watch! Extremely entertaining and connected with Verbinski's style and work. Lots of beautiful action scenes, nice landscapes, humour and never ever, at any point boring. Jack Sparrow is definitely back in great form. 8/10",jack is back this time they did it right,nice addition saga but still not as good as old ones i m 30 old big fan pirates caribbean movies absolutely love what gore verbinski did with first 3 i was utterly disappointed with previous potc movie i went watch this new one with lot prejudice but luckily it was epic fun movie watch extremely entertaining connected with verbinskis style work lots beautiful action scenes nice landscapes humour never ever at any point boring jack sparrow is definitely back great form 8 10,0.49652695789059426,0.19721566312475403,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"

4.0,A film that proves it's time to abandon ship on this franchise.,"Part of me wishes that the title of this film were true. What I wouldn't give to have these dead men not tell their tale of revenge. That being said, I had some hopes that this movie would help redeem the franchise after the lackluster On Stranger Tides (2011). After all, Javier Bardem has proven to be an effective villain in such films as No Country for Old Men (2007) and Skyfall (2012), so I thought he could help carry this movie as a solid antagonist. Unfortunately, even he could not save this sinking ship of a franchise.The main problem with Dead Men Tell No Tales is that it feels rote and uninspired. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow feels more lucky than actually talented at pirating. Granted, that was some of his charm in the previous films, but not all of it. Add to this a loose connection to the original trilogy as a vain attempt to remind the audience how great those films were, and it just highlights how bad this movie was. In fact, I felt the many overt double entendres were more groan-worthy than clever, merely pandering to the lowest common denominator. I can only assume that was why the doe-eyed and tightly bosomed Carina (Kaya Scodelario) featured into the plot so much.In a franchise that stakes itself on wild swashbuckling action sequences, this film had maybe two of note, and even they were uninteresting at best. This movie might have been better if it picked its battles more carefully, as the plot seemed like a stone skipping along the sea: never going very deep into any single character's arc, thus making them all seem insignificant when compiled together. If it was merely about Salazar's (Javier Bardem) revenge, Henry's (Brenton Thwaites) desire to break his father's curse, or Carina's search for treasure; then it might have been interesting. Unfortunately, it is all of these things and none of these things at the same time.A film that proves it's time to abandon ship on this franchise, I give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 2.0 stars out of 5.",film that proves its time abandon ship this franchise,part me wishes that title this film were true what i wouldnt give have these dead men not tell their tale revenge that being said i had some hopes that this movie would help redeem franchise after lackluster stranger tides 2011 after all javier bardem has proven be effective villain such films as no country old men 2007 skyfall 2012 so i thought he could help carry this movie as solid antagonist unfortunately even he could not save this sinking ship franchise main problem with dead men tell no tales is that it feels rote uninspired depps captain jack sparrow feels more lucky than actually talented at pirating granted that was some his charm previous films but not all it add this loose connection original trilogy as vain attempt remind audience how great those films were it just highlights how bad this movie was fact i felt many overt double entendres were more groan worthy than clever merely pandering lowest common denominator i can only assume that was why doe eyed tightly bosomed carina kaya scodelario featured into plot so much franchise that stakes itself wild swashbuckling action sequences this film had maybe two note even they were uninteresting at best this movie might have been better if it picked its battles more carefully as plot seemed like stone skipping along sea never going very deep into any single characters arc thus making them all seem insignificant when compiled together if it was merely about salazars javier bardem revenge henrys brenton thwaites desire break his fathers curse or carinas search treasure then it might have been interesting unfortunately it is all these things none these things at same time film that proves its time abandon ship this franchise i give pirates caribbean dead men tell no tales 2 0 stars out 5,0.5022689326177698,0.09840488968395947,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.38}"

6.0,"A decent, fun enough ride, could have been so much more however","The best film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise will always be the first, which is still a terrific film fourteen years later (has it really been that long, feels like only yesterday when first seeing it when it first came out).Its sequels are not on the same level, and while they are a long way from flawless none of them are awful films either. They have their flaws, 'Dead Man's Chest' did get too frenetic sometimes, 'At World's End' was overlong, bloated and needlessly bloated and 'On Stranger Tides' (which has been dumped upon by many here but to me it was a very enjoyable film, one of the better sequels, and much better than given credit for, which is not going to be a popular opinion) had an underdeveloped and forced romantic subplot and too much filler that could have been trimmed in some places. They all have great merits, namely great visuals, exciting action, Hans Zimmer's music, Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Bill Nighy.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge' has its defenders but has also been met with underwhelmed disappointment by critics and most fans. Personally am on the fence with 'Salazar's Revenge' and consider it one of the weaker entries generally of the series, with only 'At World's End' being weaker. It is a decent and fun enough ride, but it could have been so much more and has some glaring flaws.It is easy to say forget the story, however this is a strong case of being very hard to do so when there is so little to it. It takes a while to get going and there are some real pacing problems in the final act, which has its good points but generally is very tedious. It is very thin for the running time and feels overstretched and bloated, giving the impression the film is too long. The script has some droll and witty quips every now and again, but mostly it is very weak with far too much of a rambling, improvisatory and random feel, it just doesn't feel that well structured. There is also a very bizarre exchange with Depp and Paul McCartney (whose presence is rather jarring).Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are vastly inferior to Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, they lack presence and come over as bland and dare one say deadweight. The music score is rousing enough and creates some nostalgia, but can be overly bombastic and is too much of a retread from the music of the previous films. There is an overload of CGI effects, which standard-wise are mostly splendid though with some artificial ones too.With all this being said, there are obvious merits here. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful and full of beauty and atmosphere, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and sumptuous and the effects are superb. As aforementioned the special effects are splendid quality-wise.'Salazar's Revenge's' action is a lot of fun too, being coherent and exciting, especially the very scary one with the undead shark and the ending, which also does a good job clearing up loose ends. There are some great and suitably light-hearted comedy set pieces, like Jack being dragged by a building and clinging onto the guillotine.Jack not being the central focus but still being essential to the plot proved to be a good move. 'Salazar's Revenge' succeeds in bringing a sense of nostalgia. Loved Barbossa's story arc, inarguably the film's most interesting which allows Geoffrey Rush to really sink his teeth and give a fun and moving performance. His revelation and his farewell was heart-breaking in its emotion.Contrary to what some have said, apart from the newcomers to the franchise Thwaites and Scodelario as well as McCartney, the acting was fine. Although Johnny Depp's performance has been criticised, to me he still has the enthusiasm, sense of fun and swagger. Geoffrey Rush does a great job as always, while an unrecognisable Javier Bardem (very impressively made-up) is simply brilliant and clearly having a whale of a time as perhaps the franchise's most sinister villain (if not the best, that title still belongs to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones).Summing up, decent and fun enough ride that could have been so much more. 6/10 Bethany Cox",decent fun enough ride could have been so much more however,best film pirates caribbean franchise will always be first which is still terrific film fourteen years later has it really been that long feels like only yesterday when first seeing it when it first came out its sequels are not same level while they are long way flawless none them are awful films either they have their flaws dead mans chest did get too frenetic sometimes at worlds end was overlong bloated needlessly bloated stranger tides which has been dumped upon by many here but me it was very enjoyable film one better sequels much better than given credit which is not going be popular opinion had underdeveloped forced romantic subplot too much filler that could have been trimmed some places they all have great merits namely great visuals exciting action hans zimmers music johnny depp geoffrey rush bill nighy pirates caribbean salazars revenge has its defenders but has also been met with underwhelmed disappointment by critics most fans personally am fence with salazars revenge consider it one weaker entries generally series with only at worlds end being weaker it is decent fun enough ride but it could have been so much more has some glaring flaws it is easy say forget story however this is strong case being very hard do so when there is so little it it takes while get going there are some real pacing problems final act which has its good points but generally is very tedious it is very thin running time feels overstretched bloated giving impression film is too long script has some droll witty quips every now again but mostly it is very weak with far too much rambling improvisatory random feel it just doesnt feel that well structured there is also very bizarre exchange with depp paul mccartney whose presence is rather jarring brenton thwaites kaya scodelario are vastly inferior orlando bloom keira knightley they lack presence come over as bland dare one say deadweight music score is rousing enough creates some nostalgia but can be overly bombastic is too much retread music previous films there is overload cgi effects which standard wise are mostly splendid though with some artificial ones too with all this being said there are obvious merits here once again production values are impeccable cinematography is skillful full beauty atmosphere costumes sets period recreation is authentic sumptuous effects are superb as aforementioned special effects are splendid quality wise salazars revenges action is lot fun too being coherent exciting especially very scary one with undead shark ending which also does good job clearing up loose ends there are some great suitably light hearted comedy set pieces like jack being dragged by building clinging onto guillotine jack not being central focus but still being essential plot proved be good move salazars revenge succeeds bringing sense nostalgia loved barbossas story arc inarguably films most interesting which allows geoffrey rush really sink his teeth give fun moving performance his revelation his farewell was heart breaking its emotion contrary what some have said apart newcomers franchise thwaites scodelario as well as mccartney acting was fine although johnny depps performance has been criticised me he still has enthusiasm sense fun swagger geoffrey rush does great job as always while unrecognisable javier bardem very impressively made up is simply brilliant clearly having whale time as perhaps franchises most sinister villain if not best that title still belongs bill nighys davy jones summing up decent fun enough ride that could have been so much more 6 10 bethany cox,0.5640785472389246,0.21927094132282818,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"

5.0,Back to the Caribbean maybe a time too many.,"To some, to know him is to love him. But has that swash-buckling, dared doer Jack Sparrow dropped anchor in the Caribbean a time too many? Has the lucrative franchise lost some of the original luster? The rousing adventure continues as Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) seems to find himself against the odds, yet again, as an old nemesis Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his gathering of minion ghost pirates threaten a rampage of killing every living pirate on the seas. The drunken, yet witty, Captain Jack must put winds behind him to search for the Trident of Poseidon, a mythical artifact that gives its possessor unquestionable control over the seas.Plenty of action and great visuals. It remains to be seen, but scuttlebutt has it that this may just be the last time Jack Sparrow will get his boots wet.

6.0,The Two Hour Continuity Error,"The Pirates franchise has been a bit of a doozy since it's shocking box office success way back in 2003. Curse of the Black Pearl was never meant to house a sequel, as it was an open-and-shut swashbuckler flick that was heavy on energy, action, humor, and blockbuster soul. It garnished tons of Oscar nominations (and money), upped Johnny Depp's persona several notches, and helped give Disney the box office crown in 2003. 14 years later we see the fifth installment, with the second consecutive attempt at creating a new Will/Elizabeth love story, the second consecutive attempt to replace the underrated director of the original trilogy Gore Verbinski, and once again taking the crown as arguably the most expensive film shoot in cinematic history.Production hell doesn't begin to describe the attempts to create the fifth movie, even though On Stranger Tides was met with very poor reviews. Johnny Depp refused the original idea, which would have featured a female villain for the first time. Johnny Depp was going through a nasty divorce and got injured, delaying the shoot even longer. Disney and Bruckheimer were arguing about costs, and the script itself (which is a disaster we can describe later) was undergoing changes and multiple hands. And I'll still never understand how the writer of Rush Hour 3, Speed 2, and Tower Heist managed to get his hands on such a big film. Oh Hollywood The only company willing to cling on to a sinking ship of a film is Disney, simply because their patience constantly gets rewarded, and it's impossible to discontinue a franchise that has earned them a nasty 3.8 billion within only four films. So after epic struggling for many years, we finally see Dead Men Tell No Tales gracing the screen.Not going to lie, this film is an entertaining mess, and part of the wave of recent sequels/prequels that went through similar production issues which affected the final product. Alien: Covenant went through tons of trouble, and then we see Fate of the Furious have to find a way to edit out the obvious tension between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel. But the Pirates franchise is more than just a cluster of movies, its part of the Disney fandom culture, it has a life of its own through video games, books, and mysteries and intrigue surrounding it all. So copying, abandoning and contradicting plot elements of the original trilogy gives this movie a layer of frustration we didn't need, and we definitely don't deserve after such a long wait. Even after the entertaining first half, it all gets damaged by the unmet potential and by the awkward familiarity of the plot. And this comes from the Disney Company, a film studio notorious for being vigorously detailed with all of its IPs, from Marvel to (especially) Star Wars.Another curse that doesn't allow the cursed to touch land? Sounds familiar. Woman who doesn't believe in the oceanic supernatural mumbo-jumbo? Sounds familiar. A person who denounces pirates suddenly becomes one? Also sounds familiar. British navy trying to conquer the seas from the pirates? Heh, okay. The entire plot line felt very similar to Curse of the Black Pearl, yet this installment felt like it was tapping the brakes far too much. This watered down and clownish Jack Sparrow didn't perform any swordplay once, he didn't trick anyone a single time, I don't think he even delivered any clever quips of any kind. The villain didn't have a final showdown against Jack, as we witness a CGI-laden chase as our climax, a far cry from the dizzying mayhem during the big showdown in Dead Man's Chest. Worst of all, we didn't get the dramatic showdown between the enemy ships and the Flying Dutchman, the ship that you know, controls the damn seas, and has a captain that's related to someone that is in danger throughout the film! The potential was there, and wasn't met. From script to direction to storytelling decisions, Dead Men Tells No Tales has us wishing for the original writing team and the original director to somehow bring this franchise back to decent waters. This film only further enhances At World's End and Dead Man's Chest—two films that were met with ho-hum reviews but have honestly aged well and remain better than most of your modern-day blockbusters. The script here opens the door for many intriguing scenes, and they didn't deliver. We could have explored Jack Sparrow's aging and increasing alcoholism, Barbossa's past, the Flying Dutchman/Salazar curse connection, the fallout of the elongated separation of Will and Elizabeth, and the series-shifting scene of breaking every curse. And after seeing this, I don't have much hope in the eventual sixth installment touching these story lines either.The Pirates of the Caribbean series now looks like its more interested in the international box office receipts and just keeping people entertained above keeping the flavor of the franchise and keeping a continuity between each chapter. On Stranger Tides, despite the mediocrity, had interesting unresolved story lines that were completely neglected here. The original trilogy's details don't match up with the backstory of Jack Sparrow in Dead Men Tell No Tales.You will see some high-budget fun, comical mayhem, a good performance by Javier Bardiem, but it all gets evaporated when we reach the series-changing yet series-contradicting final act. The franchise is far from being dead, but boy it might be time to let this ship disappear out into the horizons unless we get a superior cast writing and filming it.

7.0,"""Are all pirates this stupid?""","By this time in the series, it's the special effects that have the most resonance for this viewer, as the story is largely a retread of prior action on the high seas. My summary line by the way, is not a comment about the picture but was actually spoken by one of the principals, though I've already forgotten who it was. It didn't seem to me like Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) did any of the heavy lifting in this movie, the focus seemed to be on his nemesis Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and his love interest Carina Smith (Kaya Scodelario). There were a few interesting concepts in the story, I liked for example the idea of robbing the bank actually involved robbing the entire bank. And 'the map no man can read' was a clever way to utilize the character of Carina Smyth, later revealed to be the long lost daughter of Barbossa. Watching the 'Pirates' series out of sequence, I don't now how much I might have missed in the way of continuity, but seeing Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley reprise their former characters for a heartfelt finale was also noteworthy. But in the end the story for me was largely forgettable, as it had to do with a lot of back and forth maneuvering between Barbossa's crew, the villain Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), and the British naval crew led by Commander Scarfield (David Wenham).

8.0,Jack Sparrow Returns!,"Finally a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I felt quite at par with the original one. I felt in this movie, the elements of entertainment were quite abundant. Unlike in the 4th installment, I think this one is funnier, more thrilling and gave the sense of happiness at the end. This time,, the movie was not solely telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Instead the other characters, especially Henry and Carina were given quite a lot screen time. It was nice to see Jack Sparrow's charm and wit plus his insistence of helping other people.This movie provided some background story of Jack while he was young, which was very interesting to see. The movie was filled with lots of fun and laughter but also few brief touching moments. The story was good and there were some surprises too. As a high budget movie, the movie was filled with very good special effects (some done by the Industrial Light Magic). I totally loved the effects of the deads (Salazar's crews), his ship and of course the very cool special effects at the end.I also felt that the movie did not have any dull moment. From beginning till the end, there were always something interesting to see. My wife and I were entertained throughout the whole movie which was having a duration of a little over 2 hours. Amazingly, due to the sense of excitement, my wife was able to hold going to the bathroom till finished. I guess she forgotten about it while watching.Actually, even though I looked forward to see this movie, I was a bit skeptical at first about whether this one would be good enough. I felt that the 4th one was a little bit dull, and also a bit forced. The story for that one did not feel strong enough and certainly did not give a lot of impression. But this one really felt it was worthy of giving another sequel after this. Especially if you wait till the very end, after the end-credit scene, where we were given something interesting to ponder. Might be the potential story for the sequel? Perhaps if this one is successful enough.I believe this one really worth to see. I am happy to see Johnny Depp in this movie which I hope would be a commercial success for him. Since his past few movies were unfortunately not really successful ones. Maybe people grew tired of his acting as unusual characters. So if you are looking for something fun, light, interesting movie with funny charming pirate and treasure hunt story, you should definitely watch this one. I am confident you would be entertained like my wife and I were.For my complete review, pls have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",jack sparrow returns,finally pirates caribbean movie that i felt quite at par with original one i felt this movie elements entertainment were quite abundant unlike 4th installment i think this one is funnier more thrilling gave sense happiness at end this time movie was not solely telling story jack sparrow instead other characters especially henry carina were given quite lot screen time it was nice see jack sparrows charm wit plus his insistence helping other people this movie provided some background story jack while he was young which was very interesting see movie was filled with lots fun laughter but also few brief touching moments story was good there were some surprises too as high budget movie movie was filled with very good special effects some done by industrial light magic i totally loved effects deads salazars crews his ship course very cool special effects at end i also felt that movie did not have any dull moment beginning till end there were always something interesting see my wife i were entertained throughout whole movie which was having duration little over 2 hours amazingly due sense excitement my wife was able hold going bathroom till finished i guess she forgotten about it while watching actually even though i looked forward see this movie i was bit skeptical at first about whether this one would be good enough i felt that 4th one was little bit dull also bit forced story that one did not feel strong enough certainly did not give lot impression but this one really felt it was worthy giving another sequel after this especially if you wait till very end after end credit scene where we were given something interesting ponder might be potential story sequel perhaps if this one is successful enough i believe this one really worth see i am happy see johnny depp this movie which i hope would be commercial success him since his past few movies were unfortunately not really successful ones maybe people grew tired his acting as unusual characters so if you are looking something fun light interesting movie with funny charming pirate treasure hunt story you should definitely watch this one i am confident you would be entertained like my wife i were my complete review pls have look michaelnontonmulu blogspot co id,0.5737517006802724,0.22124149659863945,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"

They told bizarre stories that had strange characters, all of which had something to offer to the film. The adventures were full of surprises, making them worth at least checking out, and Jack Sparrow was a character that was actually worth waiting for. This film had no personality. No heart. No passion. It was nothing more than a ""bottom of the barrel"" film with cheap sex jokes and physical gags, most of which were served by Jack Sparrow. He was drained of the spirit that he had in the previous films, and wasn't even worth the time he was on screen. Nobody cared, nobody tried, and the full theater was nearly emptied halfway through the film.

5.0,A mediocre film from a dying series of great films.,"Sadly, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was just a mediocre film from a dying series of great films, and this film honestly brings nothing new to the table for this series. In a time full of cinematic universes, and unnecessary reboots, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't do anything special to wow audiences like it originally did almost 15 years ago. The film was full of mediocre acting, writing, visuals, and music, and is a film that will honestly just end up being forgotten like the film that came before it. In the end I decided to give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10.

3.0,It's Just Too Much,"We still remember the pleasant cinematic surprise from Pirates of the Caribbean, which took us on a fun adventure fit for the young at heart. When the sequel came out, we started to grow a little sick of it. By the third, it had overstayed its welcome. By the fourth, crap, I keep forgetting that a fourth one exists! Anyway, now we're on fifth, where a few good qualities, to our amazement, remained consistent these past fourteen years. It still sustains the same atmosphere, like watching a product of the 2000's. Depp has still got it with his iconic performance, Geoffrey Rush still graces the screen, and best of all, Hans Zimmer's famous score sounds fresher than ever.Whew, got the good stuff out of the way. Now let us talk about the atrocities of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.Basically, the main hero has to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do to harness its power to control life and death. Oops, wrong movie. Well, just replace the ark with the trident of Poseidon, and the Nazis with a pirate ghost army, and the plot stays pretty much the same. Yeah, the youth of the previous decade were into ancient mythology, but now they moved on to obsessing over the future. Why not let a dated concept sit to collect shelf dust?The whole Indiana Jones rip-off of a plot may intrigue the parents after overcoming the opening prologue: A boy goes out rowing, ties his ankle to a rope, then tosses into the ocean a pile of rocks tied to the other end of the rope. It looks less like Will Turner's son going down to see him in the Flying Dutchman and more like Suicide 101. This honestly could have all landed on the cutting room floor; everything is retold anyway.The teens may feel rather dissatisfied too. No pretty imagery parades through to please their senses, particularly by the dull darkly lit stage combat. That also goes for the ""fun"" action scenes shot in broad daylight, such as the first one, where a bunch of horses pull a house through the village streets. Then later, zombie sharks attack for three minutes' tops, a CGI-infested made-for-3D visual which looks like patty cake compared to what Zack Snyder can orchestrate.As for the kids, keep them far away. After all, the rating says PG-13. Inappropriate content gladly makes its way in for nothing besides a few cheap laughs, from the sexual (gawking at a woman's bare ankles) to the tasteless (offending every Spaniard in the world). However, the children are most likely to be traumatized by some of the imagery, including a basket of severed heads at the foot of a guillotine.Although the greater portion of audiences will groan over the production's excessive desperation to curse you with a giggle fit. At the screening I went to, the audience laughed plenty throughout, even I chuckled a few times. Yet the dialogue still lacks any point as the cast goes tirelessly in search for a punchline. For instance, one of the many pointless moments puts Jack Sparrow inside a whale skeleton to wed a boogery ogress of a woman.These tiresome jokes are blaring enough to make you believe the plot doesn't even exist, or that the jokes came from the mouths of human beings with fears and opinions. The characters keep contradicting their own desires; especially Jack Sparrow's Black Pearl crew, who right at the beginning abandons him for no reason, then later comes back for him for no reason. A predictable romantic subplot further bombards the key plot, as played between two actors with no chemistry; the female half of the equation, played by the unenthusiastic Kaya Scodelario (The Maze Runner) makes it worse by relying on the eyes on her chest other than the eyes on her face to stir up emotions. You could potentially forgive the writers for their lack of care in developing believable relationships, until the ending closes every story arc with pure hogwash.Oh, believe me, it gets worse. This motion picture also brings up the fact that Galileo Galilei actually built his telescope to search for the trident of Poseidon, as a map to its location is found within the stars. Apparently, all these historians overlooked that important detail. Well, considering this alternate reality features a ghost army who pass through matter yet still kill people with their swords, that historical ""fact"" is the closest to believable Dead Men Tell No Tales gets.Okay, enough already. Did we seriously forget that Pirates of the Caribbean was once only a freaking animatronic show breathed on by Walt himself?",its just too much,we still remember pleasant cinematic surprise pirates caribbean which took us fun adventure fit young at heart when sequel came out we started grow little sick it by third it had overstayed its welcome by fourth crap i keep forgetting that fourth one exists anyway now were fifth where few good qualities our amazement remained consistent these past fourteen years it still sustains same atmosphere like watching product 2000s depp has still got it with his iconic performance geoffrey rush still graces screen best all hans zimmers famous score sounds fresher than ever whew got good stuff out way now let us talk about atrocities pirates caribbean dead men tell no tales basically main hero has find ark covenant before nazis do harness its power control life death oops wrong movie well just replace ark with trident poseidon nazis with pirate ghost army plot stays pretty much same yeah youth previous decade were into ancient mythology but now they moved obsessing over future why not let dated concept sit collect shelf dust whole indiana jones rip off plot may intrigue parents after overcoming opening prologue boy goes out rowing ties his ankle rope then tosses into ocean pile rocks tied other end rope it looks less like will turners son going down see him flying dutchman more like suicide 101 this honestly could have all landed cutting room floor everything is retold anyway teens may feel rather dissatisfied too no pretty imagery parades through please their senses particularly by dull darkly lit stage combat that also goes fun action scenes shot broad daylight such as first one where bunch horses pull house through village streets then later zombie sharks attack three minutes tops cgi infested made 3d visual which looks like patty cake compared what zack snyder can orchestrate as kids keep them far away after all rating says pg 13 inappropriate content gladly makes its way nothing besides few cheap laughs sexual gawking at womans bare ankles tasteless offending every spaniard world however children are most likely be traumatized by some imagery including basket severed heads at foot guillotine although greater portion audiences will groan over productions excessive desperation curse you with giggle fit at screening i went audience laughed plenty throughout even i chuckled few times yet dialogue still lacks any point as cast goes tirelessly search punchline instance one many pointless moments puts jack sparrow inside whale skeleton wed boogery ogress woman these tiresome jokes are blaring enough make you believe plot doesnt even exist or that jokes came mouths human beings with fears opinions characters keep contradicting their own desires especially jack sparrows black pearl crew who right at beginning abandons him no reason then later comes back him no reason predictable romantic subplot further bombards key plot as played between two actors with no chemistry female half equation played by unenthusiastic kaya scodelario maze runner makes it worse by relying eyes her chest other than eyes her face stir up emotions you could potentially forgive writers their lack care developing believable relationships until ending closes every story arc with pure hogwash oh believe me it gets worse this motion picture also brings up fact that galileo galilei actually built his telescope search trident poseidon as map its location is found within stars apparently all these historians overlooked that important detail well considering this alternate reality features ghost army who pass through matter yet still kill people with their swords that historical fact is closest believable dead men tell no tales gets okay enough already did we seriously forget that pirates caribbean was once only freaking animatronic show breathed by walt himself,0.4713040357987166,0.07647331982438364,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,a retread of its origins,"Five winters after On Stranger Tides, some of the same key characters (and a few new ones) return for this latest high seas adventure. Callow sailor Henry Turner is on a personal mission to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact thought by many to be a myth. In the course of his journey he crosses paths—and eventually aligns himself with—wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and ambitious astronomer Carina Smyth. The mission is further complicated when they run afoul of Sparrow's 'frenemy' Captain Barbossa, and learn that a gang of undead sailors are coming their way. Follows essentially the same formula as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the characters lack charisma (even Depp seems curiously subdued), the story is never really engaging, and all the rip-roaring action scenes and special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far. Bardem effectively sneers and snarls as Captain Salazar, but he's one of the few highlights in an otherwise forgettable entry. **",retread its origins,five winters after stranger tides some same key characters few new ones return this latest high seas adventure callow sailor henry turner is personal mission retrieve trident poseidon powerful artifact thought by many be myth course his journey he crosses paths eventually aligns himself with wanted pirate captain jack sparrow ambitious astronomer carina smyth mission is further complicated when they run afoul sparrows frenemy captain barbossa learn that gang undead sailors are coming their way follows essentially same formula as curse black pearl but characters lack charisma even depp seems curiously subdued story is never really engaging all rip roaring action scenes special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far bardem effectively sneers snarls as captain salazar but hes one few highlights otherwise forgettable entry,0.6041378066378066,0.026534992784992783,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.52}"
1.0,Oh My God I Am So Effing Disappointed I Cannot Believe What I Have Just Seen,"(Gonna try not to cuss) I will start by saying I was/am fanatical about all three of the first ones. Yes the original is still the best, but the second is almost every damn bit as good. The plot was creative enough that it felt necessary, the writing was on par with the first, and Davy Jones is SO freaking good oh my god he is literally my favorite villain of all time (save for Agent Smith). The third one has its flaws (though I really can't think of any besides Keira Knightley's acting being occasionally over the top), but as a whole it's a WONDERFUL movie. Like sweet Jesus, Hans Zimmer's freaking score for that movie alone is goddamn legendary. And as a result I totally bought into the romance between Will & Elizabeth and really just felt an emotional connection to the whole series because of it (much like the emotion Howard Shore's music invokes for LotR). But what makes the third one so impressive is how well it handles ALL of that crazy plot while still introducing great new sh*t like the Brethren Court. But I'm not here to talk about how great the original trilogy was. Odds are, most of you liked them too. What I want to talk about briefly before I tear Dead Men Tell No Tales to shreds, is On Stranger Tides. From what I gather, the fourth installment was/is NOT very popular. I like it. And I'll tell you why. While it didn't have the same epic sense of scale and adventure and romance and everything that made the first three so great, IT STILL HAD GOOD WRITING. It was clever, and witty, and funny as ever. And this is because Ted & Terry were still writing them, not FRICKING Jeff Nathanson. OMFG I'll get to him later. I would urge you though to go back and give On Stranger Tides another chance, especially if you've now seen the fifth installment. I think you'll find that even though it doesn't quite hold up against the first three it still FEELS like a Pirates of the Caribbean, and for all the reasons that Dead Men Tell No Tales did not, and here they are:1) Johnny Depp has completely lost it. It's like he forgot how to play Jack Sparrow. There were seriously times watching him when I thought he was more Mad Hatter than he was Jack Sparrow. And it's so sad to watch. The old Jack was an idiot sure, but he was always clever, he was always suave, always cool. In this he's just silly. It's embarrassing. I'm serious when I say he acts like the Mad Hatter, you'll see what I mean. In the fourth one he at least still felt like Jack Sparrow.2) Zimmer's so called ""protege"" Geoff Zanelli is so forgettable. I was actually trying to listen for his music but the only times the music stood out was when he was rehashing Zimmer's themes. And some of you may be like *sissy voice ""oh that's all Zimmer did was rehash Badelt's themes"". BISH PLEASE. Not only did he make Badelt's original theme sound even better, he introduced so many new ones (Jack's theme, Davy Jones' theme, Will & Elizabeth's theme). Even On Stranger Tides added a fun new Spanish twist to the old stuff.3) Salazar, Henry, & Carina are also all completely forgettable. They're worse than Blackbeard (who I actually quite liked), Philip, and Syrena. There is hardly ANY character development for them and what little there was felt SO forced. I feel terrible for them (especially Thwaites and Bardem) because they're not bad actors (Bardem is actually a fantastic actor) but they just got saddled with one of the WORST freaking scripts of all time, which brings me to my final and primary complaint with the fifth installment.4) JEFF NATHANSON IS CANCER. I mean my biggest (only) concerns from the start (because let's be honest the trailer's gave NO hint that the movie would be this bad) were the fact that Zimmer wasn't composing and that JEFF NATHANSON, the idiot who ruined Indiana Jones, was writing it, but I NEVER thought he could have F'd up this movie, not as badly as he did. Like, the movie had SO much going for it. Salazar could have been another great villain to put alongside Jones and Barbossa, but he was totally wasted with minimal and poor dialogue. Carina Smith, a female astronomer, could have been a GREAT female character! And her romance with Henry could have been done BEAUTIFULLY! Instead, what did we get? Well, I won't spoil it for you but I will say there is one of the most forced, predictable, and painstakingly banal twists I've ever seen in a movie regarding her character.So, as I said, I absolutely LOVED the first three, and I really did like the fourth one. Enough that I was very excited about what they could do with the next one (the fifth one). All my friends said the franchise was dead but I maintained that the fifth installment had the potential to be amazing (which it did). And I waited SIX GODDAMNED YEARS for this fifth one. And it, was just, god, awful. So bad that I actually now don't want to see another installment, and I will honestly probably never watch it again because it's so bad that it almost taints my love for the first four.I tried to think of reasons to give it more than the lowest possible rating, any reason. And ALL I could think of was the visual quality that the two Norwegian directors brought to it, so good for them, I give the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean a whopping two stars. Thank you.

3.0,A Jar of Dirt,"Remember when Johnny Depp exploded onto the big screen as Jack Sparo- Sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow, and it was awesome? Ah the good old days, what I would give to go back to that time where Pirates were cool and Salazar's Revenge didn't exist. The fifth instalment to the Pirates franchise displays a complete evolution of genre complying with Louis Giannetti's theory. The Cure of the Black Pearl marked the Primitive genre stage, the film blew audiences away and introduced them to the pirates genre. Dead Man's Chest marked the classical stage, classical conventions were utilised such as the Kraken and what have you. Next is the Revisionist stage of At World's End with it's time travel, witches that grow into giants and that sinkhole final act, let's just ignore the pointless fourth film aaaaaaaaaand now, unfortunately, we have the all out parody that is Salazar's revenge.Pirates 5 is quite simply a parody of itself, from its stupidly absurd, comedic action sequences, to Johnny Depp himself. This film feels like one big joke and I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew this to be true. The way Jack is introduced in this film is quite possibly one of the goofiest sequences I've ever seen in the cinema. I've seen bank robberies go wrong before, but stealing the bank itself... All I can say is, what are those horses taking and where can I get me some? BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! The guillotine scene is just so horrifically bad I physically had to lift my jaw up off the floor in a mix of amazement and bafflement. The Pirates franchise is no stranger to big, illogical, comical action scenes, but this film takes that to a whole different level of stupidity and is almost like a scene out of Epic Movie.As well as the action scenes being all out parodies of ones which preceded them, the acting is as much, if not more so. Johnny Depp drunkenly stumbles out of the children's hospital to play Jack Sparrow once again... Or at least I think he was acting... I'm not quite sure to be honest. Sparrow has always been an alcoholic character, but that was once his lovable charm, now Depp slurs his speech and acts so confused to the point where it's hard to believe he hadn't had ""a single drop of rum."" This being said he gives the best performance in this film which is shocking to be honest. Geoffrey Rush, similar to Depp, plays a parody of his character Captain Barbossa, but to be honest, Barbossa was always a kind of parody of pirates so I can let that slide. However, what I cannot excuse is the abysmal performance by the films two newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. Not helped by their rather forced relationship, the two provide a masterclass in wooden acting that makes it near impossible to care for their characters.However bad the acting is, it is not the worst part of this film, oh no. That would be the films script and visuals. Firstly, the script. Pirates 5 is plagued with terrible dialogue. Lines are recycled over and over, exposition is embedded with little effort and subtlety and the sex jokes, lots and lots of cringe worthy, unfunny sex jokes. Sex jokes are practically the back bone of comedy nowadays and can be hilarious, but here the jokes just come off as dirty, like a bunch of dirty old men in a bar recounting ""the things I'd do to her."" Simply put, it's extremely uncomfortable to watch and hear. The film also features a few pointless characters. From the bald witch lady who is simply there to give Barbossa Jack's compass, to Paul McCartney's Cameo role as Uncle Jack. The film just doesn't need them and they either act as a plot device or a waste of everyone's time.Now the visuals, the film was poorly shot. The lighting at night was non existent and the way the camera is positioned for some shots was possibly the single worst place they could have placed the camera, hidden behind objects so the action of focus is distorted/ out of view. Also you can clearly tell where the film is missing a vital shot or just couldn't be bothered to shoot it, as the use of fast cutting and cut away shots are used in an attempt to cover this up, but instead only highlights it and thus confuses the audience. SPOILER WARNING! When Henry is kidnapped by Salazar there is no shot of him being pulled away or anything. A series of fast cuts, Carina's reaction shot to a non existent shot and expositional dialogue of ""THEY TOOK HENRY!"" is used to present his capture, and frankly it just seems like they spent too much money on Salazar's gravity defying hairdo, that their visual effects budget was bone dry. This happens a fair bit in Pirates 5 and it simply leaves you as confused as Depp appears to be throughout.To conclude, Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is by far the worst in the Pirates franchise. A full on parody of what it once was with horrific acting, poorly shot sequences and a script that needs some work done to say the least. I know I've been insanely harsh so, on the off chance that the filmmakers see this, I would like to say the famous line ""it's nothing personal, it's just business"" whether or not you agree or disagree with me, none of us can deny that the theme tune is absolutely epic and pumps us up every time.",jar dirt,remember when johnny depp exploded onto big screen as jack sparo sorry captain jack sparrow it was awesome ah good old days what i would give go back that time where pirates were cool salazars revenge didnt exist fifth instalment pirates franchise displays complete evolution genre complying with louis giannettis theory cure black pearl marked primitive genre stage film blew audiences away introduced them pirates genre dead mans chest marked classical stage classical conventions were utilised such as kraken what have you next is revisionist stage at worlds end with its time travel witches that grow into giants that sinkhole final act lets just ignore pointless fourth film aaaaaaaaaand now unfortunately we have all out parody that is salazars revenge pirates 5 is quite simply parody itself its stupidly absurd comedic action sequences johnny depp himself this film feels like one big joke i can pinpoint exact moment i knew this be true way jack is introduced this film is quite possibly one goofiest sequences ive ever seen cinema ive seen bank robberies go wrong before but stealing bank itself all i can say is what are those horses taking where can i get me some but wait theres more guillotine scene is just so horrifically bad i physically had lift my jaw up off floor mix amazement bafflement pirates franchise is no stranger big illogical comical action scenes but this film takes that whole different level stupidity is almost like scene out epic movie as well as action scenes being all out parodies ones which preceded them acting is as much if not more so johnny depp drunkenly stumbles out childrens hospital play jack sparrow once again or at least i think he was acting im not quite sure be honest sparrow has always been alcoholic character but that was once his lovable charm now depp slurs his speech acts so confused point where its hard believe he hadnt had single drop rum this being said he gives best performance this film which is shocking be honest geoffrey rush similar depp plays parody his character captain barbossa but be honest barbossa was always kind parody pirates so i can let that slide however what i cannot excuse is abysmal performance by films two newcomers brenton thwaites kaya scodelario not helped by their rather forced relationship two provide masterclass wooden acting that makes it near impossible care their characters however bad acting is it is not worst part this film oh no that would be films script visuals firstly script pirates 5 is plagued with terrible dialogue lines are recycled over over exposition is embedded with little effort subtlety sex jokes lots lots cringe worthy unfunny sex jokes sex jokes are practically back bone comedy nowadays can be hilarious but here jokes just come off as dirty like bunch dirty old men bar recounting things id do her simply put its extremely uncomfortable watch hear film also features few pointless characters bald witch lady who is simply there give barbossa jacks compass paul mccartneys cameo role as uncle jack film just doesnt need them they either act as plot device or waste everyones time now visuals film was poorly shot lighting at night was non existent way camera is positioned some shots was possibly single worst place they could have placed camera hidden behind objects so action focus is distorted out view also you can clearly tell where film is missing vital shot or just couldnt be bothered shoot it as use fast cutting cut away shots are used attempt cover this up but instead only highlights it thus confuses audience spoiler warning when henry is kidnapped by salazar there is no shot him being pulled away or anything series fast cuts carinas reaction shot non existent shot expositional dialogue they took henry is used present his capture frankly it just seems like they spent too much money salazars gravity defying hairdo that their visual effects budget was bone dry this happens fair bit pirates 5 it simply leaves you as confused as depp appears be throughout conclude pirates caribbean salazars revenge is by far worst pirates franchise full parody what it once was with horrific acting poorly shot sequences script that needs some work done say least i know ive been insanely harsh so off chance that filmmakers see this i would like say famous line its nothing personal its just business whether or not you agree or disagree with me none us can deny that theme tune is absolutely epic pumps us up every time,0.495993117010816,-0.03854298356510744,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,Seriously... Another One?,"After the dreadful predecessor that was 'On Stranger Tides', I entered the cinema with rather poor expectations... how I left with even lower enjoyment is beyond me.Perhaps it's the fact that a theme park ride can't sustain a story for an entire film franchise? Maybe it's the fact that I've seen this story before in four other films? Perhaps the lack of character development and me not giving a damn about any of the new characters? Or maybe it's just because it's an orgy of CGI madness? Who knows? Either way, this film is a complete over-the-top mess. Watchable? Yes. Enjoyable? Hell no!I admit that 'Dead Man's Chest' and 'At World's End' weren't ""fantastic"" movies, but they rounded off a rather enjoyable trilogy, especially following the ultimately brilliant first film. But the two sequels' success should not have been an excuse for a fourth and now a fifth film, with each film the reception lowers and the standards and eagerness for the next further lowers. However, Disney as the opportunistic blighters they are, take their box office success with stride and look to creating the next underwhelming, money-making sequel. This time it's in the form of 'Dead Men Tell No Tales'.The overuse of jokes we've heard on several previous occasions, the fact that the beloved Jack Sparrow is now becoming a character we look at in contempt because he's worn out, much like the franchise. Scraping the bottom of the barrel, milking upon its previous success... both terms that can be applied suitably to this movie (if that's what I can call it). And do you know what the worst part is? This film will make its money back, it'll double, triple, quadruple its budget in box office returns, thus giving the producers a reason to create yet-another dull sequel.All-in-all, I actually think I had an aneurysm whilst watching this film...",seriously another one,after dreadful predecessor that was stranger tides i entered cinema with rather poor expectations how i left with even lower enjoyment is beyond me perhaps its fact that theme park ride cant sustain story entire film franchise maybe its fact that ive seen this story before four other films perhaps lack character development me not giving damn about any new characters or maybe its just because its orgy cgi madness who knows either way this film is complete over top mess watchable yes enjoyable hell no i admit that dead mans chest at worlds end werent fantastic movies but they rounded off rather enjoyable trilogy especially following ultimately brilliant first film but two sequels success should not have been excuse fourth now fifth film with each film reception lowers standards eagerness next further lowers however disney as opportunistic blighters they are take their box office success with stride look creating next underwhelming money making sequel this time its form dead men tell no tales overuse jokes weve heard several previous occasions fact that beloved jack sparrow is now becoming character we look at contempt because hes worn out much like franchise scraping bottom barrel milking upon its previous success both terms that can be applied suitably this movie if thats what i can call it do you know what worst part is this film will make its money back itll double triple quadruple its budget box office returns thus giving producers reason create yet another dull sequel all all i actually think i had aneurysm whilst watching this film,0.38191786283891543,0.052053429027113234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Good Tales Be Told By Dead Men,"After the ordeal of On Stranger Tides comes a sequel that sets sails in a truly amazing and beautiful fashion.First off the film is a great send up compared to the weakest link in the series, On Stranger Tides. The cast, effects, and story line are great. The film as a whole is amazing. Once again we get Johnny Depp as the ever funny and intoxicated Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is hilariously outrageous. He is very good and funny within the film. Unlike his performance in Stranger Tides his acting a characterization of the titular captain seems to have great passion and not the feeling of a called in performance. Again my personal favorite character returns to the 5th film is Geoffrey Rush as the amazingly interesting Captain Hector Barbossa. Within the Hector still rides high as the captain at the helm of the Queen Ann's Revenge. When we meet up with him in the film he has become very wealthy and rich from trade and knocking off ships. He then joins a false alliance with the films hardcore villain, Captain Salazar. Rush's performance as the titular captain is great and very touching. A sad note for many including me is that this is barbossa's last appearance in the series. He dies towards the end of the film, in a very courageous and brave manor, trying to save his long lost daughter Carina Smith, played by Kaya Scodelario.Next We get are new villain, Captain Salazar, played by Javier Bardem. Bardem's performance as the tortured Captain Salazar is one for the ages. His performance is gut renchingly creepy and at the same time sympathetic in a dark sort of way. His story goes like this, he was a might Spanish general who hunted and killed thousands of pirates across the sea. During one of his showdowns he was confronted by a very young (Thanks to great CGI) Jack Sparrow. He is then tricked by Jack and his ship is sent into the Devil's Triangle where he and his crew are cursed to stay forever, or at least until Jack screws up and let's them free.Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan return for a very brief time span in this entry but their presence is very well known. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom return as their titular characters from the previous installments. Will, now five years after 16 years after he became the captain of the Flying Dutchman is covered in barnacles and coral, still not as bad as old fish face, Davy Jones. Keira Knightley shows up towards the climax of the movie where here and will can finally reunite again after the trident of Poseidon is broken and all of the curses in the see are destroyed. Though they are in the film for a very brief time frame their presence is quite uplifting and good, a true treat would be to see them have bigger roles in up incoming installments. Are new characters are Brenton Thwaites and of course Kaya Scodelario as the two young leads of the film. Thwaite's plays Henry Turner, the son of Will and Elizabeth, who in the film is sixteen. Within the film, he wants to free his father from the dreaded curse of being bound to the Dutchman. In doing so he needs the trident of Poseidon. Thwaite's plays Henry in a very natural way. He seems in place in the film and does a very good job. Then we have Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smith. Smith is a women of science. She believes in the simple and factual way of life. Later in the film we learn that she is the daughter of Barbossa, who had her at a very young age along time ago. Their relationship, Geoffrey Rush's and Kaya Scodelario's is very sweet and subtle. through the film you can feel Barbossa's pain of knowing who his daughter is and her not knowing who her father is. Scodelario plays Carina superbly and is one the new standout performances. On a minor charter level we have a new British antagonist, General Scarfeild played by the brilliant and underrated Australian actor David Whenham. Though in the film for a short period, Scarfeild is an interesting charter and chews the scenes he is in. Another new charter is the films new voodoo witch played by Golihifteh Farahani. In the film she is the friend of Barbossa and give him valuable information. She is creepy and interesting as her character. From a film making stand point, the film looks great. The colors in the film are magnificent, the ships and sea faring parts are extraordinary, and the special effects are freaking amazing, Salazar and his crew are beautiful in a creepy dead rotted pirate way. The two new directors did a very good job, way better then Rob Marshall directing On Stranger Tides. On an overall look, Pirate of the Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an amazing film. The acting is spectacular. The Visuals are splendid and the story is very impressive. I loved the film, my one complaint would be that Barbossa Dies. He was my favorite character in the series. Well, anyways, the film was a great fun-filled ride and i personally can't wait until the next one. Rest in Peace Captain Barbossa, until we meet again!Two-Peg legs up!",good tales be told by dead men,after ordeal stranger tides comes sequel that sets sails truly amazing beautiful fashion first off film is great send up compared weakest link series stranger tides cast effects story line are great film as whole is amazing once again we get johnny depp as ever funny intoxicated captain jack sparrow his performance is hilariously outrageous he is very good funny within film unlike his performance stranger tides his acting characterization titular captain seems have great passion not feeling called performance again my personal favorite character returns 5th film is geoffrey rush as amazingly interesting captain hector barbossa within hector still rides high as captain at helm queen anns revenge when we meet up with him film he has become very wealthy rich trade knocking off ships he then joins false alliance with films hardcore villain captain salazar rushs performance as titular captain is great very touching sad note many including me is that this is barbossas last appearance series he dies towards end film very courageous brave manor trying save his long lost daughter carina smith played by kaya scodelario next we get are new villain captain salazar played by javier bardem bardems performance as tortured captain salazar is one ages his performance is gut renchingly creepy at same time sympathetic dark sort way his story goes like this he was might spanish general who hunted killed thousands pirates across sea during one his showdowns he was confronted by very young thanks great cgi jack sparrow he is then tricked by jack his ship is sent into devils triangle where he his crew are cursed stay forever or at least until jack screws up lets them free will turner elizabeth swan return very brief time span this entry but their presence is very well known keira knightly orlando bloom return as their titular characters previous installments will now five years after 16 years after he became captain flying dutchman is covered barnacles coral still not as bad as old fish face davy jones keira knightley shows up towards climax movie where here will can finally reunite again after trident poseidon is broken all curses see are destroyed though they are film very brief time frame their presence is quite uplifting good true treat would be see them have bigger roles up incoming installments are new characters are brenton thwaites course kaya scodelario as two young leads film thwaites plays henry turner son will elizabeth who film is sixteen within film he wants free his father dreaded curse being bound dutchman doing so he needs trident poseidon thwaites plays henry very natural way he seems place film does very good job then we have kaya scodelario as carina smith smith is women science she believes simple factual way life later film we learn that she is daughter barbossa who had her at very young age along time ago their relationship geoffrey rushs kaya scodelarios is very sweet subtle through film you can feel barbossas pain knowing who his daughter is her not knowing who her father is scodelario plays carina superbly is one new standout performances minor charter level we have new british antagonist general scarfeild played by brilliant underrated australian actor david whenham though film short period scarfeild is interesting charter chews scenes he is another new charter is films new voodoo witch played by golihifteh farahani film she is friend barbossa give him valuable information she is creepy interesting as her character film making stand point film looks great colors film are magnificent ships sea faring parts are extraordinary special effects are freaking amazing salazar his crew are beautiful creepy dead rotted pirate way two new directors did very good job way better then rob marshall directing stranger tides overall look pirate caribbean 5 dead men tell no tales is amazing film acting is spectacular visuals are splendid story is very impressive i loved film my one complaint would be that barbossa dies he was my favorite character series well anyways film was great fun filled ride i personally cant wait until next one rest peace captain barbossa until we meet again two peg legs up,0.5552329322054091,0.2434711465904127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"

8.0,Have fun with the pirates and Johny Depp is still the soul,"Dear readers, Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that I have been watching since my high school. Now I am already in the working life, but the spirit of that movie series is still on my heart, so that yesterday I watched it. Since last year, I know that there will be a continuity of that movie, but I never knew that the movie is about Revenge, well yes, finally about Revenge. Before I am telling to you my review, it is important to remember that each movie of Pirates of Caribbean movie, includes an unique plot within it, for example the last adventure is about Family, and then the others are about Love, Friendship, Father-Son relation, and Captain-Crew honesty. In this latest movie of Pirates of the Caribbean, it is about Revenge, but do not hesitate to watch it, because the plot is designed not to show up about the Revenge itself, but there are legend, myth, Science, Witch, fantasy, history of Bank, ethical Law of pirates, and of course ridiculous adventure are around the plot, from the beginning to the end. I can guarantee you that you will be laughing of many funny actions or languages, and sometimes you do not care about the end, what you really care is that the safety of the soul of this movie: That is Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, Johny Depp is still the soul of the movie. He is leading all characters and he is the one who is making this adventure happens. Besides of its perfect, this movie has some illogical scenes and some missing plots, so that for those who are not really fan of Pirates of the Caribbean movies, will not really understand who is the real enemy and what pirates stake of life in that kind of level to protect Captain Jack Sparrow. Well, there must be a betrayal, but this movie never betray you to give a lot of have fun!!",have fun with pirates johny depp is still soul,dear readers pirates caribbean is movie that i have been watching since my high school now i am already working life but spirit that movie series is still my heart so that yesterday i watched it since last year i know that there will be continuity that movie but i never knew that movie is about revenge well yes finally about revenge before i am telling you my review it is important remember that each movie pirates caribbean movie includes unique plot within it example last adventure is about family then others are about love friendship father son relation captain crew honesty this latest movie pirates caribbean it is about revenge but do not hesitate watch it because plot is designed not show up about revenge itself but there are legend myth science witch fantasy history bank ethical law pirates course ridiculous adventure are around plot beginning end i can guarantee you that you will be laughing many funny actions or languages sometimes you do not care about end what you really care is that safety soul this movie that is captain jack sparrow yes johny depp is still soul movie he is leading all characters he is one who is making this adventure happens besides its perfect this movie has some illogical scenes some missing plots so that those who are not really fan pirates caribbean movies will not really understand who is real enemy what pirates stake life that kind level protect captain jack sparrow well there must be betrayal but this movie never betray you give lot have fun,0.5487301587301586,0.22626984126984123,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
