10.0,"If you like ransom/police storiesmysteries, and have interest in Kurosawa &/or Mifune, check it out at least once","High and Low, like Yojimbo and Throne of Blood, combines elements to create something special while seeming rather routine- while Yojimbo seems like a bad-ass samurai flick, it has the ingredients of a western and satire, and Throne of Blood is a rather faithful, strange adaptation of Macbeth in the guise of a warlord/samurai tale, High and Low does a similar method. Akira Kurosawa, a filmmaker who gets film buff's ears lit up at the mere mention of him, can usually be counted on to keep a film interesting even if it may not be entertaining to some of the crowd that likes a section of his movies or another (there's usually a split between his samurai/medieval tales and epics, and his dramas about the tragedies of ordinary people). Here he finds a middle ground- the story is taken from a hard-boiled detective novel, the kind you could probably buy for a quarter or fifty cents in the old days- as he tells of two stories interconnected at the hip, both with detail a commercial Hollywood director would brush off. The first is of businessman Gondo (Toshiro Mifune, with his usual bravura presence, but with enough nuanced and quiet moments for two movies), who is about to close a deal to get the shoe company he's worked for for years, when he gets a phone call. There's been a kidnapping- not his son, but his chauffeur's by default. Backed into a corner without options, he gets together 30 million he really can't afford, and gives it to the kidnapper(s). The police, meanwhile, are not about to give up, and start digging for clues with an in-depth investigation that goes to probe every possibility: the chauffeur's son used as a partial witness with drawings; a car; a trolly car; all this leads to nothing and everything, leading to a third act that's as riveting as the first two.Although the acting by everyone involved, cop characters included (Tatsuya Nakadai and Yutaka Sada are surprisingly good, the later even with limited screen time), Kurosawa keeps the film deliberately paced. Another director (more modern perhaps, but maybe not) might cut to the chase quicker, cutting past most of the investigation details, and even the emotional high-points in the first act. But Kurosawa is as interested in the nature and details of what the police do as he is with the compositions, which are constructed and framed as only an artist would do. The film creates a superb juxtaposition as well- Mifune's Gondo is enraged about what will happen with his money, but his morals stand above everything in his business affairs. Meanwhile, the cops here aren't cruel and unforgiving, but professionals trying to crack a case that the audience can hang onto. And then when the ""seedy"" underbelly of the city comes into view, it's looked on with at least some compassion by Kurosawa, and it's not too over-the-top.If all your looking for is thrill after thrill, like in Sanjuro or even Hidden Fortress, look elsewhere- the violence, by the way, is kept to a low level for this one (it'd even be quite suitable for kids, if they don't mind the subtitles and quintessential intensity in the Japanese style of film acting). But for tight, often gripping suspense in the IL' 'whodunit' mystery tale, this is a keeper. Manipulative, perhaps, yet in the hands of a master it's an exemplary deal. And, in the end, it even provides a sad, existential kind of conclusion as good and evil become blurred as the kidnapper looks through glass at the disillusioned Gondo. It's one of the great endings in world cinema.

10.0,Kurosawa at his best and most subtle,"This is one of those rare movies I had to watch twice to catch all the meaning and beauty of its construction, that is how sleek and polished this film is. The storyline is deceptively simple -- a businessman named Gondo is about to take control of the company he's worked in for years when he's told his son's been kidnapped. It turns out the kidnappers got his chauffeur's son by mistake, but they still want him to pay the ransom. If he does, he will be financially ruined. If he doesn't, he will be reviled. Which will he choose? This makes up the first half of the movie, culminating in a breathtaking scene on one of Japan's bullet trains. The second half is the police search for the kidnapper/murderer and how a case is built that will take him to the gallows.Now this sounds like your typical cop thriller, the type Hollywood churns out with one hand tied behind its back, but Kurosawa makes it into a meditation on honor and decency, and on how one's choices can lead one to Heaven or to Hell in little steps that seem to be taking you nowhere. Gondo is an honorable man who worked hard to built himself a life of wealth and power. This is no small feat, considering Japan is not known as a society where one can easily change one's station in life, so this adds to his dilemma; he will not only lose his fortune, he will also lose his hard-gained power and respect in the business community, all for a child that is not even his. And not only will he lose but his own wife and son will, as well. But to NOT pay the ransom means he will lose everything in him that is human and decent, and his wife and son will suffer from that, too.This is a big deal -- not just in Japanese society but in the world as a whole. It doesn't matter if you live in Nepal or Kenya or Argentina or New York City, when faced with the choice of losing your position in your society or losing your soul, which would you choose? And would you still make that choice knowing that even if the cops catch the bad guy, it will make no difference in your own circumstances? Just a glance at some of the recent stock scandals gives you a good idea of where most people fall in their choices. And even Ed McBain, upon whose novel this movie is based, knew how hard it would be to give up your world for your spirit; his businessman refuses to pay the ransom.To me, this movie is Kurosawa at his best and most subtle. Every shot is composed and measured and done just right. Not all films have to have bombs exploding and chase scenes and people going ""Boo!"" to affect you; sometimes just a man riding on a train en route to what he knows will be a catastrophe to him and his world is enough to make you thank the heavens for a story well told.",kurosawa at his best most subtle,this is one those rare movies i had watch twice catch all meaning beauty its construction that is how sleek polished this film is storyline is deceptively simple businessman named gondo is about take control company hes worked years when hes told his sons been kidnapped it turns out kidnappers got his chauffeurs son by mistake but they still want him pay ransom if he does he will be financially ruined if he doesnt he will be reviled which will he choose this makes up first half movie culminating breathtaking scene one japans bullet trains second half is police search kidnapper murderer how case is built that will take him gallows now this sounds like your typical cop thriller type hollywood churns out with one hand tied behind its back but kurosawa makes it into meditation honor decency how ones choices can lead one heaven or hell little steps that seem be taking you nowhere gondo is honorable man who worked hard built himself life wealth power this is no small feat considering japan is not known as society where one can easily change ones station life so this adds his dilemma he will not only lose his fortune he will also lose his hard gained power respect business community all child that is not even his not only will he lose but his own wife son will as well but not pay ransom means he will lose everything him that is human decent his wife son will suffer that too this is big deal not just japanese society but world as whole it doesnt matter if you live nepal or kenya or argentina or new york city when faced with choice losing your position your society or losing your soul which would you choose would you still make that choice knowing that even if cops catch bad guy it will make no difference your own circumstances just glance at some recent stock scandals gives you good idea where most people fall their choices even ed mcbain upon whose novel this movie is based knew how hard it would be give up your world your spirit his businessman refuses pay ransom me this movie is kurosawa at his best most subtle every shot is composed measured done just right not all films have have bombs exploding chase scenes people going boo affect you sometimes just man riding train en route what he knows will be catastrophe him his world is enough make you thank heavens story well told,0.4838933982683983,0.12760687229437231,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,"The film ""Ransom"" could have been.","""High and Low"" is one of those deceptive detective-thrillers that sneak in under your radar and grab you from behind with their storytelling magic. It's proof positive of Kurosawa's mastery of film and all its imagery.The story was adapted from an Ed McBain ""87th Precinct"" novel, ""King's Ransom"", and is really very simple. A successful businessman (Mr. Gondo) in the middle of a major deal is told his son has been kidnapped. All concerns about money fly out the window...until Gondo learns it was actually his chauffeur's son who was taken by mistake. Doesn't matter; the kidnapper still wants him to pay the ransom, even though it will bankrupt him. Will Gondo destroy his standing in the business world to save the life of a child that is not even his? Or will he just leave it to the police and fate to determine whether the child lives or dies? This makes up the first half of the film.The second half deals with the search for the kidnapper and his accomplices, and it does not shy away from showing how dull and grueling good police work is. Step by step, the cops narrow their field of suspects and build their evidence to link their prey to murder as well as the kidnapping, meaning he would face execution. This makes up the second half of the film.It helps to know that in the original story, the businessman refuses to pay the ransom but does help the police track down the kidnappers. It also helps to understand that in Japan, working your way up from making shoes and satchels by hand to being in a position where you could wind up owning the company is a HUGE accomplishment in a caste driven society. It means he is due additional respect, and this is what Gondo faces losing if he pays the ransom, which is far more important than the fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy. From the first scene through an amazingly exciting section on a bullet train to the ending moments between Gondo and the kidnapper, Kurosawa shows exactly why he is a master of cinema. To take what is basically an episode of ""Law and Order"" and make it into a meditation on the meaning of life and evil is not something just any film school twit could do.To me, the best moment on a human level comes when Gondo descends the stairs the morning after the kidnapping to explain to the police why he cannot pay the ransom for a child not even his. You can see the man realizing he is allowing himself go to hell in order to protect his family and station in life, and Toshiro Mifune underplays it beautifully...and Kurosawa lets it just simply happen. Wonderful.THIS is the movie Mel Gibson's ""Ransom"" wishes it had been. something real and human and meaningful instead of merely kick-ass.Ten out of ten stars.",film ransom could have been,high low is one those deceptive detective thrillers that sneak under your radar grab you behind with their storytelling magic its proof positive kurosawas mastery film all its imagery story was adapted ed mcbain 87th precinct novel kings ransom is really very simple successful businessman mr gondo middle major deal is told his son has been kidnapped all concerns about money fly out window until gondo learns it was actually his chauffeurs son who was taken by mistake doesnt matter kidnapper still wants him pay ransom even though it will bankrupt him will gondo destroy his standing business world save life child that is not even his or will he just leave it police fate determine whether child lives or dies this makes up first half film second half deals with search kidnapper his accomplices it does not shy away showing how dull grueling good police work is step by step cops narrow their field suspects build their evidence link their prey murder as well as kidnapping meaning he would face execution this makes up second half film it helps know that original story businessman refuses pay ransom but does help police track down kidnappers it also helps understand that japan working your way up making shoes satchels by hand being position where you could wind up owning company is huge accomplishment caste driven society it means he is due additional respect this is what gondo faces losing if he pays ransom which is far more important than fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy first scene through amazingly exciting section bullet train ending moments between gondo kidnapper kurosawa shows exactly why he is master cinema take what is basically episode law order make it into meditation meaning life evil is not something just any film school twit could do me best moment human level comes when gondo descends stairs morning after kidnapping explain police why he cannot pay ransom child not even his you can see man realizing he is allowing himself go hell order protect his family station life toshiro mifune underplays it beautifully kurosawa lets it just simply happen wonderful this is movie mel gibsons ransom wishes it had been something real human meaningful instead merely kick ass ten out ten stars,0.45539633346451536,0.1466488751147842,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Intense and Highly Entertaining,"""High and Low"" could be considered two movies. The first, ""High"" takes place in Kingo Gondo's (Mifune's) hilltop mansion. The crime occurs and what follows in the next hour is one of the most meticulous and brilliantly constructed film segments I have ever seen! The first half of the film could almost be considered theatre. It is static and deceptively simple but.....so intense! The ensemble acting is superb with Mifune a stand out as usual! Connecting these two movies is the train sequence. After the calculated intensity of the first part this scene comes at you like a sledgehammer! These four or five minutes are magnificent! So very exciting and so very quick it leaves you drained when it ends! ""Low"" begins with the hunt for the criminal. Only ""Stray Dog"" comes closer to capturing the cop's decent into hell. This last part of the film is fast and furious. We are no longer an observer. We have become part of the chase. First, we know who the criminal is. The police do not know and what follows is a fascinating puzzle being put together before our eyes! The last scene in the film is unexpected, deeply disturbing and left me numb and staring at the TV screen after the film had ended. Like Gondo we are left with the answers that we did not want to hear.",intense highly entertaining,high low could be considered two movies first high takes place kingo gondos mifunes hilltop mansion crime occurs what follows next hour is one most meticulous brilliantly constructed film segments i have ever seen first half film could almost be considered theatre it is static deceptively simple but so intense ensemble acting is superb with mifune stand out as usual connecting these two movies is train sequence after calculated intensity first part this scene comes at you like sledgehammer these four or five minutes are magnificent so very exciting so very quick it leaves you drained when it ends low begins with hunt criminal only stray dog comes closer capturing cops decent into hell this last part film is fast furious we are no longer observer we have become part chase first we know who criminal is police do not know what follows is fascinating puzzle being put together before our eyes last scene film is unexpected deeply disturbing left me numb staring at tv screen after film had ended like gondo we are left with answers that we did not want hear,0.5468650793650794,0.16092592592592592,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,Another Great Film from Japan's Master Filmmaker,"While I've seen HIGH AND LOW referred to as a ""film noir,"" a ""detective drama,"" a ""riveting game of cat-and-mouse,"" and so on into infinity, I think those terms tend to underestimate some very great films (such as this and Kubrick's THE KILLING) and attempts to place them within boundaries over which the expanse of a few powerful films such as these spill.Indeed HIGH AND LOW is a story involving some familiar techniques from film noir; the detective story; and the hunter-and-hunted storyline, but it surpasses so many films that might be included in a list of fine films noires. It, in true Kurosawa style (one which Stanley Kubrick matched blow-for-blow, seeming to complement one another in their stunning gifts to the cinema), stands as a fable showing the differences and tensions which the coexistance of different classes creates.Gondo, the rich on high, receives torment from those who live below him, being literally perched upon a hill, overlooking the city in a feudalistic way, in which the king's palace gazes down upon the serfs below. As the kidnapper says, ""it's hot as hell down here. But you wouldn't know that, you have air conditioning."" Thus we see the parallels pile upon each other: it is about class warfare but also shows the differences between heaven and hell; and Gondo makes both a descent and ascent simultaneously.The plot is simple, but the truth is complicated, and I won't go into it here, but take my word as it stands: this is an amazing piece of film. See it now or regret it! Every Kurosawa film is sublime.",another great film japans master filmmaker,while ive seen high low referred as film noir detective drama riveting game cat mouse so into infinity i think those terms tend underestimate some very great films such as this kubricks killing attempts place them within boundaries over which expanse few powerful films such as these spill indeed high low is story involving some familiar techniques film noir detective story hunter hunted storyline but it surpasses so many films that might be included list fine films noires it true kurosawa style one which stanley kubrick matched blow blow seeming complement one another their stunning gifts cinema stands as fable showing differences tensions which coexistance different classes creates gondo rich high receives torment those who live below him being literally perched upon hill overlooking city feudalistic way which kings palace gazes down upon serfs below as kidnapper says its hot as hell down here but you wouldnt know that you have air conditioning thus we see parallels pile upon each other it is about class warfare but also shows differences between heaven hell gondo makes both descent ascent simultaneously plot is simple but truth is complicated i wont go into it here but take my word as it stands this is amazing piece film see it now or regret it every kurosawa film is sublime,0.5894614512471655,0.18024711399711402,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,About the best police procedural you're ever likely to see,"Toshiro Mifune is a businessman in a Japan that is on the brink of the Economic Miracle of the Sixties. He is an honest man who loves his job as a shoe factory exec and is in a battle for corporate control against a pack of hyenas. He has mortgaged and borrowed and scraped to raise the money for a surprise coup when his son is kidnapped. But there is a major plot twist: it is not HIS son that was taken but his son's playmate, the chauffeur's kid and the ransom demanded is astronomical. If he pays he will lose everything he has worked so hard for, but can he just sacrifice the chauffeur's child because it is not his? From here on High and Low (perhaps better translated as Heaven and Hell) is a police procedural based on an Ed McBain 87th precinct story.Watching this film I had a rare, almost unique, experience. I saw it on a fairly screen tv, letterboxed, in a darkened room. All the preceding conditions helped contribute to put me into an objective/subjective middle ground where I had the feeling of looking through a special visor that allowed me to see the world by means of an almost perfect film as if through the eyes of a cinematic genius who is in total command of his artistic means and in total command of his subject matter. I think the key to this experience is that while High and Low is interesting as human drama, it is yet peculiarly uninvolving emotionally but very involving cinematically. These distances are important in Kurosawa's films (he is high on my list of top ten directors but after Welles). In IKIRU you probably could not be more deeply involved emotionally, while in RAN there is nothing but relentless distance.I think a good companion film to watch with this would be Kurosawa's earlier, looser, but much more individually tense, police film STRAY DOG (this time Mifune is the cop)",about best police procedural youre ever likely see,toshiro mifune is businessman japan that is brink economic miracle sixties he is honest man who loves his job as shoe factory exec is battle corporate control against pack hyenas he has mortgaged borrowed scraped raise money surprise coup when his son is kidnapped but there is major plot twist it is not his son that was taken but his sons playmate chauffeurs kid ransom demanded is astronomical if he pays he will lose everything he has worked so hard but can he just sacrifice chauffeurs child because it is not his here high low perhaps better translated as heaven hell is police procedural based ed mcbain 87th precinct story watching this film i had rare almost unique experience i saw it fairly screen tv letterboxed darkened room all preceding conditions helped contribute put me into objective subjective middle ground where i had feeling looking through special visor that allowed me see world by means almost perfect film as if through eyes cinematic genius who is total command his artistic means total command his subject matter i think key this experience is that while high low is interesting as human drama it is yet peculiarly uninvolving emotionally but very involving cinematically these distances are important kurosawas films he is high my list top ten directors but after welles ikiru you probably could not be more deeply involved emotionally while ran there is nothing but relentless distance i think good companion film watch with this would be kurosawas earlier looser but much more individually tense police film stray dog this time mifune is cop,0.5341607142857143,0.2104077380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"

,Challenging Decomposition,"Spoilers herein.Kurosawa is a giant, both as a film intellectual and as master visualist. But unlike Welles, he moved away from flamboyance and in this film moves into actual meditation after the fashion of Eric Rohmer. What we have is a long (by conventional standards) decomposition of a painting. Greenaway would later use this idea in `Draughtsman's Contract.'The first part of the film is the presentation of the painting: several characters in a room -- Gondo, his wife, his assistant, his driver, and several policemen who we yet know little about. This section is very technical visually with the camera composing every conceivable combination of these people in this room. This is _not_ like `Rope,' where the intent was to confine the film itself. Here we use the space as a device to frame the images, that's all.This section of the film is a complex painting like say Vermeer, but we have the luxury of seeing it in all its possibilities. Once we have exhausted these possibilities, we have a short section which triggers the decomposition of characters. The train introduces motion and extent that we live with for the remainder.Then the decomposition proper. The participants in the painting struggle with logic and clues to understand what it all means. In turn, we discover something about each of the individuals that constituted the initial tableau. There are no extraordinary people or events here and I presume that's the point. The solution to the crime is simply that someone else saw the same tableau through the windows and didn't like/understand it. The `viewing' of the film takes place on four levels: that of us the audience, that of the examining police, that of the voyeur kidnapper, and that of the `public' through the popular media. It is `Rashomon' folded into itself.This is somewhat challenging, but worth it: durable yet stylish.",challenging decomposition,spoilers herein kurosawa is giant both as film intellectual as master visualist but unlike welles he moved away flamboyance this film moves into actual meditation after fashion eric rohmer what we have is long by conventional standards decomposition painting greenaway would later use this idea draughtsmans contract first part film is presentation painting several characters room gondo his wife his assistant his driver several policemen who we yet know little about this section is very technical visually with camera composing every conceivable combination these people this room this is not like rope where intent was confine film itself here we use space as device frame images thats all this section film is complex painting like say vermeer but we have luxury seeing it all its possibilities once we have exhausted these possibilities we have short section which triggers decomposition characters train introduces motion extent that we live with remainder then decomposition proper participants painting struggle with logic clues understand what it all means turn we discover something about each individuals that constituted initial tableau there are no extraordinary people or events here i presume thats point solution crime is simply that someone else saw same tableau through windows didnt like understand it viewing film takes place four levels that us audience that examining police that voyeur kidnapper that public through popular media it is rashomon folded into itself this is somewhat challenging but worth it durable yet stylish,0.39533163265306115,0.06926213667285096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,"The masterpiece of the ""police procedural"" genre","This is one of the outstanding detective films. For me, the most remarkable feature of this film is its architecture - the beginning is a long, static set piece taking place in one room. however, about a third of the way through the movie, it erupts into action, showing the resourcefulness of a largely blue collar police force tracking a lone sociopathic criminal.The film is a fascinating portrait of '60's Japan, but at the same time reveals its roots in Ed McBain's _King's Ransom_, from which it was taken.This is one of those films which doesn't seem to age after several viewings. Especially affecting are the police detectives, whose proletarian roots contrast sharply with the cold insensitivity of the powerful corporate executives. But the police find a hero in Gondo, the rebellious general manager who stakes his entire fortune to rescue his chauffeur's son.

9.0,highly underrated Kurasawa flick,"Too often when people talk about Akira Kurasawa, they emphasize the samurai movies he made so much that the average film buff might incorrectly assumed that's all he did. In fact, most of his films were NOT about the samurai culture, but about modern Japan.Among the best of these non-samurai movies are Ikiru, Scandal, The Bad Sleep Well and this film. High And Low is set in contemporary Japan and it's the story of a kidnapping. The first half of the film centers mostly on the Toshiro Mifune character and the impact of the kidnapping on him. It seems the kidnappers accidentally kidnapped the chauffeur's son and not the one belonging to corporate big-shot Mifune. He struggles with whether or not to pay the extremely high ransom, as it will likely bankrupt him and his family. This dilemma is handled very well. The second half of the film is centered on the forensics and police footwork done to try to bring the perpetrators to justice.Particularly outstanding in this film is the pacing. Some might consider it to be a bit slow, but I loved how they fused a human drama with the step-by-step police work (similar to a Law And Order episode in how it unfolds, but in even greater detail and attention to realism). The acting is also top-notch, though it is not a ""Toshiro Mifune"" movie per se, as he barely appears in the second half of the film.

10.0,"Morality as a choice-driven virtue, not a duty...","""High and Low"" is Akira Kurosawa's unsung masterpiece, it's strikingly similar to ""Straw Dog"" in its meticulous depiction of police procedural and the indirect canvas it offers for an exploration of Japan's social strata in the mid-sixties, from the highest layers to the lowest depths, presenting in painstaking precision the cohabitation between the upper and lower classes, made of protocoled compliance and officious defiance. It's one of the few modern dramas directed by the Master, as if his usual period ""Samurai"" movies wouldn't fit the social significance he's aiming at.To understand that, one should get to Kurosawa's vision of humanism, only a virtue if the character has a choice. In his Jidageiki movies, samurai or warriors lived under a code so strict that their bravery was closer to the realms of duty than genuine heroism. Only until his masterpieces in color, Kurosawa could portray characters the viewers could both admire and relate to, from the petty criminal played by Tatsuya Nakadai, charged to impersonate a lord in ""Kagemusha"" to the greedy and ambitious sons in ""Ran"", Kurosawa was never better as painting the flaws of humanity with a firm but forgiving hand and this is why ""Rashomon"" is such a milestone, it offered a new vision of characterization, not relying on personalities' actions but on their perception by or resonance on other people's live. Kurosawa is perhaps to cinema both an Einstein and a Sartre, bringing relativity and existentialism.We're good or we're bad by choice not by duty.This is why there always comes a point in his dramas when a flawed character chooses his destiny and this is why it never worked better than in movies set in the contemporary world such as ""Drunken Angel"" and ""Ikiru"" and even more in police procedurals like ""Stray Dog"" because these film offered a panoramic view on a Japanese society devoid of such codes of honor as the Bushido, so socially broad and ethically uncertain that it became the arena where the forces of evil and good, greed and generosity, calculations and disinterest, confronted each other. ""High and Low"" is the culmination of that introspection through one of the most painful choices ever forced upon a man, so vital to the film's emotional backbone that it needed a twenty-minute set-up. The opening is a remarkable exercise in exposition all in detail in concision as if Kurosawa was already experimenting in his directing style the same rigor applied by the detectives in charge of the case.The residence of Mr.Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is located at the top of a hill offering a panoramic view on the lowest parts, it's vast, well-furnished, his boy has a cowboy disguise and plays with the chauffeur's son, which means that he's rich enough to be a chauffeur. Gondo is a no-nonsense self-made-man and one of the stockholders of a huge national shoe company and is coerced by his associates to make a move against the president whose old-fashioned views are incompatible with their visions of profitability, making lesser shoes but with higher profits. Gondo refuses the deal but what we take for a proof of integrity is contradicted by his plan, he bought enough stock to lead the company alone, which forced him to mortgage his house and twenty years of social ladder climbing; it's a fool-proof make-it-or-break. One phone-call later, he learns that his son has been kidnapped for a ransom of 30 million yens, we expect Gondo to pay, but that would be too easy, there's a catch in that plot.If not the best or the most iconic Kurosawa, ""High and Low"" has certainly the greatest premise, the boy was the chauffeur's son, the two kids had switched disguises. The cops come, the chauffeur keeps quiet until he hears his son and then begs his boss to do something. The kidnapper realizes his mistake (which makes sense since there's no reason the son would pretend to be Gondo's) but the dilemma is all the same, either Gondo pays and jeopardizes his future or he lets the kid die. That's the equation. We know a man like Gondo will be likely to pay, it's interesting however to watch him examin his own conscience under the tacit observance of the police officer played by Nakadai. At that point of the review, I don't want to spoil much of the film because it is one to experience, and on three levels: the ethical dilemma, the police investigation and the social documentary on Japan in the 60s where the absorption of the Western way of life went at the expenses of the ancient codes.While the first part is set completely in Gondo's house, a fitting bridge sequence makes the transition to the investigation that will structure the entire second part, with tracing calls, interrogation, tailings, facial composites and all the archetypes. Gondo is absent for the most part but we feel his presence from the efforts displayed by the public opinion, the chauffeur, his son and the police. Such a fruitful zeal couldn't have been possible if the right choice wasn't made; which raises a challenging question: is it always a matter of doing your job or is morality the true driver or people's actions? Had Gondo made the wrong choice, his public and private aura would've been destroyed, his decision was moral and ethical but let's not pretend it wasn't also practical. Still, maybe it's because Gondo climbed so high that he could have a full view on the low he could sink, materially or symbolically.And when the investigation leads us to the criminal, we realizes he'd jus offered us the perfect counter-example as man who was so low that he saw the highest spot reached by Gondo with envy and jealousy instead of climbing his way to the top. Indeed ""High and Low"" is a captivating immersion into the heights humanity can raise itself above and the lowest lows it can plunge in... and it's a terrific cop thriller!",morality as choice driven

,Heaven and Hell,"Possible SpoilersA film of expert and scrupulous construction, High and Low demonstrates how a gifted filmmaker can control the structure of a film to enhance tension and narrative suspense. This film came at the zenith of Kurosawa's career and his skill is apparent in every shot; it is the work of a man who possesses complete mastery of his craft, and the movie is a masterpiece of 'constructional' film. Externally High and Low is about a kidnapping case, but as the title suggests, it is also about paradox, and relationship between polar opposites. The film can be enjoyed at both levels, either as a suspenseful police procedural, or as a meditation on opposite and similar existences. Because Kuroswa intertwines both, the film is extremely engaging. As in Ikiru, Kurosawa forces the viewer to abstain from empathizing with the characters, and it is through this method that the viewer can learn from them and appreciate the situations they exist in. One of the few films to create suspense through structure, High and Low deserves special notice. It is in this aspect that Kurosawa's expertise really shows. As in Ikiru, High and Low is broken into separate parts. The first trimester takes place entirely in a living room. The angled shots, intense close-ups, unchanging setting, and the viewers anticipations all contribute to an acute suspense that culminates in one of the most powerful transitions to ever take place in film. The transition scene occurs one a train, and the sense of motion and speed allow the viewer to experience tension and excitement merely through change in setting and suggestion of motion. Once the suspense is resolved the movie takes the form of a detective story, as the kidnapping culprit is sought after. The procedure is very interesting and the methods and processes of the detectives easily intrigue the viewer. The discovery of the culprit is accomplished through a brilliant sequence of editing, in which Kurosawa demonstrates his skills with one of the most fluid and seamless series of cuts in filmic history. Afterwards the detectives pursue the criminal and the film reaches conclusion with his capture. As always Kurosawa's shot composition is gorgeous, but in High and Low it also serves to support Kurosawa's affirmations about man. High angles and low shots combine with intense close-ups to elevate tension and remind the viewer of the films ever-present motifs. As previously stated the editing is worthy of special notice. The acting is superb, but not as prominent or vital to the film as others of Kurosawa. Sound is used carefully and successfully, and dialogue is minimal but effective. High and Low must be seen by Kurosawa devotees and fans of well-crafted cinema.",heaven hell,possible spoilersa film expert scrupulous construction high low demonstrates how gifted filmmaker can control structure film enhance tension narrative suspense this film came at zenith kurosawas career his skill is apparent every shot it is work man who possesses complete mastery his craft movie is masterpiece constructional film externally high low is about kidnapping case but as title suggests it is also about paradox relationship between polar opposites film can be enjoyed at both levels either as suspenseful police procedural or as meditation opposite similar existences because kuroswa intertwines both film is extremely engaging as ikiru kurosawa forces viewer abstain empathizing with characters it is through this method that viewer can learn them appreciate situations they exist one few films create suspense through structure high low deserves special notice it is this aspect that kurosawas expertise really shows as ikiru high low is broken into separate parts first trimester takes place entirely living room angled shots intense close ups unchanging setting viewers anticipations all contribute acute suspense that culminates one most powerful transitions ever take place film transition scene occurs one train sense motion speed allow viewer experience tension excitement merely through change setting suggestion motion once suspense is resolved movie takes form detective story as kidnapping culprit is sought after procedure is very interesting methods processes detectives easily intrigue viewer discovery culprit is accomplished through brilliant sequence editing which kurosawa demonstrates his skills with one most fluid seamless series cuts filmic history afterwards detectives pursue criminal film reaches conclusion with his capture as always kurosawas shot composition is gorgeous but high low it also serves support kurosawas affirmations about man high angles low shots combine with intense close ups elevate tension remind viewer films ever present motifs as previously stated editing is worthy special notice acting is superb but not as prominent or vital film as others kurosawa sound is used carefully successfully dialogue is minimal but effective high low must be seen by kurosawa devotees fans well crafted cinema,0.5408980785296575,0.1921219715956558,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,Akira Kurosawa uses his tremendous filmmaking talents to analyze the difference between different layers of the social and class structure.,"As the title suggests, High and Low deals a lot with class structure and it's finite importance. This film seems to say that there are times when financial success must be set aside for the compassionate preservation of endangered human life. Kingo Gondo is a high powered executive in a prestigious Japanese shoe company, and he is approached by a group of other executives who have a plan to produce different shoes that would bring in more profits. Gondo refuses, because the proposed shoes are cheaply made and fall apart easily. He kicks them out of his house and, very soon after, he gets a call saying that his son has been kidnapped for ransom. It turns out that the kidnappers accidentally kidnapped his chauffeur's son, yet they still demand the ransom.(spoilers) Gondo has borrowed money on everything he owns (including his beautiful house), so that he can buy enough stock to own National Shoes, the company for which he works. He has compiled 50 million yen, and the kidnapper is demanding 30 million yen, an amount that will ruin Gondo's chance to own National Shoes, and will also cost him virtually everything that he owns. At first he refused to pay because it would ruin him and his family, but realizing that he would be hated by the whole country for not paying, he arranges to pay the ransom, and Shinichi, the boy who was kidnapped, is returned. Shinichi's retrieval is followed by an elaborate investigation into the kidnapping case, and the kidnapper is eventually captured and given the death sentence because, in addition to the kidnapping, he also killed three people, two of whom were accomplices in the kidnapping itself.There is also some excellent characterization in high and Low, as is usually the case with Kurosawa's work. Kenjiro Ishiyama, the stocky, bald-headed detective, for example, isa very developed character. When we first see him, he is at Gondo's house, participating in the investigation. It almost seems that he is just a character to fill a place as an investigator, but we later learn a lot more about him. First of all, in a later scene where he is in a car with another investigator, he mentions that Gondo is a nice enough guy, even though he didn't like him when they first met. He said that he can't stand these rich people who feel like they are better than other people, but in this scene it he suggests that he has changed his mind about that. We are able to learn a bit more about him as an individual this way, but it is the scene in which Shinichi is recovered that we really see a new side of him. After the briefcases with the money are thrown out of the train, Shinichi is left by the tracks and the kidnappers take the money and flee. When Gondo and the investigators arrive to retrieve Shinichi, it is Ishiyama who, although briefly, breaks into tears upon his safe recovery. This adds a whole new level to his character that was not seen before.Kurosawa's films are also quite often peppered with examples of irony that are significant to the meaning of the film, and High and Low is clearly no exception. 1.)	Gondo fears that if he pays the ransom, he will be ruined financially and professionally, yet when he does pay it, he becomes a national hero and soon has control over a different (although smaller) shoe company which is sure to succeed because of his skyrocketing popularity. 2.)If Gondo pays the ransom, he will lose all power in National Shoes, yet when actually preparing to pay, it is his shoemaking skills that come in handy to insert a tracking device in the cases which are to carry the money. 3.) As mentioned above, the tough, bald-headed detective, who didn't even like Gondo at first, is the one to break into tears when Shinichi is safely retrieved. Kurosawa employs a very subtle filmmaking technique in High and Low, but it was very different from his technique in Kagemusha and Ran. Here, there were many more cuts and there was a lot more motion with the camera, but this was all done in a realistic way, he did not use the camera to alter reality to any real extent. For example, there are numerous panning shots that take place in Gondo's home, but these are mainly just to follow characters as they move about. Another good example is the camerawork that is taken on the train. As they are looking out the window, there are very shaky point of view shots that are very realistic because the investigators are trying to photograph the kidnappers from the train, and this shakiness is what it would look like in real life. Unlike Ran and Kagemusha, High and Low has a very romantic ending. As a matter of fact, most of the film is pretty highly romanticized. Three kidnappers kidnap Shinichi, they get the ransom, Gondo is glorified for his tremendous act of humanity, one kidnapper kills the other two to keep the money himself, Shinichi is returned safely, the kidnapper is eventually caught and sufficiently punished, and Gondo even gets back the vast majority of the ransom money. In the end, the kidnapper gets the death sentence, Gondo gets his money back, and Shinichi is returned safely to his father. This ending is not entirely realistic, but it is a feel good ending that is put on the movie in order to emphasize the various important messages that were communicated throughout the film. Indeed, this seems to be the only way that Kurosawa, as the director, intruded into the story to make his point, which is a characteristic of his subtle genius.",akira kurosawa uses his tremendous

7.0,"""It's very interesting to make fortunate people unfortunate""","In the late 50s and early 60s Kurosawa's pictures began to get increasingly pessimistic and depersonalised. High and Low pretty much represents the peak of this trend, a film noir every bit as cynical and universal in its condemnations as Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly or Orson Welles' Touch of Evil.Kurosawa's style is sometimes hard to categorise, because he was always adapting it to suit the story. Here, we get very contrasting styles within the one film, which is informally divided into three ""acts"". The first, set in millionaire Gondo's mansion is composed in whites and lights, with few cuts or close-ups. The middle section, in which the detectives track down the kidnapper, is constructed with point-by-point technicality, and a sense of urgency with short scenes and plenty of cross-cuts. The final act is the titular ""low""  a look at Tokyo's seedy underbelly, with low key lighting, agonising close-ups and awkward angles.This structure is perhaps where the problems of High and Low lie. It's occasionally uneven and doesn't flow well as a whole. The first act is the best - a tight, confined drama like Hitchcock's Rope. Kurosawa's handling of his characters' emotional turmoil is expertly choreographed in the placement of actors and cameras  for example, you often have everyone looking in opposite directions as if unable to face each other. The middle section has some good tension to it, but is a little too technical and formulaic. The final act looks great, but that is its very problem. There is so much going on  particularly in the sleazy nightclub  that you end up caught up focusing on all the background details rather than the actual plot. It's great as a kind of realist expose, but doesn't sit well in a thriller.The biggest trouble with the structure of High and Low is that we never really get to grips with any of the characters. There is no consistent hero or anti-hero, no single individual whose eyes we see the story through. The businessman played by Mifune is the closest thing we have to a protagonist, but he is all but dropped from the storyline after the first hour. There is not much depth to the detective characters. The kidnapper is a complex character but the focus on him is constantly shifting.While certain aspects of the picture seem really well thought out, others simply appear to be nothing more than Kurosawa going through familiar motions. Like his previous noir-ish thriller Stray Dog (1949) High and Low takes place during a heat wave, but this is not so fully emphasised as in the earlier picture and so has little real effect. Kurosawa returns to his theme of blurring social status (the chauffeur's boy being mistaken for Gondo's son despite their differing ""values"" reminds me of the disguised princess in Hidden Fortress or Mifune's wannabe-Samurai in Seven Samurai), but any emotional depth is stifled under the picture's tone of selfishness and sleaze.High and Low's score seems deliberately weird and minimalist, and perhaps just a bit too simplistic. There is great sound design though, particularly the eerie distant noises of the city as heard from Gondo's house. This is one of High and Low's best features, and its interesting to note the picture was made around the same time as Hitchcock's The Birds, which experimentally uses a sound design of bird noises in place of a musical score.Like some of Hitchcock's thrillers, High and Low is gripping when watched for the first time, but loses its appeal on repeated viewings. Kurosawa was to follow it up with Red Beard, which is heavy-handedly optimistic and humanist, perhaps to make up for the cynicism of its predecessors. Red Beard and High and Low are my two least favourite Kurosawa pictures and for me this was a real low point in his career, where his message making got in the way of his ability to tell a good story.",its very interesting make fortunate people unfortunate,late 50s early 60s kurosawas pictures began get increasingly pessimistic depersonalised high low pretty much represents peak this trend film noir every bit as cynical universal its condemnations as robert aldrichs kiss me deadly or orson welles touch evil kurosawas style is sometimes hard categorise because he was always adapting it suit story here we get very contrasting styles within one film which is informally divided into three acts first set millionaire gondos mansion is composed whites lights with few cuts or close ups middle section which detectives track down kidnapper is constructed with point by point technicality sense urgency with short scenes plenty cross cuts final act is titular low look at tokyos seedy underbelly with low key lighting agonising close ups awkward angles this structure is perhaps where problems high low lie its occasionally uneven doesnt flow well as whole first act is best tight confined drama like hitchcocks rope kurosawas handling his characters emotional turmoil is expertly choreographed placement actors cameras example you often have everyone looking opposite directions as if unable face each other middle section has some good tension it but is little too technical formulaic final act looks great but that is its very problem there is so much going particularly sleazy nightclub that you end up caught up focusing all background details rather than actual plot its great as kind realist expose but doesnt sit well thriller biggest trouble with structure high low is that we never really get grips with any characters there is no consistent hero or anti hero no single individual whose eyes we see story through businessman played by mifune is closest thing we have protagonist but he is all but dropped storyline after first hour there is not much depth detective characters kidnapper is complex character but focus him is constantly shifting while certain aspects picture seem really well thought out others simply appear be nothing more than kurosawa going through familiar motions like his previous noir ish thriller stray dog 1949 high low takes place during heat wave but this is not so fully emphasised as earlier picture so has little real effect kurosawa returns his theme blurring social status chauffeurs boy being mistaken gondos son despite their differing values reminds me disguised princess hidden fortress or mifunes wannabe samurai seven samurai but any emotional depth is stifled under pictures tone selfishness sleaze high lows score seems deliberately weird minimalist perhaps just bit too simplistic there is great sound design though particularly eerie distant noises city as heard gondos house this is one high lows best features its interesting note picture was made around same time as hitchcocks birds which experimentally uses sound design bird noises place musical score like some hitchcocks thrillers high low is gripping when watched first time but loses its appeal repeated viewings kurosawa was follow it up with red beard which is heavy handedly optimistic humanist perhaps make up cynicism its predecessors red beard high low are my two least favourite kurosawa pictures me this was real low point his career where his message making got way his ability tell good story,0.4213183849591616,0.05845507782400987,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,"""I'd rather be told the cruel truth than to be fed gentle lies.""","Up till now I've only seen Toshiro Mifune in Kurosawa's samurai movies, so it was kind of comical to see and hear him in this film when he stated ""Shoes are my life"". It just struck me as rather funny, but then, almost on a dime, Mifune's character Kingo Gondo reacted to his young son playing cowboys with a friend by stating that in a tense situation, ""Man must kill or be killed"". That had to be a subliminal rationale for Gondo's decision to wrest control of his National Shoe Company away from the owner and executive board. Borrowing against everything he owned, he was about to make a business deal that would have set him up for life.The first half of this movie sets up a moral dilemma for Gondo after a kidnapping gone awry puts him in the position of having to come up with a thirty million yen ransom, not for his own son, but for the son of his chauffeur. Without having knowledge of the Japanese mindset, I had trouble understanding why Gondo would have refused to pay the ransom if it meant his son's friend might be faced with death at the hands of a maniacal kidnapper. Granted, we had insight on the strings Gondo had to pull in order to put together the takeover plan for his company, but to my mind, the scales were balanced in favor of saving the kid. It was interesting to see how it was Gondo's wife and chauffeur who appealed to his better nature and not the police detectives assigned to the kidnapping case. Chief Inspector Tokura (Tatsuya Nakadai) remained emotionally detached during these confrontations, which struck me as somewhat odd.What's also intriguing is how the film switches gears in the second half after the ransom demand is finally met, and the police begin their work to solve the crime and capture the kidnapper. The forensic work of the detectives is quite significant in scope, taking into account such features as train schedules, landscape, locations of phone booths near Gondo's home, and the recollections of the young kidnap victim who was released after the ransom was paid. Having identified the perpetrator however, I was left stymied as to why the detective team failed to make an immediate move on Ginjiro Takeuchi (Tsutomu Yamazaki) when they had a chance more than once on the street. Since the apprehension was eventually made at a hideout location identified by Tokura, it didn't make sense to me why the police waited, other than as a concession to the script. Nothing of significance occurred with the kidnap suspect to suggest the cops should have delayed.The final sequence in which Takeuchi requested a face to face meeting with Gondo reminded me of a similar scene in the 1938 film ""Angels With Dirty Faces"". Only in that movie, Cagney's Rocky Sullivan went 'yellow' at the request of his childhood friend Father Jerry, whereas Takeuchi transformed from an arrogant and smug wise guy into that of a cowardly punk in the face of execution for the murder of his two associates in the kidnapping case. Except for Gondo appearing at the meeting with Takeuchi, the disappearance of Mifune's character in the second half of the story almost made it feel like one is watching a different movie.",id rather be told cruel truth than be fed gentle lies,up till now ive only seen toshiro mifune kurosawas samurai movies so it was kind comical see hear him this film when he stated shoes are my life it just struck me as rather funny but then almost dime mifunes character kingo gondo reacted his young son playing cowboys with friend by stating that tense situation man must kill or be killed that had be subliminal rationale gondos decision wrest control his national shoe company away owner executive board borrowing against everything he owned he was about make business deal that would have set him up life first half this movie sets up moral dilemma gondo after kidnapping gone awry puts him position having come up with thirty million yen ransom not his own son but son his chauffeur without having knowledge japanese mindset i had trouble understanding why gondo would have refused pay ransom if it meant his sons friend might be faced with death at hands maniacal kidnapper granted we had insight strings gondo had pull order put together takeover plan his company but my mind scales were balanced favor saving kid it was interesting see how it was gondos wife chauffeur who appealed his better nature not police detectives assigned kidnapping case chief inspector tokura tatsuya nakadai remained emotionally detached during these confrontations which struck me as somewhat odd whats also intriguing is how film switches gears second half after ransom demand is finally met police begin their work solve crime capture kidnapper forensic work detectives is quite significant scope taking into account such features as train schedules landscape locations phone booths near gondos home recollections young kidnap victim who was released after ransom was paid having identified perpetrator however i was left stymied as why detective team failed make immediate move ginjiro takeuchi tsutomu yamazaki when they had chance more than once street since apprehension was eventually made at hideout location identified by tokura it didnt make sense me why police waited other than as concession script nothing significance occurred with kidnap suspect suggest cops should have delayed final sequence which takeuchi requested face face meeting with gondo reminded me similar scene 1938 film angels with dirty faces only that movie cagneys rocky sullivan went yellow at request his childhood friend father jerry whereas takeuchi transformed arrogant smug wise guy into that cowardly punk face execution murder his two associates kidnapping case except gondo appearing at meeting with takeuchi disappearance mifunes character second half story almost made it feel like one is watching different movie,0.4947154471544716,0.045731707317073156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,Top-tier Kurosawa thriller,"HIGH AND LOW is one of the excellent contemporary thrillers that Akira Kurosawa made during the peak of his career. Unfortunately it's a sub-genre that seems mostly forgotten about today, passed over in favour of Kurosawa's well-renowned samurai movies. It's a shame because these films often have just as much to offer.HIGH AND LOW tells a detailed, lengthy story about a kidnapping and subsequent police investigation. It's a long and slow-moving film but one which rewards close submersion into the storyline and narrative. Toshiro Mifune is cast against type playing a hard-headed shoe factory boss whose son is kidnapped for ransom. However, the kidnapper gets his kids mixed up and accidentally kidnaps the chauffeur's son instead.What follows is tense, well-shot and superbly acted, as are the majority of the director's films. Mifune gives a bullishly realistic turn as the proud factory boss but it's Tatsuya Nakadai who really shines as the smooth detective brought in to solve the case. Watch out for Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura in the minor role of the police chief. Essentially HIGH AND LOW is a film in two parts, and the original Japanese title - HEAVEN AND HELL - gives some idea of Kurosawa's thematic ideas. Watching these characters descend into a literal and figurative Hell makes for unmissable cinema.",top tier kurosawa thriller,high low is one excellent contemporary thrillers that akira kurosawa made during peak his career unfortunately its sub genre that seems mostly forgotten about today passed over favour kurosawas well renowned samurai movies its shame because these films often have just as much offer high low tells detailed lengthy story about kidnapping subsequent police investigation its long slow moving film but one which rewards close submersion into storyline narrative toshiro mifune is cast against type playing hard headed shoe factory boss whose son is kidnapped ransom however kidnapper gets his kids mixed up accidentally kidnaps chauffeurs son instead what follows is tense well shot superbly acted as are majority directors films mifune gives bullishly realistic turn as proud factory boss but its tatsuya nakadai who really shines as smooth detective brought solve case watch out kurosawa regular takashi shimura minor role police chief essentially high low is film two parts original japanese title heaven hell gives some idea kurosawas thematic ideas watching these characters descend into literal figurative hell makes unmissable cinema,0.4427099911582669,0.16080459770114947,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,Great suspenceful crime story. Fine performances early in the careers of future stars.,"A child of a chauffeur is mistakenly kidnapped in the place of a businessman's son. The businessman, involved in a high-stakes takeover of his company from his erring bosses, chooses to risk losing his shirt to pay the ransom for a child not his own. While the clock is ticking on both the businessman's fortune and the child's life, the police decide that they want a sure conviction rather than a quick arrest.A suspenseful crime story based on a novel by Evan Hunter (aka Ed McBain) transported to 1960's Japan. The soon to be famous ""Economic miracle"" is in full swing as Japan rebuilds its war-ravaged landscape. The mix of optimism and despair of the people in the thick of this economic transformation is palpable beneath the multiple story lines of scrappy cops following their hunches, the inventive kidnapper and the businessman.Toshiro Mifune shines as the businessman while Tatuya Nakadai makes a fine appearance as Inspector Tokura. Tsutomu Yamazaki as the kidnapper debuts into a glorious career.

7.0,7.5/10 - Maybe I Missed Something?,"I mean, I did like it, it was decent, but...I mean, it's rated 9/10 on letterboxd as of now, and I don't really get it. Maybe I miss something.Anyway, High and Low is the first Akira Kurosawa film I've watched. Kurosawa is probably one of the most critically acclaimed japanese directors of all time, and this is one of his most highly regarded films.It tells the story of Gondo, a wealthy executive that tries to take over the shoe company in which he's an executive, National Shoes. He mortgaged everything in order to be able to by enough shares to vote his rivals out, but the night before the deal is closed - his chauffeur's son get kidnapped. The kidnapper calls and demands a ransom of 30 million yen (which, if paid, can cost Gondo his deal and make him lose his job) , or else - the kid dies. The first half of this film is about the dillema and its consequences, and the second half follows the police in their search for the kidnapper.I do like some things about this film. The cinematography is quite decent, and it gives everything weight during the first half and urgency during the final act. I like some subtle ideas that were communicated to the viewer throughout the film (""all we got is time"", and later the watch in the living room - if you got it you got it), and the kidnapper has interesting personality and motives. The score isn't bad either, and I do like almost everything about the final act. The cinematography there is definitely in its peak for this film, and the story kept me interested throughout it all. The final scene is really great and thought-provoking too. The score is pretty abstract, but it feels very on-point as well.BUT. I just didn't feel it throughout the whole film. I didn't have this spark, this click with the film. Especially during the search for the kidnapper, I feel like this movie can be quite exhausting. Not bad, just a bit slow. It's like those mind-battles in Death Note - it wasn't SUPER boring, but yet, at times, it was exhausting to watch.So, yeah, maybe it doesn't feel that based, but these are my thoughts and feelings, and I did watch the film twice before writing the review, just in case I've missed something, and I do thing that I understand it and its moral take pretty well, but yet, the pacing around the middle of this film brings it down a little for me.

8.0,"Masterful first hour, but then the film gets thrown out the window...","**SPOILERS**As I began watching this movie, I was glued to it from the very start. The situation which was set up was a masterful one: a man kidnaps a child whom he believes to be the son of a rich businessman, but who actually turns out to be the son of the businessman's servant. The kidnapper still insists on getting the money from the businessman. The ransom equals much, much more than the businessman can afford. So what are his choices? He can either pay the ransom and become poor, or he could indirectly kill a young child and be forever blameworthy in the eyes of the public, his associates, his son, his wife, and, most importantly, in his own eyes. This businessman, Gondo, played masterfully by Toshiro Mifune, undisputedly one of the best film actors of all time, struggles with his decision, and I struggled with him. And every second of the film for the first hour or so is extremely intense until...SPOILERS!!!the kidnappers return the child after they get the money. After this, there are only a few great Kurosawa touches at the edges of a very conventional detective vs criminal film. There is nothing at all new in this part of the plot, which lasts for at least 60% of the film's running time. In fact, the detective work is so poorly conceived and written. Half the time they're skipping over the most obvious leads, and the other half of the time they're following leads that would have in reality been impossible to figure out. One of my very favorite television shows is Hawaii Five-0, and there were several kidnapping episodes in that series. This detective story, filmed by one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, does not even touch the most lame-brained Five-0 episode ever produced.And it is an utter shame that Kurosawa, one of the world's greatest directors, wasted his time on this trite and moronic plotline. His films show us again and again philosophical problems of the greatest degree. For goodness' sake, take a look at Rashomon! Has there been a more deeply philosophical film made? And _High and Low_ has this sort of depth of philosophy in it, too. It is just relegated to right field where it hardly ever comes into play. The title of the film itself refers to the difference between the wealthy and the poor. The kidnapper is poor, and he loathes the rich man, Gondo, so he attempts to switch places with him on the social ladder. And there is a very powerful final scene where the kidnapper demands to meet with Gondo before he is put to death. Here the kidnapper confronts Gondo and tells him why he did it. It is a great moment, but it is difficult to feel anything for his situation. He hardly appears in the film until half-way through, and he only appears for any long period of time in the last half an hour of the film. He should have permeated the entire film, and the detectives should have been given more of a back seat. Perhaps the kidnapper should have been even with Gondo. But even Gondo misses out on half the film!NO MORE SPOILERS!!!I would still tell any fan of the director's to see this film, but it is truly a disappointment for someone of such great talents. Rashomon! The Seven Samurai! Yojimbo! Ran! Kagemusha! Yume! High and Low does not belong on this list. 7/10.",masterful first hour but then film gets thrown out window,spoilers as i began watching this movie i was glued it very start situation which was set up was masterful one man kidnaps child whom he believes be son rich businessman but who actually turns out be son businessmans servant kidnapper still insists getting money businessman ransom equals much much more than businessman can afford so what are his choices he can either pay ransom become poor or he could indirectly kill young child be forever blameworthy eyes public his associates his son his wife most importantly his own eyes this businessman gondo played masterfully by toshiro mifune undisputedly one best film actors all time struggles with his decision i struggled with him every second film first hour or so is extremely intense until spoilers kidnappers return child after they get money after this there are only few great kurosawa touches at edges very conventional detective vs criminal film there is nothing at all new this part plot which lasts at least 60 films running time fact detective work is so poorly conceived written half time theyre skipping over most obvious leads other half time theyre following leads that would have reality been impossible figure out one my very favorite television shows is hawaii five 0 there were several kidnapping episodes that series this detective story filmed by one greatest artists 20th century does not even touch most lame brained five 0 episode ever produced it is utter shame that kurosawa one worlds greatest directors wasted his time this trite moronic plotline his films show us again again philosophical problems greatest degree goodness sake take look at rashomon has there been more deeply philosophical film made high low has this sort depth philosophy it too it is just relegated right field where it hardly ever comes into play title film itself refers difference between wealthy poor kidnapper is poor he loathes rich man gondo so he attempts switch places with him social ladder there is very powerful final scene where kidnapper demands meet with gondo before he is put death here kidnapper confronts gondo tells him why he did it it is great moment but it is difficult feel anything his situation he hardly appears film until half way through he only appears any long period time last half hour film he should have permeated entire film detectives should have been given more back seat perhaps kidnapper should have been even with gondo but even gondo misses out half film no more spoilers i would still tell any fan directors see this film but it is truly disappointment someone such great talents rashomon seven samurai yojimbo ran kagemusha yume high low does not belong this list 7 10,0.5249050505050504,0.1396181818181819,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.4}"

7.0,Absorbing Crime Drama.,"I hope no one is put off by the fact that this was directed by Akira Kurosawa and has Japanese subtitles. Kurosawa, true, directed some atmospheric stuff. Who can forget the ghost scene in ""Throne of Blood""? But for all that, his films always packed a commercial wallop.This one will keep you in your seat with your eyes open. It's anything but artsy. What with the overwrought style of acting -- the pacing, the gritting of teeth, the outraged shouting, the sly sneaking about on crowded streets -- this particular atmosphere practically crackles with tension.The opening third introduces us to Toshiro Mifune, the self-made millionaire, who has secretly borrowed all the money he can to buy a controlling interest in National Shoes so that he can make quality products. Naturally the Board of Directors want to make junk shoes and turn a profit -- period. Mifune is not an especially generous or likable guy. He's honest and fair but gruff with his family and employees.Then -- chaos. Some kidnappers have taken his six-year-old son and are demanding 30M yen, which is to say everything that Mifune owns or has borrowed. So far the usual kidnap-for-ransom formula is followed: put the money in unmarked bills in two satchels, don't contact the police, wait for further instructions, and so forth. Mifune immediately agrees but, as is also part of the formula, he contacts the police who sneak into his house and record the calls he gets from the evildoers. We've seen this before, of course, will Glenn Ford or Mel Gibson doing the honors.Then it turns more interesting. By mistake, the kidnappers have taken, not Mifune's son, but that of his devoted chauffeur, who's been a lifelong playmate of Mifune's own boy. A call from the kidnappers confirms the accident but still demands the money.Now what? Should Mifune go broke and reduce him and his family to a state of poverty? In order to save the life of a boy who isn't his own? Interesting dilemma. It's easy for the viewer to say, yes, pay the two dollars. But suppose we were in Mifune's shoes? Wouldn't we be in a state of trichotillomania, caught between Kant's hypothetical imperatives (what's in it for me?) and his categorical imperatives (what's the right thing to do?)? Someone brought that word, trichotillomania, to my attention and I just threw it in for the hell of it. It means a compulsion to pull one's hair out. I'd have had to wait two or three more lifetimes for such an opportunity.Okay. I don't suppose it's necessary to spell out what Mifune decides. He gulps and eats it.That's the first third of the movie, and it's not uninteresting. But then the pace picks up immediately. The miscreants are really clever and manage to outwit the police during the exchange of money and child. But the cops are no dopes either, and we get a rather longish story of their tracking the criminal. It reminded me less of the kind of detective work we see in the kinds of movies sometimes called ""noirs,"" with Humphrey Bogart or Clint Eastwood on the trail, than it did of ""Day of the Jackal,"" made with a European cast and crew. And maybe Fritz Lang's ""M"".Nice scenes aboard one of the famous Bullet Trains. The tempo drops a bit when the now-busted Mifune drops from sight and the police begin trailing the chief suspect. There's a lot of slinking around in sleazy juke joints and junkie alleys and at times I was a little lost about just what was going on. I had to wait for the police report to bring me up to date.The ending, although dramatic enough, was something of a let-down too. I was waiting for the malefactor to turn out to be Mifune's estranged younger brother or something. It had been pointed out more than once that the motive was not just pecuniary but a personal desire to torment Mifune. Instead, though, it was resolved as a matter of complex status envy, with a stranger on the other end.I suppose, though, that that's what the title is meant to reflect -- the difference between the enormously wealthy and the druggies and burn-outs on the louche streets. The symbolism, if that's what it is, is realized concretely in the distinction between Mifune's mansion high on a hill and the shabby apartment of the kidnapper below, stifling in the heat and industrial smog.Kurosawa admitted that he didn't provide many answers in his movies but that the same question seemed to run through his work: Why can't people be happy? He was in a good position to ask, since he evidently suffered from a major mood disorder.",absorbing crime drama,i hope no one is put off by fact that this was directed by akira kurosawa has japanese subtitles kurosawa true directed some atmospheric stuff who can forget ghost scene throne blood but all that his films always packed commercial wallop this one will keep you your seat with your eyes open its anything but artsy what with overwrought style acting pacing gritting teeth outraged shouting sly sneaking about crowded streets this particular atmosphere practically crackles with tension opening third introduces us toshiro mifune self made millionaire who has secretly borrowed all money he can buy controlling interest national shoes so that he can make quality products naturally board directors want make junk shoes turn profit period mifune is not especially generous or likable guy hes honest fair but gruff with his family employees then chaos some kidnappers have taken his six year old son are demanding 30m yen which is say everything that mifune owns or has borrowed so far usual kidnap ransom formula is followed put money unmarked bills two satchels dont contact police wait further instructions so forth mifune immediately agrees but as is also part formula he contacts police who sneak into his house record calls he gets evildoers weve seen this before course will glenn ford or mel gibson doing honors then it turns more interesting by mistake kidnappers have taken not mifunes son but that his devoted chauffeur whos been lifelong playmate mifunes own boy call kidnappers confirms accident but still demands money now what should mifune go broke reduce him his family state poverty order save life boy who isnt his own interesting dilemma its easy viewer say yes pay two dollars but suppose we were mifunes shoes wouldnt we be state trichotillomania caught between kants hypothetical imperatives whats it me his categorical imperatives whats right thing do someone brought that word trichotillomania my attention i just threw it hell it it means compulsion pull ones hair out id have had wait two or three more lifetimes such opportunity okay i dont suppose its necessary spell out what mifune decides he gulps eats it thats first third movie its not uninteresting but then pace picks up immediately miscreants are really clever manage outwit police during exchange money child but cops are no dopes either we get rather longish story their tracking criminal it reminded me less kind detective work we see kinds movies sometimes called noirs with humphrey bogart or clint eastwood trail than it did day jackal made with european cast crew maybe fritz langs m nice scenes aboard one famous bullet trains tempo drops bit when now busted mifune drops sight police begin trailing chief suspect theres lot slinking around sleazy juke joints junkie alleys at times i was little lost about just what was going i had wait police report bring me up date ending although dramatic enough was something let down too i was waiting malefactor turn out be mifunes estranged younger brother or something it had been pointed out more than once that motive was not just pecuniary but personal desire torment mifune instead though it was resolved as matter complex status envy with stranger other end i suppose though that thats what title is meant reflect difference between enormously wealthy druggies burn outs louche streets symbolism if thats what it is is realized concretely distinction between mifunes mansion high hill shabby apartment kidnapper below stifling heat industrial smog kurosawa admitted that he didnt provide many answers his movies but that same question seemed run through his work why cant people be happy he was good position ask since he evidently suffered major mood disorder,0.5205864944847995,0.16198009147161688,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Right up there with Kurasawa's best,"Not my favourite Akira Kurasawa film by all means, but for me definitely in the top 10 of his best films. Perhaps the final sequence is a little too safe, but it's not too much of a big problem compared to how good everything else is. Kurasawa's movies all have the advantage of being well made and directed, and High and Low is certainly no exception. The single-set scenery is both atmospheric and epic, and the cinematography is as ever exceptional. While Kurasawa's direction is one of his more subtle overall directorial jobs, it never undermines the riveting and tense feel of the always compelling story. The score is suitably haunting, and Toshiro Mifune's lead performance is very brooding.All in all, a superb film and one of Kurasawa's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",right up there with kurasawas best,not my favourite akira kurasawa film by all means but me definitely top 10 his best films perhaps final sequence is little too safe but its not too much big problem compared how good everything else is kurasawas movies all have advantage being well made directed high low is certainly no exception single set scenery is both atmospheric epic cinematography is as ever exceptional while kurasawas direction is one his more subtle overall directorial jobs it never undermines riveting tense feel always compelling story score is suitably haunting toshiro mifunes lead performance is very brooding all all superb film one kurasawas best 10 10 bethany cox,0.49274725274725284,0.30498626373626375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
