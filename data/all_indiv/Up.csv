10.0,Best animated movies ever made,"This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film.",best animated movies ever made,this film is possibly one best animated films all time as it tells emotional moving story while being funny as i said emotion this film is full heart even though i didnt cry it will make most people cry characters this are perfect even if it is small character like ellie or big character like carl everybody gets so much development even charles muntz villain film is also given development even more than some superhero films nowadays also this film has comedy some pixar films now just want make you cry but 2000s they had mix sad funny moments so overall this film is as close perfect as animated film can get it is has mix emotions it is funny sad when it needs be it has so much heart characters are perfect this film my opinion is best pixar film,0.6190476190476191,0.34523809523809523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.48, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10.0,"Imaginative, fun and moving - as close to perfect as Pixar has ever been","Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a ""bird"" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.10/10.",imaginative fun moving as close perfect as pixar has ever been,carl frederickson ed asner has lived long life but dreams adventuring south america he wants spend his remaining days his home but new high rises are being constructed around it after chance accident carl loses his home is set be taken into retirement home unhappy with this idea former balloon salesman ties thousands balloons his house simply floats away en route his dream adventure except he is not alone young wilderness explorer russell jordan nagai inadvertently shows up mid air carl sees no other choice but bring boy with him fact that this plot line is even relevant enough get made into movie is more than enough reason praise up ever since toy story pixar has consistently delivered most radically original unique ideas animated films live action films sure not all them are as amazing as others cars is quite simply stale compared likes ratatouille wall e but there is something brilliantly imaginative exciting going at studio up is no exception coming off breakthrough wall e i was not expecting same reaction up but i was more than just pleasantly surprised film is hilarious heartfelt moving depressing all at once this may sound like it is issue that film has problem holding its ground with its tonal structure but instead it handles it quite well splitting film into quadrants allowing themes plot line coincide with whatever emotional response filmmakers are going while there is plenty young children enjoy take film it is older audience that will get biggest reaction it there is lot going film but it never loses its speed never loses control what it wants say do it knows exactly where it wants be when where other recent pixar films have failed specifically their lengthy runtimes frequent need drag themselves out up does not it practically blasts its way through its beginning all way up its ending with time left spare what makes up work so well much like wall e before it is focus very few characters where wall e spent majority its runtime primarily earth with its main character love interest cockroach up spends its majority with carl russell bird named kevin talking dog named dug voiced by co director bob peterson it does allow more characters enter later but focus never strays these main characters some may say film is trying tell multiple stories but as film progresses it is clear it is telling one story tale man who never experienced what he wanted most film builds up carls backstory heavily startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive marketing film we know very first trailer that carl is fairly mean old man but film spends great deal time develop him into emotional wreck man but real success film is its imagination adventure while wall e is perhaps most startlingly unique original animated picture last decade up still manages pack lot uniqueness but while wall e got caught up its own environmentally sound message up sticks with being almost straight adventure picture it is frequently thrilling exciting lets up only few moments at time such older character film really stuns with some its fantastical ideas sure it is obvious this is film that could only ever be done as animated film but what it lacks realism it makes up fun something that has been sorely missing movies years it came back short while with first pirates caribbean film but focus as late any film has been deeply conflicted depressing narratives while this film is struck with having some most depressing scenes year has seen so far it never wallows sadness it throws moments at you then quickly moves as said previously tonal shifts work excellently ups favour but course animated movie cannot work without its animation while up is not breakthrough way other pixar films have been it keeps with tradition still looking stunning leading curve computer animated films it does look cartoony fantastical many instances but this only continues work towards it being even better locales are realistic looking dog fur is near perfect me watching carls facial hair gradually grow as story moves along was simply amazing little details minute perfections have always been key pixar films up is no different additionally 3d effects really add layer film bring movie life unlike other recent efforts like monsters vs aliens bolt i cannot praise up enough words cannot do justice how excellent film is pixar continues outdo itself year after year even with their subpar films while each film has their own flaws up revels being as close perfect as company has been years i adored every minute look forward watching it again with even bigger smile my face 10 10,0.49597459859364623,0.17448593073593074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,"In my personal opinion, this is Pixar's funniest and most poignant film","I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.First of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino's music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E's haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.I have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn't a dog talk? It's an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don't fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.And finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.Overall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox",my personal opinion this is pixars funniest most poignant film,i love pixar feel they have been pretty consistent true i do prefer toy story over cars finding nemo over ratatouille but i find their films amazingly animated thrilling i thought that after first two toy story films that pixar wouldnt be able make film top them wall e yes i loved it came pretty close but my opinion up is pixars masterwork why do i say that because it is widely imaginative astonishing its emotional range first all animation is stupendous beautiful backgrounds beautifully drawn characters stunning colours scenery sights are just fantastic down colour visual detail that went into film michael giacchinos music is stunning as well simple yet melodious sublime i do have concur with majority about opening montage finding nemo had some beautiful moments wall es haunting isolation moved me close tears but this opening montage was so poignant utterly heart breaking it is quite simply one most beautiful effective beginnings ever animated film i have heard complaints that story meanders when talking dogs are introduced that they were irritating can i respectfully disagree what i loved about up was how widely imaginative it was short why shouldnt dog talk its animated film why does it have completely realistic elephants dont fly look at what disney did with dumbo story back target was well written thrilling startling with sense adventure with enough action high flying escapism kids adults script had some truly hilarious surreal moments while toy story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue dialogue up made me laugh it made me cry finally characters i loved them all grumpy old widower carl stowaway russell eccentric adventurer charles muntz big bird hilarious doug russell may be tad annoying at first but he grows you voice acting is exceptional carl is voiced with real demeanour depth by ed asner christopher plummer wonderful underrated actor he is is superb as charles muntz but i do have give mention bob peterson he is simply brilliant as doug he is really funny when he needs be never overdoes it overall this is wonderful film there may be controversy over how beauty beast is no longer only animated film be nominated best picture beauty beast has been always will be my favourite animated film one my favourite films all time lion king is very close second but up is great film does deserve award some kind 10 10 bethany cox,0.648669026169026,0.3417267267267267,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.25}"
9.0,It's Just a House,"Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.I am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along. You will be entertained, delighted and moved.",its just house,greetings again darkness another crackling collaboration pixar disney as expected it is touching funny thrilling amazing look at watch only step below toy story just because it is not quite as ground breaking though story is even better while i love technology effects i am first foremost story guy when it comes movies this has as good story as any film you will see my only caution is that it seems geared towards grown ups not kids montage carl ellie growing old together is without dialogue will probably bore some kids their parents certainly wont be bored however as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasnt taken time chase their childhood dreams no question this film is barrage color eccentric characters can even be bit frightening at times still key this one are stories quests elderly mr fredrickson young russell trying earn his badge honor beginning disney has always had finger pulse youngsters here we arent given usual hollywood garbage brainiac kids who make adults look stupid instead we are given pudgy slightly goofy kid just trying get his parents take note special kudos ed asner bringing mr fredrickson life good times bad he never goes overboard is quite often absolutely perfect christopher plummer has limited role as bad guy charles muntz or is he really so bad cast aside by society he has spent his life searching redemption i am not saying kids wont enjoy but i am saying make sure parents grandparents tag along you will be entertained delighted moved,0.6443510737628385,0.11617647058823533,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Real tear jerker opening,"Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) as a young quiet kid idolized explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his discovery of Paradise Falls. Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.The first part of this movie is a real tear jerker. When Carl and Ellie's lives flash through the years, all the heart breaks and all the love just jump off the screen. Then there is comedy as the journey to Paradise Falls starts. The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar.",real tear jerker opening,carl fredricksen ed asner as young quiet kid idolized explorer charles muntz christopher plummer his discovery paradise falls ellie is much more animated also great fan muntz together they would marry live their lives together until day she dies now carl is hounded by property developer forced go retirement home instead he ties sea helium balloons his home float away paradise falls wilderness explorer scout russell whos trying get assisting elderly badge gets dragged along adventure first part this movie is real tear jerker when carl ellies lives flash through years all heart breaks all love just jump off screen then there is comedy as journey paradise falls starts movie gets very surreal with dog translators very colorful bird villain is bit too villainy story gets too serious at times but it ends almost as emotionally as it starts it is one best pixar,0.4902222222222222,0.2512020202020202,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"Up ""uped"" the bar once again! Wonderful movie","Seriously, I'm convinced, Pixar is maybe the only movie studio that is providing the best movies around. Who said that animated films can't be considered real movies? Can't be considered an art form? Up is the latest creation from Disney and Pixar, after last year's smash hit WALL-E, I felt like they couldn't at all top themselves and they did it again with this incredibly charming story. Admittingly from the trailer, I wasn't sure this story was going to work as well, but I got the opportunity to see Up this week and was just totally blown away by it's story, animation and characters. The thing I adore about these movies that Disney and Pixar are creating is that they're not just for the kids, but the adults as well, this is something that I could even see an adult seeing by themselves. This story doesn't insult kid's intelligence and is extremely entertaining for anyone to enjoy, to go through this adventure with an old man who just wanted to make his wife happy.Carl Fredricksen, a quiet young boy, meets Ellie in her clubhouse, discovering together they share the same interest in exploration as their hero, famed explorer Charles F. Muntz. Ellie expresses her desire to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America, a promise she makes Carl keep. Carl and Ellie fall in love, wed and grow old together in the old house where they first met. Ellie dies of old age before they can take their trip, leaving Carl living alone in their home. After a tussle with a construction worker over Carl's broken mailbox, the court orders Carl to move into a retirement home. Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and creates a makeshift airship using thousands of helium balloons which lift his house off its foundation. Russell, a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a snipe hunt by Carl the day before. After a storm throws them around for a while, they find themselves across a large ravine facing Paradise Falls. With their body weight providing ballast allowing Carl and Russell to pull the floating house, the two begin to walk around the ravine. As they walk towards Paradise Falls, Russell finds a colorful tropical bird which he names Kevin, not realizing that the bird is actually female. They later run into a dog with a translating collar named Dug. They discover Dug's owner is Charles Muntz, who has remained in South America for several decades to find a bird like Kevin in order to restore his reputation after bringing back a skeleton and being called a fraud. Though Carl is initially thrilled to meet his hero, when he realizes that Muntz is after Kevin and will kill to obtain her, Carl takes steps to save the bird and escape from Muntz.Up is seriously the best movie I have seen so far this year, it's actually one of my favorite movies of all time, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this film. Wither it was the fun and charming story between Carl and Russell, the crazy bird Kevin, or the story that nearly killed me in laughter, the dogs that have collars that make them talk. I don't remember the last time a movie that made me laugh so hard that my stomach hurt, it also made me tear up and smile. If someone ever tells you that an animated film can't be considered a real movie, just show them Up. I absolutely adore this movie, can't wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it again. This is a perfect family film, actually scratch that, it's a perfect film, the animation is incredible, the characters are lovable and the story is magical. Up is going to be a film to be remembered for all time, great movie, go see it.10/10",up uped bar once again wonderful movie,seriously im convinced pixar is maybe only movie studio that is providing best movies around who said that animated films cant be considered real movies cant be considered art form up is latest creation disney pixar after last years smash hit wall e i felt like they couldnt at all top themselves they did it again with this incredibly charming story admittingly trailer i wasnt sure this story was going work as well but i got opportunity see up this week was just totally blown away by its story animation characters thing i adore about these movies that disney pixar are creating is that theyre not just kids but adults as well this is something that i could even see adult seeing by themselves this story doesnt insult kids intelligence is extremely entertaining anyone enjoy go through this adventure with old man who just wanted make his wife happy carl fredricksen quiet young boy meets ellie her clubhouse discovering together they share same interest exploration as their hero famed explorer charles f muntz ellie expresses her desire move her clubhouse paradise falls south america promise she makes carl keep carl ellie fall love wed grow old together old house where they first met ellie dies old age before they can take their trip leaving carl living alone their home after tussle with construction worker over carls broken mailbox court orders carl move into retirement home carl comes up with scheme keep his promise ellie creates makeshift airship using thousands helium balloons which lift his house off its foundation russell wilderness explorer trying earn his assisting elderly badge has stowed away porch after being sent snipe hunt by carl day before after storm throws them around while they find themselves across large ravine facing paradise falls with their body weight providing ballast allowing carl russell pull floating house two begin walk around ravine as they walk towards paradise falls russell finds colorful tropical bird which he names kevin not realizing that bird is actually female they later run into dog with translating collar named dug they discover dugs owner is charles muntz who has remained south america several decades find bird like kevin order restore his reputation after bringing back skeleton being called fraud though carl is initially thrilled meet his hero when he realizes that muntz is after kevin will kill obtain her carl takes steps save bird escape muntz up is seriously best movie i have seen so far this year its actually one my favorite movies all time i cant tell you how much i enjoyed this film wither it was fun charming story between carl russell crazy bird kevin or story that nearly killed me laughter dogs that have collars that make them talk i dont remember last time movie that made me laugh so hard that my stomach hurt it also made me tear up smile if someone ever tells you that animated film cant be considered real movie just show them up i absolutely adore this movie cant wait it come out dvd watch it again this is perfect family film actually scratch that its perfect film animation is incredible characters are lovable story is magical up is going be film be remembered all time great movie go see it 10 10,0.500323339212228,0.2877645502645503,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,Another Feast For The Eyes,"This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork. Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong.

,"Brilliant, another Pixar home run","If there's a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It'd be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I'd place it among so much stellar work.Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you're looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it's the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There's an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don't feel gives anything away. It's pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn't make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you're reminded of it, but I suppose it's up to one's own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don't really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that's just simply unprecedented. I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn't really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you're better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn't take away from Up mind you, it just didn't add to it either. Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It's pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we're entitled to the entertainment. It's nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don't know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together.

10.0,Drag me to heaven,"UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.The one clue I can give away – because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise – is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting – perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that – at least in the audience I was in – when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie – particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action – nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle ""Bambi,"" this film should be a breeze.",drag me heaven,up pixars latest animated feature is just delightful but how do you go about extolling movies virtues without giving away its surprises like kid at beginning movie you dont try conquer immovable force you work around it one clue i can give away because its movies heavily hyped premise is that carl fredrickson gruffy old widower voiced with gruffy old charm by ed asner miraculously inflates enough balloons use his house as aircraft soon he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with short attention spanned kid named russell ill also mention couple other items that can gauge your potential interest movie one is gag that is take off famous painting perhaps too inside inside joke but typical pixars cheery attempts appeal viewers all ages also part plot involves carls long held wish meet lindbergh type adventurer named charles muntz christopher plummer this is another joke thats even vaguer than first one cartoon historians know that walt disney started cartoon biz by creating oswald rabbit producer charles mintz who then greedily stole rights disneys creation this gives you pretty good idea where ostensible hero muntz stands scheme things beyond that i can only offer you some enticing clues about characters theres dog whos leader his pack menacing beyond measure until he opens his mouth gets one movies biggest laughs theres huge awkward bird that is big laugh getter at first then she becomes real enough character that at least audience i was when shes injured she elicits screams fright worthy bambis late mother theres surprising heartfelt emotion vivid imagery you can almost touch landscapes skies music score by michael giacchino thats practically character movie particularly thoughtful montage that takes carl childhood widowhood there arent many or at least not enough live action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon pixar studios has gotten be one those movie icons that shouldnt even have deliver premise get funded anymore moneymen should just shut up hand over money trust theyll get product that will appeal everyone up is only second pixar feature get pg rating only mildly intense imagery action nothing off color least again if you can handle bambi this film should be breeze,0.6002777777777778,0.09562289562289562,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,Lighten Up with UP! It's up there as one of the best animation movies of all-time!,"What's up? Up is up! It was very successful movie! It even was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. It was the second animation film to do that. Directed by Pete Docter, Up is Pixar's tenth film in their series and their first full-length 3-D film. The film tells the story of an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Voiced by Edward Asner) whom trying to fulfill his late wife's dream by taking their house to South America. The only problem is, that an earnest Boy Scout named Russell (Voiced by Jordan Nagai) has tagged along, making the simple trip, so much, more complex. Can Carl make it to South America or will his late wife's dreams be shattered? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The movie is gorgeous and colorful. Sadly, the 3D isn't worth it, but it's still, beautiful to the eyes. I love the amazing music by Michael Giacchino. I just wish, the tune sound more South or Latin American, than European, because it would make more sense. The movie is unsurprisingly well action part. Great pacing. The film is also well-acted. Everybody did their parts, very well. Edward Asner was a great choice as Mr. Fredricksen. I love his grumpiness in his voice. The use of mostly grunts, make it seem, like his responses come from a protective stance, rather than his own grouchy nature. Jordan Nagai as Russell is just as likable. He has the most lines, in the film, and none of it, sounds too annoying. I guess, there was something, sweet about his voice. You really do hear it, whenever, Russell speaks. I love that the actor wasn't even trying to get cast for the role, but end up, getting it, over his brother who was. It show, how charming, his voice is. The supporting cast's voice acting is just as memorable. Christopher Plummer as the villain, Charles Muntz, the explorer was fun to listen to. Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog, was pretty amazing. His voice in this, remind me so much of veteran voice actor, Dom DeLuise. I also love the cameo from Pixar's own favorite actor, John Ratzenberger in his minor role. As much as I love the voice acting; I really love, how the cartoon characters appear in this film. I like how, they have more child-like appealing cartoony look. The whole over the top celebrity caricatured facial appearances kinda works, because the older computer model for humans, used in Toy Story 1&2 are just way too bland-looking and unappeased. It has that creepy uncanny valley look to it. Anyways, I think, the new model gives the movie, the amount of surrealism to make the plot to work. I really doubt, the film could work, with more realistic facial appearances, because how bizarre, the premise is. While, the appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. I like his short square status, and cartoony facial expressions. It makes Carl stand out. Unlike some critics, I also love, how Russell look. He doesn't look, like a kid with Down syndrome. He looks like a normal kid. I think, they were a little too harsh in their judgment. I also love the fact, that Russell is clearly Asian American, but his character lack the typical Asian over-stereotyping. Surprising, it makes the character, so much, more appealing, because it's not stepping over to over-used racial clichés. Charles F. Muntz really looks like, an old explorer, but his character's looks was a bit jarring. I really had a hard time, believing, that he's that well maintain, at his age, when he spent, most of the film, living for so long, outside of civilization. In my opinion, he should have, look, a little more broken-down. Last is Dug. He's a very realistic looking golden retriever. I own one, and they got it exactly right. I like how he closes his mouth and freezes when he notices a squirrel. Funny moment right there. For the story, it's both a hit and miss. I love that the film deals with more adult like drama, than childish antics. Having Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife, gave the movie, so much depth. It was really needed. However, besides the awesome and unexpected genuine tearjerker opening marriage montage, the film goes into another direction, with its absurdity. It's really off the wall, crazy and convenient, that Carl able to travel to South America in the way, he's traveling. The movie takes great artistic license, when it comes to engineering and physics. You have to really, be willing to suspension your disbelief from the rest of the entire film. Especially, when Russell was designed to be the child that Carl and his wife were unable to have, in both a figurative and literal spirit. Another thing, I didn't get about the plot, is how Charles Muntz can be, easily discredited. Clearly, the amount of what he found, in his short life, would give, his statements about the exotic bird, some credit. Clearly, much of the unexplainable questions in the plot, could be solve in the Carl is crazy theory that certain people has latch on. In theory, Carl didn't travel to South America, instead the Balloons are metaphors, reflecting Carl's happy and uplifting memories of his wife. Hints, why he was stubbornly clinging to them and refuses to let go, as if he's afraid he's going to fall. It wasn't until he did, was he able to live life, once more. Other people have notice, some themes similarity in the plot to John Milton's great poems Paradise Lost, Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm by Jerdine Nolen, and most of all, several really obvious references to Studio Ghibli. Overall: It deserve its good praise. A must-watch. Things can only go up from here.",lighten up with up its up there as one best animation movies all time,whats up up is up it was very successful movie it even was nominated best picture by academy

I really don't want to get into specifics because of spoilers but the movie literally has everything.Amazing visual effects.Amazing sound.Hilarious comedy.Breath taking action.Heart.All those combined equal something special.

,Pixar do it again! Up soars to new heights!,"Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted 'talking' dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.This isn't slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.Visually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can't help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.I have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.Anyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.Up is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!",pixar do it again up soars new heights,viewed at festival de cannes 2009 opening film this years festival first animated film ever have this honour up is truly film all ages story adventures old man young boy flying house tethered countless balloons long lost mad explorer giant bird called kevin assorted talking dogs gets funnier more exciting as it goes along this isnt slapstick humour although there are some lovely visual gags but deeper more thoughtful at times up is even touching poignant visually this is treat while i was sceptical about use 3d begin with it is built into story so seamlessly that it really is worth effort seek it out at same time i cant help feeling 2d version could be even better because 3d glasses had effect dimming picture use colour film is especially noteworthy with various palettes used according mood character phase story character voicing music are also spot i have no connection with pixar disney or film whatsoever even if this review reads like puff piece fact is up is incredible piece cinema was big hit with very demanding press audience is worthy your time money anyone who says animated films cannot amuse entertain while at same time delivering any kind emotion does not know what they are talking about up is so good i can now forgive pixar cars,0.48626262626262623,0.20815656565656565,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A delight...plus it's in 3-D!!,"As I am much more hesitant to give a movie a score of 10 than most reviewers, take my score of 9 as a ringing endorsement for this sweet CGI film from Pixar. In addition, the film is the first 3-D film by the studio and it looked lovely.The film begins with a sweet but VERY emotionally draining prologue. You see Carl Fredricksen as a very young boy along with his first two loves--the adventures of the explorer, Charles Muntz, and his meeting and falling in love with Ellie. All this is done with a minimum of dialog and it is one of the sweetest segments I've seen in years--and is a first for something this deep and emotional from a computer generated film. Keep a few Kleenex nearby--you'll likely need it.Then, the film jumps ahead to the present day. Carl is now elderly and alone. His life is quite sad and he dwells on the recent loss of Ellie. Fortunately, the film doesn't dwell on this too long or become maudlin--though it did come a bit close at times. Now, with nothing in his life other than memories AND the court pushing him into a retirement home against his will, Carl comes up with a crazy plan--to float his home away with a bazillion balloons and take it to South America!! Unfortunately, while the plan works, Carl also gets an unwelcome passenger (Russell). Now Russell is an absolutely adorable character--wonderfully rendered and with a fittingly cute voice. You cannot help but love him. But, since Carl is alone and childless and grumpy, he is less than enthralled with this hitchhiker.Eventually, they arrive in South America and meet some new friends--a bizarre giant bird and Dug, the dog. But, being a family film, you KNOW that there must be some villain and sure enough, along comes a very, very, very elderly Muntz who seems a tad...""touched"". This sets off some very hair-raising adventures and you'll just need to tune it to see what happens next.Technically speaking, this film was incredible and shows that the same old software is NOT being used but a newer generation with greater clarity and richness. I loved how through the course of the film, for instance, Carl's beard stubble starts to slowly grow in as well as the lovely shading and colors. While I loved RATATOUILLE and WALL-E for their animation, this looked a lot better--plus came in 3-D. I just saw Dreamworks' latest film the week before (MONSTERS VS. ALIENS) and frankly UP looked immensely better--there was just no comparison.As for the story, it was highly imaginative and strange--in a good way. I can only think of one other film that is like UP at all, and that is the wonderful French live action film, LE PAPILLON. It, too, is about an elderly single man who has an adorable child dumped in his lap and like UP, by the end of the film the old man has essentially been adopted by the kid. Both are rather predictable in that sense, but both also make it work due to brilliant writing, adorable kids and plot elements that are very unique and magical. Heck, in UP, the many dogs in the film can talk AND are excellent chefs--where have you ever seen that before?! Overall, it's a great film for almost all ages. I did notice in the theater that one kid (about 4) got very, very, very upset when the cute bird was captured--and he screamed and cried for some time. Keep this in mind if you do take young kids to see it--it may elicit come tears though there is no dirty language and the violence is mostly mild. For Pixar, this is among their best.",delight plus its 3 d,as i am much more hesitant give movie score 10 than most reviewers take my score 9 as ringing endorsement this sweet cgi film pixar addition film is first 3 d film by studio it looked lovely film begins with sweet but very emotionally draining prologue you see carl fredricksen as very young boy along with his first two loves adventures explorer charles muntz his meeting falling love with ellie all this is done with minimum dialog it is one sweetest segments ive seen years is first something this deep emotional computer generated film keep few kleenex nearby youll likely need it then film jumps ahead present day carl is now elderly alone his life is quite sad he dwells recent loss ellie fortunately film doesnt dwell this too long or become maudlin though it did come bit close at times now with nothing his life other than memories court pushing him into retirement home against his will carl comes up with crazy plan float his home away with bazillion balloons take it south america unfortunately while plan works carl also gets unwelcome passenger russell now russell is absolutely adorable character wonderfully rendered with fittingly cute voice you cannot help but love him but since carl is alone childless grumpy he is less than enthralled with this hitchhiker eventually they arrive south america meet some new friends bizarre giant bird dug dog but being family film you know that there must be some villain sure enough along comes very very very elderly muntz who seems tad touched this sets off some very hair raising adventures youll just need tune it see what happens next technically speaking this film was incredible shows that same old software is not being used but newer generation with greater clarity richness i loved how through course film instance carls beard stubble starts slowly grow as well as lovely shading colors while i loved ratatouille wall e their animation this looked lot better plus came 3 d i just saw dreamworks latest film week before monsters vs aliens frankly up looked immensely better there was just no comparison as story it was highly imaginative strange good way i can only think one other film that is like up at all that is wonderful french live action film le papillon it too is about elderly single man who has adorable child dumped his lap like up by end film old man has essentially been adopted by kid both are rather predictable that sense but both also make it work due brilliant writing adorable kids plot elements that are very unique magical heck up many dogs film can talk are excellent chefs where have you ever seen that before overall its great film almost all ages i did notice theater that one kid about 4 got very very very upset when cute bird was captured he screamed cried some time keep this mind if you do take young kids see it it may elicit come tears though there is no dirty language violence is mostly mild pixar this is among their best,0.5677842431738535,0.2620839658177321,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9.0,One of the finest films I've ever seen,"If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film. Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest, anything else from this year - to reach the level of quality of this year's first animated film, Coraline (which, along with last year's Bolt and Wall-E, became one of my favorite films of all time). Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.Easily the most emotionally impactful portion of the entire film, the first ten to fifteen minutes of Up are nothing short of beautiful. Using little to no dialogue, the opening ""montage"" of this film tells the story of Carl and his wife Ellie, and the wonderful life that they share together. Carl is such a lovable character, that you feel for him from the very beginning. Without trying to come off as cliché or anything, you feel the joy that he feels, and when his wife passes away, you feel his loss. By the end of the whole sequence, I was in tears.This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor. Dug the dog (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson) is especially hilarious every single time that he ""opens his mouth"", and yet still proves to be a key part of this emotional roller coaster ride. The movie also does a terrific job at making you feel a sense of wonder, and you just buy into the adventure of these two characters. Finally, I want to give a special nod to Christopher Plummer as the famous wilderness explorer, Charles Muntz, who is easily my favorite Pixar villain.I love Up. Go see it now, as my review just can't do it justice. Not only is it extremely entertaining, but also gut-bustingly hilarious, and beautifully told throughout. To quote John Campea of TheMovieBlog.com, ""The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that it ended."" The result is a film that's on par with Wall-E and The Incredibles as my favorite Pixar movie to date (which, again, is saying a hell of a lot, considering that they're two of my top 10 favorite films of all time) and while it may take a couple more viewings to say for certain, I have no qualms with saying that Up is one of the finest films I've ever seen.",one finest films ive ever seen,if pixar as studio has any weakness its that they have no idea how make bad film again again they release entertaining movies with not only terrific sense humor but level storytelling that has set standard todays films animated or otherwise while i was obviously extremely excited see up never did i expect it or be honest anything else this year reach level quality this years first animated film coraline which along with last years bolt wall e became one my favorite films all time well i have say that i was pleasantly surprised simply put up is perfect movie easily most emotionally impactful portion entire film first ten fifteen minutes up are nothing short beautiful using little no dialogue opening montage this film tells story carl his wife ellie wonderful life that they share together carl is such lovable character that you feel him very beginning without trying come off as clich or anything you feel joy that he feels when his wife passes away you feel his loss by end whole sequence i was tears this movie is freakin hilarious without doubt funniest film that pixar has ever made each every character up provides their own bit humor dug dog voiced by co director bob peterson is especially hilarious every single time that he opens his mouth yet still proves be key part this emotional roller coaster ride movie also does terrific job at making you feel sense wonder you just buy into adventure these two characters finally i want give special nod christopher plummer as famous wilderness explorer charles muntz who is easily my favorite pixar villain i love up go see it now as my review just cant do it justice not only is it extremely entertaining but also gut bustingly hilarious beautifully told throughout quote john campea themovieblog com only negative thing i have say about this movie is that it ended result is film thats par with wall e incredibles as my favorite pixar movie date which again is saying hell lot considering that theyre two my top 10 favorite films all time while it may take couple more viewings say certain i have no qualms with saying that up is one finest films ive ever seen,0.6703781512605043,0.28799019607843135,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Pixar launches their funniest film out of their tank to date.,"What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.The movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.Just brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of ""robot"" dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.Up is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10.",pixar launches their funniest film out their tank date,what can i say about pixar amazing perfect got see this at cannes film festival france went trip with my family pixar gives us another instant classic up movie focuses 78 year old man carl fredricksons voiced by edward asner life who always had dream going journey south american see wilds it he buys thousands balloons just attach it his house float up sky so he starts with his journey up sky his house with balloons attached it suddenly hes not alone somebodys at door while flying its boy scout kid named russell he invites boy with him his journey south america just brilliant simple story telling beautiful visuals as usual with pixar awesome voice work funny smart dialogue beautiful score once again by michael giacchino very very enjoyable characters speaking characters highlight film dug dog sort robot dog that will have you have you lot stitches each scene that dog is that was case with me simply one funniest characters pixar ever made pete doctor one four pixar directors john lassester andrew stanton brad bird who directed monsters inc 2001 needs should get nominated his clever genius smart directing this but if stanton didnt get nods finding nemo wall e bird incredibles ratatouille which they should been then oscars are making another huge mistake not nominating this guy this movie up is funniest pixar movie funnier than toy story movies bugs life finding nemo which were funniest my opinion movie is not just hilarious its emotional sad at times like wall e it focuses character feelings but not as magical as wall e still up is full emotional fun hilarious proportions your big ride this 10 10,0.6671264367816092,0.3021346469622332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,"Pixar hits it out of the park, again","I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special pre-release screening of Up at Pixar studios in Emeryville, organized by the San Francisco Film Society. After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar's new high water mark, Up.My favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl's life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no ""new"" technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.As the associate producer who participated in the Q&A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they'll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar's commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here.

8.0,Pixar soars again,"""Up"" is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on ""Monsters Inc"", a writer on ""Toy Story"" and a co-writer and director on ""Wall*E."" Peterson was a writer on ""Finding Nemo"". Both know the guidelines for success and while ""Up"" doesn't reach the heights of say a ""Wall*E"" or a ""Toy Story"", it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.This one is about Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), a 78-year old retired balloon salesman living alone in a house full of old memories. Carl and his wife Ellie met each other as young children, both enamored by the newsreels about adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They eventually married and planned on seeing the world together, especially Paradise Falls in South America, but life kept getting in the way and before he knew it, Ellie died.As the world changes, Carl refuses to change with it. When developers threaten to move him out of his house and into a retirement home, the old codger rigs his house up with thousands of balloons and before you can say ""way to go Carl"", he floats away, determined to have the adventure he and his wife never had. He doesn't plan on taking 8-year old chubby wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) with him or crash landing on the other side of Paradise Falls, or finding an exotic female snipe (that Russell names Kevin) or a group of talking dogs (one named Dug befriends them) tracking down the bird for Muntz, who it turns out is a sinister villain, but things kinda turn out that way.You're grabbed instantly. The adorable opening montage of the Carl and Ellie love story is more endearing and moving in its dialogue-less 10-minute entirety than any other romance this year by a long shot. This is another Pixar flick that goes in a daring direction. We next see Carl as a heartbreaking old man, his wife dead and the world no longer needing him. You forgive him his bitterness and you love him for the sentimental streak he has towards the things he and his wife shared together. His crabbiness is a little funny but there are also some heavy scenes early on as well. It sets up a beautiful, multi-layered story about enduring love and learning to live life without limits.When a thrilling rainstorm crashes Carl and Russell on the other side of Paradise Falls, the two must each harness themselves to the house floating above them. The characters each look terrific and share a good chemistry. Russell is the usual 8-year old kid, talkative, inquisitive, and annoyingly overeager. He is a good comic foil to crabby Carl, his big, rosey smile and plump round stature a counter to the stout, frowningly square-faced Carl. As the two spend more time together, a wonderfully written friendship develops.The movie is full of visual gags and the talking dog-henchmen are great fun. Muntz, an adventurer who travels around the world in a big blimp, offers a menacingly evil villain to chase Carl and Russell through rough mountainous terrain before the exciting final house vs. blimp in-air showdown. Plus the movie looks fantastic, a lush array of candy color and grand scenery. And the vocal cast, from Edward Asner to Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai each deftly voice their roles. ""Up"" is one of the year's rare treasures, a movie that flies in every way possible and from Pixar, you shouldn't expect anything less.",pixar soars again,up is winner i couldnt be less surprised anyone still putting limit how new inventive they think pixar film can be deserves have their socks blown off rest us just buy ticket expect be taken away this new flick is work writers directors pete docter bob peterson two guys who have each been around making pixar flicks before docter was director monsters inc writer toy story co writer director wall e peterson was writer finding nemo both know guidelines success while up doesnt reach heights say wall e or toy story its still fantastic movie because well i dont think people pixar hires know how make anything other than fantastic movies this one is about carl fredericksen edward asner 78 year old retired balloon salesman living alone house full old memories carl his wife ellie met each other as young children both enamored by newsreels about adventurer charles muntz christopher plummer they eventually married planned seeing world together especially paradise falls south america but life kept getting way before he knew it ellie died as world changes carl refuses change with it when developers threaten move him out his house into retirement home old codger rigs his house up with thousands balloons before you can say way go carl he floats away determined have adventure he his wife never had he doesnt plan taking 8 year old chubby wilderness explorer russell jordan nagai with him or crash landing other side paradise falls or finding exotic female snipe that russell names kevin or group talking dogs one named dug befriends them tracking down bird muntz who it turns out is sinister villain but things kinda turn out that way youre grabbed instantly adorable opening montage carl ellie love story is more endearing moving its dialogue less 10 minute entirety than any other romance this year by long shot this is another pixar flick that goes daring direction we next see carl as heartbreaking old man his wife dead world no longer needing him you forgive him his bitterness you love him sentimental streak he has towards things he his wife shared together his crabbiness is little funny but there are also some heavy scenes early as well it sets up beautiful multi layered story about enduring love learning live life without limits when thrilling rainstorm crashes carl russell other side paradise falls two must each harness themselves house floating above them characters each look terrific share good chemistry russell is usual 8 year old kid talkative inquisitive annoyingly overeager he is good comic foil crabby carl his big rosey smile plump round stature counter stout frowningly square faced carl as two spend more time together wonderfully written friendship develops movie is full visual gags talking dog henchmen are great fun muntz adventurer who travels around world big blimp offers menacingly evil villain chase carl russell through rough mountainous terrain before exciting final house vs blimp air showdown plus movie looks fantastic lush array candy color grand scenery vocal cast edward asner christopher plummer jordan nagai each deftly voice their roles up is one years rare treasures movie that flies every way possible pixar you shouldnt expect anything less,0.5241844116844117,0.1424464236964237,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"

9.0,A Surrealistic Adventure Full of Sentiments,"The boy Carl Fredrickson is a dreamer that idolizes the adventurer Charles Munts. When he meets the girl Ellie, who also worships Munts, they become close friends. However Charles Munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of Paradise Falls, and he travels in his blimp to South America to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. Carl and Ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to Paradise Falls and build a house there. Many years later, Ellie dies and the lonely Carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. When Carls hits one worker that damaged his box-mail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. However, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to Paradise Falls. While floating, he finds that the boy Russell, who is in the Wilderness Explorer Training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. They travel together to South America where Russell finds a weird bird that he names Kevin and the talking dog Doug. Then they meet the insane villain Charles Munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch Kevin with his talking dogs. But Carl and Russell decide to protect Kevin and they have the adventure of their lives. ""Up"" is a surrealistic adventure full of sentiments, where the heroes are an old widower and an annoying fat boy. The first point that impresses is how touching this story is with the dramatic situation of the elder Carl after losing his beloved Ellie, lonely and forgotten by the world that is changing. I slightly recalled the situation of Walt Kowalski, performed by Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"". The annoying Russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with Kevin and the talking dog Doug. There are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. Further, it is also impressive how Disney and Pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like ""Wall-e"" or ""The Incredibles"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Up – Altas Aventuras"" (""Up – High Adventures"")",surrealistic adventure full sentiments,boy carl fredrickson is dreamer that idolizes adventurer charles munts when he meets girl ellie who also worships munts they become close friends however charles munts falls disgrace accused forging skeleton monster paradise falls he travels his blimp south america bring monster alive he is never seen again carl ellie get married they promise each other travel together paradise falls build house there many years later ellie dies lonely carl refuses move their house despite offers owner construction company when carls hits one worker that damaged his box mail he is sentenced move retirement home however he uses many balloons float his house travel paradise falls while floating he finds that boy russell who is wilderness explorer training trying get his assisting elderly badge be promoted senior is stowaway board they travel together south america where russell finds weird bird that he names kevin talking dog doug then they meet insane villain charles munts that spent his life forest trying catch kevin with his talking dogs but carl russell decide protect kevin they have adventure their lives up is surrealistic adventure full sentiments where heroes are old widower annoying fat boy first point that impresses is how touching this story is with dramatic situation elder carl after losing his beloved ellie lonely forgotten by world that is changing i slightly recalled situation walt kowalski performed by clint eastwood gran torino annoying russell is responsible most funniest sequences especially those with kevin talking dog doug there are many details layers this beautifully sad tale further it is also impressive how disney pixar succeed releasing one excellent movie after another like wall e or incredibles my vote is nine title brazil up altas aventuras up high adventures,0.5746774193548386,0.0785483870967742,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,"Up-lifting, Up-standing, Up-pealing, and quite simply - brilliant!","Sadly, there aren't enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how I've long been adverse to ""kids movies"", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's The Incredibles and 2008's WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.If you're thinking this isn't the usual stuff you see in ""kids movies"" you're right. But all credit is due to Pixar and the directorial and writing team of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for realizing that children aren't idiots, and can handle complex, often tragic stories, if conveyed in the proper manner. It's a refreshing change from the over-protective mentality that once saw all hints of violence edited out of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.In Up, characters bleed, there's implied murder, and it's all counter-balanced with some of the most delightfully twisted humor that's as inspired as anything the Zucker brothers ever came up with. The story literally had me careening from being misty-eyed to laughing heartily, frequently in the span of minutes.Faced with forced relocation to a retirement home, Carl opts for one final gambit, to fly his house down to Paradise Falls with the aid of a multitude of helium-filled balloons affixed to the roof of his house. Along for the ride is Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Scout seeking to add a merit badge to his collection. Eventually the duo are complimented by Dug (voiced by co-director and writer Bob Peterson) a dopey derelict dog equipped by the now aged Muntz with a translator collar that converts dog thoughts to English.Like WALL-E, Up manages to imbue its characters with depth and humanity, while at the same time tell a story that is mature, delightful, and most of all, terrifically funny. In an era when Hollywood seems only capable of re-boots and do-overs, Up is not merely a refreshing stroke of original brilliance, it is likely the best movie you will see all year.... or until Pixar emerges with their next effort.",up lifting up standing up pealing quite simply brilliant,sadly there arent enough superlatives english language with which laud up latest offering folks at disney pixar this is quite simply best movie any genre emerge thus far this year no small praise considering how ive long been adverse kids movies pegging them as being shallow vapid simplistic personal preconception which pixar mercifully shattered with 2004s incredibles 2008s wall e which proved beyond shadow doubt that all their acclaim as animation studio they are equally brilliant story tellers up tells story carl fredricksen voiced by ed asner who as child meets ellie later become love his life carl ellie find they share common dream one day visit paradise falls mysterious tropical oasis south america made famous vintage newsreels chronicling exploits explorer adventurer charles muntz christopher plummer life however manages get way as two grow up get married experience pain miscarriage eventually grow old so much so that father time catches up ellie leaving carl widower all this is conveyed with little dialog masterful sequence that had audience old young alike sniffling throughout if youre thinking this isnt usual stuff you see kids movies youre right but all credit is due pixar directorial writing team pete docter bob peterson realizing that children arent idiots can handle complex often tragic stories if conveyed proper manner its refreshing change over protective mentality that once saw all hints violence edited out warner bros looney tunes cartoons up characters bleed theres implied murder its all counter balanced with some most delightfully twisted humor thats as inspired as anything zucker brothers ever came up with story literally had me careening being misty eyed laughing heartily frequently span minutes faced with forced relocation retirement home carl opts one final gambit fly his house down paradise falls with aid multitude helium filled balloons affixed roof his house along ride is russell jordan nagai wilderness scout seeking add merit badge his collection eventually duo are complimented by dug voiced by co director writer bob peterson dopey derelict dog equipped by now aged muntz with translator collar that converts dog thoughts english like wall e up manages imbue its characters with depth humanity while at same time tell story that is mature delightful most all terrifically funny era when hollywood seems only capable re boots do overs up is not merely refreshing stroke original brilliance it is likely best movie you will see all year or until pixar emerges with their next effort,0.550439342403628,0.11757723922902495,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,Falls,"Pixar has its first truly Disney project. It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to ""read"" the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual. I think that may have also to do with Disney strategies for dealing with technology threats.The child here is Asian.

10.0,"as they say, Pixar hits it out of the park again!","Some, and you know who you are if you're reading this, may come across the IMDb page for Pixar's Up (and no, it's not Up! with an exclamation point, as that belongs to the 1976 Russ Meyer X-rated flick), and turn your nose up at it as just another Disney and/or Pixar kids flick. ""An old man with balloons tied to his house flying around with an annoying kid, not enough ""art"" for my taste"" (or something similar to that if not as snobbish). I want to relay an example for you that may get you excited: this is for Pixar a riff on Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. You might remember that crazy little movie where Klaus Kinski, a dreamer obsessed with opera, decides he has to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle, so in order to accomplish this he has to drag his big freighter-ship across a mountain to the other side. It is a leap of faith, but we take it because it's led by a filmmaker with a compelling sense of telling a story with an equally compelling protagonist. Balloons tied to a house, ship across a mountain, not much difference if you ask me, just the degree of the ambition.But it's not enough to compare it to Herzog, or even really try to. Pixar's Up, directed by Pete Doctor, is original in its intent to make a serious adventure movie that starts off as something quite mature, makes it big leap to kids, and then straddles that line like that guy who crossed the twin towers on the tightrope in the 70s. Take your adjective, this is beautiful, audacious, heartbreaking, heartrending, sublime, hilarious, surreal, inventive film-making, and it doesn't talk down to any age group in its story of an old man, Carl Frederickson, who fulfills his and his late-wife's dream of having a house on a hilltop called Paradise Falls that their favorite explorer as kids flew to in South America. If you're a kid you'll not get any tasteless jokes (there's one poo joke that actually works since it's brief and, dare I say it, funny as hell), and it helps to get you prepared for some of the hardships that may come in life, like, well, the possibility of not having kids and losing your loved one in old age. Rare does it happen that you'll cry in the first ten minutes of a Disney family film anymore. Here's the rarity.Up is also in the tradition of wild fantasy, like a tale out of the Lost World mixed in with a tale out of Pixar's idols, Studio Ghibli. One could definitely see the kinds of characters like Carl, Russel and the hero-turned-villain explorer Charles Muntz in a Miyazaki film (as Ebert so thankfully noted in his review), but they also remain true to the Pixar tradition that's given them their distinction. They're never card-board cut-outs, and even when faced with certain plot elements reminiscent of Disney fare, such as with the big bird, ""Kevin"", in the jungle they have to help get back to her kids, or the (insane/perfect) comic relief of the dogs that talk with the collars around their necks, its dealt with the kind of love and care that should be given in solid storytelling. Nothing is too frivolous in Up, and there's an undercurrent of sadness to both Carl, for what he's lost and has to achieve without his late wife he's known since childhood, and for Russell lacking a father figure or real mother (this last part is handled really well, watch for ""Phyllis"" mentioned).Oh, and I forgot, it's animated in the usual tradition of Pixar fare: awesomely. Following on the heels of their arguable top-top masterpiece WALL-E, Up features the ordinary (inside a house, an old man) and the extraordinary (the birds, the dogs, the juxtaposition of a floating house with an airship, something else out of say Howl's Moving Castle) with delicacy and subtly while at the same time grandiosity and the vibrancy possible in the medium. I could go on and on, about how howlingly funny it is or how touching it is in the little moments. But make no mistake, Up is modern film art, even if it doesn't fit into your local art-house cinema. Take the (well-behaved/respectful) kids, take the old folks, take your rotten punk kid. It is what it is- squirrel!
