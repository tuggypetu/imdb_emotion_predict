8.0,"A visual and artistic treat about humanity, respect and the power of love against time and circumstances","Yash Chopra's Veer-Zaara is a film about humanity, devotion, sacrifice, and the power of love. It is a visually stunning and emotionally touching picture about star-crossed lovers who meet once and are tied forever. Yash Chopra artistically combines realism with greatly unrestrained emotion and some overdone sentimentality. Although the love story itself, the separation and everything else is very typical, Chopra creates an entirely different film in the way it portrays the respect the lovers have for each other, the honour they pay to parents and elders, and their genuine willingness to sacrifice themselves for each other. It is a cross-border love story between an Indian and a Pakistani, yet their nationality is not what prevents them from being together. That's what really makes sense in this film. It flows very well through the stunning views of Indian and Pakistani fields and groves, and colourfully shows the bright sides of each country. The film does look a bit dated, but then it does not have a defined period of historical time, which makes it an all-time saga.The film also addresses women's empowerment through Rani Mukherjee's role of a Pakistani lawyer who tries to overcome society. There are many surprising and touching moments in the film. The love story is portrayed grandiosely, with larger-than-life orchestral music of heavy violins and piano. The movie soundtrack is perhaps the most beautiful soundtrack in recent years, and the fact that it was actually composed many years ago contributes to the epic mood of the film. Shahrukh Khan and Preity Zinta are great choices for the film. They resuscitate their characters with restraint and dignity and have a credible chemistry despite not having much physical interaction. Khan is the main soul of the film and he is believable in everything his character goes through. Tremendously nuanced, Zinta is beautiful and compelling as the intelligent and headstrong Zaara, and looks ethereal in traditional outfits. Rani Mukhejee makes a great impact with her relatively minor but pivotal role of the tenacious, level-headed Saammiya. She is natural and impressive and walks out leaving a mark.Veer-Zaara, though a completely entertaining and often overwhelming epic romance, is not the greatest film you'll see and it often goes over-the-top with its abundant emotional quotinent. It is far from being flawless and has its share of loopholes where script is concerned. Having said that, it just doesn't matter here. This film is far ahead of anything it can be blamed for. It is about the main values a person should cherish in life: humanity, respect and love, and it conveys this message very well. Chopra manages to bring together a remarkable group of skilled actors to play the supporting roles, including Kirron Kher, Divya Dutta, Boman Irani, Manoj Bajpai, Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, and Anupam Kher, all of whom play their respective parts to perfection, bringing layering and realism to their different, relatively short but memorably interesting characters. As a cinematic experience, it is both a visual and artistic treat. In this regard, it is one of those films which become classics instantly, and I recommend it to anyone, whoever and wherever he or she is.",visual artistic treat about humanity respect power love against time circumstances,yash chopras veer zaara is film about humanity devotion sacrifice power love it is visually stunning emotionally touching picture about star crossed lovers who meet once are tied forever yash chopra artistically combines realism with greatly unrestrained emotion some overdone sentimentality although love story itself separation everything else is very typical chopra creates entirely different film way it portrays respect lovers have each other honour they pay parents elders their genuine willingness sacrifice themselves each other it is cross border love story between indian pakistani yet their nationality is not what prevents them being together thats what really makes sense this film it flows very well through stunning views indian pakistani fields groves colourfully shows bright sides each country film does look bit dated but then it does not have defined period historical time which makes it all time saga film also addresses womens empowerment through rani mukherjees role pakistani lawyer who tries overcome society there are many surprising touching moments film love story is portrayed grandiosely with larger than life orchestral music heavy violins piano movie soundtrack is perhaps most beautiful soundtrack recent years fact that it was actually composed many years ago contributes epic mood film shahrukh khan preity zinta are great choices film they resuscitate their characters with restraint dignity have credible chemistry despite not having much physical interaction khan is main soul film he is believable everything his character goes through tremendously nuanced zinta is beautiful compelling as intelligent headstrong zaara looks ethereal traditional outfits rani mukhejee makes great impact with her relatively minor but pivotal role tenacious level headed saammiya she is natural impressive walks out leaving mark veer zaara though completely entertaining often overwhelming epic romance is not greatest film youll see it often goes over top with its abundant emotional quotinent it is far being flawless has its share loopholes where script is concerned having said that it just doesnt matter here this film is far ahead anything it can be blamed it is about main values person should cherish life humanity respect love it conveys this message very well chopra manages bring together remarkable group skilled actors play supporting roles including kirron kher divya dutta boman irani manoj bajpai amitabh bachchan hema malini anupam kher all whom play their respective parts perfection bringing layering realism their different relatively short but memorably interesting characters as cinematic experience it is both visual artistic treat this regard it is one those films which become classics instantly i recommend it anyone whoever wherever he or she is,0.5670304232804232,0.30717592592592596,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.24}"

,A movie with a lot of emotions. Good performances from the main characters. Good entertainment,"The main purpose of the cinema is to entertain.Entertainment can mean different things to different people.Normally we expect a lot of emotion in Indian movies.If emotion makes you feel like throwing up, you should not really be watching Indian Hindi movies.If you are really taken with realism, watch a documentary. If you want to get away from the mundane affairs of everyday life watch a Hindi movie.Veer Zaara is a Hindi movie with lots of emotion. The audience identify with the characters and go back to watching it again and again.One must realise that a movie is a hit only when the audience is able to identify themselves with the characters.Questions do come to mind. Like, how did Rani Mukherjee know Veer's name? Maybe Yash Chopra made a mistake. The mistake did not cost him anything because the movie succeeded at the box-office.It might also have taken too long a time to give an explanation.And the movie is already 192 minutes long. A flaw nevertheless, but then you can find faults with just about everything. If you have negative vibes about the person playing the principal character in a movie, you really should not be watching the movie in the first place. SRK has become a living legend.He is a good actor. He has done well as the young squadron leader as well as the ageing prisoner. Twenty two years in jail can age a man beyond his years. Shahrukh was convincing.Preity was her usual bubbly self initially, and then equally convincing.The movie was fast paced.Editing was good. No where did it drag.The songs were excellent.",movie with lot emotions good performances main characters good entertainment,main purpose cinema is entertain entertainment can mean different things different people normally we expect lot emotion indian movies if emotion makes you feel like throwing up you should not really be watching indian hindi movies if you are really taken with realism watch documentary if you want get away mundane affairs everyday life watch hindi movie veer zaara is hindi movie with lots emotion audience identify with characters go back watching it again again one must realise that movie is hit only when audience is able identify themselves with characters questions do come mind like how did rani mukherjee know veers name maybe yash chopra made mistake mistake did not cost him anything because movie succeeded at box office it might also have taken too long time give explanation movie is already 192 minutes long flaw nevertheless but then you can find faults with just about everything if you have negative vibes about person playing principal character movie you really should not be watching movie first place srk has become living legend he is good actor he has done well as young squadron leader as well as ageing prisoner twenty two years jail can age man beyond his years shahrukh was convincing preity was her usual bubbly self initially then equally convincing movie was fast paced editing was good no where did it drag songs were excellent,0.4515625,0.15950520833333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,A beautiful epic love story from Yash Chopra!,"The Chopras have proved once again that you can always count on them to provide the highest quality cinema. I'd first like to applaud Shahrukh for outdoing himself once again by playing both a young, simple-natured squadron and an old, tormented prisoner so convincingly. His skillful subtleties and attention to each detail of his performance have undoubtedly turned him to the best actor I have ever seen. I think he has even surpassed Amitabh. Even though Rani and Preity's roles didn't seem to demand too much from them, they gave a wonderful performance. Even Manoj Bajpai did an excellent job. The story is fabulous. Where the traditional Bollywood film could take the same situations with different outcomes for each event to turn the film into the same familiar fare, Veer-Zaara makes turns it into an epic love story where Veer and Zaara's names can be added to the list of Devdas and Paro, Shah Jahaan and Mumtaaz, etc. The main minus point of the film is its music. Warning: Don't listen to the music before watching the film or it will sound horrendous! Tere Liye, however, is extremely beautiful and melodic. After watching the movie, Aisa Des Hai Mera and Main Yahan Hoon are quite likable. Unfortunately, the latter two are not ones that one can keep humming for several months. Another minor yet negligible drawback is that this movie can't appeal as much to the youth as Yash Chopra's previous film, Dil to Pagal Hai. An addicting soundtrack and a youthful appeal were two things that seemed to be missing, which are usually guaranteed in every Chopra extravaganza. Nonetheless, Veer-Zaara is fantastic!",beautiful epic love story yash chopra,chopras have proved once again that you can always count them provide highest quality cinema id first like applaud shahrukh outdoing himself once again by playing both young simple natured squadron old tormented prisoner so convincingly his skillful subtleties attention each detail his performance have undoubtedly turned him best actor i have ever seen i think he has even surpassed amitabh even though rani preitys roles didnt seem demand too much them they gave wonderful performance even manoj bajpai did excellent job story is fabulous where traditional bollywood film could take same situations with different outcomes each event turn film into same familiar fare veer zaara makes turns it into epic love story where veer zaaras names can be added list devdas paro shah jahaan mumtaaz etc main minus point film is its music warning dont listen music before watching film or it will sound horrendous tere liye however is extremely beautiful melodic after watching movie aisa des hai mera main yahan hoon are quite likable unfortunately latter two are not ones that one can keep humming several months another minor yet negligible drawback is that this movie cant appeal as much youth as yash chopras previous film dil pagal hai addicting soundtrack youthful appeal were two things that seemed be missing which are usually guaranteed every chopra extravaganza nonetheless veer zaara is fantastic,0.4507002801120448,0.26151960784313727,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7.0,Bollywood Entertainment,"""Veer-Zaara"" was shown as part of an international film series at my local public library. It is the first Bollywood musical I have ever seen, and as such, I lack the critical perspective necessary to make an informed judgement about it. However, I did rate ""Veer-Zaara"" seven out of ten, because I found it consistently entertaining, and often entirely delightful. I was never once bored - in spite of its three hour plus running time. In order to appreciate any form of musical drama, it's necessary to ""surrender"" to theatrical artifice, and seen in that light, ""Veer-Zaara"" is no more illogical or ""unrealistic"" than a classic Vincent Minnelli Musical or a ""serious"" Verdi opera. I was also very intrigued at the way that the plot of the film crossed several genres and combined a number of classic story-telling archetypes: ""the star-crossed lovers,"" ""the village pastorale,"" ""the saga of family honor,"" ""the courtroom drama,"" etc.Watching this film I think I learned a lot about modern Indian culture. Although at times the sentimentality in ""Veer-Zaara"" is so gushing that it enters into the realm of camp, there is also much substance in the film which is entirely admirable and worthy of esteem: the honor paid to parents and elders, the independence and spirit shown by strong and intelligent women, the respect given to Law and Justice, and perhaps most importantly, the possibility of peace and reconciliation between two peoples and two nations who have been engaged in a long, bitter, and fruitless quarrel.",bollywood entertainment,veer zaara was shown as part international film series at my local public library it is first bollywood musical i have ever seen as such i lack critical perspective necessary make informed judgement about it however i did rate veer zaara seven out ten because i found it consistently entertaining often entirely delightful i was never once bored spite its three hour plus running time order appreciate any form musical drama its necessary surrender theatrical artifice seen that light veer zaara is no more illogical or unrealistic than classic vincent minnelli musical or serious verdi opera i was also very intrigued at way that plot film crossed several genres combined number classic story telling archetypes star crossed lovers village pastorale saga family honor courtroom drama etc watching this film i think i learned lot about modern indian culture although at times sentimentality veer zaara is so gushing that it enters into realm camp there is also much substance film which is entirely admirable worthy esteem honor paid parents elders independence spirit shown by strong intelligent women respect given law justice perhaps most importantly possibility peace reconciliation between two peoples two nations who have been engaged long bitter fruitless quarrel,0.47230392156862744,0.1122549019607843,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,Progressive Film,"Reviewed by: Vijay Venkataramanan Reviewer's Rating: 9 out of 10It's Diwali - the time for sweets, new clothes, fireworks, and as is customary every year in India, a star-studded, feel-good blockbuster. Yash Chopra's reclamation of the director's throne after seven long years is a simple return to the classical traditions of mainstream Indian film-making. The flair and sensitivity for romance is intact along with the passion for deep-rooted cultural and traditional mis-en-scene. However, neither is ""Veer Zaara"" a classic, nor is it even remotely comparable to Chopra's earlier masterpieces such as ""Silsila"", ""Kaala Pathar"", ""Kabhie Kabhie"", and ""Lamhe"". Yet, it is an ideal Diwali gift, exquisitely packaged, filled to the brim with sentiments and emotions, presented with only the best of intentions.Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) has been decaying in a Pakistani prison for twenty-two years. Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukherjee), a local lawyer representing the Human Rights Commission undertakes the challenge of fighting for Veer so he can return to India. As Saamiya tries to unearth the hidden truth behind why and how Veer ended up in this situation, we are taken through a trip down memory lane as Veer recollects the days when he found and lost the love of his life, a Pakistani girl called Zaara (Priety Zinta).What ""Veer Zaara"" lacks in terms of an innovative plot structure, it more than makes up for with Aditya Chopra's sometimes flawed, but sensitive writing. The supporting characters are extremely well fleshed out, and his dialogs witty and subtle. The storytelling is further enhanced with Javed Akhtar's lyrical wizardry, and Yash Chopra's tact for stretching defining moments of the story into musical interludes continues to fascinate. ""Do pal ruka, khwaabon ka kaarvaan"", a fine example of Mr. Akhtar's and Mr. Chopra's brilliance remains etched in your memory.The film's grand-scale packaging is embellished by Sharmishta Roy's artistic, and exquisitely detailed production design, with each set being highly reflective of the characters that it holds in. Cinematographer Anil Sharma (Lagaan, Kal Ho Na Ho) sets up a rustic, yet opulent scheme to the film's largely rural setting that brings back memories of the evergreen ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge"".Actors including the great Amitabh Bachchan (who makes a stunning special appearance in this film with Hema Malini) have always elevated their performances to higher levels under Yash Chopra's baton. Rani Mukherjee follows in the same footsteps, playing the rookie lawyer with an admirable juxtaposition of nervousness and ferocity. While Preity Zinta and Shahrukh Khan too perform well in their respective roles, at no point does one feel that these two talented actors are ever challenged with roles such as these. Having played the loverboy so many times in the past, Veer Pratap Singh is a cakewalk for the Khan. The lead pair's chemistry from their younger days all the way to the days of their fifties is highly appreciable however. The supporting cast comprising of Divya Dutta, Kirron Kher, Boman Irani, and Manoj Bajpai make full use of their well-defined characters to enact high-caliber performances.Other than the story of two fanatically devoted lovers, ""Veer Zaara"" is a progressive film for the Indian Film Industry because it makes an effort to break stereotypes with respect to Indo-Pak relations. It is a welcome change from the mindless Pak-bashing fare that we are routinely subjected to. Sensitive approaches like this first of all would help improve cultural ties, considering Hindi movies do comprise of a large portion of India's unofficial exports to Pakistan. Equally important is the economic factor because a culturally sensitive film like ""Veer Zaara"" is bound to officially open up a potentially huge, untapped, cinema-going audience across the border",progressive film,reviewed by vijay venkataramanan reviewers rating 9 out 10its diwali time sweets new clothes fireworks as is customary every year india star studded feel good blockbuster yash chopras reclamation directors throne after seven long years is simple return classical traditions mainstream indian film making flair sensitivity romance is intact along with passion deep rooted cultural traditional mis en scene however neither is veer zaara classic nor is it even remotely comparable chopras earlier masterpieces such as silsila kaala pathar kabhie kabhie lamhe yet it is ideal diwali gift exquisitely packaged filled brim with sentiments emotions presented with only best intentions squadron leader veer pratap singh shahrukh khan has been decaying pakistani prison twenty two years saamiya siddiqui rani mukherjee local lawyer representing human rights commission undertakes challenge fighting veer so he can return india as saamiya tries unearth hidden truth behind why how veer ended up this situation we are taken through trip down memory lane as veer recollects days when he found lost love his life pakistani girl called zaara priety zinta what veer zaara lacks terms innovative plot structure it more than makes up with aditya chopras sometimes flawed but sensitive writing supporting characters are extremely well fleshed out his dialogs witty subtle storytelling is further enhanced with javed akhtars lyrical wizardry yash chopras tact stretching defining moments story into musical interludes continues fascinate do pal ruka khwaabon ka kaarvaan fine example mr akhtars mr chopras brilliance remains etched your memory films grand scale packaging is embellished by sharmishta roys artistic exquisitely detailed production design with each set being highly reflective characters that it holds cinematographer anil sharma lagaan kal ho na ho sets up rustic yet opulent scheme films largely rural setting that brings back memories evergreen dilwale dulhania le jaayenge actors including great amitabh bachchan who makes stunning special appearance this film with hema malini have always elevated their performances higher levels under yash chopras baton rani mukherjee follows same footsteps playing rookie lawyer with admirable juxtaposition nervousness ferocity while preity zinta shahrukh khan too perform well their respective roles at no point does one feel that these two talented actors are ever challenged with roles such as these having played loverboy so many times past veer pratap singh is cakewalk khan lead pairs chemistry their younger days all way days their fifties is highly appreciable however supporting cast comprising divya dutta kirron kher boman irani manoj bajpai make full use their well defined characters enact high caliber performances other than story two fanatically devoted lovers veer zaara is progressive film indian film industry because it makes effort break stereotypes with respect indo pak relations it is welcome change mindless pak bashing fare that we are routinely subjected sensitive approaches like this first all would help improve cultural ties considering hindi movies do comprise large portion indias unofficial exports pakistan equally important is economic factor because culturally sensitive film like veer zaara is bound officially open up potentially huge untapped cinema going audience across border,0.5221163313810372,0.1860132841015194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,Wow...Shah Rukh Khan AND Amitab Bachchan in the same movie! And then Anupam Kher appears from out of no where!! Wow...,"Many folks around the world do not remember the history that has transpired between India and Pakistan in the last 70 years. When India was subdivided into India, East Pakistan (later known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan, it coincided with LOTS of sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims. It also touched off wars and between one and two million people were killed! It was an awful time and led to both nations developing atomic weapons--after which, an uneasy stalemate has existed in the region. In this problem spot of the world is where this love story is based--a story about an Indian man (Shah Rukh Khan) and Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta). The movie begins in Pakistan. Zaara's elderly grandmother is dying and begs her to take her ashed back to India where she was born. Despite the poor relations between the countries, Zaara agrees to go and during her journey (not surprisingly) she meets Veer and they soon fall in love. This portion of the film is very, very sweet--my favorite part of the film. However, things are NOT going to be easy--this IS an Indian romance and at over three hours in length, you know SOMETHING is going to come between their love.What happens to Veer is something you'll have to see for yourself-- but it clearly is an awful injustice and is highly reminiscent of Dumas' ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". This film really takes you on an emotional roller-coaster, that's for sure! In the process, some of the biggest film stars in India are there to support the main characters--with Amitabh Bachchan, Anupam Kher and Rani Mukerji on hand. While these names may not mean much to non-Bollywood fans, they are all mega- stars and make this one of the most star-studded Indian films I have ever seen. Combined with some amazing scenery and cinematography, clearly Yash Chopra pulled out all the stops to make this film.Overall, this is a wonderful and stirring romance--and I highly recommend it. The only part that didn't ring true for me was the little speech made by Kher near the end...it just seemed a bit trite and hard to believe. Still, a terrific film and one that stars two of the most beautiful women ever to have appeared on screen as well as two terrifically handsome and virile leading men.",wow shah rukh khan amitab bachchan same movie then anupam kher appears out no where wow,many folks around world do not remember history that has transpired between india pakistan last 70 years when india was subdivided into india east pakistan later known as bangladesh west pakistan it coincided with lots sectarian violence between hindus muslims it also touched off wars between one two million people were killed it was awful time led both nations developing atomic weapons after which uneasy stalemate has existed region this problem spot world is where this love story is based story about indian man shah rukh khan pakistani woman preity zinta movie begins pakistan zaaras elderly grandmother is dying begs her take her ashed back india where she was born despite poor relations between countries zaara agrees go during her journey not surprisingly she meets veer they soon fall love this portion film is very very sweet my favorite part film however things are not going be easy this is indian romance at over three hours length you know something is going come between their love what happens veer is something youll have see yourself but it clearly is awful injustice is highly reminiscent dumas man iron mask this film really takes you emotional roller coaster thats sure process some biggest film stars india are there support main characters with amitabh bachchan anupam kher rani mukerji hand while these names may not mean much non bollywood fans they are all mega stars make this one most star studded indian films i have ever seen combined with some amazing scenery cinematography clearly yash chopra pulled out all stops make this film overall this is wonderful stirring romance i highly recommend it only part that didnt ring true me was little speech made by kher near end it just seemed bit trite hard believe still terrific film one that stars two most beautiful women ever have appeared screen as well as two terrifically handsome virile leading men,0.5911180555555554,0.1510520833333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.24}"

8.0,"""Gift of the Magi"" in Bollywood format","SOME SPOILERS: As some other reviewers have commented, this movie is like grand opera. That does not bother me at all--it is what I expect from Bollywood musicals of the grand, traditional type. (Better grand opera than fifth-rate-MTV cheeze.) I also wasn't especially bothered by some of the implausibility of the plot: I did think SRK's Veer was a bit too doddering for a man who is theoretically only in his early fifties, 22 years in prison or not. On the other hand, it didn't bother me that Saamiya knew his name. He had given his interrogators his name before he decided on silence, and presumably that name was in his files.What some might consider a major, major flaw (or at least deeply disappointing) is the basic premise. After Veer sacrifices himself to save Zaara's honor, she throws her honor away. What is Veer's sacrifice for, if she doesn't marry and have children, if her family is destroyed anyway? But--whether intentional or not--this is what makes the movie interesting to me, because the pointless sacrifice is mutual.""Veer-Zaara"" is like a Bollywood version of the old O. Henry story, ""The Gift of the Magi,"" which focuses on a young married couple who are very much in love. They are poor, and have only two possessions of value: she has her long, lovely hair and he has a beautiful pocket watch. Each wishes to surprise the other with a Christmas present that will reflect the depth of their love for one another. So what do they do? She sells her lovely hair to buy him a chain for his watch, and he sells his watch to buy her an ornamental comb for her hair. The mutual sacrifices cancel each other out, and are meant to ironically underline the over-the-top foolishness of their love for each other.How much more pointless is it that Veer sacrifices 22 years of his life to save the honor of Zaara and her family, while Zaara sacrifices her honor and family in order to live Veer's life? I think the pointlessness of the sacrifice (that they cancel each other out) is deliberate, though, because we see it through the eyes of Saamiya, who says, ""What century do these people live in? Are they human beings pretending to be gods or gods disguised as human beings?"" It is up to each viewer to decide whether the sacrifices of Veer and Zaara are noble and romantic, or foolishly romantic.The only problem I have with the basic premise is that Veer's choice is presented as either/or: Either he explains what he is really doing in Lahore and ruins Zaara, or he sacrifices himself. But what if he had said that Zaara's mother had sent for him, because she wanted to meet the man who had saved her daughter's life? Ideally, the screenplay would have allowed for such a choice, and found a way to close the door on it. This was not a great flaw for me, though, because Veer is not behaving like an intelligent young man capable of outwitting his captors. He has, after all, come to Pakistan in a state of mind where he is ready and willing, and even eager, to immolate himself on the altar of love.The movie itself is beautifully filmed. There isn't much going on apart from the love story, but sometimes a grand over-the-top romance is worth watching. I did not find SRK embarrassing, as I sometimes did in ""Kal Ho Naa Ho."" He was very good, as was Zinta as a slightly spoiled girl who begins showing her actual determination and nobility of spirit and as soon as she is tested by her nanny's death.

7.0,"Extremely sentimental, yet unabashedly so: the epitome of Bollywood","If I were to judge each factor of VeerZaara separately, I would not even judge it a mediocre movie, I would call it awful, cheesy, cloying, utterly unrealistic. However, I saw the whole movie and enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. Not being a hypocrite, I am giving it the score it deserves for its emotion and entertainment. This movie, almost as the epitome of Bollywood, is not one bit ashamed of having star-crossed lovers, true and eternal love and devotion, selfless sacrifice in the name of love, justice, idealistic religious syncretism, and mutually inclusive patriotism and respect for the neighboring nation. Combined with that of course you have songs sung by eminent playback singers, beautiful cinematography and attractive actors. Acting wise, initially SRK's totally fake prisoner-getup really annoyed me, with its fake powdered hair and totally unconvincing geriatric quiver. The obviousness of the dialogue when he first starts speaking also bored me. Then there's Preity's silly (but cute) little song. But these things really opened the way up for the movie, let the audience know, 'Hey, this isn't like your world, it's totally different. Abandon disbelief (completely), all ye that enter.' So I had to disarm myself and give into Bollywood, and into all the pure, romantic love, colorful clothes, wide stretches of beautiful village scenery, rather inaccurate but still well-meant depiction of Pakistani and Muslim societies, and all the idealistic sociopolitical ideas one wants in such a movie. But there is still something unexpected here. Before the resolve we see the aftermath of a sacrifice from both parties. You see that even though they are reunited, they have definitely lost a lot. SRK did a good job here in carrying through his prison mannerisms and not losing them at Zaara's sight. They are reunited but a sense of loss is maintained. A somewhat bittersweet trace in a very sweet movie.",extremely sentimental yet unabashedly so epitome bollywood,if i were judge each factor veerzaara separately i would not even judge it mediocre movie i would call it awful cheesy cloying utterly unrealistic however i saw whole movie enjoyed it far more than i thought i would not being hypocrite i am giving it score it deserves its emotion entertainment this movie almost as epitome bollywood is not one bit ashamed having star crossed lovers true eternal love devotion selfless sacrifice name love justice idealistic religious syncretism mutually inclusive patriotism respect neighboring nation combined with that course you have songs sung by eminent playback singers beautiful cinematography attractive actors acting wise initially srks totally fake prisoner getup really annoyed me with its fake powdered hair totally unconvincing geriatric quiver obviousness dialogue when he first starts speaking also bored me then theres preitys silly but cute little song but these things really opened way up movie let audience know hey this isnt like your world its totally different abandon disbelief completely all ye that enter so i had disarm myself give into bollywood into all pure romantic love colorful clothes wide stretches beautiful village scenery rather inaccurate but still well meant depiction pakistani muslim societies all idealistic sociopolitical ideas one wants such movie but there is still something unexpected here before resolve we see aftermath sacrifice both parties you see that even though they are reunited they have definitely lost lot srk did good job here carrying through his prison mannerisms not losing them at zaaras sight they are reunited but sense loss is maintained somewhat bittersweet trace very sweet movie,0.6667460317460316,0.0936139455782313,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Thank you Mr Chopra,"I am one of those fussy people who watches selected films. Most films bore me because either they are a re-make (old Indian or American)or the story just does not grab me.

8.0,Emotionally powerful one that never loses its focus !,"7 years ago, the veteran director Yash Chopra directed Shah Rukh Khan in a love triangle based movie Dil Toh Pagal Hain. After a long span of time, he came back with his highly acclaimed endeavor Veer Zaara. Not only an outstanding movie but a totally stand-out movie. The film stars Shah Rukh khan, Preity Zinta & Rani Mukherjee playing the lead roles while actors like Anupam Kher, Kirron Kher, Boman Irani comes under the supporting cast. Kudos to legends Amitabh Bachchan & Hema Malini for their cameos. The movie is set under the backdrop of enmity between India and Pakistan and the way it affects the lives of two lovers. A very old and weak Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh ( Shah Rukh Khan) has spend 22 years of his life in Lahore jail situated in Pakistan abandoning his freedom and happiness only for the sake of his love Zaara's happiness (Preity Zinta). A ray of hope rises in his life when rookie lawyer Samiya ( Rani) comes for the sheer reason of opening Veer's case again in the court. Major part of the film is Veer's narration of his love story to Samiya. Scenes , dialogs and Artistic direction add up to the beauty of the film. Chopra redefines the true meaning of love through this brilliance Veer Zaara. The shots taken through Punjab and Lahore are so eye-catchy and refreshing. Yash Chopra takes u on a ride in fields of Punjab, the pinds of Lahore, the snow capped mountains that charms you in every way possible. Songs touch your heart deeply. Valuable contributions by singers Lata mangeshkar, Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan, Roop Kumar rathod, Gurudas Mann have made songs so pure and full of good-will that u literally feel the emotion in your heart.

9.0,somehow it works...,"I watched it twice before I was being able to make an opinion about it. Though I do have some negatives about the movie...over all it is a good value for money. First talking about the plus sides... 1. Amitabh Bachan was awesome...one of the best performances of his lifetime in a short role.... 2. Screenplay and script deserve high grade.. though the dialogues aren't as catchy as were of DDLJ, DTPH or Mohabbatein...the overall screen play and twists and turns made this movie a treat to watch...specially Samia finding Zara in India catches everyone by surprise... 3. Rani's performance is A class and will surely win her some awards this year.... 4. Hima Malini looked cool as well as did her part with perfection. 5. Choice of locations for Indian village life is remarkable. 6. Though music on the whole is just about above average, a couple of scores in Bhangra beat are catchy. 7. And last but certainly not the least... Shahrukh Khan once again walks through a role with utmost perfection. I don't know whether it was deliberate or incidental, but his casualness and under toned acting as a youth made his performance as a gray-haired guy more prominent. Needless to see he was really skillful portraying a middle age prisoner.And now the minus side.. Well the only minus that I have with this movie is the projection of Pakistani society. Every time Pakistan was shown in the film it never looked like Pakistan. The director seems quite unfamiliar with Pakistan, her society, her customs, her wedding rituals, her surroundings..just about everything. And this to me was a real big minus...that bigger a minus that it overshadowed the pluses of the movie in first viewing. No politician in Pakistan contesting from Lahore wears shirwani in his house for sure..in fact in the entire national assemblies of last 3-4 decades, you will hardly find any sherwani except the nawab's of bahawalpur and late Nasarullah Khan. No one in Lahore uses the Lakhnao Delhi style of adab for greetings. Nor does the ladies of the class shown wear jewels like Kiron Kher. It looked more like Muslim Lucknow rather than Pakistan. And this highlights one more thing - ""India and Pakistan are two different and distant societies who know very little about each other. by the virtue of history, they do have things in common, but on the whole they have turned into two different societies. Pakistani society is different than the society of Indian muslims, it's more modern and has her own set of customs. It has moved quite a lot from the pre partition commonalities between the two cultures. And this is where Yash jee got it all wrong.""But all in all, a real good movie, with a daring plot and good screenplay full of surprises.",somehow it works,i watched it twice before i was being able make opinion about it though i do have some negatives about movie over all it is good value money first talking about plus sides 1 amitabh bachan was awesome one best performances his lifetime short role 2 screenplay script deserve high grade though dialogues arent as catchy as were ddlj dtph or mohabbatein overall screen play twists turns made this movie treat watch specially samia finding zara india catches everyone by surprise 3 ranis performance is class will surely win her some awards this year 4 hima malini looked cool as well as did her part with perfection 5 choice locations indian village life is remarkable 6 though music whole is just about above average couple scores bhangra beat are catchy 7 last but certainly not least shahrukh khan once again walks through role with utmost perfection i dont know whether it was deliberate or incidental but his casualness under toned acting as youth made his performance as gray haired guy more prominent needless see he was really skillful portraying middle age prisoner now minus side well only minus that i have with this movie is projection pakistani society every time pakistan was shown film it never looked like pakistan director seems quite unfamiliar with pakistan her society her customs her wedding rituals her surroundings just about everything this me was real big minus that bigger minus that it overshadowed pluses movie first viewing no politician pakistan contesting lahore wears shirwani his house sure fact entire national assemblies last 3 4 decades you will hardly find any sherwani except nawabs bahawalpur late nasarullah khan no one lahore uses lakhnao delhi style adab greetings nor does ladies class shown wear jewels like kiron kher it looked more like muslim lucknow rather than pakistan this highlights one more thing india pakistan are two different distant societies who know very little about each other by virtue history they do have things common but whole they have turned into two different societies pakistani society is different than society indian muslims its more modern has her own set customs it has moved quite lot pre partition commonalities between two cultures this is where yash jee got it all wrong but all all real good movie with daring plot good screenplay full surprises,0.4729619646600779,0.18503256963162626,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"

This causes Zaara's father to have a fit and he conspires with his in-laws to be to set Veer up. They paint him as a spy for Pakistan and jail him under those terms. While in jail, he is visited by Zaara's fiancé who tells him that if he should try and make a ruckus that Zaara would be shamed and suffer etc. etc. and so Veer takes a vow for silence that last 20 years, after which a plucky lawyer (played by Rani Mukherjee) reads about this Pakistani prisoner and comes to the jail to interview him.

2.0,A total crap,"Hi.. well, i have just finished watching this movie, and let me say that it was total crap. Nothing in this movie is worth watching, the plot is totally predictable, the acting is worthless with too many clichés, the music was maybe the best thing about the movie although it wasn't superb.In summary, the story line is a combination of Dilwale dulhanya le jayenge, chalte chalte and swades, Ya3ni nothing new at all. The movie is full of clichés that we saw over and over again in thousands of Indian movies. The first part of the movie is similar to Dilwale dluhania and chalte chalte, where sharukh starts falling in love with the girl during their traveling and is surprised that she is engaged..*sigh*..hence we have the common problem that we have seen thousands of times before.And the part where sharukh takes pretty to his village and all the villagers including shaurkh's mom and dad fall in love with pretty..sounds a lot like SWADES doesn't it ?? and again so predictable.The dialog and conversations were so cheezy, the part where Rani starts babbling to sharukh about the rights of women in Pakistan was so boring and lame that i wanted to go to sleep. And when sharukh starts talking he always starts with poetry like talk and excessive details that was suppose to add some romantic story telling feel into it, was so silly.Oh, and the acting was terrible, except for pretty whom i think was better than the rest, sharukh was so funny playing his older character, moving so slow like a robot, made me laugh.So in conclusion this was a total waste of time out of my precious life, sooo predictable from beginning to end,boring and a total piece of crap, my advice to you is to keep away from this movie.",total crap,hi well i have just finished watching this movie let me say that it was total crap nothing this movie is worth watching plot is totally predictable acting is worthless with too many clich s music was maybe best thing about movie although it wasnt superb summary story line is combination dilwale dulhanya le jayenge chalte chalte swades ya3ni nothing new at all movie is full clich s that we saw over over again thousands indian movies first part movie is similar dilwale dluhania chalte chalte where sharukh starts falling love with girl during their traveling is surprised that she is engaged sigh hence we have common problem that we have seen thousands times before part where sharukh takes pretty his village all villagers including shaurkhs mom dad fall love with pretty sounds lot like swades doesnt it again so predictable dialog conversations were so cheezy part where rani starts babbling sharukh about rights women pakistan was so boring lame that i wanted go sleep when sharukh starts talking he always starts with poetry like talk excessive details that was suppose add some romantic story telling feel into it was so silly oh acting was terrible except pretty whom i think was better than rest sharukh was so funny playing his older character moving so slow like robot made me laugh so conclusion this was total waste time out my precious life sooo predictable beginning end boring total piece crap my advice you is keep away this movie,0.6308621933621933,-0.0415945165945166,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Veer Zaara is pure Opera!,"I saw this movie last night. Personally I loved the film for many reasons. The only thing that I have to say against it is that it could have been slightly shorter. But this movie had an ""egde of the seat"" quality that I have not seen in a Bollywood film in a long time. The twists in the film are very good, and highly unexpected! The music was excellent. I have to dis-agree with some comments on this page that criticize the music, and claim it's not a ""catchy"" soundtrack! I think this music is right for the theme, and the character of this film! This movie has an epic quality to it that requires it to have a soundtrack that reflects this. I think the music is memorable.This movies has a story which attempts to explore human nature, and what makes it great. The characters develop in the story to exceed their own expectations of themselves. Especially Zaara's character as we first see it, and who she turns out to be in the end. We know right from the start that Zaara is a stubborn person. But we also see her capacity for love when she goes to India to perform the last rights for her nanny despite the opposition from her family. But we see that the strength of her feelings for Veer take even her by surprise. Veer is a carefree and daring character who takes his job very seriously, and is basically a sensible guy. He's not at all ""over dramatic"" when we first meet him. Yet he falls in love and lets go of everything he holds dear. But this is consistent with his character as we see right from the start that he dosen't do things by half. There where a few scenes in this film where the humanity of the characters are shown in great depth. One of the best scenes is the one between Zaara and her father, when he apologizes to his daughter for compelling her into marriage with Raza Shirazi.But at this point we know what the motivation of both father and daughter is. One other memorable and exciting scene is, Veer and Zaara's meeting in the Mosque when Veer comes to Lahore.The movie was well cast. Rani Mukherjee as Sammiya Siddiqui was an excellent addition to the story, and she is in more ways than one the ""Hero"" of this story. The outcome of this story is just as important to Sammiya Siddiqui as it is for Veer and Zaara. In fact they are each other's salvation.Sammiya is also a women who is trying to make it in a man's world,despite being thwarted from the likes of her opposing council.The acting was excellent. The best I have seen Shah Ruhk do in the last 5 years! I loved his acting. He depicted great depth, and also there was good control in his acting. Very well done. Priety did justice to the role of Zaara Hayatt Kahn.Very convincing. The cameo's where excellent. Amitab Bachchan, Hema Malini, Manoj Bajpai, and Anupam Kher. Kiron Kher as always was excellent in her role. The cinematography was excellent too.All in all, this movie is worth a watch, and if you have the chance see it on the big screen, because it does justice to the visually spectacular aspect of this movie. Veer Zaara was Operatic in it's presentation and style. It was larger than life!",veer zaara is pure opera,i saw this movie last night personally i loved film many reasons only thing that i have say against it is that it could have been slightly shorter but this movie had egde seat quality that i have not seen bollywood film long time twists film are very good highly unexpected music was excellent i have dis agree with some comments this page that criticize music claim its not catchy soundtrack i think this music is right theme character this film this movie has epic quality it that requires it have soundtrack that reflects this i think music is memorable this movies has story which attempts explore human nature what makes it great characters develop story exceed their own expectations themselves especially zaaras character as we first see it who she turns out be end we know right start that zaara is stubborn person but we also see her capacity love when she goes india perform last rights her nanny despite opposition her family but we see that strength her feelings veer take even her by surprise veer is carefree daring character who takes his job very seriously is basically sensible guy hes not at all over dramatic when we first meet him yet he falls love lets go everything he holds dear but this is consistent with his character as we see right start that he dosent do things by half there where few scenes this film where humanity characters are shown great depth one best scenes is one between zaara her father when he apologizes his daughter compelling her into marriage with raza shirazi but at this point we know what motivation both father daughter is one other memorable exciting scene is veer zaaras meeting mosque when veer comes lahore movie was well cast rani mukherjee as sammiya siddiqui was excellent addition story she is more ways than one hero this story outcome this story is just as important sammiya siddiqui as it is veer zaara fact they are each others salvation sammiya is also women who is trying make it mans world despite being thwarted likes her opposing council acting was excellent best i have seen shah ruhk do last 5 years i loved his acting he depicted great depth also there was good control his acting very well done priety did justice role zaara hayatt kahn very convincing cameos where excellent amitab bachchan hema malini manoj bajpai anupam kher kiron kher as always was excellent her role cinematography was excellent too all all this movie is worth watch if you have chance see it big screen because it does justice visually spectacular aspect this movie veer zaara was operatic its presentation style it was larger than life,0.5665858843537416,0.36082908163265304,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.35}"
5.0,cheesy and unoriginal. *Spoiler Alert*,"I'm disappointed with Veer Zaara. Shah Rukh continues to be unrelentingly embarrassing-hamming for all he is worth, and Preity Zinta looks old and haggard. *SPOILERS* The story is a mishmash of all the ""hit"" trademarks of a Yash Chopra film - the intro of the leading lady in white chiffon, her rain dance about her dreams, Shah Rukh winning the mom over; with all the stock characters: ancient grandma, strong mum n dad et al thrown in. The screenplay is implausible, hasty and the love story just doesn't build up to the grand saga it is supposed to be. The movie insults intelligence of the viewer, so cheesy in places - the court scene where everyone claps when shah rukh finished talking! Groan!On a positive note, the soundtrack is nice and Rani Mukherjee is good.",cheesy unoriginal spoiler alert,im disappointed with veer zaara shah rukh continues be unrelentingly embarrassing hamming all he is worth preity zinta looks old haggard spoilers story is mishmash all hit trademarks yash chopra film intro leading lady white chiffon her rain dance about her dreams shah rukh winning mom over with all stock characters ancient grandma strong mum n dad et al thrown screenplay is implausible hasty love story just doesnt build up grand saga it is supposed be movie insults intelligence viewer so cheesy places court scene where everyone claps when shah rukh finished talking groan positive note soundtrack is nice rani mukherjee is good,0.5984848484848485,0.1364718614718615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.46}"
