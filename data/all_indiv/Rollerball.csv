1.0,John McTiernan's amateur hour.,"Original 'Rollerball' was a movie about dystopia future, where huge corporations ruled the world and there was no wars. But the blood lust of people had to be compensated, so there was this game called Rollerball, which was full of action, thrills and kills. But then one of the players was in the verge of becoming too big. He, Jonathe E. was a threat to the rule.We can forget all about that with this remake of that 70's classic. There is no political metaphor, no philosophical questions about humanity, in fact there is no sense at all, if you don't count nonsense, about the movie. John McTiernan, director of such classics as 'The Predator' and 'Die Hard' has managed to make a movie, that is in one word, poor.With some idiotic excuse the main protagonist Jonathan (at least the name is same), gets in the hazardous game of Rollerball with his pal Marcus (LL Cool J). Soon he notices, that there is something fishy about the game.There isn't anything worthwhile to mention about the film. Tiernan directs like a man, who hasn't directed a single piece of film in his life. The plot is idiotic and the main baddies are pretty much camp material. The action is poorly choreographed and the editing tries so badly to be music video like, that it's flat out funny.Can't really figure any reason for anyone to see this film.Rating: 1 out of 10Camp rating: 4 out of 10",john mctiernans amateur hour,original rollerball was movie about dystopia future where huge corporations ruled world there was no wars but blood lust people had be compensated so there was this game called rollerball which was full action thrills kills but then one players was verge becoming too big he jonathe e was threat rule we can forget all about that with this remake that 70s classic there is no political metaphor no philosophical questions about humanity fact there is no sense at all if you dont count nonsense about movie john mctiernan director such classics as predator die hard has managed make movie that is one word poor with some idiotic excuse main protagonist jonathan at least name is same gets hazardous game rollerball with his pal marcus ll cool j soon he notices that there is something fishy about game there isnt anything worthwhile mention about film tiernan directs like man who hasnt directed single piece film his life plot is idiotic main baddies are pretty much camp material action is poorly choreographed editing tries so badly be music video like that its flat out funny cant really figure any reason anyone see this film rating 1 out 10camp rating 4 out 10,0.43777348777348774,-0.01341698841698841,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.51}"
1.0,One of the worst remakes ever.,"A good friend of mine, and fellow rabid film fan, said he would give me a tenner (£10) if I honestly felt that Rollerball was worth a score higher than 1/10; as much as I need the cash, I just can't bring myself to lie. Rollerball is absolutely dire and truly deserves the lowest rating possible.A muddled, unexciting piece of drivel from the word go, John McTiernan's lousy remake of Norman Jewison's 70s cult favourite is every inch as bad as you have probably heard. Perpetually-perplexed-looking Chris Klein is unwisely cast as Jonathan (portrayed by James Caan in the original), a thrill junkie who is convinced by good friend Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) to try his hand at Rollerball, a dangerous team sport played in Russia and its neighbouring countries.The evil men controlling the sport, led by Alexis Petrovich (Jean Reno), are corrupt gangsters who will trade players lives in order to boost their ratings. But a brave American citizen like Jonathan isn't about to kowtow to the demands of nasty foreigners, and sets about upsetting the applecart.To be honest, there are so many reasons to despise this movie, I really do not know where to start. I guess as good a place as any would be with director McTiernan, who seems to have lost all ability to make a decent film. This is the man who redefined the action movie in the 80s with Die Hard. He also proved he could do a decent remake with The Thomas Crown Affair. So what the hell happened here?His Rollerball is unexciting, glossy toss that makes the mistake of pandering to the teen crowd. As a result, we get a pretty boy lead 'actor' (Klein makes Keanu Reeves look like Olivier), a rapper playing support, an ex-model (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as the love interest, and even an inexplicable appearance by noise-merchants Slipknot. The script treats the viewer with contempt, making no attempt to explain the titular game, rendering the action scenes meaningless. If we have no idea of the rules of the sport, how the hell can we get excited about it?Visually the film is even worse: the 'roller dome'the arena in which Jonathan is king (despite constantly looking as if he is about to wet himself)resembles a kids activity area rather than a tough battlefield; the players, dressed in shiny PVC, look like they're off to an S&M party; and for some reason an entire chase scene is shot viewed though some kind of night-vision goggles.The acting ranges from poor (Reno, Romijn-Stamos) to very poor (Klein, rapidly becoming my most hated actor, and LL Cool J).Gone is the bone-crunching realistic violence of the original film; in McTiernan's version of the sport, it seems that no-one is supposed to get hurtif they do get injured, it's because of their unscrupulous bosses and their money-grabbing ways. Gone is the futuristic settingthis one is supposed to be in the here and now! And gone is any respect I had for JohnMcTiernan.",one worst remakes ever,good friend mine fellow rabid film fan said he would give me tenner 10 if i honestly felt that rollerball was worth score higher than 1 10 as much as i need cash i just cant bring myself lie rollerball is absolutely dire truly deserves lowest rating possible muddled unexciting piece drivel word go john mctiernans lousy remake norman jewisons 70s cult favourite is every inch as bad as you have probably heard perpetually perplexed looking chris klein is unwisely cast as jonathan portrayed by james caan original thrill junkie who is convinced by good friend marcus ridley ll cool j try his hand at rollerball dangerous team sport played russia its neighbouring countries evil men controlling sport led by alexis petrovich jean reno are corrupt gangsters who will trade players lives order boost their ratings but brave american citizen like jonathan isnt about kowtow demands nasty foreigners sets about upsetting applecart be honest there are so many reasons despise this movie i really do not know where start i guess as good place as any would be with director mctiernan who seems have lost all ability make decent film this is man who redefined action movie 80s with die hard he also proved he could do decent remake with thomas crown affair so what hell happened here his rollerball is unexciting glossy toss that makes mistake pandering teen crowd as result we get pretty boy lead actor klein makes keanu reeves look like olivier rapper playing support ex model rebecca romijn stamos as love interest even inexplicable appearance by noise merchants slipknot script treats viewer with contempt making no attempt explain titular game rendering action scenes meaningless if we have no idea rules sport how hell can we get excited about it visually film is even worse roller dome arena which jonathan is king despite constantly looking as if he is about wet himself resembles kids activity area rather than tough battlefield players dressed shiny pvc look like theyre off s m party some reason entire chase scene is shot viewed though some kind night vision goggles acting ranges poor reno romijn stamos very poor klein rapidly becoming my most hated actor ll cool j gone is bone crunching realistic violence original film mctiernans version sport it seems that no one is supposed get hurt if they do get injured its because their unscrupulous bosses their money grabbing ways gone is futuristic setting this one is supposed be here now gone is any respect i had johnmctiernan,0.6046540880503145,0.018385744234800844,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,Rollerball is one of the worst movies ever made.,"Johnathan Cross, a lover of extreme sports, is recruited to star in Rollerball. The players are on Rollerblades, trying to bring a heavy metal ball into a high goal. Also, there are motorcyclists around to bring momentum to the players. Oh yes, and there are no rules in the game. During his skyrocketing career, Johnathan has to experience what Alexi has found out: Blood brings more viewing pleasure to the audience. In a final game, Johnathan and his team have to fight for mere survival.Back in 1975, James Caan brought us a brutal movie in which you can literally hear every bone in the players body break. Now, John McTieran has brought that film to us again, for a new generation. With stars like LL Cool J, Rebbeca Romijn and Chris Klein you would expect it to be a pretty bad remake, but this is not the case. Rollerball does the unthinkable and gives Psycho a running for it's money as the worst remake ever created by man.Chris Klein in every film he has been in manages to make it look as if he has no range at all. His soft voice and good looks can only go so far, and in a movie where you need to beat the living hell out of another team member, you want someone that can at least yell and make a sound beyond a bird chirp. LL Cool J is only hear to bring the film a ""cool"" hip look, he's suppose to be the I don't give a damn, James Dean character, but it doesn't fly. Rebbeca Romijn, well, she has a nude scene, but when it's covered in the dark, you wonder why she is even in the movie to begin with.Rollerball is suppose to be a bloody entertaining film, but McTeirnan at no point manages to show us anything entertaining. The entire game sequences seem uninspired and drawn out. When it goes for a shock, it misses and misses completely. I'm still wondering if LL Cool J's character is dead or alive, but apparently it's not important to the story. LL Cool J probably knew that this was going to be garbage and left the movie, leaving the film crew to make his character disappear. I don't blame him.Not even the professional himself, Jean Reno save this film from the ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure from seeing this film. In a film about violence in sports, you would expect to see some, but when you have a PG-13 rating, you know that it was targeted to make money and nothing else.I can't understand why someone would want to see this film, the final action sequence is yet another let-down in this horrible tripe. The only thing that this film has going for it, is it's 97 minute length, so if you do have the unfortunate experience of sitting through it, it will be over soon enough.",rollerball is one worst movies ever made,johnathan cross lover extreme sports is recruited star rollerball players are rollerblades trying bring heavy metal ball into high goal also there are motorcyclists around bring momentum players oh yes there are no rules game during his skyrocketing career johnathan has experience what alexi has found out blood brings more viewing pleasure audience final game johnathan his team have fight mere survival back 1975 james caan brought us brutal movie which you can literally hear every bone players body break now john mctieran has brought that film us again new generation with stars like ll cool j rebbeca romijn chris klein you would expect it be pretty bad remake but this is not case rollerball does unthinkable gives psycho running its money as worst remake ever created by man chris klein every film he has been manages make it look as if he has no range at all his soft voice good looks can only go so far movie where you need beat living hell out another team member you want someone that can at least yell make sound beyond bird chirp ll cool j is only hear bring film cool hip look hes suppose be i dont give damn james dean character but it doesnt fly rebbeca romijn well she has nude scene but when its covered dark you wonder why she is even movie begin with rollerball is suppose be bloody entertaining film but mcteirnan at no point manages show us anything entertaining entire game sequences seem uninspired drawn out when it goes shock it misses misses completely im still wondering if ll cool js character is dead or alive but apparently its not important story ll cool j probably knew that this was going be garbage left movie leaving film crew make his character disappear i dont blame him not even professional himself jean reno save this film ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure seeing this film film about violence sports you would expect see some but when you have pg 13 rating you know that it was targeted make money nothing else i cant understand why someone would want see this film final action sequence is yet another let down this horrible tripe only thing that this film has going it is its 97 minute length so if you do have unfortunate experience sitting through it it will be over soon enough,0.6400962454736038,-0.07753192300362108,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.4}"
2.0,Rollerball is a pointless remake and a terrible film,"Rollerball is a bad movie that pretty much fails on every level. It's the year 2005 and the new sport of Rollerball is very popular. Marcus Ridley {LL Cool J} recruits his friend Jonathan Cross {Chris Klein} into the very dangerous sport which may not be that luxury as it seems. One of the games promoters will do anything to get higher ratings even if that means death. I have seen the original and after watching this I wonder why they took a very good film and just ruined it. Rollerball is a poorly written movie that lacks suspense and good action. The film is just really ridiculous at times that its hard to take serious. The dialog is really lame and the characters aren't very developed . The acting is terrible with the worst probably being Chris Klein who doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead. LL Cool J was alright but he just doesn't seem to be trying. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Jean Reno both do a decent job but like LL Cool J, they just don't seem to really be trying. I can't blame them though as the writing is horrible and they are not given a lot of material to work with. The film is a lot more violent then the original, however, the action is still not very impressive. It also doesn't help matters that the studio got scared and went for the PG-13 rating and so the editing looks very bad. The film is about 95 minutes long but it drags on forever since its just a really boring film. The film is also confusing as some of the events that occur in the film don't really make a lot of sense. At some point during the film you will most likely stop caring. If you have seen the original then you will hate this movie. If you haven't seen it then you might like this but that's not very likely. Its just better to see the original. Rollerball is a loud and terrible film that's worth skipping and its also one of the worst films of 2002.

,unimaginably bad,"`Rollerball' is a god-awful remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison film about a fictional sport in which murdering the players becomes a primary object of the game. The original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting the story sometime in the distant future. This version is set in the present, but it tries to maintain its believability by locating the league in Southwest Asia, under the parochial assumption, I suppose, that that part of the world is every bit as alien, exotic and dehumanized as any hypothetical future society. It doesn't work. It is simply impossible for us to believe even for a split second that the owners and promoters of this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live to millions of viewers the world over.  Might not the United Nations, among other international organizations, have a thing or two to say about all this? Also, will someone please explain to me just WHAT purpose is served by having the promoters of this sport killing off their own players? Doesn't that sort of deplete their own resources for future games? I can't imagine too many people willingly signing on to engage in this sort of gladiatorial tomfoolery.Even if we agreed to swallow the whole thing merely for the sake of the entertainment value of the film, we would be forced to admit that `Rollerball' is a chintzy, clunky, uninteresting movie in all respects. The sport itself  sort of a cross between motor cross racing, roller derby, hockey and basketball  is completely unexciting, consisting of little more than blurred figures racing madly around a cramped, claustrophobic track. Without even the context of good action sequences, `Rollerball' is forced to fall back on its dialogue and characters, which proves to be disastrous for all concerned. Chris Klein, in the role of hotshot Jonathon Cross - played by James Caan in the original - comes across as a minor league version of Keanu Reeves. LL Cool J is wasted in the part of Jonathon's American sidekick, and poor Jean Reno gets to play one of the most laughable villains we've run across in a movie in a long long long long time. In fact, this redux turns out to be good for nothing BUT a few hearty laughs. If you are in need of such, check out `Rollerball.' It's a real hoot.",unimaginably bad,rollerball is god awful remake 1975 norman jewison film about fictional sport which murdering players becomes primary object game original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting story sometime distant future this version is set present but it tries maintain its believability by locating league southwest asia under parochial assumption i suppose that that part world is every bit as alien exotic dehumanized as any hypothetical future society it doesnt work it is simply impossible us believe even split second that owners promoters this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live millions viewers world over might not united nations among other international organizations have thing or two say about all this also will someone please explain me just what purpose is served by having promoters this sport killing off their own players doesnt that sort deplete their own resources future games i cant imagine too many people willingly signing engage this sort gladiatorial tomfoolery even if we agreed swallow whole thing merely sake entertainment value film we would be forced admit that rollerball is chintzy clunky uninteresting movie all respects sport itself sort cross between motor cross racing roller derby hockey basketball is completely unexciting consisting little more than blurred figures racing madly around cramped claustrophobic track without even context good action sequences rollerball is forced fall back its dialogue characters which proves be disastrous all concerned chris klein role hotshot jonathon cross played by james caan original comes across as minor league version keanu reeves ll cool j is wasted part jonathons american sidekick poor jean reno gets play one most laughable villains weve run across movie long long long long time fact this redux turns out be good nothing but few hearty laughs if you are need such check out rollerball its real hoot,0.4364942528735632,-0.01819487983281087,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.51}"
1.0,How to get an awful mess remaking a good film,"I suspected 2002 ""Rollerball"" was an ugly movie, but not that ugly! Well, let's get rid of the only merit of the movie: the presence of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, beautiful and tremendously sexy. Indeed, a statuesque female warrior is always sexy, all the more with that alluring scar on her face.The tragic fact with ""Rollerball"" is that the story should be good, per se. The authors took the ideas from the original (and true) 1975 ""Rollerball"". They deleted the political and moral messages, which were somewhat a weakness of the 1975 film, and placed the story in some remote countries of a near future, allegedly ruled by violence, greed, abuse. But the way the film is made turns it into a disaster.There is an over-long (and boring) preamble, with a race down-hill of some cretinous youngsters, in San Francisco. This is a great narrative mistake. The audience is anxious to know about the Rollerball game, and you excruciate them with idiots, easily found, alas!, in everyday life. In the next scene Jonathan (a remarkably blunt Chris Klein) has become the undisputed superstar of the Rollerball. We don't understand anything of the rules of the game. As a matter of fact, we don't understand anything of the plot! The guys on the screen keep talking about other guys, seemingly killed by the bad ones, or something like that. Who are who? The audience utterly ignores it. The next scene (say: someone escaping from somewhere) has no logical connection with the previous one. I bet that in the final editing of the movie a good 30 minutes were cut, making the story a complete mess. The only thing we get is that the villains deliberately provoke accidents on the field to raise the TV audience of the game. And then there is the lousy greenish nocturnal scene. Up to my knowledge, the worst visual idea in the history of cinema. Some 15 minutes of sufferings for the innocent viewer. The ending is even more ludicrous than expected.But what is really incredible, even in a terrible movie, is that, in spite of the enormous technological improvements, the scenes of the game, and related special effects, are by far less spectacular, exciting, violent than those of the 1975 ""Rollerball"". The possibly interesting presence of women playing Rollerball is not exploited at all. The uniforms of the teams are worse than horrible, they are stupid.There's nothing to save in ""Rollerball"". Just take Romijn-Stamos and bring her to another movie (keeping the scar on her face, if possible).",how get awful mess remaking good film,i suspected 2002 rollerball was ugly movie but not that ugly well lets get rid only merit movie presence rebecca romijn stamos beautiful tremendously sexy indeed statuesque female warrior is always sexy all more with that alluring scar her face tragic fact with rollerball is that story should be good per se authors took ideas original true 1975 rollerball they deleted political moral messages which were somewhat weakness 1975 film placed story some remote countries near future allegedly ruled by violence greed abuse but way film is made turns it into disaster there is over long boring preamble with race down hill some cretinous youngsters san francisco this is great narrative mistake audience is anxious know about rollerball game you excruciate them with idiots easily found alas everyday life next scene jonathan remarkably blunt chris klein has become undisputed superstar rollerball we dont understand anything rules game as matter fact we dont understand anything plot guys screen keep talking about other guys seemingly killed by bad ones or something like that who are who audience utterly ignores it next scene say someone escaping somewhere has no logical connection with previous one i bet that final editing movie good 30 minutes were cut making story complete mess only thing we get is that villains deliberately provoke accidents field raise tv audience game then there is lousy greenish nocturnal scene up my knowledge worst visual idea history cinema some 15 minutes sufferings innocent viewer ending is even more ludicrous than expected but what is really incredible even terrible movie is that spite enormous technological improvements scenes game related special effects are by far less spectacular exciting violent than those 1975 rollerball possibly interesting presence women playing rollerball is not exploited at all uniforms teams are worse than horrible they are stupid theres nothing save rollerball just take romijn stamos bring her another movie keeping scar her face if possible,0.6052219921785138,-0.05975960432482172,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,Nowhere near close to being worth getting into the game for,"Norman Jewison's 1975 film 'Rollerball' is not a perfect film, it did have pacing issues, had heavy-handed moments and James Caan and John Houseman's characters were the only interestingly developed ones. The rollerball sequences however are truly exciting and harrowing, it's thought-provoking and relevant, it's well made and acted it has a powerful ending and it has some of the best use of classical music in film.Whatever faults the original had, it's a masterpiece compared to this dreadful mess, which makes all the few faults of the original, magnifies them by a thousand and makes a plethora's worth of flaws on top. The remake of 'Rollerball' not only fails spectacularly as a remake, down there as the worst and most pointless ones out there along with 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man' and 'Stepford Wives', but is catastrophically bad film in its own right. It is truly hard to believe that it was directed by the same man responsible for great films like 'The Hunt for Red October', 'Predator' and especially 'Die Hard'. One of the biggest falls in film quality ever and John McTiernan's worst film by a significant degree.Not even the usually game and more Jean Reno is enough to save it, but actually comes off the least badly. The acting is very poor, and this is at best, especially from a chronically wooden and personality deprived Chris Klein, in a role that even the best of actors working today would struggle to do anything with, and Rebecca Romijin-Stamos who doesn't even try to act. Character development may not have been a strong suit in the 1975 film, but at least the two lead characters were interesting. Here there were no interesting characters at all, all of them severely underwritten ciphers.McTiernan's direction has no style, personality, tension or energy of any kind, it's uncharacteristically incompetent career-worst and career-killing worthy direction and 'Rollerball' is a strong contender for the worst-directed film of that year. Don't expect good visuals either, 'Rollerball' is cheap, chaotic, too darkly lit and is to me has some of the worst editing for any film not to have SyFy or The Asylum's involvement. Eric Serra's, regular composer for Luc Besson's films, music score is never dynamic, in fact it's discordant and intrusive, and has nothing memorable about it.School sports days are more exciting and suspenseful than the action here, and considering they and bullying were the lowest points of my school life that is not a compliment. No sense of danger, no tension, too darkly lit, chaotically edited and sometimes incoherent as well as too clean and glossy for something actually intended to be very dangerous (when it did try to be more violent it was gratuitously so), a huge problem for a film where it features heavily at the expense of everything else. The ending is as wet as a drip and floppy as badly out of date cabbage.Dialogue is truly risible and should never have approved beyond first draft, and even earlier than that, the pace is so pedestrian the slowest snail moves faster in comparison and the story is redundant in all senses with no thrills or fun, lack of coherence is also an issue as is the jumbled structure.Altogether, a catastrophically bad mess with no redeeming values (not even Reno). In the top 10 of the worst and most pointless remakes ever and on its own terms as a film it's not much better, even worse actually. 1/10 Bethany Cox",nowhere near close being worth getting into game,norman jewisons 1975 film rollerball is not perfect film it did have pacing issues had heavy handed moments james caan john housemans characters were only interestingly developed ones rollerball sequences however are truly exciting harrowing its thought provoking relevant its well made acted it has powerful ending it has some best use classical music film whatever faults original had its masterpiece compared this dreadful mess which makes all few faults original magnifies them by thousand makes plethoras worth flaws top remake rollerball not only fails spectacularly as remake down there as worst most pointless ones out there along with psycho wicker man stepford wives but is catastrophically bad film its own right it is truly hard believe that it was directed by same man responsible great films like hunt red october predator especially die hard one biggest falls film quality ever john mctiernans worst film by significant degree not even usually game more jean reno is enough save it but actually comes off least badly acting is very poor this is at best especially chronically wooden personality deprived chris klein role that even best actors working today would struggle do anything with rebecca romijin stamos who doesnt even try act character development may not have been strong suit 1975 film but at least two lead characters were interesting here there were no interesting characters at all all them severely underwritten ciphers mctiernans direction has no style personality tension or energy any kind its uncharacteristically incompetent career worst career killing worthy direction rollerball is strong contender worst directed film that year dont expect good visuals either rollerball is cheap chaotic too darkly lit is me has some worst editing any film not have syfy or asylums involvement eric serras regular composer luc bessons films music score is never dynamic fact its discordant intrusive has nothing memorable about it school sports days are more exciting suspenseful than action here considering they bullying were lowest points my school life that is not compliment no sense danger no tension too darkly lit chaotically edited sometimes incoherent as well as too clean glossy something actually intended be very dangerous when it did try be more violent it was gratuitously so huge problem film where it features heavily at expense everything else ending is as wet as drip floppy as badly out date cabbage dialogue is truly risible should never have approved beyond first draft even earlier than that pace is so pedestrian slowest snail moves faster comparison story is redundant all senses with no thrills or fun lack coherence is also issue as is jumbled structure altogether catastrophically bad mess with no redeeming values not even reno top 10 worst most pointless remakes ever its own terms as film its not much better even worse actually 1 10 bethany cox,0.557446454008954,0.00040095899470899793,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,What channel did you say you gave us in your territory?,"In the original film, the game attempted to stand as an outlet of Corporation superiority; constantly demonstrating to the consumers (the people) that individuality is futile. Apparently, one does not have to either read the screenplay or physically watch the original film for there to be a remake. Decent director John McTiernan, who ""wow-ed"" me with such films as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair as well as his early cult hits like Die Hard and Predator has obviously lost his ability to either A) do remakes or B) handle a camera with any sense of decency. If I was allowed one question to have answered through the course of my life, my question would be, ""What was the point of Rollerball the remake?"", and I do believe there would be answer from any higher authority. This film single handedly goes down in the record books as not just the worst remake to come out of Hollywood, but it is also a double threat, with it being in the top 100 of worst films ever conceived. It is embarrassing to say, but it has to be said, that Rollerball is one of a few select films that demonstrated no ability in the fields of direction, acting, cinematography, or writing. Nothing, I repeat, nothing of value can be found with this film, and I even tried hard, but one must easily look at this film and simply state, ""It failed"".There was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather sci-fi-esquire type game, but when you look at it, there is nothing special about the sport. The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world, the surrounding environment, as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun. Yet somehow, this 2002 version is able to call itself a ""science fiction"" merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future. Three. Whole. Years. That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out. The writing was atrocious to say the least. It felt as if the writers of this film, one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue (odd, this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes  ouchers!), took random ideas, threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes. No doubtably procrastination was an issue, and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters, huge plot points, and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer. Nothing, in the form of script, plot, or action/adventure is worth mentioning in this film. Words came out of the actor's mouths, but they meant nothing, they stood for nothing, and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt. Again, there was no value in this film.Chris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time (I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films), so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man, but you can't make cardboard stand on his own. Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film  is that possible? The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion; he was together with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for purely the physical admiration, and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry. I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using ""night vision"" for dramatic purposes, and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind. It was hilarity on a grand scale. I remember the pair talking about something, but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering. Nothing (which seems to be the common theme of this film) is of value in this film. That isn't to say that those like LL, Jean Reno, Stamos, or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better. Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills, but Reno was completely over the top, which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially, Andrews was nothing more than filler, Stamos was used for the nudity  that was all, and LL kept the ""hip-ness"" factor on a grander scale. Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.Rollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name. Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about, films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes. I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say, ""This is my best work yet!"" If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company, I would reconsider the release. Writing was far worse that imaginable, the acting was nowhere to be seen, and the cinematography (something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review) felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera. Honestly, I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer. Why is this film still being distributed? My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking.

2.0,Never to be confused with the 1975 classic.,"The ""Rollerball"" movie from 1975 was brilliant because although the film was violent, it was much deeper had a lot to say about humanity--our love of violence and how easily we can be led and controlled with sports. The film was brilliant on so many levels. So, some brilliant persons thought it was a great idea to update the film...make a new version which removed all the wonderful social commentary and left us with violence and not much more. Is it any wonder that the film is currently rated #39 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List? After all, folks who loved the original were sure to be angry when offered a slick but neutered version of the classic.Early into the film, I could see why many viewers disliked this remake. The game was totally changed. Instead of the relatively simple roller derby-style game, this one includes ramps, tunnels and explosions. But the part that got me was how confusing the new game was...and the announcer even said that the game was too complicated to explain!! Didn't this make the filmmakers the least bit concerned?! In addition, the film featured all sorts of eccentric players--with court jester hats, dragon masks and more. Now remember...the original film was AGAINST folks in the game standing out and being unique! To top it off, Jean Reno's character then is heard that he's happy that the integrity of the game has been maintained...unlike in other sports! Huh??The bottom line is that if the original film had never been made, ""Rollerball"" (2002) would have still been seen as a poor film. But in light of how many people loved the original and well crafted it was, watching this film is sure to frustrate most viewers....especially since a remake didn't have to be terrible and mindless.",never be confused with 1975 classic,rollerball movie 1975 was brilliant because although film was violent it was much deeper had lot say about humanity our love violence how easily we can be led controlled with sports film was brilliant so many levels so some brilliant persons thought it was great idea update film make new version which removed all wonderful social commentary left us with violence not much more is it any wonder that film is currently rated imdbs infamous bottom 100 list after all folks who loved original were sure be angry when offered slick but neutered version classic early into film i could see why many viewers disliked this remake game was totally changed instead relatively simple roller derby style game this one includes ramps tunnels explosions but part that got me was how confusing new game was announcer even said that game was too complicated explain didnt this make filmmakers least bit concerned addition film featured all sorts eccentric players with court jester hats dragon masks more now remember original film was against folks game standing out being unique top it off jean renos character then is heard that hes happy that integrity game has been maintained unlike other sports huh bottom line is that if original film had never been made rollerball 2002 would have still been seen as poor film but light how many people loved original well crafted it was watching this film is sure frustrate most viewers especially since remake didnt have be terrible mindless,0.6197779803042959,0.1179425837320574,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"

,Plain dreadful film.,"I was really speechless after watching ""Rollerball"". I expected a dull movie, not something so dreadful. ""Rollerball"" has all the elements to make one of those bizarre cult classics from the 70's and 80's. Except the fun element.The movie starts with the worst police chase in years. Believe me, any Lorenzo Lamas movie, even one featuring appearances from Dolph Lundgren, can be capable of a car chase better than this: we see Chris Klein running from police in a mix of skateboard and racing-car, in San Francisco. Then, helped by his friend LL Cool J., he goes to an Asiatic country. There, the most popular game is the Rollerball, a mix of basketball and roller-skating that seems to be deadly and a great money-maker. Rollerball is controlled by Jean Reno's character, the average ""mad-business-man"" stereotype. Then, we learn that Chris Klein is having an affair with his Rollerball partner, Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos.What comes next is not worth telling. Of course, Chris, LL and Rebbeca will make a rebellion against Jean Reno. But there isn't anything new in this idea. It's wasted by a script that, once tries to make a cheap social critic, then tries to shove action sequences in the screen at all coasts, and both are really bad.The acting is at the last level. It's incredible to see Jean Reno, an actor that is mostly great (watch ""Red Rivers"") making such a mess with his role. It's so stereotyped and has so less to do (despite it's importance in the plot) that you can completely forget about it. LL Cool J. is a special case: he keep going well for a while, and then completely disappears, showing that, maybe, good acting wasn't allowed in Rollerball rules.Oh, the main couple. Chris Klein and Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos. Well, Rebbeca is incredibly sexy in this role, and it's nice to see her in topless scenes, so we can forget she's so bad here. And Klein. Let's just say Chris Klein will NEVER work in an action movie anymore. At least we hope so.In the end, the movie is a complete mess. Is not only a waste of money, but also waste of time, celluloid and Jean Reno. That is a complete sin.

1.0,Rollerball,"I had heard of this film long before the original 1975 Norman Jewison/James Caan version it is based on, mainly because of the leading actor and the fact that it's not rated well, I am relieved I watched the original before this remake, directed by John McTiernan (Predator, Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October). Basically in 2005, Rollerball is a sport that has become hugely popular in Central Asia, Russia, China, Mongolia and Turkey, it is an extraordinarily violent extension of roller derby involving motorcycles, a metal ball, and many trappings similar to professional wrestling. Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) invites NHL (National Hockey League) hopeful Jonathan Cross (American Pie's Chris Klein) to become part of a team of rollerball, Jonathan soon becomes the star player, and the poster child of promoter Alexi Petrovich (Jean Reno). Jonathan at first enamoured by the high- octane sport, the fame and popularity, and with female teammate Aurora (Razzie nominated Rebecca Romijn), but he and Ridley discover cynical Alexi and his opportunistic assistant Sanjay (Lost's Naveen Andrews) want to keep the game popular, through planned gory ""accidents"", and ensuring Jonathan and Ridley will not quit and remain high-profile stars. Aurora is almost killed in an accident, so to save themselves Jonathan and Ridley flee the country, but they are followed by Alexi and several body guards, before they can reach the Russian border, the two are attacked, and Ridley is killed. Alexi tries to stage a public execution for Jonathan, following the escape attempt, by removing all the regular rules of Rollerball for the upcoming match, however Jonathan, with the help of his teammates, start a revolution, and cause the fans to see the sport for what it really is, a violent game where blood brings in the audience figures, and Alexi is killed as a result. Also starring Oleg Taktarov as Denekin, David Hemblen as Serokin, Janet Wright as Coach Olga, Mike Dopud as Michael 'The Assassin' and Kata Dobó as Katya, with cameo appearances by P!nk, Slipknot and Paul Heyman. I assumed Klein missed being in American Pie: The Wedding to be in this, this turned out to be untrue, he lacks charisma to be the lead, Romijn just looks gorgeous and doesn't do much, and the rest of the well known stars like Cool J, Reno and Andrews are silly. Cool J admitted the movie ""sucked"", but did his ""duty"" to promote it, he really should not have bothered, the performances are wooden, the story is full of clichés, and the pacy rollerball sequences and action set pieces are worthless, there are no thrills to be had here, it is one of the most boring films I've seen in years, a highly dull and pointless science-fiction sports drama.

The plot is some muddled mess about the future in which some insane sport is run, and someone finds out about there being some cheating going on in it... I don't know, I think the biggest problem was that I really didn't give a damn. Some new sport is started, and it's worse than the rest... so? Don't participate in the bloody thing. Some people start cheating in order to win or make it more interesting or whatever... so? Isn't that what all sports are about? To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been a completely honest type of sports that was completely devoid of cheaters since... well, ever. That's what we do, us humans. We challenge each other to find someone who's better at one particular thing and cheat if we don't think we can win. What else is new? In case you haven't figured it out by yourself yet, no, I don't care for sports. The pacing is awful and tries the viewers patience, whilst the editing does its best to supply him/her with a sturdy migraine, usually successful. The editing, score and dialog clearly does what it can to seem 'hip', cool and fresh, mostly just resulting in more bodily pain(now it's not just your brain that hurts due to it trying hard to understand the pure crap the plot and the film in general is, now your ears will be bleeding from the noise and your eyes will be flinching from the quick, pointless cuts that try far too hard to be stylish). McTiernan, one question. What the hell is wrong with you? OK, maybe you were never *that* talented... but Last Action Hero was at the very least solid and Die Hard was good. How did you slide so low down the talent ladder? One of the steps broke and you didn't grab a hold of it, is that it? The acting is dire. Not that it's any surprise, really... come on, admit it, LL Cool J can't act, we all know it; and apparently, neither can Chris Klein, if his performance in this mess is anything to go by(guess he just got lucky in the American Pie films). The characters are poorly written clichés that we don't care even the slightest bit about. The whole film is an unforgivable mess of a somewhat decent idea with absolutely no redeeming qualities. See the first version or just skip this one altogether. I recommend this to mindless sports fans or teenagers who like loud noises and break-neck speed editing. 1/10",whatever you do dont ever as much as consider watching this poor excuse film,after watching this well watching occasionally glancing at it which unsurprisingly was more than enough pick up plot i have wonder about its placing as bottom 100 list personally id have rated it much higher its one worst films ever made without doubt plot is some muddled mess about future which some insane sport is run someone finds out about there being some cheating going it i dont know i think biggest problem was that i really didnt give damn some new sport is started its worse than rest so dont participate bloody thing some people start cheating order win or make it more interesting or whatever so isnt that what all sports are about best my knowledge there hasnt been completely honest type sports that was completely devoid cheaters since well ever thats what we do us humans we challenge each other find someone whos better at one particular thing cheat if we dont think we can win what else is new case you havent figured it out by yourself yet no i dont care sports pacing is awful tries viewers patience whilst editing does its best supply him her with sturdy migraine usually successful editing score dialog clearly does what it can seem hip cool fresh mostly just resulting more bodily pain now its not just your brain that hurts due it trying hard understand pure crap plot film general is now your ears will be bleeding noise your eyes will be flinching quick pointless cuts that try far too hard be stylish mctiernan one question what hell is wrong with you ok maybe you were never that talented but last action hero was at very least solid die hard was good how did you slide so low down talent ladder one steps broke you didnt grab hold it is that it acting is dire not that its any surprise really come admit it ll cool j cant act we all know it apparently neither can chris klein if his performance this mess is anything go by guess he just got lucky american pie films characters are poorly written clich s that we dont care even slightest bit about whole film is unforgivable mess somewhat decent idea with absolutely no redeeming qualities see first version or just skip this one altogether i recommend this mindless sports fans or teenagers who like loud noises break neck speed editing 1 10,0.47992666389926675,0.07111585522544424,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.22}"

2.0,Rollerballs !,"I wasn't expecting much. In fact the poorest of poor reviews that this film received had made me curious enough to watch this it (for free on cable I might add). Firstly I should say that I am not a huge fan of the original movie, it is a reasonable action film, so my dislike does not stem from a loyalty to the first incarnation of this story. My dislike for the 2002 Rollerball comes from a feeling of being patronized by everyone involved in the making of this movie. How did the producers ever think that this was acceptable on any level? The acting is second rate but what is to be expected from one of the worst casts ever assembled? Klein is worthless unless he is making a joke of his own persona (Election), LLcoolJ is one of a string of rappers that should never be given a 'tough guy' role simply because of his real profession and Reno, the one talented actor among them, seems to slip into pantomime dame territory. I will give Paul Heyman praise for his character as the English announcer, he seems to come across as a decent and fairly charasmatic actor but he does little that he doesn't do brilliantly in his day job.The attempted satire relating to the commercialisation of sport and its reliance on violence is pathetically toothless. The direction is simply a mess. The attempt to make this non-sensical sport look breathtaking through rapid editing and instant replay is awful. It does nothing but make you realize that restrained directing and editing are a wonderful thing. Rollerball represents everything that is wrong with mainstream Hollywood movies. It shows a lack the of originality, does this version add anything to the original version?, that has dogged film for years. I cannot believe that there are so few new ideas that we have to see cult action movies, cult British crime movies and television shows remade over and over again. This movie should be avoided at all costs.",rollerballs,i wasnt expecting much fact poorest poor reviews that this film received had made me curious enough watch this it free cable i might add firstly i should say that i am not huge fan original movie it is reasonable action film so my dislike does not stem loyalty first incarnation this story my dislike 2002 rollerball comes feeling being patronized by everyone involved making this movie how did producers ever think that this was acceptable any level acting is second rate but what is be expected one worst casts ever assembled klein is worthless unless he is making joke his own persona election llcoolj is one string rappers that should never be given tough guy role simply because his real profession reno one talented actor among them seems slip into pantomime dame territory i will give paul heyman praise his character as english announcer he seems come across as decent fairly charasmatic actor but he does little that he doesnt do brilliantly his day job attempted satire relating commercialisation sport its reliance violence is pathetically toothless direction is simply mess attempt make this non sensical sport look breathtaking through rapid editing instant replay is awful it does nothing but make you realize that restrained directing editing are wonderful thing rollerball represents everything that is wrong with mainstream hollywood movies it shows lack originality does this version add anything original version that has dogged film years i cannot believe that there are so few new ideas that we have see cult action movies cult british crime movies television shows remade over over again this movie should be avoided at all costs,0.5681086931086932,0.0703146328146328,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
2.0,One of the worst films to ever receive an international cinematic release,"Right then, lets review the 2002 Gen Xtreme remake of 1975's Rollerball staring American Pie's Chris Klein, LL Cool J with cameo appearances by Pink, Slipknot, that Paul Heyman guy as a sports commentator, Shane McMahon as a supporting artist and all this was directed by the guy who directed Die Hard. What the hell is this?Ok, unsurprisingly for a film currently rated 34 in IMDB's bottom 100, there's a lot to unpack here. Straight outta the gate, Rollerball is an abstruse wall of noise featuring quality nu-metal, garish cyberpunk art direction, out of control sound design, several languages and twice the amount of accents. Everyone but Paul Hayman is miscast. There is an entire five minute sequence in this film filtered in green night vision because it was from a dirt cheap done amateur hour re-shoot of a scene that itself was too poorly lit for purpose. The editing is so abysmal throughout, it makes Suicide Squad look like The Wild Bunch.From my research, a picture is painted of 2002's Rollerball having one of the most botch-ladened productions of it's time. Several screenplay rewrites, all time worst test screenings, poorly produced re-shoots and a relationship between above the line crew and studio executives so toxic, the director pulled a Watergate and hired a private investigator to illegally wiretap the producer in an effort to get him fired. Need i say more. Oh, LL Cool J, not so hot as hell in this, i gotta say.Except for the ending which really kicks into gear in the last five minutes and almost achieves something resembling gravitas, the Rollerball remake is every bit as terrible you have been led to believe.",one worst films ever receive international cinematic release,right then lets review 2002 gen xtreme remake 1975s rollerball staring american pies chris klein ll cool j with cameo appearances by pink slipknot that paul heyman guy as sports commentator shane mcmahon as supporting artist all this was directed by guy who directed die hard what hell is this ok unsurprisingly film currently rated 34 imdbs bottom 100 theres lot unpack here straight outta gate rollerball is abstruse wall noise featuring quality nu metal garish cyberpunk art direction out control sound design several languages twice amount accents everyone but paul hayman is miscast there is entire five minute sequence this film filtered green night vision because it was dirt cheap done amateur hour re shoot scene that itself was too poorly lit purpose editing is so abysmal throughout it makes suicide squad look like wild bunch my research picture is painted 2002s rollerball having one most botch ladened productions its time several screenplay rewrites all time worst test screenings poorly produced re shoots relationship between above line crew studio executives so toxic director pulled watergate hired private investigator illegally wiretap producer effort get him fired need i say more oh ll cool j not so hot as hell this i gotta say except ending which really kicks into gear last five minutes almost achieves something resembling gravitas rollerball remake is every bit as terrible you have been led believe,0.4361832611832611,-0.025937950937950933,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,"Achingly, horrifyingly, stunningly bad","A certain film critic -- I believe it was the NY Times reviewer -- labeled ""Battlefield Earth"" as, to paraphrase, ""what will become known in infamy as the worst film of the 21st century."" He was wrong. ""Rollerball"" wins hands down. The acting, dialogue and direction are incomparably bad -- and I defy anyone to sit down after watching the movie once and effectively explain the plots, character motivations, or any of the rules of the Rollerball game. This is the most poorly-edited major studio film I've seen since ""Superman IV,"" which is still my least favorite movie of all time. There are at least five or six very, very obvious dubs over the f-word, clearly done late in the game to obtain a PG-13 rating. This is fine for an airing on network television, but for an R-rated DVD? Um, no. Others here have already eviscerated the ridiculous night-vision sentence effectively, so I won't go there. The only thing remotely worth watching in this film is the opening luge sequence.",achingly horrifyingly stunningly bad,certain film critic i believe it was ny times reviewer labeled battlefield earth as paraphrase what will become known infamy as worst film 21st century he was wrong rollerball wins hands down acting dialogue direction are incomparably bad i defy anyone sit down after watching movie once effectively explain plots character motivations or any rules rollerball game this is most poorly edited major studio film ive seen since superman iv which is still my least favorite movie all time there are at least five or six very very obvious dubs over f word clearly done late game obtain pg 13 rating this is fine airing network television but r rated dvd um no others here have already eviscerated ridiculous night vision sentence effectively so i wont go there only thing remotely worth watching this film is opening luge sequence,0.5413286302175191,-0.07596266901822454,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.37}"
