10.0,More Western than 'The Western' itself,"In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.Are you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you.But are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can't you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.The almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it's uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.Charles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo's in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.In a tavern the man meets Manuel 'Cheyenne' Guti√©rrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn't be an overrated luxury.The 'damsel in distress' (although she isn't in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn't want to cross.They are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.And finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you'd like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!The soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes' theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I'd do it.Sergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up. So when all pieces of the puzzle fall into place to the score of Ennio Morricone, how can one not be moved by it?For Leone, there was no better way to reach the top of the Western genre.And for us, there never will be a film that is more Western than 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.",more western than western itself,full silence three mysterious men long trench coats wait remote train station their faces have anticipation written all over them even while most interesting things they can find do are toying with fly drinking water hat cracking their fingers dog runs past windmill squeaks ticket vendor is locked away heath bounces off wooden platform men sweat are you bored yet then this movie is probably not you but are you dying know what three men are waiting does light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description cant you wait tension resolve then this movie is all you ever wanted almost lawless world where outlaws bandits roam country with ease that is setting story is shown by tonino delli colli director photography all its splendorous grandeur its uncountable little details set pieces costumes real life locations arizona utah make everything believable together with characters figurants everything creates vibrant utterly believable western civilisation charles bronson plays man with harmonica lone wolf looking something that he chooses not reveal anyone until he gets it character with no name roaming endless fields under sun announcing his presence at all times with same melody he plays his harmonica that echos unsettling way bronson does this brilliantly with face that overflows with held back emotions determination that is downright scary tavern man meets manuel cheyenne guti rrez jason robards bandit that recently escaped being hung by neck re joining his band outlaws with already greying hair he takes situation that arises area trying his part be hero that saves day robards portrays character that by only one look at him we can see how years have shaped him his performance is outstanding we want grab drink with cheyenne but we also get feeling that being your guard around him wouldnt be overrated luxury damsel distress although she isnt original meaning word jill mcbain played by claudia cardinale turns into toy fate itself without any warning she gets involved something quite over her head but she handles it masterfully she refuses return new orleans with her tail between her legs stays face difficulties put before her cardinale playing jill is both erotic marvel woman you wouldnt want cross they are all opposed by frank henry fonda local gang leader with heart stone business proposal at ready at all times with his ruthless blue eyes his gun at ready he keeps town quiet fonda gives you creeps with just one gaze at camera every sentence leaves bitter taste malfeasance finally gabriele ferzetti finishes line main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal crippled railroad baron morton character that youd like slap face but one you feel pity as well outstandingly brought soundtrack is composed by never beaten maestro film scoring himself ennio morricone his genius lies creation themes melodies that will haunt your dreams forever better or worse melancholic main theme that is brought with heavenly choir draws tears your eyes after hearing only couple chords theme man with harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic cheyennes theme creates lighter counter points movie morricone uses these motifs ingeniously hinting at plot points character motifs feelings giving you sense world movie takes place if i could give twelve out ten stars score id do it sergio leone was masterful director no need prove that he manages turn even scene seven minutes where three men are merely waiting train into epic storyline two hours three quarters tension builds then resolves partially always building towards end that finale that finale that finale chilled me bone throughout film question after question is raised when one question is answered another one pops up so when all pieces puzzle fall into place score ennio morricone how can one not be moved by it leone there was no better way reach top western genre us there never will be film that is more western than once upon time west,0.508140933140933,0.10156926406926407,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,It doesn't get any better than this: this is movie history,"This one only gets better with each viewing. Leone's masterful storytelling and Morricone's crazy, beautiful, epic soundtrack; desperate, haunted faces which look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in THE ultimate western finale.As in Leone's previous films, music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story, or perhaps even more: Morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film. Anyone who thought that the so called ""Spaghetti westerns"" were nothing but cheap, violent B-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film.

9.0,thumping good Western with an almost operatic quality,"One of the great classics : a riveting, wildly immersive Western set against the historical backdrop of the expansion of the railroads. The Ennio Morricone music is rousing, the scenery is jaw-dropping and the various characters spring to colourful life.This last fact owes much to the casting, which includes a bit of truly inspired counter-casting : actor Henry Fonda, used to playing pretty decent guys, takes on the sable-black persona of an amoral middle-aged mercenary fully capable of killing random children. It's a marvellously chilling performance - but wait for the ending of the movie, where a short flash-back shows the mercenary as a young man already much given to taunting and torturing. Fonda takes on a sick, twisted intensity that can only be described as diabolical.Now this is a long and intense movie which requires attentive viewing, meaning that it is a good idea to create an intermission and watch it in two parts.

9.0,"""When you've killed Four, it's easy to make it five.""","In the annals of western film lore, there are good and bad films. This is one of the finest. Because ""Once Upon A Time in The West"" is such a remarkable film, it is hard to define what makes it so memorable. The story centers on a beautiful former prostitute called Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) who arrives to assume the role of wife to a stubborn, crazy, red-headed Irishman with a dream. Waiting, instead is tragedy and 'Mr. Morton' who is a powerful, but ailing land grabbing baron (Gabriele Ferzetti) who desires to crush everything and everyone who stands in his way to reach the Pacific ocean with his railroad. To help him is an equally ruthless gunfighter named Frank (Henry Fonda; the success of this movie owes much to Fonda who plays a very convincing heavy) who has been removing obstacles for years and now targets the McBain family for death and that includes Jill. Unfortunately for Frank, he has accrued many enemies over the years with one particular, mysterious and deadly Harmonica playing stranger seeking revenge. Frank arranges for three of his best and fastest gun hands to meet and eliminate the stranger at the train-station. Joining the instrument playing stranger is an unpredictable, half-breed, renegade, who is a notorious gunfighter called 'Cheyenne.' ( Jason Robards ) The entire film is a triumph to the superb direction of Sergio Leone, who christens each major character with their own theme song. Each theme was created by Ennio Morricone and when the character makes an entrance, the theme prepares the audience for mood change, drama, action, and lifelong memories. Special guest appearances, by Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn and Lionel Stander add to the classic nature of this excellent story. ****",when youve killed four its easy make it five,annals western film lore there are good bad films this is one finest because once upon time west is such remarkable film it is hard define what makes it so memorable story centers beautiful former prostitute called jill mcbain claudia cardinale who arrives assume role wife stubborn crazy red headed irishman with dream waiting instead is tragedy mr morton who is powerful but ailing land grabbing baron gabriele ferzetti who desires crush everything everyone who stands his way reach pacific ocean with his railroad help him is equally ruthless gunfighter named frank henry fonda success this movie owes much fonda who plays very convincing heavy who has been removing obstacles years now targets mcbain family death that includes jill unfortunately frank he has accrued many enemies over years with one particular mysterious deadly harmonica playing stranger seeking revenge frank arranges three his best fastest gun hands meet eliminate stranger at train station joining instrument playing stranger is unpredictable half breed renegade who is notorious gunfighter called cheyenne jason robards entire film is triumph superb direction sergio leone who christens each major character with their own theme song each theme was created by ennio morricone when character makes entrance theme prepares audience mood change drama action lifelong memories special guest appearances by woody strode jack elam keenan wynn lionel stander add classic nature this excellent story,0.5609395109395112,0.14760296010296012,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,"Without a doubt, one of the best Westerns of all time","I won't claim to have the ability to say anything new about this movie. It's been around for nearly fifty years, and is widely regarded as not just one the best Spaghetti Westerns of all time, but one of the best Westerns full stop. And it's not hard to see why: an incredible soundtrack, strong performances from the entire main cast, some surprisingly good humour and funny one-liners, a few tense sequences, a well-told story that doesn't rely on excessive dialogue or exposition, and consistently amazing cinematography and direction throughout. At least half the frames in this movie would probably make good paintings- no exaggeration.It's probably the marriage of the great visuals and soundtrack that make Once Upon a Time in the West work as well as it does. There's a good number of dramatic camera movements and interesting reveals that are tied up perfectly with the music- almost like some kind of singing-free musical at some points.Sergio Leone was one of the greatest directors of all time. It's a real shame that he apparently never got the kind of recognition he gets nowadays while he was still alive. Out of all his films, there's a strong argument to be made for this one being the closest to perfect. Honestly, there's not a lot that could be changed to make it better. My biggest direct gripe is the way the title pops up at the very end of the film, and rotates in a full circle before it disappears. It looks really cheesy, and comes close to killing the mood the otherwise extremely strong ending creates. While we're on complaints, another minor one would be that I want to say the film feels a little too long- maybe about 10 to 15 minutes. But at the same time, I wouldn't really know what to cut. Every scene is so well-constructed and orchestrated, and there's always something interesting to look at or listen to or think about, so I'm not really sure what should be cut. It's a pretty weak complaint, I know. Like I said, this thing's close to perfect.The Good The Bad and The Ugly might be a tiny bit more entertaining, and Once Upon a Time in America might have a slightly better soundtrack and stronger emotional moments (for me, personally), but it's still really hard to find much to complain about here. Absolutely recommended to any Western fan, and it gets a little better every time I watch it (four for me now, and counting).",without doubt one best westerns all time,i wont claim have ability say anything new about this movie its been around nearly fifty years is widely regarded as not just one best spaghetti westerns all time but one best westerns full stop its not hard see why incredible soundtrack strong performances entire main cast some surprisingly good humour funny one liners few tense sequences well told story that doesnt rely excessive dialogue or exposition consistently amazing cinematography direction throughout at least half frames this movie would probably make good paintings no exaggeration its probably marriage great visuals soundtrack that make once upon time west work as well as it does theres good number dramatic camera movements interesting reveals that are tied up perfectly with music almost like some kind singing free musical at some points sergio leone was one greatest directors all time its real shame that he apparently never got kind recognition he gets nowadays while he was still alive out all his films theres strong argument be made this one being closest perfect honestly theres not lot that could be changed make it better my biggest direct gripe is way title pops up at very end film rotates full circle before it disappears it looks really cheesy comes close killing mood otherwise extremely strong ending creates while were complaints another minor one would be that i want say film feels little too long maybe about 10 15 minutes but at same time i wouldnt really know what cut every scene is so well constructed orchestrated theres always something interesting look at or listen or think about so im not really sure what should be cut its pretty weak complaint i know like i said this things close perfect good bad ugly might be tiny bit more entertaining once upon time america might have slightly better soundtrack stronger emotional moments me personally but its still really hard find much complain about here absolutely recommended any western fan it gets little better every time i watch it four me now counting,0.5654845557019469,0.24128787878787872,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.23}"

8.0,"Hey, it's slow on purpose. Is that a good thing? When it's this gorgeous, yes.","Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)On the heels of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is this equally sprawling and archetypal Western, this time with less obvious dubbing, and Henry Fonda as a kind of tie in to Hollywood's hero paradigm. It's indescribably beautiful, one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed, indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details, small ones, shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable, quite, but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film, as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believable--even the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.Plot? You might, at times, wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys, and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist, unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns, even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear, in the last twenty minutes, it's again archetypal (and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in ""Good Bad and Ugly""). A small bit of slow motion (not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already) makes clear this is the key moment in the film, the thing that made the rest of it, with all its confusing and violent layers, sensible.For my money, I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff, the sounds and sights, filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict, not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked, or swept away, or impressed, or dazzled, but I'm actually never moved, not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move us--including feeling for the woman's plight, rather than simply recognizing that it is, after all, quite a plight.Still, another landmark Sergio Leone movie.",hey its slow purpose is that good thing when its this gorgeous yes,once upon time west 1968 heels good bad ugly is this equally sprawling archetypal western this time with less obvious dubbing henry fonda as kind tie hollywoods hero paradigm its indescribably beautiful one most gorgeous westerns ever photographed indeed model good visual directing cinematography any genre that alone makes almost three hours pure pleasure but its not fast movie any other way it cant be it depends lingering over delicious details small ones shot up close startling detail ever deadpan looks steely eyes nothing is believable its not meant be its not even fable quite but more celebration being inside incredible film as strange as that sounds not that scenes are not believable even very last shots makeshift town railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets great stuff plot you might at times wonder where plot went there are lots bad guys youre not totally sure theres protagonist unless one woman movie is center our concerns even if she is clearly bystander it all when it gets clear last twenty minutes its again archetypal has echoes over tops showdown good bad ugly small bit slow motion not needed normally movie where everything is slow already makes clear this is key moment film thing that made rest it with all its confusing violent layers sensible my money id love all this incredible visceral stuff sounds sights filled with some kind deeply felt conflict not purely dramatic one i watch am shocked or swept away or impressed or dazzled but im actually never moved not heart there are plenty aspects here that should really move us including feeling womans plight rather than simply recognizing that it is after all quite plight still another landmark sergio leone movie,0.558887543718052,0.09671105730427763,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.18}"

,"""Something To Do With Death""","Sergio goes Hollywood for this big-name, big-budget Spaghetti Western. Fonda, Bronson, Robards and Cardinale queue up and take Leone's choreographic direction in an epic tale of blood and revenge.Frank is a bad guy who has killed a lot of people. He now works for a railroad entrepreneur whose ruthless sterile tracks are spreading ever westward. The time has come for the real Americans to confront both the railroad and Frank.Leone sat down with film intellectuals Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento and watched dozens of Hollywood westerns. From this saturation-viewing emerged a 300-page treatment which was eventually distilled into the script, penned by Leone and Sergio Donati. There are conscious echoes of ""Shane"" and ""High Noon"" in the meticulously-plotted screenplay. Ennio Morricone apparently sat in on the planning stage and had composed the score in toto before shooting began, the reverese of the usual process of fitting music to existing footage. The result is a tight matching of soundtrack and visuals. Robards, Bronson and Cardinale each have musical 'signatures' which play whenever their characters are onscreen. Bronson's is an eerily-wailing harmonica, Robards has the plonking banjo and Cardinale the lush strings. So intricately was everything structured that the themes were available to be played on set, so that the actors could co-ordinate every nuance of gesture to fit with the score.The film is a grandiose lament to the death of the Wild West. Decay is everywhere to be seen. Streets, bars, buildings and people all have a beat-up, grungy look. When Cheyenne (Robards) pauses beside a rough-hewn wooden post, there is little difference in texture between his face and the post. Morton the cripple is killing the romantic West of open spaces with his ""snail trail"" of railroad tracks, leaving the fine adventurous men (Cheyenne and Harmonica) nowhere to go.There can be few opening scenes with the visual and aural brilliance of this one. Three bad guys stake out Flagstone's railroad depot in a High Noon pastiche. Jack Elam (who was actually in ""High Noon"") leads the villains. The only spoken words throughout this long (but totally gripping) scene are uttered by the old station clerk. Haunting rhythms raise the tension to an unbearable pitch ... the squeaking windmill, the chattering tickertape, the creaking bench. This wonderful crescendo climaxes with the appearance of Bronson, a sequence as stylised and choreographed as a Shinto ceremony, all the more effective for the absence of spontaneity.Equal to and counterbalancing this scene is the very next one, the introduction of Frank. This time it is ""Shane"" that gets the treatment as the McBain boy spots five men in yellow duster topcoats. A growing sense of unease on the McBain homestead is beautifully conveyed (was the stopping of a cicada chirp ever so effective?) A cinematic multiple orgasm ensues, with the musical theme crashing in as the boy sees the devastation, and the camera swoops round to reveal the baddie to be none other than Henry Fonda as Morricone's trademark solitary tubular bell peals out.Cheyenne's entrance is also a piece of impressive cinema. Inside Lionel Stander's strange labyrinthine tavern, quite unlike any saloon ever filmed before, the violence which hovers around Cheyenne like a dustcloud is heard but not seen, preparing us for his appearance in person. The sliding of the lamp towards Bronson works brilliantly, the film's two good men sharing the light of humour, the symbolic forging of a meaningful friendship.By a slow accretion, the plot reveals itself. The leviathan of the railroad must be stopped, and there must be a reckoning with Frank. Gradually the fates of the main characters converge, and swim into sharp focus for the shoot-out.It is not the story, excellent though that is, which lingers in the memory, but rather a hundred individual flashes of brilliance: Claudia Cardinale (are those eyes for real?) filmed on the bed, viewed vertically downward, through a lace canopy: Cheyenne's surprise method of concealing himself on the train: Morton (""when you're not on that train, you're like a turtle out of its shell"") imprisoned by the armature that helps him walk: the 'heartbeat' of the train's engine during the cardgame: the tension of the ambush preparations against Frank: the eruption of guitar music as Bronson enters the frame: Bronson's stillness and self-possession, the emblem of his righteousness: Fonda's eyes flickering rapidly in his motionless head, denoting the waning of his self-confidence: the amazing super-close-ups of Bronson: and the weird brick arch, the only man-made intrusion into the entire terrain, and the focus of human depravity.",something do with death,sergio goes hollywood this big name big budget spaghetti western fonda bronson robards cardinale queue up take leones choreographic

9.0,Leone goes a new route with the same results.,"With a style very much unlike that of his previous three Westerns, Once Upon a Time in the West takes a long time to tell this epic and powerful tale of three men all connected by their past and all destined to connect in the future. The acting is universally excellent with Fonda playing a very uncharacteristic part, but since he is such a great actor he has no problem filling the shoes of the merciless gunslinger, Frank. Jason Robards is great as the outlaw with a good heart, Cheyenne; and Charles Bronson is very Eastwood-like as a man known only as Harmonica with a mysterious past and a quick draw. The central character, though, is that of the beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Jill, a widow seeking revenge.Sergio Leone used a slower, more romantic style for this Western, but he still was able to produce some great images and a story that will forever be remembered. He doesn't deal too much with character development, rather showing us their actions and letting that speak for themselves. And, of course we cannot forget the score by Ennio Moriconne.

,One of the best,"There's two things that stand out to me always about this movie, and indeed about all of Sergio Leone's movies. One is his understanding of pacing events, and the other is using his actors/actresses to actually act. When you see Claudia Cardinale riding up to the ranch, all you see is her face, but you can tell instantly what she is looking at and everything she's feeling. You know Henry Fonda's the bad guy, but when he smiles faintly at the young boy, you feel there's something more to him, a personality and human qualities, even if he is evil. The final shoot-out itself is a masterpiece. The two protagonists say nothing, but as they face off the music lets you know the moment as come. As they stand ready the scene that's been hinted at throughout the movie plays out like a dream, revealing what the whole story was about. Then, without warning, they draw and fire. Just as in real life, it's over before you notice it. What today's movies lack is how quickly they cater to MTV video inspired nonstop action and endless clich√©s. The bad and good guy duke it it out, the violence is so extreme that no human could actually survive it, and always just when you think the bad guy is dead he gets back up for one last shot. How much I wish today's film makers would learn Leone's lesson about TIMING, and let suspense build rather than force it in. The music score, which had certain pieces and sections for various moods and to signify the main characters, is one of my favorites. Even if Clint Eastwood wasn't in it, Charles Bronson fills the role of the mysterious stranger and adds his own elements to the character. How I wish they still made movies like this",one best,theres two things that stand out me always about this movie indeed about all sergio leones movies one is his understanding pacing events other is using his actors actresses actually act when you see claudia cardinale riding up ranch all you see is her face but you can tell instantly what she is looking at everything shes feeling you know henry fondas bad guy but when he smiles faintly at young boy you feel theres something more him personality human qualities even if he is evil final shoot out itself is masterpiece two protagonists say nothing but as they face off music lets you know moment as come as they stand ready scene thats been hinted at throughout movie plays out like dream revealing what whole story was about then without warning they draw fire just as real life its over before you notice it what todays movies lack is how quickly they cater mtv video inspired nonstop action endless clich s bad good guy duke it it out violence is so extreme that no human could actually survive it always just when you think bad guy is dead he gets back up one last shot how much i wish todays film makers would learn leones lesson about timing let suspense build rather than force it music score which had certain pieces sections various moods signify main characters is one my favorites even if clint eastwood wasnt it charles bronson fills role mysterious stranger adds his own elements character how i wish they still made movies like this,0.4794546850998463,0.02707373271889402,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.42}"

9.0,A bit slow n tedious but still one of the best western film. Fonda was terrific.,"As a fan of Westerns, I saw this film many times in the early 90s. Saw this recently again on a DVD aft many years. The plot- Claudia Cardinale arrives at her ranch, to find that her husband has been murdered by hired gun Henry Fonda. Mysterious gunman Charles Bronson wants an appointment with Fonda. Bronson teams up with outlaw Jason Robards to help protect Cardinale n her ranch from Fondas evil intentions. There are long scenes where you get close shots of a person's face. Sergio Leone loves the stare-down, and you can see it in virtually all of his films. In this movie he allows the camera to linger longer than ever before. You get those quiet scoreless scenes where the natural sounds of the environment are greatly exaggerated. Leone's opponents take a long time to feel each other out before they act. One may find the long stretches of silence and inaction tedious n boring. Honestly, even i found some scenes boring, especially the opening scene. Henry Fonda is terrific. No one expected him to play such a ruthless and brutal killer. Bronson was decent but Jason Robards was much better with his tip on guys patting females bottom n the tip on don't get shot by a person who doesn't know to shoot. One of the best part bah the film was Ennio Morricone's score, especially the recurring harmonica music during the final closing fight. This is Morricone's best moment in a long, treasured career. I was surprised to know that the story was written by Dario Argento.",bit slow n tedious but still one best western film fonda was terrific,as fan westerns i saw this film many times early 90s saw this recently again dvd aft many years plot claudia cardinale arrives at her ranch find that her husband has been murdered by hired gun henry fonda mysterious gunman charles bronson wants appointment with fonda bronson teams up with outlaw jason robards help protect cardinale n her ranch fondas evil intentions there are long scenes where you get close shots persons face sergio leone loves stare down you can see it virtually all his films this movie he allows camera linger longer than ever before you get those quiet scoreless scenes where natural sounds environment are greatly exaggerated leones opponents take long time feel each other out before they act one may find long stretches silence inaction tedious n boring honestly even i found some scenes boring especially opening scene henry fonda is terrific no one expected him play such ruthless brutal killer bronson was decent but jason robards was much better with his tip guys patting females bottom n tip dont get shot by person who doesnt know shoot one best part bah film was ennio morricones score especially recurring harmonica music during final closing fight this is morricones best moment long treasured career i was surprised know that story was written by dario argento,0.6266812865497077,-0.039181286549707595,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,"The Best Western ever made??? Not quite, but still is AMAZING!","After the great success of the masterpiece ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" which perfectly finished the ""Dollars"" trilogy. Sergio Leone get bored with nothing to do, and decided to start another trilogy, the ""America"" trilogy with ""Once upon a time in the West"". That today is considered the best Western ever made in the history of cinema.""Once upon a time in the West"" begins when the farmer Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his sons are murdered in cold blood by the hands of the ruthless bounty-killer Frank (Henry Fonda) who puts the blame on the criminal Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Frank was hired by the legged-rail baron Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) to just scare away McBain and his family of their land, because she would be much valued with the advancement of the railroad. But on the same day Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in town, coming from New Orleans, and when she finds out of the crime she reveals that she married Brett McBain weeks before in New Orleans and therefore the land still had a owner. On the same day, Jill meets a mysterious man who is known for Harmonica (Charles Bronson) because he always carries with himself a harmonica, and offers itself as a protector of Jill. And when the criminal Cheyenne knows that he is being unfairly prosecuted, he decides to join forces with Harmonica to help Jill keep the lands of her deceased husband. But a web of mystery and deceit circulates between the contradictory relationship of the characters.When the film premiered at the time it was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure, only today that the critics and the public praised the film as not only the best Sergio Leone's movie, but also the best Western ever made. Well, not quite (in my opinion), but I understand why people praise him as such. The main complain of the critics to the film at the time, it was that the film was extreme slow. But this slowness is caused by some reasons.The first one is that the film was completely different from all the Western films ever made, even from the ""Dollars"" trilogy because Leone gives the film a dramatic tone. What Leone tries to show in the story is the end of the Old West, the title shows that perfectly. The original translation from Italian to English was ""Once upon a time THE West"", that is, the end of the Old West. And that originally came in the time of the advance of the railways, and the grand corruption and death that she brought to the population. Leone shows that giving the film an excellent script (written by him and Sergio Donati), which gives the film a superb narrative with beautiful dialogs between the characters, but like any Leone's film, it never loses his great sense of humor.The other reason is, as always. the magnificent direction of Leone, which once again shows advanced for its time. With its perfect close-ups on characters and enormous scenarios, making everything beautiful and epic. But there it comes the problem that prevents the film to even beat ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". Leone was known for his quiet moments brilliantly filmed, and ""Once upon a time"" is full of them (but maybe too much). Without considering the first 10 minutes of the film (which is brilliant, putting us in the heat of the scene), but others seem to boring taking the power of narrative and our investment on them.Another problem with the film is the relevance of the characters. Not that they are not superb and memorable (which they are): Jill is nothing more nor less than the representation of the women in the world of men in the Old West and its extreme strength and intelligence, along with an excellent performance from Cardinale; Cheyenne can be compared with Tuco from ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", both characters are cruel bandits, but in several times they are shown to be simple human beings with their problems and their kind and innocent side; Frank is another cruel-badass villain that Leone built in his films, Frank is a bounty-killer who in previous films its showed that they are honored to their ""job"", do whoever they were told and paid for and nothing more. But Frank in the film betrays its own principles, and gets into the corrupt world of the railways; Harmonica is almost the same character that Clint Eastwood was in previous Leone films. Mysterious, don't talk much, and never shows his true motives (only at the most epic and badass moment of the film). All characters are fantastic, but thanks to the silent moments of Leone, their relevance and relationship fails in several moments in the history.I don't agree that this is the best Western film ever made, but I understand why people consider it so. From a fabulous story that shows excellently the end of the era of legends with a flawless script, magnificent direction and unforgettable characters. All this makes ""Once upon a time"" not only one of the best Western films ever made, but a beautiful masterpiece of cinema and the beginning of another amazing trilogy! 10/10",best western ever made not quite but still is amazing,after great success masterpiece good bad ugly which perfectly finished dollars trilogy sergio leone get bored with nothing do decided start another trilogy america trilogy with once upon time west that today is considered best western ever made history cinema once upon time west begins when farmer brett mcbain frank wolff his sons are murdered cold blood by hands ruthless bounty killer frank henry fonda who puts blame criminal cheyenne jason robards frank was hired by legged rail baron morton gabrielle ferzetti just scare away mcbain his family their land because she would be much valued with advancement railroad but same day jill claudia cardinale arrives town coming new orleans when she finds out crime she reveals that she married brett mcbain weeks before new orleans therefore land still had owner same day jill meets mysterious man who is known harmonica charles bronson because he always carries with himself harmonica offers itself as protector jill when criminal cheyenne knows that he is being unfairly prosecuted he decides join forces with harmonica help jill keep lands her deceased husband but web mystery deceit circulates between contradictory relationship characters when film premiered at time it was poorly received by critics was box office failure only today that critics public praised film as not only best sergio leones movie but also best western ever made well not quite my opinion but i understand why people praise him as such main complain critics film at time it was that film was extreme slow but this slowness is caused by some reasons first one is that film was completely different all western films ever made even dollars trilogy because leone gives film dramatic tone what leone tries show story is end old west title shows that perfectly original translation italian english was once upon time west that is end old west that originally came time advance railways grand corruption death that she brought population leone shows that giving film excellent script written by him sergio donati which gives film superb narrative with beautiful dialogs between characters but like any leones film it never loses his great sense humor other reason is as always magnificent direction leone which once again shows advanced its time with its perfect close ups characters enormous scenarios making everything beautiful epic but there it comes problem that prevents film even beat good bad ugly leone was known his quiet moments brilliantly filmed once upon time is full them but maybe too much without considering first 10 minutes film which is brilliant putting us heat scene but others seem boring taking power narrative our investment them another problem with film is relevance characters not that they are not superb memorable which they are jill is nothing more nor less than representation women world men old west its extreme strength intelligence along with excellent performance cardinale cheyenne can be compared with tuco good bad ugly both characters are cruel bandits but several times they are shown be simple human beings with their problems their kind innocent side frank is another cruel badass villain that leone built his films frank is bounty killer who previous films its showed that they are honored their job do whoever they were told paid nothing more but frank film betrays its own principles gets into corrupt world railways harmonica is almost same character that clint eastwood was previous leone films mysterious dont talk much never shows his true motives only at most epic badass moment film all characters are fantastic but thanks silent moments leone their relevance relationship fails several moments history i dont agree that this is best western film ever made but i understand why people consider it so fabulous story that shows excellently end era legends with flawless script magnificent direction unforgettable characters all this makes once upon time not only one best western films ever made but beautiful masterpiece cinema beginning another amazing trilogy 10 10,0.5766344766344766,0.17448199948199952,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,No western has ever come close to this one....and no western ever will.,"I can't quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made, the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray 'Americanism', the American Way, along with a romanticised view of the west as 'Frontier country' where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.And then came this film. The title, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' must have seemed to mean nothing more than 'just another western' to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie, Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western, it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain, this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks, and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a 'generally-hunky-dory-kind-of-scene with the occasional bad guy and indian' and replaces it with an eerie, dark, hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.I cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie, waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival, but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast, deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human, more real to the viewer, while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama, is perfected by the absolute fantastic music, directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and heart-tearing music are not just able to carry the story, but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it's genre?Another great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real, emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn't required for the understanding of the story, yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words, the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals, just real, desire-laden, traumatised, obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.All in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times, and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing, heart-shattering westerns like this one, like 'A Fistful of Dynamite', 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly', and 'For a Few Dollars More', none could equal 'Once Upon A Time In The West' in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....I only wish I'd have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it, for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001: A Space Odyssey (also of 1969, a year of legends).A tip for those who have never seen this movie: Bribe, beg, borrow, or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifi-audio equipment if you can't find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH (never mind the neighbors) and prepare never to be the same again.........I (obviously) gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can't find anything less than perfect about it.",no western has ever come close this one no western ever will,i cant quite find words even come close describing pure brilliance this movie when this movie was made western genre was dominated by big hollywood studios western was taken by these studios transformed into opportunity portray classic superheroes like john wayne burt lancaster their fight against all sorts smalltime crooks outlaws smalltime stories smalltime towns it was genuine effort portray americanism american way along with romanticised view west as frontier country where good always triumphed over bad where life was hard but honest it was american way then came this film title once upon time west must have seemed mean nothing more than just another western unexpecting viewers at time oh boy were they wrong with this movie sergio leone singlehandedly redefined western genre no american western would ever match brilliant spirit which it was made while story is basically same as any other western it is way which it is presented that so clearly distances this western others whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed entertain this movie is emotional masterpiece that will move your heart sergio leone takes ordinary western replaces words with looks conversations with feelings emotions with his brutal but honest portrayal sheer hardness life death those times he thoroughly destroys old romantic idea west as generally hunky dory kind scene with occasional bad guy indian replaces it with eerie dark hot dry place where life is cheap only strongest will survive i cannot adequately convey words way which sergio leone deepens defines characters by pure means visual persuasion it starts with three gunman beginning movie waiting some reason at train station someone or something that obviously is going be next train no explanation no conversation not word is said even stationmaster is ushered into captivity without single audible threat then comes waiting any other director would have skipped directly moment arrival but sergio leone takes minutes boredom translates it into visual feast deepening characters that are portrayed making them more human more real viewer while at same time encompassing us with deep dark sense foreboding this way which story is not just augmented but times completely replaced by sheer visual drama is perfected by absolute fantastic music directed by ennio morricone who needs words explanations when combined forces cinematic mastery heart tearing music are not just able carry story but pick it up push it up such heights excellence that it has no equal its genre another great feat that adds power this movie is minimalistic way portrayal characters as real emotional people not single word is said that isnt required understanding story yet characters feel more true than those movies where whole conversations are added merely explain their motives instead words camera focuses characters so that you can simply read emotion off their faces often no explanation is given other than than mere facial expression no superheroes or supercriminals just real desire laden traumatised obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by viewer all all this is without single doubt my mind greatest western all times even though sergio leone has made many more mindblowing heart shattering westerns like this one like fistful dynamite good bad ugly few dollars more none could equal once upon time west sheer magnitude perfection western has never been same since i only wish id have been there 1969 when movie was new see it first time with fresh innocent eyes unexpecting mind just like 2001 space odyssey also 1969 year legends tip those who have never seen this movie bribe beg borrow or steal yourself into possession videobeam hifi audio equipment if you cant find cinema that is showing this movie turn audio up way high never mind neighbors prepare never be same again i obviously gave this movie 10 because no matter how hard i try i cant find anything less than perfect about it,0.4325532270759543,0.06876023219205038,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.31}"

,pure cinematic paradise,"Thank god that I'm a Bronson fan. This was my first Leone movie, and dumb kid that I was, I actually watched it thinking I was in for a typical Bronson ""vehicle""! Looking back I'm thankful, because if it wasn't for his involvement, I would never have discovered the beauty and majesty that is Once Upon a Time in the West.I absolutely love this movie. It's probably my all time favourite, certainly one of the few that I can watch OVER and OVER again without losing interest. I love the way Leone creates intrigue and mystery around what is a relatively thin plot. He can make even the smallest twist of fate seem like an epic turn of events, with that amazing sense of revelation that he generates out of old hackneyed situations (something Argento has since picked up). Leone proves in this film that he could seemingly take anyone, even peripheral characters, and give them screen charisma without using dialogue as a crutch.OUATITW features the most tense two man stand-offs ever, with some serious deja-vu in the direction of his ""Dollars"" trilogy. In fact, it does feel like those three movies were warm ups, practice sessions in the build up to OUATITW. Here though, he perfected everything; despite the long running time, it's all focused, and without a single irrelevant scene. For me, the two hours plus just fly by, I wish it would never end. Leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this, that's not to say that he went downhill from then on, but I honestly don't think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly.The cast is flawless. Fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did in one fell swoop, truly chilling. Robards is a great comic character, the lovable rogue with an edge. And Cardinale is more than just (incredible) window dressing; she switches between passionate, angry, delicate and sentimental at all the right moments.Which leaves the hero; I'm a huge Eastwood fan, but I honestly don't believe he could have done the role justice. His ""man with no name"" was a cool, sly character with hidden complexities. Eastwood always does these layered personalities, with some kind of mental baggage. Bronson, on the other hand, mostly does himself; simple, uncomplicated figures with only one state of mind, that's why he's put in so many revenge flicks. Plus, he looks like he's been seriously wronged at some point in his life, Eastwood doesn't have that quality. Bronson is the genuine hard-as-nails article. You can readily imagine that, had he been born decades earlier and been put in the same situation, he would resolve the problem in much the same way as his character in the movie (sometimes I affectionately refer to this movie as Deathwish part 0- could Harmonica be the great granddaddy of Paul Kersey?).Of course the other great contribution is the music. I still think that the main theme is one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I have ever heard. It affects me deeply whenever I hear it, regardless of the mood I'm in. Maybe I should listen to more opera or something, I don't know, but that's the way I feel. And the individual character themes are just so well integrated into the film, it's unbelievable. Leone replaces words with music, and it conveys so much more in return. Bronson just plays that melancholy tune on the harmonica instead of answering people back, it consistently cracks me up.High Noon, Naked Spur, Shane, The Searchers, etc. are all classics of the genre, but I really don't think it's possible to compare those ""traditional"" westerns with OUATITW. For me, it exists on a plane of it's own, it's the kind of film experience that you let wash over you, a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone, if you're on the right wavelength you'll be greatly rewarded.",pure cinematic paradise,thank god that im bronson fan this was my first leone movie dumb kid that i was i actually watched it thinking i was typical bronson vehicle looking back im thankful because if it wasnt his involvement i would never have discovered beauty majesty that is once upon time west i absolutely love this movie its probably my all time favourite certainly one few that i can watch over over again without losing interest i love way leone creates intrigue mystery around what is relatively thin plot he can make even smallest twist fate seem like epic turn events with that amazing sense revelation that he generates out old hackneyed situations something argento has since picked up leone proves this film that he could seemingly take anyone even peripheral characters give them screen charisma without using dialogue as crutch ouatitw features most tense two man stand offs ever with some serious deja vu direction his dollars trilogy fact it does feel like those three movies were warm ups practice sessions build up ouatitw here though he perfected everything despite long running time its all focused without single irrelevant scene me two hours plus just fly by i wish it would never end leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this thats not say that he went downhill then but i honestly dont think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly cast is flawless fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did one fell swoop truly chilling robards is great comic character lovable rogue with edge cardinale is more than just incredible window dressing she switches between passionate angry delicate sentimental at all right moments which leaves hero im huge eastwood fan but i honestly dont believe he could have done role justice his man with no name was cool sly character with hidden complexities eastwood always does these layered personalities with some kind mental baggage bronson other hand mostly does himself simple uncomplicated figures with only one state mind thats why hes put so many revenge flicks plus he looks like hes been seriously wronged at some point his life eastwood doesnt have that quality bronson is genuine hard as nails article you can readily imagine that had he been born decades earlier been put same situation he would resolve problem much same way as his character movie sometimes i affectionately refer this movie as deathwish part 0 could harmonica be great granddaddy paul kersey course other great contribution is music i still think that main theme is one most breathtaking pieces music i have ever heard it affects me deeply whenever i hear it regardless mood im maybe i should listen more opera or something i dont know but thats way i feel individual character themes are just so well integrated into film its unbelievable leone replaces words with music it conveys so much more return bronson just plays that melancholy tune harmonica instead answering people back it consistently cracks me up high noon naked spur shane searchers etc are all classics genre but i really dont think its possible compare those traditional westerns with ouatitw me it exists plane its own its kind film experience that you let wash over you waking dream i recommend this movie anyone if youre right wavelength youll be greatly rewarded,0.5797410714285712,0.21048214285714284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"

8.0,such a haunting theme,"thank goodness for IMDb !!! I remember over the years that echoing mournful theme song but since I missed this movie on first release I didn't make the connection, and it never played on television because of rights issues and the unusual length for the time.finally I bought it on DVD and there it was, that theme song that gave me flashbacks big time.then I finally knew what the interview with Jane Fonda was about where she described her recollections seeing her father Henry in the unusual role as archvillian, and another one with jack Elam about how it took all day to do the scene with the handgun and the fly.this is a remarkable western, despite some stretches of credibility.the railroad indeed was the thing that finally opened the west; it was the only way to move millions of tons of goods and tens of thousands of people over the long distances, wagon trains were too dangerous and got off the beaten path too easily and couldn't carry enough provisions. the railroad allowed in a symbiotic relationship, towns to be founded and flourish with mining, cattle herding and farming around them.and thus the premise of the movie, McBain is going to build a town right in front of the advancing railroad.the corruption, violence and greed depicted were certainly problems of the day considering the fortunes to be made. no different than today when a big factory is built and the land selected gains 20 times its normal value and those 'in the know' engage in speculation. or oil or mineral resources are discovered on land held by simpletons who mysteriously are murdered in a 'botched' robbery or some such nonsense. it does happen.the movie is so long I haven't seen it once yet without falling asleep which is not to be taken as a criticism, just that wailful haunting theme song gets to me ..... and it is close to 3 hours long.at least the good guy, in this case, the good girl wins in the end.gawd Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and still making films.",such haunting theme,thank goodness imdb i remember over years that echoing mournful theme song but since i missed this movie first release i didnt make connection it never played television because rights issues unusual length time finally i bought it dvd there it was that theme song that gave me flashbacks big time then i finally knew what interview with jane fonda was about where she described her recollections seeing her father henry unusual role as archvillian another one with jack elam about how it took all day do scene with handgun fly this is remarkable western despite some stretches credibility railroad indeed was thing that finally opened west it was only way move millions tons goods tens thousands people over long distances wagon trains were too dangerous got off beaten path too easily couldnt carry enough provisions railroad allowed symbiotic relationship towns be founded flourish with mining cattle herding farming around them thus premise movie mcbain is going build town right front advancing railroad corruption violence greed depicted were certainly problems day considering fortunes be made no different than today when big factory is built land selected gains 20 times its normal value those know engage speculation or oil or mineral resources are discovered land held by simpletons who mysteriously are murdered botched robbery or some such nonsense it does happen movie is so long i havent seen it once yet without falling asleep which is not be taken as criticism just that wailful haunting theme song gets me it is close 3 hours long at least good guy this case good girl wins end gawd claudia cardinale is beautiful still making films,0.625793650793651,0.15944444444444447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,"Leone's film unfolds across the screen in time and space with all the mellowness and majesty of such great Westerns as ""Shane,"" ""The Searchers,"" and ""The Magnificent Seven.""","""Once upon a Time in the West"" is Leone's masterpiece and certainly one of the best Westerns of all time... It is beautifully shot, perfectly cast, ambitious, erotic, humorous and wonderfully scored by Leone's regular composer Ennio Morricone, whose haunting melodies are just as important as the widely separated dialog occurring on the action..The film opens with an extreme close-ups of Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Lionel Stander waiting at a station for Charles Bronson... Henry Fonda has sent them to kill him...The railroad wants a property for its water well belonging to the newly widowed Claudia Cardinale, a fancy lady from New Orleans who just arrived in Flagstone and learns about the tragedy... We would come to understand, much later, Claudia Cardinale's role as the bearer of water, life, and continuity to the civilization of the New West...Fonda, a despicable hired gun, kills her husband and orders, without a twinge of guilt, the slaughter of the entire family, innocents women and children...Henry Fonda, in a chilling performance, plays the cold-blooded murderer, the most vicious villain in Westerns history to ever ride the big country... the blue ice-eyed child killer, gunning down a 9-year old boy...Bronson as 'The Man' is like Clint Eastwood 'The Man With No Name,' with only one thing in common: they are the most ruthless heroes in Westerns history sharing the same character in their quality 'not' to say much in their need of emotions, in their fast draw, in their disinterest in women, in their air of mystery and in their macabre sense of humor...Their differences are also very clear: 'The Man With No Name' has no past whatsoever, and 'The Man' is motivated by revenge to settle an old personal score... Claudia Cardinale plays Jill, the well-proportioned, husky-voiced beauty, the lady, the businesswoman, the maker of coffee involved with Fonda in an incredible perverse erotic sequence...The blood, the violence, the humor, the several gunfights and the final showdown have been constants in Leone's Westerns since ""A Fistful of Dollars""...The highlights of his movie are so many: Leone's overwhelming shot when he raises his camera over the Flagstone train station office revealing the sprawling town; when he replaces a shot of a smoking gun with a shot of a smoking train; when he uses close-ups instead of dialog to reveal what a character is thinking; and the striking use of his extreme close-up in the final shootout... Leone builds up tension by slowly circling his two characters, focusing with his camera on their eyes, hands and guns while the level of the music is raised to evoke the action... Leone's film is a brave epic Western, extremely violent, immensely powerful... It's above all fable and fantasy, as the desire for revenge is childish and fruitless... It is the essence of a great filmmaker...",leones film unfolds across screen time space with all mellowness majesty such great westerns as shane searchers magnificent seven,once upon time west is leones masterpiece certainly one best westerns all time it is beautifully shot perfectly cast ambitious erotic humorous wonderfully scored by leones regular composer ennio morricone whose haunting melodies are just as important as widely separated dialog occurring action film opens with extreme close ups jack elam woody strode lionel stander waiting at station charles bronson henry fonda has sent them kill him railroad wants property its water well belonging newly widowed claudia cardinale fancy lady new orleans who just arrived flagstone learns about tragedy we would come understand much later claudia cardinales role as bearer water life continuity civilization new west fonda despicable hired gun kills her husband orders without twinge guilt slaughter entire family innocents women children henry fonda chilling performance plays cold blooded murderer most vicious villain westerns history ever ride big country blue ice eyed child killer gunning down 9 year old boy bronson as man is like clint eastwood man with no name with only one thing common they are most ruthless heroes westerns history sharing same character their quality not say much their need emotions their fast draw their disinterest women their air mystery their macabre sense humor their differences are also very clear man with no name has no past whatsoever man is motivated by revenge settle old personal score claudia cardinale plays jill well proportioned husky voiced beauty lady businesswoman maker coffee involved with fonda incredible perverse erotic sequence blood violence humor several gunfights final showdown have been constants leones westerns since fistful dollars highlights his movie are so many leones overwhelming shot when he raises his camera over flagstone train station office revealing sprawling town when he replaces shot smoking gun with shot smoking train when he uses close ups instead dialog reveal what character is thinking striking use his extreme close up final shootout leone builds up tension by slowly circling his two characters focusing with his camera their eyes hands guns while level music is raised evoke action leones film is brave epic western extremely violent immensely powerful its above all fable fantasy as desire revenge is childish fruitless it is essence great filmmaker,0.5924868372368371,0.1712136844636845,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,One of the biggest and boldest westerns you will ever see,"Although I have not seen all his films, I have yet to see a Sergio Leone film I hate. The movies I have seen of his are visually gorgeous with superb scores and interesting stories and characters. Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception. It is long and slow, but I think the film was deliberately paced like that.Once Upon a Time in the West does take a lot of risks, including improvising the action around the score's moods. This was a risk that paid off. The story is rich and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking and beautifully written. Leone also proved what a fine director he was by directing so wonderfully on this film.The characters are great and quite complex, and are further advantaged by being wonderfully portrayed. There is the brutish gunfighter, the beautiful widow, the mysterious harmonica player and the sympathetic outlaw. Henry Fonda particularly does brilliantly in the role of Frank. The visuals once again are exquisite and quite grandiose in its scope and beauty, while Ennio Morricone's wonderfully operatic-like score fully justifies why he is considered one of the all-time great film composers.All in all, a big and bold western and one unlike any other. It also took risks, ones which could have gone horribly wrong but due to the evident work and care of all involved, they paid off. 10/10 Bethany Cox",one biggest boldest westerns you will ever see,although i have not seen all his films i have yet see sergio leone film i hate movies i have seen his are visually gorgeous with superb scores interesting stories characters once upon time west is no exception it is long slow but i think film was deliberately paced like that once upon time west does take lot risks including improvising action around scores moods this was risk that paid off story is rich compelling dialogue is thought provoking beautifully written leone also proved what fine director he was by directing so wonderfully this film characters are great quite complex are further advantaged by being wonderfully portrayed there is brutish gunfighter beautiful widow mysterious harmonica player sympathetic outlaw henry fonda particularly does brilliantly role frank visuals once again are exquisite quite grandiose its scope beauty while ennio morricones wonderfully operatic like score fully justifies why he is considered one all time great film composers all all big bold western one unlike any other it also took risks ones which could have gone horribly wrong but due evident work care all involved they paid off 10 10 bethany cox,0.6596774193548387,0.34327956989247316,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Once Upon A Time...There Were Westerns!,"I first saw this film as a 20 year old in the late 80's on VHS & ended up thoroughly disappointed. Every scene seemed to stretch to near-infinity and the action was too sporadic for what I normally expected from a western. Now, however, things are different! I saw it again a few days ago after reading so many positive reviews & I must admit to pretty much being bowled over! 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is not your traditional shoot-em-up western. Its an acquired taste and I wouldn't be too far off the mark if I say that it resembles a dish with near-perfect proportions of ingredients, slow cooked over an intense fire. Director Leone doffs his hat to several classic westerns and ends up with a film thats greater than the sum of its parts. The lovely Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in the old west to join her new husband & family only to find them all brutally shot dead. Clues apparently point to the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) though the dastardly deed has in fact been perpetrated by the magnificently evil Frank (Henry Fonda). Also in this lethal mix is a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) with his own covert agenda. From the classic opening scene to the explosive climax, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' sucks the viewer into its vortex of emotions as layers upon layers are gradually peeled away revealing each characters true motivations. Featuring a stellar cast who have probably never been better, and a haunting, evocative score by maestro Ennio Morricone, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is mandatory viewing for all film aficionado's. My only (small) complaint is the occasional self-indulgence displayed by Leone when he tends to give style precedence over narrative.",once upon time there were westerns,i first saw this film as 20 year old late 80s vhs ended up thoroughly disappointed every scene seemed stretch near infinity action was too sporadic what i normally expected western now however things are different i saw it again few days ago after reading so many positive reviews i must admit pretty much being bowled over once upon time west is not your traditional shoot em up western its acquired taste i wouldnt be too far off mark if i say that it resembles dish with near perfect proportions ingredients slow cooked over intense fire director leone doffs his hat several classic westerns ends up with film thats greater than sum its parts lovely jill mcbain claudia cardinale arrives old west join her new husband family only find them all brutally shot dead clues apparently point bandit cheyenne jason robards though dastardly deed has fact been perpetrated by magnificently evil frank henry fonda also this lethal mix is mysterious harmonica playing stranger charles bronson with his own covert agenda classic opening scene explosive climax once upon time west sucks viewer into its vortex emotions as layers upon layers are gradually peeled away revealing each characters true motivations featuring stellar cast who have probably never been better haunting evocative score by maestro ennio morricone once upon time west is mandatory viewing all film aficionados my only small complaint is occasional self indulgence displayed by leone when he tends give style precedence over narrative,0.5044573643410852,0.04353417899929528,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,A film any actor would just die to be in.,"The opening scene in this masterpiece from Sergio Leone is alone worth the 10 points. I would add another 10 if I could. To think that the three main actors from another work by the great master, ""The Good And The Bad And The Ugly"", Clint Eastwood, Eddie Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, said NO to appear as the three bad guys in the film's beginning, is just hilarious. Any actor would die just to be in this film. But these three guys were all thinking to highly of themselves, and didn't consider such a ""small role"" to be a great honor. It's not hard to understand Leone's meta intention to ask the three heroes to appear like that, but perhaps we all should thank them for refusing, because how much more epic didn't Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Al Mulock become after acting in this famous scene. They are simply perfect for it. Even more incredible is that Mulock committed suicide with his costume still on, and this way actually died, if not for playing a part in the film. His reason will forever be untold. One person getting too little credit is Leone's co-screenwriter, another Sergio by the surname Donati, who together with Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci really must have inspired Leone to get at top level. Every single actor in the film are at their top level too and make appearances so perfect that the audience forget that this is fiction. Personally I have seen it again and again only to see the beautiful and great acting Claudia Cardinale appear. But I believe Charles Bronson got the part mainly because he had the perfect looks and the most amazing eyes. Also, Bronson pretending to play the harmonica is THE ONLY just a little annoying thing about the film, even though the character's name is Harmonica. I am certain that the master behind the fantastic music score, Ennio Morricone, had little or no saying in this, the one place where music and picture don't fit together. There are so many to mention and give the very best credits. Tonino Delli Colli, director of photography, has caught the actor's faces, in particular Henry Fonda's and Charles Bronson's, but also the grand landscape and every important and non important detail in such an amazing way, it's totally stunning, and all the way. Nino Baragli is the master of editing. The total is so well composed that it just can't be made better. We can smell the air, taste the dust and feel every part of the setting.
