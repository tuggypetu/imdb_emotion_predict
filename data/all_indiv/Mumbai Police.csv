8.0,A police procedural with a difference - Engaging and bold,"Mumbai Police is a revelation. I cannot proclaim it to be the best thriller I have seen, but it has to be applauded for what it tries to accomplish. Roshan Andrews has gone a notch above the standard genre fare we have come to expect in Indian thrillers and gave us something which will, in turns, haunt and genuinely surprise. This is in no small part to the accomplished writing duo of Bobby-Sanjay and the brilliant Prithviraj.ACP Anthony Moses (Prithvi) is just about to solve a crime and report it to his boss, Farhan (Rehman), when he is caught in a bad accident which leaves him without any memory of his past. Farhan tries to help him jog his memory and get the name of the culprit, but Anthony has no clue to his past or to his impending future. However, his reflexes and training from his previous life are still in tact and he realizes he would need to use these to piece both his life and the case together again. The crime is of a very personal nature to both the officers, as it involves the murder of their colleague and close friend, ACP Aryan John Jacob (Jayasurya) while he was receiving a gallantry award. Together, the trio had been known as the 'Mumbai Police' owing to their earlier presence in the Mumbai police department. As Anthony re-pieces together the jigsaw, he realizes everything is not as it would seem and the seemingly bizarre directions and conflicts the investigation takes as opposed to the initial attempts in the case alienates his team and further confuses his already addled mind. All this ultimately leads up to a climax which can only be termed as amazingly bold and genuinely shocking in its denouement.Apart from the climactic reveal, the movie also must take plaudits for its mostly different approach to the standard police thriller. There are hardly any bombastic dialogs and mustache twirling here. The investigating officer is not exactly the epitome of all vices, as he himself realizes in the course of his second life. The introduction of alternative sexuality into Malayalam commercial cinema has to be hailed as a landmark in this generally conservative segment of viewers. Background music is pretty apt and gripping for the most part and there are no songs to break the flow.The supporting characters all do a great job. Jayasurya, Rehman, Aparna Nair and Riyaz Khan (in a cameo) are all commendable. There is also a surprisingly strong performance from the veteran, Kunjan, as one of the officers on the team. However, this is Prithviraj's show all the way. He has done tougher roles than this and will probably have bigger hits. But the conviction of a mainstream actor of his stature to take up a role which pushes the envelope in terms of what is 'acceptable' for commercial leading men in Indian cinema has to be thoroughly appreciated. I have been a fan of this guy for a while now, and he keeps giving reasons why, despite all the unfounded criticism against him, he will always be relevant. Take a bow, Prithvi, Roshan and Bobby-Sanjay, for hopefully bringing in a much needed wind of change in this industry.",police procedural with difference engaging bold,mumbai police is revelation i cannot proclaim it be best thriller i have seen but it has be applauded what it tries accomplish roshan andrews has gone notch above standard genre fare we have come expect indian thrillers gave us something which will turns haunt genuinely surprise this is no small part accomplished writing duo bobby sanjay brilliant prithviraj acp anthony moses prithvi is just about solve crime report it his boss farhan rehman when he is caught bad accident which leaves him without any memory his past farhan tries help him jog his memory get name culprit but anthony has no clue his past or his impending future however his reflexes training his previous life are still tact he realizes he would need use these piece both his life case together again crime is very personal nature both officers as it involves murder their colleague close friend acp aryan john jacob jayasurya while he was receiving gallantry award together trio had been known as mumbai police owing their earlier presence mumbai police department as anthony re pieces together jigsaw he realizes everything is not as it would seem seemingly bizarre directions conflicts investigation takes as opposed initial attempts case alienates his team further confuses his already addled mind all this ultimately leads up climax which can only be termed as amazingly bold genuinely shocking its denouement apart climactic reveal movie also must take plaudits its mostly different approach standard police thriller there are hardly any bombastic dialogs mustache twirling here investigating officer is not exactly epitome all vices as he himself realizes course his second life introduction alternative sexuality into malayalam commercial cinema has be hailed as landmark this generally conservative segment viewers background music is pretty apt gripping most part there are no songs break flow supporting characters all do great job jayasurya rehman aparna nair riyaz khan cameo are all commendable there is also surprisingly strong performance veteran kunjan as one officers team however this is prithvirajs show all way he has done tougher roles than this will probably have bigger hits but conviction mainstream actor his stature take up role which pushes envelope terms what is acceptable commercial leading men indian cinema has be thoroughly appreciated i have been fan this guy while now he keeps giving reasons why despite all unfounded criticism against him he will always be relevant take bow prithvi roshan bobby sanjay hopefully bringing much needed wind change this industry,0.4726086956521739,0.1048913043478261,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7.0,An Engaging thriller,"In one word,Mumbai Police can be termed as an Investigative Thriller.The film follows a non-linear narration at parts and that has worked out extremely well in holding the viewers gripped in their seats.Yet the climax and suspense element will not be Favourable or acceptable to some.But the film should be praised for its tight screenplay,superb direction and variety climax.Everyone of us had been fed up with the usual formulaic thrillers which showcases the hero's intelligence and firebrand dialogues.Mumbai police succeeds in staying away from these usual clich√©s for god's sake.The film opens with the accident of a police officer Antony Moses(Prithviraj).He suffers from Amnesia after the accident.He is confused about his past and future.He was also working on a case which involves the murder of his colleague and friend Aryan(Jayasurya).His superior and friend Farhan(Rahman) fills him with details regarding the case and the developments that he had made on the case.Farhan states that Antony called him up seconds before the accident stating that he found the culprit.Now Its up to Antony to find the killer again using the clues about his past.Prithviraj excels in the role of Antony Moses.His performance as the man who lost his memory stands out in the movie.He is sure to get praises for his role even if the movie fails.Stunts were also good.Rahman also made a convincing performance.Good to see him in a major role.Jayasurya gave an okay performance,what was demanded out of him.Rest of the cast does not have much to do though Riyaz khan's cameo was good.Bobby-Sanjay again delivered a superb script after the yesteryear Ayaalum Njanum Thammil.But here the challenge was of making a thriller and they have done their part very well indeed.They succeeded in connecting all the events that leads to the identity of the killer and his motive that may not be acceptable to some.That was evident in negative response after the movie.Roshan made a great comeback after the yesteryear debacle Casanova.His direction was superb and made the viewers hooked to their seats for most parts of the movie.BGM by Gopi Sunder was cool Mumbai Police may not set the cash registers ringing but it is one of the best movies to be released recently.There are many cases where a good movie flops and becomes a DVD classic.Well who knows,Mumbai police might turn out to be a classic in the near future.Congrats to the crew for bringing out something different.",engaging thriller,one word mumbai police can be termed as investigative thriller film follows non linear narration at parts that has worked out extremely well holding viewers gripped their seats yet climax suspense element will not be favourable or acceptable some but film should be praised its tight screenplay superb direction variety climax everyone us had been fed up with usual formulaic thrillers which showcases heros intelligence firebrand dialogues mumbai police succeeds staying away these usual clich s gods sake film opens with accident police officer antony moses prithviraj he suffers amnesia after accident he is confused about his past future he was also working case which involves murder his colleague friend aryan jayasurya his superior friend farhan rahman fills him with details regarding case developments that he had made case farhan states that antony called him up seconds before accident stating that he found culprit now its up antony find killer again using clues about his past prithviraj excels role antony moses his performance as man who lost his memory stands out movie he is sure get praises his role even if movie fails stunts were also good rahman also made convincing performance good see him major role jayasurya gave okay performance what was demanded out him rest cast does not have much do though riyaz khans cameo was good bobby sanjay again delivered superb script after yesteryear ayaalum njanum thammil but here challenge was making thriller they have done their part very well indeed they succeeded connecting all events that leads identity killer his motive that may not be acceptable some that was evident negative response after movie roshan made great comeback after yesteryear debacle casanova his direction was superb made viewers hooked their seats most parts movie bgm by gopi sunder was cool mumbai police may not set cash registers ringing but it is one best movies be released recently there are many cases where good movie flops becomes dvd classic well who knows mumbai police might turn out be classic near future congrats crew bringing out something different,0.4914484126984128,0.2573065476190476,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,Transcendent!,"Malayalam Cinema has, thus transcended into another era with this movie. Mumbai Police talks about friendship, memory loss & the plight of LGBT community. It is bold in its plot & thrilling in its story.Prithviraj's character as well as portrayal is his best till now, as an ACP who loses his memory after a car accident. What unfolds is a grim & tacky story related to Rehman & Jayasurya who were best friends once. Backed by brilliant non-linear screenplay, brilliant music & scintillating performances by each & every one in cast, Mumbai Police succeeds in keeping the suspense intact till it reaches the climax. And the climax is simply outstanding. The life lessons & virtues depicted are good & worth pondering upon, especially due to the professional style. Ballistics, mind games, genius assassination & everything related to it - is what Mumbai Police is about. This will take Rosshan Andrrews to the next level, for sure.I appreciate the filmmakers' guts to introduce LGBT into Malayalam cinema, although I cannot say how it will be received by the Mallu public. But, for me, it was food for thought & a great entertainer. It has some serious references to the Hollywood thriller, The Bourne Identity.BOTTOM LINE: A perfect summer movie for everyone. 8.3/10.MESSAGE: LGBT community should be respected. Sometimes, decision making is difficult when close friends are involved.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES.

8.0,Audacity and unpredictable that makes it Mumbai police.,"‚ÅØDirected by Roshan Andrews after the debacle Casanova, scripted by deadly duo Bobby & Sanjay. One of the brilliant script in recent past by B&S as usual emotional quotient as their major backdrop and they handle it subtly, this shows their intellectual melange with meticulously written screenplay. This cop flick deviate from usual cop investigation and ended up as daringly different one. Some may deplore strongly against climax, but for me after thinking for a while i found it terrific ending. Prithviraj(Moses A) cataclysm behavior as a disguise and as confused (Moses B) both were scintillating, his performance was just tad above the script. Songs were not included but BGM was good but in chase scene it was jarring. Prithviraj & Rahman were mostly the cynosure of the film. Cinematography was good. Weakest point in the whole movie is the pace, it was done in a lethargic manner but only for 1st half. 2nd half was top-notch and engaging and make it a edge of the seat type thriller. Highly recommended for thriller aficionado. For others might not be fully delectable but it arrest and indulge the viewers on the seat.‚ÅÆ",audacity unpredictable that makes it mumbai police,directed by roshan andrews after debacle casanova scripted by deadly duo bobby sanjay one brilliant script recent past by b s as usual emotional quotient as their major backdrop they handle it subtly this shows their intellectual melange with meticulously written screenplay this cop flick deviate usual cop investigation ended up as daringly different one some may deplore strongly against climax but me after thinking while i found it terrific ending prithviraj moses cataclysm behavior as disguise as confused moses b both were scintillating his performance was just tad above script songs were not included but bgm was good but chase scene it was jarring prithviraj rahman were mostly cynosure film cinematography was good weakest point whole movie is pace it was done lethargic manner but only 1st half 2nd half was top notch engaging make it edge seat type thriller highly recommended thriller aficionado others might not be fully delectable but it arrest indulge viewers seat,0.49130952380952364,0.09366071428571429,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,Breaking Free of Stereotype Police Stories,"MUMBAI POLICE _ MY REVIEWFinally Watched Mumbai Police....As of me, Mumbai Police was the most expected malayalam film of 2013, as was penned by Bobby Sanjay duo....directed by Roshann Andrews and it had some of industry's good actors including Jayasurya, Rahman and my favourite Prithviraj Sukumaran I was planning to watch this movie at the time of its release itself, but unfortunately, my annual examinations too were of the same time and I missed this flick in Theatre.... And after 4 months of its theatrical release, I have watched it...First of all I want to mention one thing... As I visit Facebook and other movie discussion websites frequently, the climax twist and suspense elements were already exposed to me.... A punch on the face of those who revealed suspense in social medias....These type of fellows never change.....degraders.... Even though the suspense was revealed, the script of Bobby Sanjay, offered a lot of thrill and was successful in satisfying me to the core...The story of the film is known to most of us.... Three friends....three of them are high level police officers.One of them gets killed and one of them solves it out...Before he could reveal the murderer, he gets into an accident and looses his memory... Inspite of his memory loss, his senior officer, who is the third friend , asks him to solve the case once again and find the killer.The story of the movie is known to most of us and hence, there is no need of explanation in that part..I liked the movie very much......First of all.....I applaud #Bobby_Sanjay for thinking out of the box and presenting us such a film... They have always been ma favourites....especially Ayaluum Njanum Thammil.... Their lateral thinking has delivered many good movies such as Ente Veedu Appunteyum, Notebook, Traffic, Ayalum Njanum Thammil and now Mumbai Police.. And if we make a small comparison, each movie is of different genre and had something variety in it, which breaks the boundaries of usual malayalam cinema...Breaking free of stereotype Hero oriented films, the ANTAGONIST is focused more in this film, and the highlight of the movie is that, both the protagonist and antagonist is the same person. Kudos to them for this Brilliant Script... Super.....Super....Superb..... The best script writes....of this generation.... Quality dialogues and genuine wits in the film, showcases their talent...Out of their brilliant Minds.....they have created one of the most powerful characters of the recent times, Antony Moses. And Antony Mosses was safe in the hands of Prithviraj. #Prithviraj delivered an wholesome performance. One of The best characterizations of the recent times....... He excelled in his roles, as rude and villainous Rascal Mosses and memory lost person, who cannot remember his history..... The mannerisms of a person who is haunted by his bad history is successfully portrayed by Prithvi. Those climax sequences were really terrific and requires great appreciation. That Bewildered Antony Mosses in climax scenes were superb.....kudos.... This is a character that none dares to play..... The character of Antony Mosses is the true definition for BOLDNESS... Breaking free of usual stereotypic heroes#Jayasurya as Aryan John too rendered superb performance, with a good role matching him... Energetic Performance,....#Rahman, with an equally important role, excelled in his character as Farhan.. Super.... ""Farhan.....You are a Brrilliant Police Officer"" :)The trio of Prithvi..Jayasurya and Rahman worked out well.....Great castingOther actors including Kunjan, Aparna Nair and the one who acted as Roy.. etc did their part well Kunjan's oath was superb......It remembers the duties and responsibilities of a police officer.....#Roshann_Andrews is a director, who is known for his rich making.... His direction seemed to be apt for this dark shaded thriller...Music by #Gopi_Sunder too was of top notch..... The Theme Music is still hearin' in ma ears...loved it...Good camera work was visible in every scene of the movie...Climax of the film...was really wonderful one.......I Liked it.... Even though it was revealed before watching this film, the way the script travels towards the climax was really thrilling one.... That Blue car's green colour.....automated Gun etc seemed to be an indication for coming of age thrillers in malayalam cinema...The film is something beyond usual police films....Totally..... Mumbai Police is one of the best thrillerrs of the recent times, with brilliant script and bold performance from Prithviraj...Superb.... My rating: 9/10Must watch in my views...Thank You for reading my review.... Any mistakes should be forgiven.....Yours truly.....Sooraj Pattazhy",breaking free stereotype police stories,mumbai police my reviewfinally watched mumbai police as me mumbai police was most expected malayalam film 2013 as was penned by bobby sanjay duo directed by roshann andrews it had some industrys good actors including jayasurya rahman my favourite prithviraj sukumaran i was planning watch this movie at time its release itself but unfortunately my annual examinations too were same time i missed this flick theatre after 4 months its theatrical release i have watched it first all i want mention one thing as i visit facebook other movie discussion websites frequently climax twist suspense elements were already exposed me punch face those who revealed suspense social medias these type fellows never change degraders even though suspense was revealed script bobby sanjay offered lot thrill was successful satisfying me core story film is known most us three friends three them are high level police officers one them gets killed one them solves it out before he could reveal murderer he gets into accident looses his memory inspite his memory loss his senior officer who is third friend asks him solve case once again find killer story movie is known most us hence there is no need explanation that part i liked movie very much first all i applaud thinking out box presenting us such film they have always been ma favourites especially ayaluum njanum thammil their lateral thinking has delivered many good movies such as ente veedu appunteyum notebook traffic ayalum njanum thammil now mumbai police if we make small comparison each movie is different genre had something variety it which breaks boundaries usual malayalam cinema breaking free stereotype hero oriented films antagonist is focused more this film highlight movie is that both protagonist antagonist is same person kudos them this brilliant script super super superb best script writes this generation quality dialogues genuine wits film showcases their talent out their brilliant minds they have created one most powerful characters recent times antony moses antony mosses was safe hands prithviraj delivered wholesome performance one best characterizations recent times he excelled his roles as rude villainous rascal mosses memory lost person who cannot remember his history mannerisms person who is haunted by his bad history is successfully portrayed by prithvi those climax sequences were really terrific requires great appreciation that bewildered antony mosses climax scenes were superb kudos this is character that none dares play character antony mosses is true definition boldness breaking free usual stereotypic heroes as aryan john too rendered superb performance with good role matching him energetic performance with equally important role excelled his character as farhan super farhan you are brrilliant police officer trio prithvi jayasurya rahman worked out well great castingother actors including kunjan aparna nair one who acted as roy etc did their part well kunjans oath was superb it remembers duties responsibilities police officer is director who is known his rich making his direction seemed be apt this dark shaded thriller music by too was top notch theme music is still hearin ma ears loved it good camera work was visible every scene movie climax film was really wonderful one i liked it even though it was revealed before watching this film way script travels towards climax was really thrilling one that blue cars green colour automated gun etc seemed be indication coming age thrillers malayalam cinema film is something beyond usual police films totally mumbai police is one best thrillerrs recent times with brilliant script bold performance prithviraj superb my rating 9 10must watch my views thank you reading my review any mistakes should be forgiven yours truly sooraj pattazhy,0.5959188034188033,0.3490598290598291,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.23}"

8.0,Sometimes a fight for justice challenges us into fighting self,"What worked: The movie sets up a very good premises for a good thriller, and it does make us believe in a narrative that's nonlinear and layered. I find the twists and mysteries to be quiet amusing and interesting.What did not work: It's the run time that's a bit sketchy considering a lot of scenes that could have been avoided. Firstly the repeated clip scenes, then the scenes that were loosely associated with the actual narrative. Some cliche melodramatic scenes could have been shortened down. Of course the boldness of putting a sexuality in the narrative is visible but the intend and the motives are not powerful enough for us as a viewer to relate or support. I would say the movie could have been better if the makers had made some changes in the narrative or even the situations that the series of events that happened.

7.0,A little derogatory but a fine thriller with Prithviraj Sukumaran's sublime characterization.,"Mumbai Police (2013) : Brief Review -A little derogatory but a fine thriller with Prithviraj Sukumaran's sublime characterization. Mumbai Police is one of those rare thrillers which plays a fine and unpredictable trick with the protagonist of the story. It tries to fool you by feeding some unrevealed facts as would be twists and then at the end opens completely different cards. However, the length required for such thriller should be less and Mumbai Police fails to catch it. It's not like that it will bore you to death and then reveal some sensational stuff but it's just that if they had these reasons as suspense material then they shouldn't have wasted 20-25 minutes around useless things. A tight runtime is one of the most important aspect for any thriller so any brilliant writer or director should pay a primary focus to it, if you don't then it actually hurts the repeat value of the product even if it's too good. The same problem is there with Mumbai Police. It takes longer than needed, that's it and nothing else is wrong about the film. For first-time viewing it's a terrific thriller and i strongly recommend it to everyone but repeat viewing is almost impossible. For me atleast. ACP Antony is the only one who knows the truth behind ACP Aaryan's murder. Antony meets with an accident, losing his memory and is unable to reveal the killer. He is forced to investigate the murder again hoping that he remembers something and then retraces past events to find shocking facts about the real culprit. I won't spoil anything here but Mumbai Police shows you one of the finest trick ever played with the protagonist of the film. Something what Farhan Akhtar did with 'Don' (2006) and recently 'Ittefaq' (2017). I hope you understood my hints and find it exciting. Two more reasons why Mumbai Police is a must watch are Prithviraj Sukumaran's sublime act and Rosshan Andrrews's convincing storytelling. Don't miss it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",little derogatory but fine thriller with prithviraj sukumarans sublime characterization,mumbai police 2013 brief review little derogatory but fine thriller with prithviraj sukumarans sublime characterization mumbai police is one those rare thrillers which plays fine unpredictable trick with protagonist story it tries fool you by feeding some unrevealed facts as would be twists then at end opens completely different cards however length required such thriller should be less mumbai police fails catch it its not like that it will bore you death then reveal some sensational stuff but its just that if they had these reasons as suspense material then they shouldnt have wasted 20 25 minutes around useless things tight runtime is one most important aspect any thriller so any brilliant writer or director should pay primary focus it if you dont then it actually hurts repeat value product even if its too good same problem is there with mumbai police it takes longer than needed thats it nothing else is wrong about film first time viewing its terrific thriller i strongly recommend it everyone but repeat viewing is almost impossible me atleast acp antony is only one who knows truth behind acp aaryans murder antony meets with accident losing his memory is unable reveal killer he is forced investigate murder again hoping that he remembers something then retraces past events find shocking facts about real culprit i wont spoil anything here but mumbai police shows you one finest trick ever played with protagonist film something what farhan akhtar did with don 2006 recently ittefaq 2017 i hope you understood my hints find it exciting two more reasons why mumbai police is must watch are prithviraj sukumarans sublime act rosshan andrrewss convincing storytelling dont miss it rating 7 10 by,0.5511011904761904,0.03741071428571428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,An unraveling of the self,"An unraveling of the self, 18 March 2015 *** This review may contain spoilers ***Not too sure about the relevance of the title, but this is a helluva thriller, & until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking about how much better the same 'condition' was treated in 'Anukokunda Oka Roju' a decade back (its pathetic remake, 'Sunday' not included).Having said that, this one focuses completely on a single investigative case, with the differentiator being the memory-loss suffered by the main protagonist, which is know only to 2 characters, & that makes for a riveting tale, especially since the main character is retracing his steps throughout, & this is great storytelling, since the audience has to be completely empathetic to the whole process. Save a few narrative mis-steps, & for an opportunity to mis-understand the motives of the makers, this makes for very engrossing viewing, even though the song-less runtime is 145 minutes. Needless to say at this stage, they just fly by.For most of the running time of the movie, I was not too happy with the single expression worn by the otherwise-good actor, Prithviraj Sukumaran. However, in retrospect, it seems completely apt, since, like us, the main lead is also piecing together the parts of his entire life, with evidence being provided by files/folders & people who are a part of his investigation into the death of a top cop. The attention to detail is inconsistent, but that also can be seen in context of the slowly peeling away nature of the narrative, that ensures that no one is ahead of the plot, save an important cast member, who, in a very clever sleight-of-hand, seems to be the prime suspect, since there are many convenient instances of his/her having perpetrated said crime under investigation, right until the very end.The background score is not up-to the mark though, & certain techniques of camera-work, & cinematography could perhaps have been done without, but those are very minor nits to pick in the context of the overall denouement.This might get swept under the rug, but before it does, a few thoughts - It is wonderful to see someone shine a light on the homophobia inherent in each & every character in our country, including the ones involved in such relationships. I know some might see this as a validation of how homophobic the film-makers themselves are, & that might well be the case, but regardless, it just might be that they are shining a light on this issue, since the pains they take to show even a schizophrenic's alter-ego also respond to society's conditioning, albeit unconsciously, has to appreciated, nee, applauded, even if it is unconscious.However, it is indeed difficult not to focus on the assertion made by the writers that being one is also clubbed with being violent, unscrupulous, callous & traitorous, & all it takes is one act of conscious re-awakening of his/her conscience, in order for that character to shrug of the other negatives along with their original sexual preference. I'm willing to give the makers a pass for that assertion, but it is indeed a bit tough to overlook.One of my fav actresses, Swetha Menon (Salt-n-Pepper, Rathinirvedam remake) is in the movie for 1 brief scene, & I do wish they had written more stuff for her, & that the movie was peppered with interactions between her & the main lead/s.I had bought my ticket to this one, but ended up missing it on the big screen, so I am glad I purchased the DVD recently, in spite of the fact that about 4-7 minutes played very badly. I hope I didn't miss a vital plot point (I don't think so, in the context of my comprehending the narrative, overall). Not to be missed, at least for appreciating an effort that veers from the traditional and the clich√©d.",unraveling self,unraveling self 18 march 2015 this review may contain spoilers not too sure about relevance title but this is helluva thriller until last 20 minutes i was thinking about how much better same condition was treated anukokunda oka roju decade back its pathetic remake sunday not included having said that this one focuses completely single investigative case with differentiator being memory loss suffered by main protagonist which is know only 2 characters that makes riveting tale especially since main character is retracing his steps throughout this is great storytelling since audience has be completely empathetic whole process save few narrative mis steps opportunity mis understand motives makers this makes very engrossing viewing even though song less runtime is 145 minutes needless say at this stage they just fly by most running time movie i was not too happy with single expression worn by otherwise good actor prithviraj sukumaran however retrospect it seems completely apt since like us main lead is also piecing together parts his entire life with evidence being provided by files folders people who are part his investigation into death top cop attention detail is inconsistent but that also can be seen context slowly peeling away nature narrative that ensures that no one is ahead plot save important cast member who very clever sleight hand seems be prime suspect since there are many convenient instances his her having perpetrated said crime under investigation right until very end background score is not up mark though certain techniques camera work cinematography could perhaps have been done without but those are very minor nits pick context overall denouement this might get swept under rug but before it does few thoughts it is wonderful see someone shine light homophobia inherent each every character our country including ones involved such relationships i know some might see this as validation how homophobic film makers themselves are that might well be case but regardless it just might be that they are shining light this issue since pains they take show even schizophrenics alter ego also respond societys conditioning albeit unconsciously has appreciated nee applauded even if it is unconscious however it is indeed difficult not focus assertion made by writers that being one is also clubbed with being violent unscrupulous callous traitorous all it takes is one act conscious re awakening his her conscience order that character shrug other negatives along with their original sexual preference im willing give makers pass that assertion but it is indeed bit tough overlook one my fav actresses swetha menon salt n pepper rathinirvedam remake is movie 1 brief scene i do wish they had written more stuff her that movie was peppered with interactions between her main lead s i had bought my ticket this one but ended up missing it big screen so i am glad i purchased dvd recently spite fact that about 4 7 minutes played very badly i hope i didnt miss vital plot point i dont think so context my comprehending narrative overall not be missed at least appreciating effort that veers traditional clich d,0.5468720080624843,0.13158604182413705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.44}"
3.0,The future generations will laugh at us.,"I watched this film after hearing that the protagonist is a gay person, which is almost a revolution in a conservative society like Kerala. The way gay people are portrayed in the film just disappointed my high expectations. The characters are so underdeveloped and their motives are unjustified by their actions in the film. There are so many scenes that are unbelievably coincidental as the writers could not break the clich√©s. Using cuts to fake the fight scene was effective, but still such a clich√© in Malayalam films. Solving Sudoku is used as a measure of eligibility to go back to work for a police officer who is suffering from memory loss. Unsurprisingly, the same officer is used to solve the same case again even after the superior realizing that the protagonist is suffering from the accident he had. The character done by Rahman was so badly developed and was created as an excuse for making the story the way the writers wanted. And the actor could not help but act badly too. I haven't seen any other films of Rahman from recent years, but in this film, he did such a terrible job. But I'd blame the writers for that. It is surprising that he hadn't had any sexual thoughts about any men for the period of investigation in the second term. His boyfriend visiting him on the last day of investigation is questionable. Chasing scene looked very fake, but acting of Prithvi and Jayasurya were convincing. Comparing to most of the Malayalam films these days, this film still wasn't the worst, so I am giving it a three.",future generations will laugh at us,i watched this film after hearing that protagonist is gay person which is almost revolution conservative society like kerala way gay people are portrayed film just disappointed my high expectations characters are so underdeveloped their motives are unjustified by their actions film there are so many scenes that are unbelievably coincidental as writers could not break clich s using cuts fake fight scene was effective but still such clich malayalam films solving sudoku is used as measure eligibility go back work police officer who is suffering memory loss unsurprisingly same officer is used solve same case again even after superior realizing that protagonist is suffering accident he had character done by rahman was so badly developed was created as excuse making story way writers wanted actor could not help but act badly too i havent seen any other films rahman recent years but this film he did such terrible job but id blame writers that it is surprising that he hadnt had any sexual thoughts about any men period investigation second term his boyfriend visiting him last day investigation is questionable chasing scene looked very fake but acting prithvi jayasurya were convincing comparing most malayalam films these days this film still wasnt worst so i am giving it three,0.5210416666666666,-0.004114583333333328,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"
