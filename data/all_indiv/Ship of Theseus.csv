,An experience not to be missed.,"Have been more than 5 months since I saw the film. But it surely got to be a film which will stay with me forever. A film dealing with a philosophical paradox doesn't sound exciting but this film totally surprised me. The paradox of the Ship of Theseus is an underlying layer of the film which has 3 stories. The characters in the film deal with things that challenge their beliefs and in unexpected ways. The beauty is in the treatment which is effortlessly unpredictable without ever being manipulative or calculated. You feel tremendous empathy for the characters which seems to come for the filmmakers deep understanding of the human psychology and behavior unlike most films/narratives where the author/ filmmaker try to 'design' a character for the purpose of eliciting emotions. Here its all so natural that there seems no design and that is the best part about the performances. They are real as well as really intriguing. I found the character of monk played by Neeraj Kabi to be specially intriguing. His is an amazingly natural performance and yet larger than life in some ways. Sohum Shah was a revelation. For once I thought that he may have been casted in the film for being the producer but when you see the film, he was just brilliant. His performance is one which is so subdued that it took me sometime to realize how good he is. Aida who plays the photographer also delivers a delightful performance. I guess her role was the most difficult as she plays a character which one cannot normally find references in real life or even fiction and despite that she delivers such a natural performance.What is most surprising about the film is its technical finesse. Cinematography is the best you'll see, the film is a visual treat. It took me sometime to realise that the film is set in Bombay not because its a Bombay which you rarely ever see in Bollywood films. It was later that I got to know that the film was shot on a Canon DSLR and I couldn't believe it. Sound design and mixing is also top notch something which is rare for low budget productions(In Indian context even for big budget films). The background score is absolutely mesmerising and only comes when needed. Particular mention should be made of the Naham Janami song which plays in the background during the monk story. I really believe that this film deserves a big screen experience and that is why am so happy that it is finally releasing in India otherwise most would have either not seen it or would have to see it on small screens which does not do justice to this film. I can go and on about the film but at this point will end at this note that do not miss this film if you get an opportunity to see it. You'll thank me for this!",experience not be missed,have been more than 5 months since i saw film but it surely got be film which will stay with me forever film dealing with philosophical paradox doesnt sound exciting but this film totally surprised me paradox ship theseus is underlying layer film which has 3 stories characters film deal with things that challenge their beliefs unexpected ways beauty is treatment which is effortlessly unpredictable without ever being manipulative or calculated you feel tremendous empathy characters which seems come filmmakers deep understanding human psychology behavior unlike most films narratives where author filmmaker try design character purpose eliciting emotions here its all so natural that there seems no design that is best part about performances they are real as well as really intriguing i found character monk played by neeraj kabi be specially intriguing his is amazingly natural performance yet larger than life some ways sohum shah was revelation once i thought that he may have been casted film being producer but when you see film he was just brilliant his performance is one which is so subdued that it took me sometime realize how good he is aida who plays photographer also delivers delightful performance i guess her role was most difficult as she plays character which one cannot normally find references real life or even fiction despite that she delivers such natural performance what is most surprising about film is its technical finesse cinematography is best youll see film is visual treat it took me sometime realise that film is set bombay not because its bombay which you rarely ever see bollywood films it was later that i got know that film was shot canon dslr i couldnt believe it sound design mixing is also top notch something which is rare low budget productions indian context even big budget films background score is absolutely mesmerising only comes when needed particular mention should be made naham janami song which plays background during monk story i really believe that this film deserves big screen experience that is why am so happy that it is finally releasing india otherwise most would have either not seen it or would have see it small screens which does not do justice this film i can go about film but at this point will end at this note that do not miss this film if you get opportunity see it youll thank me this,0.5320861678004535,0.2639455782312925,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Sheer Poetry gives Indian Cinema a new definition..,"""Whether the ship would remain the same if it were entirely replaced, piece by piece. What would happen if their original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a second ship. Which ship, if either, is the Ship of Theseus'.""Ship of Theseus starts by stating the Theseus' paradox and then moves on, leaving the viewers struggling to find the answer of this paradox. SOT is based upon three stories which raises questions on Existence, Identity, Humanity and Karma.The first story is about a girl named Aaliya Kamal (Aida El-Kashef) who took photography after she lost her eyesight to a cornea infection and when she is asked ""Do you feel limited?"", she replies ""Uhh.. No. Why is it so amazing not to have limits and doubts?"". This is the part where each and every frame of the film looks stunning and exceptionally beautiful. There is no story in this part but it's about the perception of beauty, how black and white can be the most colorful combination and how a person loses her comfort when she gets her vision back. Aida plays with her eyes and did a great job with her part. Watch out for her body movements when she hears distinct voices during her photo sessions. Pankaj Kumar (director of photography) does an excellent job and his part gives real definition to the movie's aesthetic value. The sequence where Aaliya starts seeing her photographs when she gets her vision back is another highlight of the movie. Ah!!! Those photographs were just mind blowing.The second story shows an ailing monk, Maitreya (Neeraj Kabi) who is suffering from Liver Cirrhosis and is fighting against pharmaceutical companies which performs cruelty against animals for the sake of experiments. It's the part where questions are raised about Karma, Religions and Beliefs. The moment where Chakrava (Vinay Shukla) asks the monk, when he is restricting himself to take medications to support his protest, ""What about the violence you are committing on yourself by not taking medication?. And how is your choice not different from a suicide bomber who is so convinced about the fundamentalism of his political and religious thoughts?"" and so many points that he makes e.g., ""what if the caterpillar's karma was to get crushed"" sequence and the fungus-making- an-ant-a-zombie-to-reap-benefits-out-of-it-concept defines this part and we, the viewers get puzzled with each and every words what this character says. It apparently questions the monk's beliefs and his karma. This is a part where to some extent dullness appears just before the interval but goes to another level when it ends in the second half.Neeraj Kabi is exceptionally well in his role of a monk. Hats off to him for the workout he did for this role.The final part takes the whole movie to another level by asking questions on humanity and why the poor always gets crushed by the rich peoples. It's a story of a stockbroker who is the recipient of a kidney, which he later discovers that it was stolen from a labor who has been part of a racket which was led by highly esteemed doctors. It changes his life's perspective and then he goes to help that poor and make things better for him. This part is totally gripping and will be highly likable by many peoples. An exceptional performance by Sohum Shah makes this part even better.Ship Of Theseus didn't waste any time on character development. It starts from the middle of the characters' life and doesn't tell you about their ending. But it tells you the way their perception gets changed about their life. At the start I was thinking about the title. But when the film ended I thought that this is the most appropriate title which a movie could ever have. Anand Gandhi provides us a movie of the decade and is certainly going to give Indian Cinema a new definition. He is a talent to watch out for.I am going with 4.5 stars for Ship Of Theseus. It's not run of the mill kind of movie but if you are a movie fanatic then it's totally your cup of tea. MISS IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!.P.S:- Twitter was heavily flooded with the praises of Ship Of Theseus, but I was skeptical regarding those.But now the one tweet which I totally found appropriate for the movie is ""After watching the movie, do a blood test. You will find the traces of the film in it"".",sheer poetry gives indian cinema new definition,whether ship would remain same if it were entirely replaced piece by piece what would happen if their original planks were gathered up after they were replaced used build second ship which ship if either is ship theseus ship theseus starts by stating theseus paradox then moves leaving viewers struggling find answer this paradox sot is based upon three stories which raises questions existence identity humanity karma first story is about girl named aaliya kamal aida el kashef who took photography after she lost her eyesight cornea infection when she is asked do you feel limited she replies uhh no why is it so amazing not have limits doubts this is part where each every frame film looks stunning exceptionally beautiful there is no story this part but its about perception beauty how black white can be most colorful combination how person loses her comfort when she gets her vision back aida plays with her eyes did great job with her part watch out her body movements when she hears distinct voices during her photo sessions pankaj kumar director photography does excellent job his part gives real definition movies aesthetic value sequence where aaliya starts seeing her photographs when she gets her vision back is another highlight movie ah those photographs were just mind blowing second story shows ailing monk maitreya neeraj kabi who is suffering liver cirrhosis is fighting against pharmaceutical companies which performs cruelty against animals sake experiments its part where questions are raised about karma religions beliefs moment where chakrava vinay shukla asks monk when he is restricting himself take medications support his protest what about violence you are committing yourself by not taking medication how is your choice not different suicide bomber who is so convinced about fundamentalism his political religious thoughts so many points that he makes e g what if caterpillars karma was get crushed sequence fungus making ant zombie reap benefits out it concept defines this part we viewers get puzzled with each every words what this character says it apparently questions monks beliefs his karma this is part where some extent dullness appears just before interval but goes another level when it ends second half neeraj kabi is exceptionally well his role monk hats off him workout he did this role final part takes whole movie another level by asking questions humanity why poor always gets crushed by rich peoples its story stockbroker who is recipient kidney which he later discovers that it was stolen labor who has been part racket which was led by highly esteemed doctors it changes his lifes perspective then he goes help that poor make things better him this part is totally gripping will be highly likable by many peoples exceptional performance by sohum shah makes this part even better ship theseus didnt waste any time character development it starts middle characters life doesnt tell you about their ending but it tells you way their perception gets changed about their life at start i was thinking about title but when film ended i thought that this is most appropriate title which movie could ever have anand gandhi provides us movie decade is certainly going give indian cinema new definition he is talent watch out i am going with 4 5 stars ship theseus its not run mill kind movie but if you are movie fanatic then its totally your cup tea miss it at your own risk p s twitter was heavily flooded with praises ship theseus but i was skeptical regarding those but now one tweet which i totally found appropriate movie is after watching movie do blood test you will find traces film it,0.4774451659451659,0.1845930735930736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,Gem of a Cinema,"Anand Gandhi's SHIP OF THESEUS is in one sentence an amazing story, amazingly shot. One rarely came across a film where narrative is powerful but the visuals add a whole new subtext, a new dimension to the overall experience. Without being too arty, intellectual or surreal, it is an original piece of cinema, where there are moments when you wish your characters to stay silent and they get into arguments and when you expect them to say the things, they stay silent yet speak a lot. It is a classic example of a wonderful use of the language of cinema. It engages your mind provided you have not left it at your home to watch a mindless entertainer. It is intense, sensitive thus overall a rare gem of cinema.

10.0,Very deep. Watch it with an open mind.,"Review #2.Ship of Theseus is a very different cinematic experience. It moves you, it makes you think about life in a different way. The characters, the narrative don't ever leave you. Anand Gandhi is definitely a talent to look out for. There are three different stories. Each with a different plot but same destination. The first one brings you in life of a girl who had lost her eyesight due to cornea and does photography. The second one is about a monk who should have an organ transplant. And the third one is about a stockbroker who just had a kidney transplant. The stories instantaneously connect with you. It's hard to decide which one of the three is the best. I would say the three altogether make one of the finest movies ever made in India. And it would not be wrong to say that it is the best Indian movie of the year. The performances are very real. Specially Neeraj Sir. The direction and cinematography are exceptional. At last, I would like to say that It is not a usual Indian movie. Go with your brains and you'll experience something you've never experienced before.",very deep watch it with open mind,review ship theseus is very different cinematic experience it moves you it makes you think about life different way characters narrative dont ever leave you anand gandhi is definitely talent look out there are three different stories each with different plot but same destination first one brings you life girl who had lost her eyesight due cornea does photography second one is about monk who should have organ transplant third one is about stockbroker who just had kidney transplant stories instantaneously connect with you its hard decide which one three is best i would say three altogether make one finest movies ever made india it would not be wrong say that it is best indian movie year performances are very real specially neeraj sir direction cinematography are exceptional at last i would like say that it is not usual indian movie go with your brains youll experience something youve never experienced before,0.46585497835497836,0.10275974025974026,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,Organ transplants are a more interesting topic than I ever imagined. Some dark side effects give much food for thought,"Transplantation of body parts seems very useful, and cannot be thought away anymore from our current way of life. However, there are dark sides around it that we never see or even want to consider that they exist. Three stories, or rather parables, take us on a journey through these dark sides. This film was part of the Rotterdam film festival 2013.The first story about a blind (!) photographer is the least sombre of the three. Though being blind (we don't hear whether she is born that way, or acquired blindness later) she proves to be very talented in her profession, producing very original images in a way that no one else can imitate. Despite her handicap she lives a full life, is happily married, and is very able to find her way outside while making photographs. We see interesting in-house discussions with her husband about the photo's she decides to dismiss, based solely on her intuition, and about her reluctance to keep copies anyway for possible use later. We see the process of being cured from her blindness from a transplant operation. Alas, it does not improve her professional skills, however strange that may seem. In the end we see her overwhelmed by the multitude of images on the street, something that we are used to and are able to cope with easily. But unlike her past method of operation where she could easily find the crucial elements of a situation, and make that the core of her photos, she is now unable to choose, and practically seems to have lost her professional capabilities. This is where her story ends.The second story involves animal testing, as something that cannot be avoided to advance medical science. The main character decides to not have his liver transplanted, though everyone in his environment pressures him to drop his objections. We see arguments pro and con, partly in the format of court proceedings, and partly in the form of images from animal testing. But our main character's condition worsens, until he eventually gives in and decides to be operated anyway. We don't see how it works out, because the second story ends here.The third story is the most complex one, also providing the most material to ponder about aforementioned dark side effects. A man who himself has been given a donor kidney, visits his mother in hospital, and learns by accident about someone who was taken his kidney away while having an appendix operation. It happened in a shady hospital, apparently making money from covert operations like this. He delves deeper in the matter, and eventually finds the recipient of the kidney in Sweden. The latter is not aware of the sinister ways he received his transplant, and only heard that the donor was paid very well and consented with the transfer. A stalemate situation is reached, since the organ cannot be given back to the rightful owner. It serves no useful purpose to condense the rest of the story here, but it triggers many thoughts about this transplant ""industry"", initially created to help people in need but also yielding side effects we don't want to know.All in all, I was reasonably satisfied having seen this film. It lets you think about issues that you rather want to reason away. My only problem with the film were the switches from story to story, which were not clearly delineated. Suddenly you see other characters appear on screen, different from the story at hand, and that is the only clue you get that a new story is about to start. The opening lines about the Theseus ship is a nice stepping stone to think about the parts our body is made of, and whether exchanging some of the parts make you a different person.",organ transplants are more interesting topic than i ever imagined some dark side effects give much food thought,transplantation body parts seems very useful cannot be thought away anymore our current way life however there are dark sides around it that we never see or even want consider that they exist three stories or rather parables take us journey through these dark sides this film was part rotterdam film festival 2013 first story about blind photographer is least sombre three though being blind we dont hear whether she is born that way or acquired blindness later she proves be very talented her profession producing very original images way that no one else can imitate despite her handicap she lives full life is happily married is very able find her way outside while making photographs we see interesting house discussions with her husband about photos she decides dismiss based solely her intuition about her reluctance keep copies anyway possible use later we see process being cured her blindness transplant operation alas it does not improve her professional skills however strange that may seem end we see her overwhelmed by multitude images street something that we are used are able cope with easily but unlike her past method operation where she could easily find crucial elements situation make that core her photos she is now unable choose practically seems have lost her professional capabilities this is where her story ends second story involves animal testing as something that cannot be avoided advance medical science main character decides not have his liver transplanted though everyone his environment pressures him drop his objections we see arguments pro con partly format court proceedings partly form images animal testing but our main characters condition worsens until he eventually gives decides be operated anyway we dont see how it works out because second story ends here third story is most complex one also providing most material ponder about aforementioned dark side effects man who himself has been given donor kidney visits his mother hospital learns by accident about someone who was taken his kidney away while having appendix operation it happened shady hospital apparently making money covert operations like this he delves deeper matter eventually finds recipient kidney sweden latter is not aware sinister ways he received his transplant only heard that donor was paid very well consented with transfer stalemate situation is reached since organ cannot be given back rightful owner it serves no useful purpose condense rest story here but it triggers many thoughts about this transplant industry initially created help people need but also yielding side effects we dont want know all all i was reasonably satisfied having seen this film it lets you think about issues that you rather want reason away my only problem with film were switches story story which were not clearly delineated suddenly you see other characters appear screen different story at hand that is only clue you get that new story is about start opening lines about theseus ship is nice stepping stone think about parts our body is made whether exchanging some parts make you different person,0.4430827505827506,0.08575174825174825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,Get soaked......,"If one has got his/her basics in the right place, whatever is churned out (even if art) automatically scores good while transition from good to great is left to the creativity and imagination involved.""Ship of Theseus"" does exactly so and not only gets the basics right but also excels in each of them.With mind-blowing cinematography (How cud that be a DSLR?!!!!!), super-crisp editing,superb screenplay,superlative acting (Neeraj Kabi & Sohum Seth take a bow!!!!),music (that song in the monk story was simply amazing) and even comic reliefs there's not much room left for complaints. Now, coming to the gray area of creativity or whatever you call it, ""Ship of Theseus"" also scores (high enough) but may be not as seamless as its basics (off course IMO).The biggest positive that it has is not being either emotionally or intellectually manipulative.Its a treat to watch a film which is straight enough, with not much hidden in layers and yet so very subtle.Its left for the viewers to perceive once the film ends and continue the journey within.With so many chances that the director could have taken to succumb to push emotional epiphany he never compromises,not even in last reel.And once you know that the same man was involved behind ""Kyunki Saas Bhi..."" you understand what transformation/compromise(?) means as depicted in the film itself.To talk about drawbacks I found the film lacking in its background score.Not that the realtime sounds as in docu-feature style or absence of constant music is a problem.But more than often it doesn't do justice to the exemplary visuals or images that we see on screen.Those lash green grasses,the centipede movement,the array of photographs,the monk in white walking in rain or through huge sewage lines on both sides with black water flowing below-all of these scenes demanded some musical piece behind.The piece that would bind the film together.Also,of the three stories rather storeys only the first justifies the title while the other two are deeper and close.Yes,though it meets all regular and expected requirements, ""Ship of Theseus"" could have had a few more exciting requirements to its name.You can't complain,you can only wish and also wish more films like this gets a theatrical release and get the required backing (Thanks Kiran Rao).I am not sure whether this will be a life-changing film for all as selected by the Critics Circle,UK But as inspite of Neeraj Kabi,Aida El-Kashef,Vinay shukla,Sohum Seth and almost everyone else giving of Mr.Mehta (don't know the actor's name) that will stay with me for all as did the father in ""A Separation"", ""Ship Of Theseus"" also has every chance to stay with you for long.",get soaked,if one has got his her basics right place whatever is churned out even if art automatically scores good while transition good great is left creativity imagination involved ship theseus does exactly so not only gets basics right but also excels each them with mind blowing cinematography how cud that be dslr super crisp editing superb screenplay superlative acting neeraj kabi sohum seth take bow music that song monk story was simply amazing even comic reliefs theres not much room left complaints now coming gray area creativity or whatever you call it ship theseus also scores high enough but may be not as seamless as its basics off course imo biggest positive that it has is not being either emotionally or intellectually manipulative its treat watch film which is straight enough with not much hidden layers yet so very subtle its left viewers perceive once film ends continue journey within with so many chances that director could have taken succumb push emotional epiphany he never compromises not even last reel once you know that same man was involved behind kyunki saas bhi you understand what transformation compromise means as depicted film itself talk about drawbacks i found film lacking its background score not that realtime sounds as docu feature style or absence constant music is problem but more than often it doesnt do justice exemplary visuals or images that we see screen those lash green grasses centipede movement array photographs monk white walking rain or through huge sewage lines both sides with black water flowing below all these scenes demanded some musical piece behind piece that would bind film together also three stories rather storeys only first justifies title while other two are deeper close yes though it meets all regular expected requirements ship theseus could have had few more exciting requirements its name you cant complain you can only wish also wish more films like this gets theatrical release get required backing thanks kiran rao i am not sure whether this will be life changing film all as selected by critics circle uk but as inspite neeraj kabi aida el kashef vinay shukla sohum seth almost everyone else giving mr mehta dont know actors name that will stay with me all as did father separation ship theseus also has every chance stay with you long,0.44256657388732856,0.1318465653843012,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.48}"

9.0,The ship of Theseus sails the high seas!!!,"Anand Gandhi's debut feature film The Ship of Thesues is a rare gem in the indie cinema circle which comes out with more crap in the name of struggle and rebel than anything worthy of watching.I am not even talking of bollywood here.Watching continuum it was quite clear that the director scores high in mixing simple philosophies of the world with everyday tales.Here he takes a philosophical paradox and extends it to three different tales that connect in the end.The acting is brilliant,such unknown actors being able to emote so clearly in English and various languages credit goes to the director.The landscapes n locations reflect the inner conflict that the characters are going through.It is still not in the league of Tarkovsky,Malick maybe due to lack of a strong music background but is somewhere on the steps to that house of talent where even bergmann reached.It works perfectly in the first story of the blind photographer,her inner conflict of recognition vs objectivity in art is very well summarized in some dialogues that remind everyone of a coffee talk that they must have had with their best critics and fake philanderers.Even the philosophy of the title matches perfectly with the first story.The middle story about a monk has the strongest acting seen for a long time in Indian Cinema.The shloka by rohit sharma in jain language explains all the philosophies of the monk so clearly n cleverly.His voice, argument as well as staunch beliefs are so strongly acted out and written. The comic break from the lawyer works well in giving it a break like light n shades. What doesn't work is the monks acceptance of life against the miseries of death, though it shows that the monk is free of religious beliefs in formulating his own thoughts, there is no such strong moment of cinematic epiphany that convinces the audience of a switch over. I meant a subtle one not a overly dramatic one.And also is the failure of the philosophy of the ship of Theseus. We don't think he changes or his views change due to his liver change.in fact its his mind that changes when one of his body part threatens to dismantle the whole(that his body) on which functions his unique mind.The last story works more as a comic n funny satire on genes working against their predetermined course in India.A stock market broker as being an artistic Granny's only left grandson is funny and so is his logic for living as he wants to.But when challenged his compassion extends from mumbai to its slums to the beautiful locales of Sweden as if almost like an ode to bergmann n tarkovksy.There is also a top shot of grass blowing in the wind as if taken from a Andrei Tarkovsky film but lacks the magical music along with it.It is also illogical that the theory of ship works in this one..it doesn't.The middle n last one have in fact changes of mind due to change in body part is hard to bite.Almost like 21 grams had a heart replacement surgery making the recipient fall in love with the donors wife.And what the film lacks is the emotional epiphanies.Though the eerie end where the different body parts of a dead person come to see his creative cognition, is by far the best fitting end ever to such a conflicting theory of body vs mind. It gave me shivers that the persons body was still alive and its mind dead and yet the new recipients could feel what the mind tried to explore in the cave. The cave almost being a metaphor for understanding the universe by the humble mind which accepts answers to easily then pose big questions.Indias first sci-fi cum philosophy cum drama and really one of the best best Indies to ever come out.I am sure the director wouldn't cry about the struggle in finding finance rather he would ask the strugglers to search for talent within themselves.",ship theseus sails high seas,anand gandhis debut feature film ship thesues is rare gem indie cinema circle which comes out with more crap name struggle rebel than anything worthy watching i am not even talking bollywood here watching continuum it was quite clear that director scores high mixing simple philosophies world with everyday tales here he takes philosophical paradox extends it three different tales that connect end acting is brilliant such unknown actors being able emote so clearly english various languages credit goes director landscapes n locations reflect inner conflict that characters are going through it is still not league tarkovsky malick maybe due lack strong music background but is somewhere steps that house talent where even bergmann reached it works perfectly first story blind photographer her inner conflict recognition vs objectivity art is very well summarized some dialogues that remind everyone coffee talk that they must have had with their best critics fake philanderers even philosophy title matches perfectly with first story middle story about monk has strongest acting seen long time indian cinema shloka by rohit sharma jain language explains all philosophies monk so clearly n cleverly his voice argument as well as staunch beliefs are so strongly acted out written comic break lawyer works well giving it break like light n shades what doesnt work is monks acceptance life against miseries death though it shows that monk is free religious beliefs formulating his own thoughts there is no such strong moment cinematic epiphany that convinces audience switch over i meant subtle one not overly dramatic one also is failure philosophy ship theseus we dont think he changes or his views change due his liver change fact its his mind that changes when one his body part threatens dismantle whole that his body which functions his unique mind last story works more as comic n funny satire genes working against their predetermined course india stock market broker as being artistic grannys only left grandson is funny so is his logic living as he wants but when challenged his compassion extends mumbai its slums beautiful locales sweden as if almost like ode bergmann n tarkovksy there is also top shot grass blowing wind as if taken andrei tarkovsky film but lacks magical music along with it it is also illogical that theory ship works this one it doesnt middle n last one have fact changes mind due change body part is hard bite almost like 21 grams had heart replacement surgery making recipient fall love with donors wife what film lacks is emotional epiphanies though eerie end where different body parts dead person come see his creative cognition is by far best fitting end ever such conflicting theory body vs mind it gave me shivers that persons body was still alive its mind dead yet new recipients could feel what mind tried explore cave cave almost being metaphor understanding universe by humble mind which accepts answers easily then pose big questions indias first sci fi cum philosophy cum drama really one best best indies ever come out i am sure director wouldnt cry about struggle finding finance rather he would ask strugglers search talent within themselves,0.5169253162857813,0.16509337561663145,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,Send this to the Oscars! It will make history.,"I've been hearing about this movie for a long time. Directors like Anurag Kashyap and Dibakar (who I admire) praised this movie unconditionally.

This is a film that makes the 100 years of Indian Cinema's history look like zero compared to this. Maybe I'm praising it too much. But this can join the list with Mother India, Pyaasa, Sahib, Biwi Aur Gulaam and Sholay as one of the greatest Indian movies ever made.There are three stories in the movie that ends together in the end. I don't want to talk about because that would ruin everything. Just watch it!I can't end this review without talking about the Camera-work. It's brilliant! Pankaj Kumar is the next big thing as far as the cinematography department is concerned.And finally, as Indians, we should encourage this movie, it deserves to be watched. It makes you think.

9.0,Ship Of Theseus and Tumbbad- Anand Gandhi raising the Bar of Indian Cinema beyond Hollywood.,"Ship Of Theseus (2012) : Brief Review -Ship Of Theseus and Tumbbad- Anand Gandhi raising the Bar of Indian Cinema beyond Hollywood. Ship Of Theseus is PURE CLASS! INDEED A WORLD CINEMA MASTERPIECE! Fortunately both the films of Anand Gandhi came in watchlist and unfortunately i couldn't watch any of them in Theatre. Well it doesn't matter now because both the films have left huge impact on me and how, undoubtedly highest for any bollywood films in the last decade. I have watched over 800+ Bollywood films from the last decade and here are My Top 2 Best Films of the Decade, first is Tumbbad and 2nd is Ship Of Theseus.. both coming from One Creative Genius Brain Mr. Anand Gandhi. For Tumbbad i said, A lesson not just to Hollywood but also to World Cinema that how to turn a mythological horror film into Human Masterpiece. Anyways Tumbbad was Visually stunning and very cinematic operation but Ship Of Theseus is an Artistic and Realistic Cinema scoring at it's Best. There are no dramatic moments, there's not a single shadow of something called Cinematic Liberty, everything happens so realistically, so artistically, so purely, so simply and so incredibly. Hats off to Anand Gandhi for creating this Gem of Art Cinema with human resources and intellectual thoughts from Indian Lifestyle. Ship of Theseus is a story of everyone because it explores meaning of life, death, money, identity and giving something back to the world in which we live. From cinematography to dialogues this film is like an extraordinary art exhibition. I can't believe someone did have such a vision in Bollywood to shoot a scene on Road in one take with 2 minutes of argument between 2 Highly Intellectual minds talking about Life and Death, and the second scene shot in Mumbai's Slum. Writing, Screenplay, Dialogues, Cinematography and Direction everything is Perfect and by perfect i mean they always say 'Nothing is Perfect, yes but there's always something close to Perfection'. I believe, it will take some years for Indian Cinema to produce something like this. Ship Of Theseus is a MUST WATCH for Classes, a film and an experience not to be missed at any cost. Do yourself a favour and watch this film if you want to see Indian Cinema defeating Hollywood in Realistic Intellectual Cinema. And remember the name Anand Gandhi because i am not gonna forget it anytime soon.

7.0,Intriguing and Thought-Provoking Piece of Independent Indian Cinema!,"Anand Gandhi's first feature-length film is an intriguing and thought-provoking piece of Independent cinema; it deals with life, purpose and philosophy. Gandhi's prior experience with short films helps him direct the three disparate story lines with certain finesse; the stories shed some light on Theseus's Paradox and give a transcendent look at consequences arising from individual actions.In Greek Legend, according to Plutarch, Theseus's ship was preserved, and the decayed parts were replaced piece by piece until no part of the original ship remained. Plutarch asks whether you would call it the same ship or not. The paradox might seem too confusing to discuss, but Anand Gandhi just uses this to connect the three plots through the theme of organ donation, questioning identity in the face of change. Rather than making a statement, Gandhi just raises interest and discusses various important philosophies and issues; having compelling arguments for and against the topics, it helps us being a part of the discussion.The characters are likable and interesting. All the actors have done a commendable job, and Neeraj Kabi's brilliant performance as the Jain monk stands out. As the three stories go, the first one (with the blind Egyptian photographer) deals with behaviour to change, the second one (with the animal-rights supporting Jain monk) might seem more philosophically and intellectually orgasmic, but it's the third one (with a stock broker seeking justice for a kidney scam victim) which oozes with brutal honesty. The use of humour to lighten the serious tone of the movie is delightful.The cinematography is spectacular. Rarely have I seen such breathtaking visuals in an Independent film; the shots have a certain poetic and aesthetic charm. The blend of far-off shots and sudden close-ups gives us an intimate look at the characters' lives.The movie is really good, but far from perfection. 2 hours 20 minutes is too long for the movie; with better editing, it could have maintained the pace and momentum well. And as most movies with multiple story lines suffer from this, the characters lack enough depth and screen-time for us to invest ourselves in them. The first story, though the idea of a blind photographer is a bit far-fetched, suffers from an abrupt ending. The second story has many interesting viewpoints and arguments, but part of them seem off-the-book and pretentious; it suffers from an illogical ending too. The third story, though quite honest and absorbing, is quite messy and detours from the main theme of the movie.From writing screenplay and dialogues for cheesy soap operas to an intellectual independent feature film, Anand Gandhi has come a long way; I guess his experience as a playwright and short-film director must have come in handy.",intriguing thought provoking piece independent indian cinema,anand gandhis first feature length film is intriguing thought provoking piece independent cinema it deals with life purpose philosophy gandhis prior experience with short films helps him direct three disparate story lines with certain finesse stories shed some light theseuss paradox give transcendent look at consequences arising individual actions greek legend according plutarch theseuss ship was preserved decayed parts were replaced piece by piece until no part original ship remained plutarch asks whether you would call it same ship or not paradox might seem too confusing discuss but anand gandhi just uses this connect three plots through theme organ donation questioning identity face change rather than making statement gandhi just raises interest discusses various important philosophies issues having compelling arguments against topics it helps us being part discussion characters are likable interesting all actors have done commendable job neeraj kabis brilliant performance as jain monk stands out as three stories go first one with blind egyptian photographer deals with behaviour change second one with animal rights supporting jain monk might seem more philosophically intellectually orgasmic but its third one with stock broker seeking justice kidney scam victim which oozes with brutal honesty use humour lighten serious tone movie is delightful cinematography is spectacular rarely have i seen such breathtaking visuals independent film shots have certain poetic aesthetic charm blend far off shots sudden close ups gives us intimate look at characters lives movie is really good but far perfection 2 hours 20 minutes is too long movie with better editing it could have maintained pace momentum well as most movies with multiple story lines suffer this characters lack enough depth screen time us invest ourselves them first story though idea blind photographer is bit far fetched suffers abrupt ending second story has many interesting viewpoints arguments but part them seem off book pretentious it suffers illogical ending too third story though quite honest absorbing is quite messy detours main theme movie writing screenplay dialogues cheesy soap operas intellectual independent feature film anand gandhi has come long way i guess his experience as playwright short film director must have come handy,0.5119885982562039,0.13291415157612335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,An Allusion to Life through Theseus' paradox.,"I got the opportunity of watching ""Ship Of Theseus"" at a special screening at the Jagran Film Festival in Lucknow. To be very honest, I've seen almost close to a thousand films so far and I could swear that this film stands out in every sense of film making and viewing. Accompanied by my mother, I was sitting in this multiplex theater hoping for something worth absorbing by the novice mind of mine as I was rather worried that I may not grasp much of this already world acclaimed film that has been called a ""gem"" and a ""masterpiece"" by the honourable names of the cinema community.Nevertheless as the film began the ""Theseus' paradox"" was highlighted in plain language on the screen, which as mentioned in Wikipedia, ""... raises the question of whether an object which has had all its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object."" Though, I already did a bit of reading on the film's title I couldn't help but feel all excited by this idea which somewhat illuminated the simultaneous existence of universal allusion about ""replaceability"" and ""irreplaceability"" during the course of the film.The film was divided into 3 segments about 3 characters who in turn eventually highlight the aforementioned concept while dealing with their own personal dilemmas regarding being the recipients of organ donation, which in turn brings their indisposed lives to normal but changes them and their perceptions forever. The first two had been portrayed by Aida El-Kashef (an Egyptian film maker/actress) and Neeraj Kabi (with whom I had the pleasure of shaking hands). I must mention quite frankly this has been one of the finest films ever made in a long time, in India and abroad.The producers – Sohum Shah(who was also a cast in the 3rd segment), Mukesh Shah, Amita Shah – please take a bow, in a series of many. A more incredible work had been done by the writer-director of the film – Anand Gandhi (earlier been nominated for this year's Best Screenplay at the Asian Film Awards for the same), by making a simple-yet-complex theme come alive in such a grand light on-screen. The most exceptional characteristics of the film have been the cinematography (Pankaj Kumar) and sound design(Hungarian-based Gabor Erdelyi), the former being of the symbolic magnitude of, ""The Tree of Life"". Last but not the least, the film's editing work - Adesh Prasad, Sanyukta Kaza, Satchit Puranik - had been equally meticulous and give the film a gem-cut look, and a lot more in a narrative flwo.To summarise, even though being full of one's philosophical and personal predicaments and deeper meanings than presumed (like – ""Life of Pi"") the film will serve everyone who view it because it will have a subjective meaning for each, no matter how big or small it may seem, and will allow them to appreciate the lives of men and women around and above all, of their own.Verdict - Must-watch, at every cost!

10.0,A Thought provoking genius,"I went for the movie with nil expectations though i was aware of the genre. But it impressed me beyond excellence at the end. The movie presents three stories seemingly different from one another but the way the different threads of the stories get intertwined at the end into one beautiful fabric is an absolute pleasure to the senses. As per me I perceived there were multiple layers to the story each layer contributing as an example in some way to the ship of theseus paradox. The way in which it subtly presents the fact that if something changes in us, we do not remain the same person from thereon. This change may be a change in the way we perceive the world, or a change in our belief system , or a change in our attitude towards other people. The next layer of the story is what amazed me most , which consists of bringing the three stories together to show how a human being is not just flesh and bones but comprises of ideas, emotions, beliefs etc. What makes each one of us different is our thought process, our ideas, our choices and many other things. A very simple example to state such theory could be a case of twins who share the same progeny, the some womb, the same features but end up completely different. I guess i have already said a lot, if your brain has a good appetite for thought this is the movie for you.",thought provoking genius,i went movie with nil expectations though i was aware genre but it impressed me beyond excellence at end movie presents three stories seemingly different one another but way different threads stories get intertwined at end into one beautiful fabric is absolute pleasure senses as per me i perceived there were multiple layers story each layer contributing as example some way ship theseus paradox way which it subtly presents fact that if something changes us we do not remain same person thereon this change may be change way we perceive world or change our belief system or change our attitude towards other people next layer story is what amazed me most which consists bringing three stories together show how human being is not just flesh bones but comprises ideas emotions beliefs etc what makes each one us different is our thought process our ideas our choices many other things very simple example state such theory could be case twins who share same progeny some womb same features but end up completely different i guess i have already said lot if your brain has good appetite thought this is movie you,0.4472402597402597,0.1553030303030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"

4.0,Same premise has been more interestingly made in films before.,"After reading news reports that this movie will create a revolution of sorts in independent cinema and stuff like that, I went to see it last night. The premise of focussing on the lives of 3 people (who have/will be) obtaining a person's different organs through transplant - is very similar to Seven Pounds, and in fact Seven Pounds was way better in what it presented to the audience. This film is trying to question if the recipient of an organ transplant inherits any characteristics from the donor, but leaves it to the audience to frame their own spiritual, religious, emotional conclusions - which maybe new to people who grew up on Shah Rukh Khan films, but not to other broad-minded and rationally thinking individuals.Even though some of the dialogues in the 2nd story of the saint were pretty captivating, I never understood its relevance to the ship of theseus ? In fact most of the thoughts worded in this film can be found in any spirituality/karma related texts or books written by swami vivekananda or in fact the bhagavad gita itself.As I said earlier, people who have been spoon-fed with mindless action and romance films may find this film different, but honestly the matured audience can opt for some better films to see.",same premise has been more interestingly made films before,after reading news reports that this movie will create revolution sorts independent cinema stuff like that i went see it last night premise focussing lives 3 people who have will be obtaining persons different organs through transplant is very similar seven pounds fact seven pounds was way better what it presented audience this film is trying question if recipient organ transplant inherits any characteristics donor but leaves it audience frame their own spiritual religious emotional conclusions which maybe new people who grew up shah rukh khan films but not other broad minded rationally thinking individuals even though some dialogues 2nd story saint were pretty captivating i never understood its relevance ship theseus fact most thoughts worded this film can be found any spirituality karma related texts or books written by swami vivekananda or fact bhagavad gita itself as i said earlier people who have been spoon fed with mindless action romance films may find this film different but honestly matured audience can opt some better films see,0.48123251748251755,0.17736013986013985,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,"Visually Brilliant, Philosophically Unparalleled","Ship of Theseus: The Paradox Simplified, NO SPOILERSHardly would you ever come across any work of art, pure artistic magic, which would make Einstein, Gandhi and Leonardo da Vinci proud. Or Nolan, Cameron and Tarantino equally satisfied. In one instant of time. This is THAT ONE unique work of art. A solitaire grade elixir class beauty. In the league of true Hollywood art movies. Inspired by millennium old philosophies (second story) and exemplified by tens of millions of years old behavior (poster). All about the transitivity of identity. Anand Gandhi has created The Shawshank Redemption for Indian Cinema. This movie is the 'grandfather' of Life of Pi in photography and video- shooting, whatever technical terms they use for it, WITHOUT VFX (special effects). The visuals are never-before shot uniques: so brilliant, so majestic, so engaging, that every single minute comes a scene you would wish to 'printscreen' and use it as a wallpaper for your computer! Excellent interplay of light and shadow. Truly metaphysical in every sense. This is the single most important aspect of the movie even if you keep the philosophical side aside.FACTS FIRST: The movie neither has a ship nor any Greek King named Theseus and Kiran Rao is just the distributor, not the producer and has no role in the making of the movie. Theseus was the founder-king of Athens, Greece. Having slayed Minotaur, the half-man half-bull monster, got out of the much-hyped impossible Labyrinth (the famed ball-of-thread story) and overcome several obstacles, he returned from Crete to Athens to a heroic welcome. It is said that his ship was kept in the Athenian harbor as a memorial for several centuries. However, the Athenians replaced the decaying old planks of the ship with new and stronger timber as they had honored to send the ship to Delos, every year, to honor Apollo and needed the ship to be seaworthy. This started the philosophical debate whether it should be considered the SAME ship or not. Essentially, as per Greek philosopher Plutarch, the question boils down to: whether an object which has had all its components replaced, one at a time, remains fundamentally the same object or not. And if all the replaced components made another object, being replaced one by one, does the second object claim to be the original object or not. The movie tries to answer this paradox. Amazingly well. And surprisingly without using maths !Now, apart from the literal meaning, the paradox-puzzle is showcased in the form of 3 short stories. Just as three points are necessary to form a triangle or prove collinearity (or not), these 3 stories are the three vertices, pillars and fulcrums of this movie which tries to simplify the philosophy. Whether the stories are interconnected, merge at any point or three mutually exclusive but exhaustive events is to be decided by you!The first story is about a blind photographer (just imagine), her enthusiasm in clicking the right 'sounding' pics, her frustration of others not being able to 'see' her point and how her passion & technology helps her overcome her 'hurdle'. The second is about a Gandhi-type monk, whose philosophy ensures he always sticks to righteousness, including believing in karma and the 'what-you-do-is- what-you-get-funda' and fighting cosmetic companies' barbaric drug testing on animals. And the third is of a casual money-minded youth, who, triggered by a couple of events, tries to change the wrongdoings but realizes how intricate morality is.ESSENCE: Is the physical aspect of everything essential or the mental aspect? Is the doer important or the intention of the one who does? What if the doer changes retaining the same intention or the doer remains same and intention changes? Is the 'who' and 'what' crucial or the 'how' and 'why'? It details about the passion of your life, the celebration of being alive, overcoming handicaps, the duality of life (remember the wave and particle nature of light theory you used to hate in class 11th), the thin line between philosophy & religion, relativity, doing what you strongly believe is correct no matter what the world does to you, the meta-gyaan that every molecule in this universe is affected by every single act of yours, 'we are made of starstuff' type, how far will you go to make things correct again, the immortality of the soul and the fickleness of the body and most importantly, destiny, where we make it or it makes us. It's a mini-Bhagavad Gita at times. And what change (perhaps, for your own good) may force you to abandon your life-long ethics or confuse you into believing your earlier life was better or make you feel: I tried a lot but couldn't get the result, did I fail? If somebody is destined to die, should his life be equally hellish or his life be peaceful though he is to butchered anyways? The movie sparks such questions and tries to make you answer them too. CAST: Aida El-Kashef, Sohum Shah, Neeraj Kabi, Vinay Shukla. New actors whom I didn't know of. But yes, the chubby girl is quite pretty too  POSTER Explanation: A fungus, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, infects select types of ants, changes their smell sense, the ants fall from the trees where it lives, climbs plants, gets stuck up there and dies. Meanwhile, our smart fungus consumes its tissues, keeps exoskeleton (outside body) intact, then grows outside it and releases its spores to infect millions others. Happening since millions of years on earth !!! Proving outside 'things' alter the behavior of hosts for their own benefit, eventually killing the host. Similar to viruses. So when an ant is infected and behaves in such a manner, how can a human escape with millions of microbes in him? When and where do you say my body ends and environment begins?

9.0,"This is probably the most important Indian film in the new millennium, which can rightly be tagged as ""Movie To See Before You Die"" in the literal sense.","The title of the review itself should be inviting enough for every true lover of real cinema to watch this rare classic at the earliest. But here frankly, I am not going into the practice of using all those exciting verbal phrases to praise this astonishing piece of work like many other reviews & write-ups. In fact the biggest respect, the highest acclaim and the loudest applause to this rare achievement in Indian Cinema would be, that you at once search for the theaters showing this in your town, find the time to catch it postponing all your other important works, travel whatever distance you may have to and just go to see SHIP OF THESEUS right away to participate in this new age celebration being made on the silver screen. And in case the film is not being shown in your town, then simply curse the way movies are usually seen and exhibited here in our country, just to make some quick bucks without caring about the essence of the term 'Cinema' & its soul at all.If I am asked then the only job of a reviewer here is to influence his readers to watch such significant chapter of Indian Cinema at the earliest without any further delay and that too by not revealing any major details about its unpredictable content, maintaining its precious sanctity intact.As an indicative review, SHIP OF THESEUS is certainly a rare cinematic triumph from our Indian Film Industry which brilliantly amalgamates various human emotions on the screen mesmerizingly in its three different story lines of a photographer, a monk and a share broker. Its insightful title refers to the historical Theseus's Paradox which raises a doubt or a question that if the different components of an object are replaced with exactly similar ones, then does the object basically remains the same or not. The paradox has been used quite beautifully in the film (and its skillfully designed poster too) which strongly stays with the viewer for next few hours and even days once he gets it. It has some intense & remarkable verbal interactions putting you into a deep thinking mode within its first 15 minutes itself, absolutely stunning visuals to take you onto another world altogether and a minimal yet graceful (natural) background score which simply lifts all its well conceived sequences on to the next level. Further, truly genuine performances by some extremely gifted actors never let you feel that you are watching a fictional film at all and its concluding moments merely turn you into a statue with the complete film jamming into your mind in a fast reversing mode like a loop.Also, SOT has an extremely significant message for the viewers in its final scenes which needs to be discovered by every individual on his own and should not be ideally revealed in any review as such. Actually the film is just like listening to an enlightening discourse which makes you realize that, Yes you are still alive with all your basic senses working fine in a healthy body, which is nothing less than a miracle blessed by the Almighty. Moreover, its concluding part leaves you in an intense thoughtful mode, reminding the fact that there is still lot to be done while we continue breathing and certain decisions need to be taken on an urgent basis which would help us all to be alive differently, even after our own 'Death' (representing the Theseus Paradox)Praising the sincere effort, I would like to add that since the last few years, whenever somebody asked me to name a few classic films, to be watched as a must. I always had suggestions of many foreign language films instantly coming to my mind and then a few Indian movies too made in the last century. But very rarely did I have any name coming to my mind from the recent decades, of an Indian film which could be called as a Spiritual Lesson captured on the screen from any of the new generation directors.However the case is not the same since last Friday post SHIP OF THESEUS, as now I have got a film, a masterpiece from our own Indian Cinema to proudly recommend as a must watch, which deserves to be seen before one dies in the most literal sense. So firstly I would like to congratulate its director Anand Gandhi for giving we Indian audience a film to be proud of (after a long time), a film which can easily be kept in the highest bracket among many other world cinema classics without any hesitation. Secondly, we surely need to thank the presenters of the film, Kiran Rao & UTV for making it possible to reach the bigger screen, since most of the times meaningful attempts like these just remain in the closed corridors of the festivals and never reach the general viewers.Lastly but most importantly, I would like to address my fellow viewers with a humble urge that for a while just forget your favourite big stars providing the usual weekend entertainment repeatedly and please don't let the medium of this film (which is mostly English), discourage you from watching it in the theaters, buying a costly ticket. SHIP OF THESEUS rises much above your expectations, incorporating a surprising element of humor too in its pensive content and keeps the viewer glued to the screen with an unpredictable progression throughout. So for once, simply pass any of your preliminary mind hurdles and watch this one of the most important Indian Film of the new millennium as a must, since it does have something worth to share..which might enhance the way you would be living your remaining years of life in the indefinite future.",this is probably most important indian film new millennium which can rightly be

1.0,A wrong interpretation of the Theseus Paradox,"If you are even a moderate reader or in any way are aware of a website called ""wikipedia"", you would know that the Theseus Paradox (The ship of Theseus) is a paradox that raises the question of whether an object which has had ALL its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. This movie uses the Title, but the story is Not at all in sync with the Basic principles of the Paradox. If this was a Story of some guy , who has received most of his organs from different people (like Eyes from A, kidney from B, heart from C etc) and then they showed his change in behaviour or personality then this Title would have worked for me. Besides the film was slow and the actors spoke like they were reading out monologues. Most of the people who ""say"" that they liked this film are the Pretentious ones , who think its cool to like anything that is Not typically bollywood. Just coz a movie is slow,has non commercial actors, doesn't have songs and tries to show pain,suffering, poverty and/or depression does not mean that it's a good movie.",wrong interpretation theseus paradox,if you are even moderate reader or any way are aware website called wikipedia you would know that theseus paradox ship theseus is paradox that raises question whether object which has had all its components replaced remains fundamentally same object this movie uses title but story is not at all sync with basic principles paradox if this was story some guy who has received most his organs different people like eyes kidney b heart c etc then they showed his change behaviour or personality then this title would have worked me besides film was slow actors spoke like they were reading out monologues most people who say that they liked this film are pretentious ones who think its cool like anything that is not typically bollywood just coz movie is slow has non commercial actors doesnt have songs tries show pain suffering poverty or depression does not mean that its good movie,0.49097222222222225,0.09108796296296294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.67}"
9.0,"Sheer delight to watch. A world cinema masterpiece, almost!","Ship of Theseus is a movie which we need but didn't really deserve right now. A lot of things have already been said about it, so with the risk of sounding repetitive, however I'll try not to be so, here are some of my thoughts: 1. To begin with, Anand Gandhi has made an utterly brilliant movie. The honesty, genuineness, and intent of the director is clear from the word go which is a sheer pleasure to see in an Indian filmmaker.2. Three stories - totally different to each others in terms of mood and narration, yet so well transitioned that you don't even notice it. Two thumbs up for the screenplay and editing.3. Utterly brilliant cinematography, a visual delight which mesmerizes you and grips you with every scene and its details that is on the screen. After I exited the theater, I couldn't believe I watched an Indian movie looking so beautiful. In fact, I can go on and on about the imagery. Well done! 4. Superb dialogues (and the use of no dialogues) - At times, zen, and other times, so passionate that you feel like talking to your alter ego, just like, the conversations in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Even the humorous and satirical parts don't make you feel like they are used as punches, except a couple times maybe.5. Acting - Top notch by the all three protagonists. Relatively good performance by the other actors as well. But the three main actors are so good you long to see more of them. And the sympathies and your connections with them find their peaks in the penultimate scene.6. Only thing where I felt I had issue is that some scenes and conversations were finished in a hurry. While one talk about something so powerful in detail, it should be a complete conversation, whereas, at times, it appears a lot of important things were skipped (esp. in story #2). Though I didn't find too many things wrong with the conversations in story 2 and narrations in story 2 and 3, it looked to me that something was amiss, they could have talked a little more, and so on. The movie could have been even more powerful, given the premise and ideas it began with. Actually, the idea is itself so big and extensive that any less would feel like incomplete. Such as, writing about this movie in 140 characters. But I guess I shouldn't complain as it's a movie where it's very difficult to have such kind of narration as well as a speech as long as that of John Galt. Anyways, I am more than glad that such things were talked about in a movie made in India.Bravo, Anand Gandhi and the team! I stood and clapped for you all when the movie ended in the theater.",sheer delight watch world cinema masterpiece almost,ship theseus is movie which we need but didnt really deserve right now lot things have already been said about it so with risk sounding repetitive however ill try not be so here are some my thoughts 1 begin with anand gandhi has made utterly brilliant movie honesty genuineness intent director is clear word go which is sheer pleasure see indian filmmaker 2 three stories totally different each others terms mood narration yet so well transitioned that you dont even notice it two thumbs up screenplay editing 3 utterly brilliant cinematography visual delight which mesmerizes you grips you with every scene its details that is screen after i exited theater i couldnt believe i watched indian movie looking so beautiful fact i can go about imagery well done 4 superb dialogues use no dialogues at times zen other times so passionate that you feel like talking your alter ego just like conversations zen art motorcycle maintenance even humorous satirical parts dont make you feel like they are used as punches except couple times maybe 5 acting top notch by all three protagonists relatively good performance by other actors as well but three main actors are so good you long see more them sympathies your connections with them find their peaks penultimate scene 6 only thing where i felt i had issue is that some scenes conversations were finished hurry while one talk about something so powerful detail it should be complete conversation whereas at times it appears lot important things were skipped esp story though i didnt find too many things wrong with conversations story 2 narrations story 2 3 it looked me that something was amiss they could have talked little more so movie could have been even more powerful given premise ideas it began with actually idea is itself so big extensive that any less would feel like incomplete such as writing about this movie 140 characters but i guess i shouldnt complain as its movie where its very difficult have such kind narration as well as speech as long as that john galt anyways i am more than glad that such things were talked about movie made india bravo anand gandhi team i stood clapped you all when movie ended theater,0.5913561076604554,0.1923524844720497,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,One of its kind.,"This is a rare movie, and maybe the only one of it's kind as far as Indian cinema goes yet uniquely Indian in terms of the facets of life and issues dealt with in the film.The film uses three different frameworks(short stories) to explore a plethora of contemporary issues and philosophical ideas on one level and doles out brilliant acting and creative cinematography on another. Also the different segments are weaved together seamlessly in the end as a finishing touch.It 'shows' rather than 'tells', the pace is slow with a large amount of details, enough to draw you in and connect you with the protagonists in the most natural manner possible.The only single complaint I have is that they could have cut down on the 'still life' like scenes a bit and added a little more sharpness and depth to the discussions especially in the monk's part of the story.That apart this is a unique work of art and a must watch since even if you don't like it it will still give you something to take back.",one its kind,this is rare movie maybe only one its kind as far as indian cinema goes yet uniquely indian terms facets life issues dealt with film film uses three different frameworks short stories explore plethora contemporary issues philosophical ideas one level doles out brilliant acting creative cinematography another also different segments are weaved together seamlessly end as finishing touch it shows rather than tells pace is slow with large amount details enough draw you connect you with protagonists most natural manner possible only single complaint i have is that they could have cut down still life like scenes bit added little more sharpness depth discussions especially monks part story that apart this is unique work art must watch since even if you dont like it it will still give you something take back,0.57994708994709,0.14388227513227517,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9.0,The Ship of Theseus is a painstakingly dialectical observation of the transient human forms journeying in the sphere of reality.,"The Ship of Theseus is a painstakingly dialectical observation of the transient human forms journeying in the sphere of reality. It examines the paradoxes in arguments about human beliefs, values and ideologies, exploring through the cave of space and time to find answers in the arcane light of truth. The film is deep, sometimes dense enough to put you into a storm of confusion, yet its mysterious powers to stimulate your mind into questioning the basis of existence is nevertheless a remarkable feat for writer-director Anand Gandhi. It's all the more astonishing to know that Ship of Theseus is Gandhi's debut feature film, and wait it you hear the biggest shocker – this work comes from the same man who began the incredibly contrived 'evil mother-in-law vs. saintly daughter-in-law' tradition in Indian television soaps such as 'Kyuunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi (Because the mother-in-law was once a daughter- in-law herself)' and 'Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii (Story of Every Home)' more than a decade ago.This man has completed his journey, his eight-year pilgrimage at last (he conceived his idea in 2005, after making two short films 'Right Here Right Now' in 2003 and 'Continuum' in 2005) and he has found some answers, which he brings to the world in the form of Ship of Theseus. His search is probably still on, yet this film is as good as it gets.Anand Gandhi captains his Titanic Ship along its course, and it remains totally unhampered by any stupid icebergs. The easy way to look at this movie is that it's about organ donation, but on closer look, you'll see the theme of 'reconfiguration of human psyche by external forces' shining through. The film's structure is so massive, it's themes so multitudinous, that you don't feel sure at times whether you are moving in the direction the film intends you to move. My advice for those who can't understand everything would be to leave it to God and just understand what's easier for your mind to comprehend. Subsequent viewings will reveal further answers.The cinematography by Pankaj Kumar is extremely fluid, and Gandhi allows the camera to remain static over long periods of time. That's where our actors, Aida El-Kashef, Neeraj Kabi and Sohum Shah (also the producer), do all the excellent visual communication, bringing an emotional intensity which gives these philosophical concepts a simpler, human form of expression. There's some powerful imagery here that draws our focus to the grand scheme of things. We begin to question ourselves then, wondering ""God knows why?"".

9.0,"Humane, Thought-Provoking and Philosophical","Not everyone will enjoy this film. It might be dry for someone's taste because they won't get item songs, comedy, cheesy dialogues and gravity defying action scenes. So go through the review once, if you don't like serious art house films. This movie is very different from the other Indian films that I have ever seen. It is not for everyone because not everyone enjoys serious cinema or artistic films. This film challenges the viewer's mind by giving them some food for thought.It is the best Indian Indie-film (Along with The Lunchbox) I have ever seen and one of the few Indian films that can compete with foreign films when it comes to artistic and aesthetic values.Ship of Theseus is a story about three different persons. The first story is about a blind girl who uses her hearing and imagination to click photographs. But then she gets an eye-transplant and everything changes. She can not use her hearing and imagination anymore because her eyes keep distracting her. She is not the same person she used to be or is she? If your body parts are replaced, are you still the same person?The second story is about a monk who is an animal rights activist and is fighting the case against animal cruelty and torture in medical laboratories. Once he gets ill and refuses to take medicines at first because they were made by the same medical labs that torture animals. He gets stuck in a moral dilemma and in the end he decides to take the medication. It is clear that he changed his rules and morals. He also gets an organ transplant. So, is he still the same person?The third story is about a stock-broker who is interested in money only. He gets a kidney transplant and finds out that his kidney might have been stolen from a poor guy. he feels guilty and tries to help the person. In this process, he comes to know that his kidney was not a stolen one. So he tries to find the person who is having the poor guy's kidney. He is hell bent on fighting for the justice for the poor person. In the end, we see a changed stock-broker who is not all about the money. So is he the same guy? In all the three stories, the central character is in a quandary and seeks answers to his questions. The film deals with the questions of Identity, Justice, Morals, Life and death with the help of these three stories which seem disjointed.These questions are asked again and again and that is why Ship of Theseus is brilliant. In the end, we see all the protagonists sitting together and enjoying a movie about the person whose organs were donated to them. That person happens to be a cave explorer. So these three protagonists are having the organs which were harvested from the same person. The first one is having his eyes, the second one is having a different organ and the third one is having his kidney. There were more people sitting with them so almost all of his organs were donated to different people. Now, recall the Ship of Theseus paradox and you will find something interesting. This is a spellbinding climax which stays with you for a very long time.Ship of Theseus shows that we have the potential to make great films. Anand Sharma deserves a standing ovation for this film. The way he captures everything is mesmerizing. It gave me the similar feeling that Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life did. You can not really complain about anything because you will not find a fault with this film. The cinematography is beautiful and one of the best I have seen in Indian films albeit they didn't use any expensive camera. Camera techniques used by the DOP are brilliant. Kudos to Pankaj Kumar for scoring a perfect 10 here. The guy surely does know his work.The direction is flawless, The screenplay is engrossing and all the actors do a great job, specially Neeraj Kabi as the ailing monk. However the story is the soul of this film which makes it spectacular. It explores the Ship of Theseus Paradox artistically (It is not a completely accurate depiction but serves the message anyway).Whats riveting about Ship of Theseus is that seldom do you see Indian films speaking the language of pure cinema (atleast nowadays) instead of narrating and spoon feeding everything to the audience. Ship of Theseus does that without any hurdles. The director does not spoon feed you everything. He shows you the imagery and wants you to know what is going on inside the heads of those characters with the help of their expressions.Every crew member deserves applause for making such a great film. They made a film which is much more thought-provoking and meaningful than what Bollywood has put forward in last 20 years or so and they did this with the help of a DLSR camera? and a debutant director did this? Anand Sharma has a bright future ahead of him. In the end, I would like to say that movies like The Lunchbox, Ankhon Dekhi and Ship of Theseus have rebuilt my hope for Indian cinema. I hope they keep making such films.",humane thought provoking philosophical,not everyone will enjoy this film it might be dry someones taste because they wont get item songs comedy cheesy dialogues gravity defying action scenes so go through review once if you dont like serious art house films this movie is very different other indian films that i have ever seen it is not everyone because not everyone enjoys serious cinema or artistic films this film challenges viewers mind by giving them some food thought it is best indian indie film along with lunchbox i have ever seen one few indian films that can compete with foreign films when it comes artistic aesthetic values ship theseus is story about three different persons first story is about blind girl who uses her hearing imagination click photographs but then she gets eye transplant everything changes she can not use her hearing imagination anymore because her eyes keep distracting her she is not same person she used be or is she if your body parts are replaced are you still same person second story is about monk who is animal rights activist is fighting case against animal cruelty torture medical laboratories once he gets ill refuses take medicines at first because they were made by same medical labs that torture animals he gets stuck moral dilemma end he decides take medication it is clear that he changed his rules morals he also gets organ transplant so is he still same person third story is about stock broker who is interested money only he gets kidney transplant finds out that his kidney might have been stolen poor guy he feels guilty tries help person this process he comes know that his kidney was not stolen one so he tries find person who is having poor guys kidney he is hell bent fighting justice poor person end we see changed stock broker who is not all about money so is he same guy all three stories central character is quandary seeks answers his questions film deals with questions identity justice morals life death with help these three stories which seem disjointed these questions are asked again again that is why ship theseus is brilliant end we see all protagonists sitting together enjoying movie about person whose organs were donated them that person happens be cave explorer so these three protagonists are having organs which were harvested same person first one is having his eyes second one is having different organ third one is having his kidney there were more people sitting with them so almost all his organs were donated different people now recall ship theseus paradox you will find something interesting this is spellbinding climax which stays with you very long time ship theseus shows that we have potential make great films anand sharma deserves standing ovation this film way he captures everything is mesmerizing it gave me similar feeling that terrence malicks tree life did you can not really complain about anything because you will not find fault with this film cinematography is beautiful one best i have seen indian films albeit they didnt use any expensive camera camera techniques used by dop are brilliant kudos pankaj kumar scoring perfect 10 here guy surely does know his work direction is flawless screenplay is engrossing all actors do great job specially neeraj kabi as ailing monk however story is soul this film which makes it spectacular it explores ship theseus paradox artistically it is not completely accurate depiction but serves message anyway whats riveting about ship theseus is that seldom do you see indian films speaking language pure cinema atleast nowadays instead narrating spoon feeding everything audience ship theseus does that without any hurdles director does not spoon feed you everything he shows you imagery wants you know what is going inside heads those characters with help their expressions every crew member deserves applause making such great film they made film which is much more thought provoking meaningful than what bollywood has put forward last 20 years or so they did this with help dlsr camera debutant director did this anand sharma has bright future ahead him end i would like say that movies like lunchbox ankhon dekhi ship theseus have rebuilt my hope indian cinema i hope they keep making such films,0.49833735181836447,0.15619951778179625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.37}"
6.0,Brilliance in concept but faltering at other spots makes if fall short of outstanding cinema,"Being a fan of new concepts, this one is a 10/10. However, there is more to a film than just concept. The movie tells stories of change in 3 people's lives when they become a recipient of something they dint have.The 1st story introduces you to Aliya, a blind photographer who clicks B & W images with her intuition & camera vocals and the change in her once gifted with sight. The 2nd story is about a monk who fights for pharmaceutical companies ill-treating animals and is put to test on his very principle when he is the subject. The 3rd story where a businessman forgets his job to reveal a kidney- transplant racket when he fears his kidney might have been a source of the same is compelling, yet in vain comparing to what he wanted to achieve in 1st placeThe 3 stories just move from one frame to another without any clear distinction. In terms of acting, Aliya is the only character you feel connected with while the other 2 just go about playing their roles. Mumbai looks different in a nice way through the camera's lenses. With 144 minutes of run time, the movie offers boredom at regular intervals and when you wish for a powerful climax, it lets you further down.
