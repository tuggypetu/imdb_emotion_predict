8,Like a Soap Opera Directed by Quentin Tarantino,"I'm honestly not even sure how to begin reviewing this movie. The best way I can describe it is a fantasy-mystery-black comedy-musical-adventure-epic. Does that sound like something absolutely ridiculously insane? Well it is. Andhadhun focuses on a *blind* pianist who *witnesses* a deadly crime and is forced to report it to authorities, and things go awry after several reveals/double crosses that lead to a third act so extravagantly convoluted that it's actually quite awesome. Am I being vague enough for you? This is like a soap opera, in the vein of Pulp Fiction, with a dash of La La Land & Seven Pounds, inspired by Fargo, and directed by Quentin Tarantino. If that doesn't sell you then I don't know what will.

10,Rabbit or Duck? Ending Explained.,"Many have reviewed Andhadhun and rated it highly and I am no different. I found it pretty damn entertaining myself. Following is just a review of the ending and how enriching that experience was for me as an audience. Hope you all like it.Watched Andhadhun again today. I never made a post about its ending the first time because I liked the Director's version of the open ending and leaving it up to the audience's interpretation.However, when I watched it again today, I realized that the film does not have any open ending if you carefully observe it.Before I go into the meaning of the ending we have to understand the phenomena of Rabbit or Duck illusion. Google ""Rabbit or duck"" for the image and the reference for rest of my review.For decades now, the Rabbit or Duck illusion has been presented as a test for level of creativity. What you notice in the image determines what part in your brain is more active. A lot of people look at Duck only, Some people see Rabbit only and some see both.Of course you can see both if you know that it's an illusion and you pay way too much attention to it and if you try to look for it.However, the real trick is (and this is the next level - not part of the original illusion but something that Raghavan has done here), that what if there is no illusion? But being used to the concept of illusion, we are forced to look for both Rabbit and the Duck.Andhadhun - There is no duck. It's only a rabbit.In the last scene of the movie, the waitress from the Restaurant comes outside and gives Ayushman his cane back. This Cane has a Rabbit at its handle (Raghavan starts his Rabbit/Duck illusion here)The movie begins with Ayushman's voice telling Radhika - ""bahut lambi kahaani hai.... Coffee? - It's a very long story...Coffee?"" (This line is repeated towards the end and that's how the audience know, that Ayushman is telling the story of his life to Radhika)But interestingly, the story telling takes a pause right towards the climax (when Ayushman and Doctor in the story are driving off)...the scene cuts to London and Radhika says - ""Aur phir? (and then?)""This is sort of the writer's way of writing an Epilogue solely to ""create the illusion of creating an illusion"". In the Epilogue story, where Ayushman tells the story of Tabu's accident and how the rabbit jumped and caused the accident - there are only 2 souls that can know about the Rabbit. 1- Tabu (who was distracted) and 2- Rabbit (because it caused the distraction)...Even Ayushman won't know because he was blind. So very clearly, Raghavan tells you that Ayushman is simply bluffing in this final piece.Now some may say that the shooter also saw the rabbit and he could have come and told Ayushmaan (blah, blah) - but I am basing my explanation on what is shown. Not on, what is not shown and is pure conjecture.Here is one more thing - Tabu dying would have been a bigger piece of Info which Radhika would already be aware of since the case was such a high profile one, but she seems to get all this info first hand from Ayushman, completely oblivious of Tabu's whereabouts until that moment.So Raghavan very cleverly tells the truth, but by that time- we the audience are so trapped in this brilliant tale of our hearts wanting to continue in the suspense, that we want to believe there is an illusion for sure.Raghavan even more clearly tells it very loud and clear that there is no illusion- by having Ayushman's cane with a Rabbit(or duck) handle, clearly saying- that Ayushman is selling the illusion because he has no way of validating the presence of Rabbit but he is telling that in his story.It is absolutely a delightful way of gripping your audience by having them look for things that they invent as they go.Adhadhundh (the original word not the movie title - notice the spelling difference) - basically means, something that happens extremely fast and recklessly without any validation or thought - Exactly what the ending is.Fantastic!",rabbit or duck ending explained,many have reviewed andhadhun rated it highly i am no different i found it pretty damn entertaining myself following is just review ending how enriching that experience was me as audience hope you all like it watched andhadhun again today i never made post about its ending first time because i liked directors version open ending leaving it up audiences interpretation however when i watched it again today i realized that film does not have any open ending if you carefully observe it before i go into meaning ending we have understand phenomena rabbit or duck illusion google rabbit or duck image reference rest my review decades now rabbit or duck illusion has been presented as test level creativity what you notice image determines what part your brain is more active lot people look at duck only some people see rabbit only some see both course you can see both if you know that its illusion you pay way too much attention it if you try look it however real trick is this is next level not part original illusion but something that raghavan has done here that what if there is no illusion but being used concept illusion we are forced look both rabbit duck andhadhun there is no duck its only rabbit last scene movie waitress restaurant comes outside gives ayushman his cane back this cane has rabbit at its handle raghavan starts his rabbit duck illusion here movie begins with ayushmans voice telling radhika bahut lambi kahaani hai coffee its very long story coffee this line is repeated towards end thats how audience know that ayushman is telling story his life radhika but interestingly story telling takes pause right towards climax when ayushman doctor story are driving off scene cuts london radhika says aur phir then this is sort writers way writing epilogue solely create illusion creating illusion epilogue story where ayushman tells story tabus accident how rabbit jumped caused accident there are only 2 souls that can know about rabbit 1 tabu who was distracted 2 rabbit because it caused distraction even ayushman wont know because he was blind so very clearly raghavan tells you that ayushman is simply bluffing this final piece now some may say that shooter also saw rabbit he could have come told ayushmaan blah blah but i am basing my explanation what is shown not what is not shown is pure conjecture here is one more thing tabu dying would have been bigger piece info which radhika would already be aware since case was such high profile one but she seems get all this info first hand ayushman completely oblivious tabus whereabouts until that moment so raghavan very cleverly tells truth but by that time we audience are so trapped this brilliant tale our hearts wanting continue suspense that we want believe there is illusion sure raghavan even more clearly tells it very loud clear that there is no illusion by having ayushmans cane with rabbit or duck handle clearly saying that ayushman is selling illusion because he has no way validating presence rabbit but he is telling that his story it is absolutely delightful way gripping your audience by having them look things that they invent as they go adhadhundh original word not movie title notice spelling difference basically means something that happens extremely fast recklessly without any validation or thought exactly what ending is fantastic,0.5618533215755437,0.18033950617283948,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9,"No one can Review this Film, we can only hope to Analyze it","Andhudhun means Blind Music and Andhadhund means chaos. What is life? It depends on the liver. Sounds philosophical. We don't know if it's the person being referred or the body organ. Everything in the movie has two meanings. It's rarely I watch any movie twice - Andhadhun happens to be that movie. Apart from the story-line, there's a ton of hidden puzzles, clues and in general the director communicating with us either paying homage to certain movies or the 70s or clues in general. This movie is not just a movie, it's a dark comedy, an experience that will leave you confused, entertained and most of all questioning what exactly happened.**If you haven't seen the movie, don't read any further. You have been warned.**I won't dwell into the story-line, that's not analysis that reading out of a book. Hint: Most reviews tell you the story. In my opinion that's bad writing and owning a website domain doesn't make you a writer. Moving on. Here are few questions that might pop up in your head and I'll try and analyze them.1) Movie starts with ""Ek lambi kahaan hai, Coffee?"". This might imply parts of the story-line might be the protagonist's (Akash) point of view. What is true, what is not, it's up to you to believe.2) Simi's character tries to run over Akash with the car. Another homage to ""Karz"" from the 70s where the actor's real name is Simi Garewal. Coincidentally Sriram Raghavan's first movie was ""Ek Hasina Thi"", another homage to the movie ""Karz"". As you can tell, the director likes to tease his audience in subtle ways.3) The Ending- Lot of questions about the ending. The director very cleverly cut the part to where they changed the scene to Europe and then continues with A-Kash's version. The truth? We will never know but my analysis is he took the deal with the doctor. A-Kash also could imply the one with the money. Another pun, another tease indicating he has the money now. And the friend he was talking about was Daani, she was someone Akash could trust. Also, at one point in the movie she was shown to talking to someone over the phone for a few seconds. Nothing happens in a Raghavan movie without a reason.4) Radhika Apte's characters father wearing a tee shirt with a rabbit printed on it. Hint. Clue. Tease.5) Akash acts as Ismael the detective, right after that they click a picture and maushi says ""Ismael"" please. Tease. Pun.I don't think this level of intelligent cinema can be matched up for a long time to come. Sriram Raghavan's best movie so far! Watch it only if you want to look beyond the story-line, if you grew up understanding Indian Cinema, if you like Pune, if you understand subtle dark comedy, if you speak the same language as the director. Both Hindi and Cinema language. I had two meanings there for a reason. Catch it if you can.",no one can review this film we can only hope analyze it,andhudhun means blind music andhadhund means chaos what is life it depends liver sounds philosophical we dont know if its person being referred or body organ everything movie has two meanings its rarely i watch any movie twice andhadhun happens be that movie apart story line theres ton hidden puzzles clues general director communicating with us either paying homage certain movies or 70s or clues general this movie is not just movie its dark comedy experience that will leave you confused entertained most all questioning what exactly happened if you havent seen movie dont read any further you have been warned i wont dwell into story line thats not analysis that reading out book hint most reviews tell you story my opinion thats bad writing owning website domain doesnt make you writer moving here are few questions that might pop up your head ill try analyze them 1 movie starts with ek lambi kahaan hai coffee this might imply parts story line might be protagonists akash point view what is true what is not its up you believe 2 simis character tries run over akash with car another homage karz 70s where actors real name is simi garewal coincidentally sriram raghavans first movie was ek hasina thi another homage movie karz as you can tell director likes tease his audience subtle ways 3 ending lot questions about ending director very cleverly cut part where they changed scene europe then continues with kashs version truth we will never know but my analysis is he took deal with doctor kash also could imply one with money another pun another tease indicating he has money now friend he was talking about was daani she was someone akash could trust also at one point movie she was shown talking someone over phone few seconds nothing happens raghavan movie without reason 4 radhika aptes characters father wearing tee shirt with rabbit printed it hint clue tease 5 akash acts as ismael detective right after that they click picture maushi says ismael please tease pun i dont think this level intelligent cinema can be matched up long time come sriram raghavans best movie so far watch it only if you want look beyond story line if you grew up understanding indian cinema if you like pune if you understand subtle dark comedy if you speak same language as director both hindi cinema language i had two meanings there reason catch it if you can,0.5312770562770563,0.0388888888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.01, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"

9,"A slick, stylish and taut thriller that is highly captivating and artistically brilliant","Okay, wow, that was quite a film, and I have no doubt it will be watched in one breath by most viewers and will keep them all on the edge of their seat the whole time through, just like it kept me and my family. Andhadhun is first and foremost a wonderful story, and Sriram Raghavan, one of the most talented directors working in Hindi movies today, brilliantly translates it onto the screen, creating a stylish and highly taut thriller which is very slick and aesthetically appealing, but also very credible, involving and thought provoking. The narration style is excellent, and the plot is very unpredictable, with many plot twists popping up as the story unfolds. Technically, the film is very impressive - the camera work is stupendous, and the sound score is fantastic and never exaggerated. The characters are wonderfully etched out, and the acting matches it perfectly. The film obviously belongs to the two leads who are polar opposites in terms of morality and intentions, but they also greatly complement each other within the story. Ayushmann Khurrana is always highly likable and convincing, and in this film, he does a great job of adding depth into a character that could have easily become unidimensional. His Akash is real and flawed and not a stereotypical hero, and the way Khurrana plays Akash's changing states is so good that even knowing the truth, the viewers might be confused. And speaking of breaking stereotypes, who could be a better choice for the role of the merciless Simi if not the magnificently charismatic Tabu, who happens to be one of India's greatest actresses. Her portrayal is extraordinary, because while playing a bad, villainous archetype, she saves it from veering into caricature and creates a woman who is as evil and immoral as she is real and conflicted. She actually manages to make her character almost a comic one, and this is perhaps her most entertaining performance in this regard. These two make Andhadhun an incredible cinematic experience and what can I add more except just please go and watch this film if you still have yet to",slick stylish taut thriller that is highly captivating artistically brilliant,okay wow that was quite film i have no doubt it will be watched one breath by most viewers will keep them all edge their seat whole time through just like it kept me my family andhadhun is first foremost wonderful story sriram raghavan one most talented directors working hindi movies today brilliantly translates it onto screen creating stylish highly taut thriller which is very slick aesthetically appealing but also very credible involving thought provoking narration style is excellent plot is very unpredictable with many plot twists popping up as story unfolds technically film is very impressive camera work is stupendous sound score is fantastic never exaggerated characters are wonderfully etched out acting matches it perfectly film obviously belongs two leads who are polar opposites terms morality intentions but they also greatly complement each other within story ayushmann khurrana is always highly likable convincing this film he does great job adding depth into character that could have easily become unidimensional his akash is real flawed not stereotypical hero way khurrana plays akashs changing states is so good that even knowing truth viewers might be confused speaking breaking stereotypes who could be better choice role merciless simi if not magnificently charismatic tabu who happens be one indias greatest actresses her portrayal is extraordinary because while playing bad villainous archetype she saves it veering into caricature creates woman who is as evil immoral as she is real conflicted she actually manages make her character almost comic one this is perhaps her most entertaining performance this regard these two make andhadhun incredible cinematic experience what can i add more except just please go watch this film if you still have yet,0.6914434523809524,0.31511904761904763,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

2,Badly skewed by Indian user ratings - immensely bad cinema,"I really think it is time for IMDb to improve their rating algorithm and start to to take into account the demographic diversity (or lack thereof), which can vastly skew the average rating of a film.

Not only are they without substance or morale formed through hideous scripts, they lack humanity, and by this I mean in a dualistic sense, as neither good or bad are portrayed anything vaguely close to authentic.Performances are bad to mediocre at best, and so is direction and cinematography.Apart from these basics features, also ""Andhadhun"" is a horribly banale film without any real quality, and which by no means deserves a place in the IMDb top 250 alongside masterpieces such as ""Ikiru"", ""Persona"" or ""M"".Pure film hypocrisy and blasphemy that anyone from outside Eastern film tradition will badly regret seeing.

6,A blind tale,I watched this movie on Amazon Prime because it was highly recommended by a friend of mine who has a bit of questionable taste. I am a fan of Ayushman Khurana and loved his work in Vicky Donor and also Badhai Ho. He was good in this movie too but this movie was really not much to write home about. Its a story of a pianist who is supposedly blind. Because he is supposed to be blind he is exposed to a number of crimes.

5,Illogical plot,"A logical plot is everything to me. But it is lacking in this movie. The series killing by a woman is simply incredible. The police does not have any doubt on the death of the old woman? She is a witness of another murder.The wife is so cruel a killer. Why she just blinds the eyes of male lead instead of killing him?I have no problem of understanding seeing Indian films before this one. But I find the present one hard to follow. Maybe I miss out something.Anyway, it does not worth a rating higher than 5.",illogical plot,logical plot is everything me but it is lacking this movie series killing by woman is simply incredible police does not have any doubt death old woman she is witness another murder wife is so cruel killer why she just blinds eyes male lead instead killing him i have no problem understanding seeing indian films before this one but i find present one hard follow maybe i miss out something anyway it does not worth rating higher than 5,0.399074074074074,0.00648148148148148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10,Sriram Raghvan is India's Martin Scorsese!,Like another reviewer said the movie is to be seen and anything about the storyline would be a spoiler. My 2 cents: just watch out for the numerous inside jokes on the characters such as Tabu referred as Lady Macbeth and posters of similar genre movies such as Darwaza. An ode to the past is just the prologue in his movies. Sriram Raghvan is a genius and a precious gift to the Indian cinema. 10 on 10.,sriram raghvan is indias martin scorsese,like another reviewer said movie is be seen anything about storyline would be spoiler my 2 cents just watch out numerous inside jokes characters such as tabu referred as lady macbeth posters similar genre movies such as darwaza ode past is just prologue his movies sriram raghvan is genius precious gift indian cinema 10 10,0.525,0.041666666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9,The only thing I hated was the Intermission - Andhadhun is a class Act!,"Very impressive film yet again by the master of thriller and my favorite Sriram Raghavan. This would be after a very long time the entire theatre experiencing a roller coaster ride along with the characters, so much fun- especially the first half, not a dull moment. The second half fails to retain the steam, though it gets back on track during the climax, winding up on the right note. It's an out an out Tabu film, very happy to notice she being utilized to her potential at last in mainstream films.

7,Enjoyable thriller but...,"Good movie with good twists, Crisp editing so it will not loose grip and keep you riveted. Tabu's roll was well developed and portrayed so she showed her class. Ayushmann Khurana's performance was not bad as well although his roll was not as well developed as Tabu's.Being a novelist, I have to be honest about the story. I will say that story could have been better crafted although there are some twists and turns, you enjoy and appreciate, while there are others, which seem artificial, enforced and don't make much sense. For example, after seeing the murder, Akash (Ayushmann Khurrana) behaved like a smart and intelligent person but when he went to police station he looked like an idiot. I would like to ask this group of story writers that on that very moment where was his friend (who helped him in coming to Landan). Similarly, when doctor(Zakir Hussain) and his helpers tried to take out his Kidney he very intelligently escaped the dangerous situation but soon after the same people tied him on the chair and he was not smart enough to anticipate the possible betrayed. So, during the entire movie I was not able to decide that he is smart or dumb. So the major disappointments was the improper and incomplete closure around many plot elements. There could be many interesting things which could have been done with the character of Radhika Apte, in place of adding Akash's imaginary friend who helped him in coming to Landan. I think the reason behind all this is very obvious - Four writers cocked the story- Arijit Biswas, Yogesh Chandekar, Sriram Raghavan, Pooja Ladha SurtiSanjay Agnihotri Novelist",enjoyable thriller but,good movie with good twists crisp editing so it will not loose grip keep you riveted tabus roll was well developed portrayed so she showed her class ayushmann khuranas performance was not bad as well although his roll was not as well developed as tabus being novelist i have be honest about story i will say that story could have been better crafted although there are some twists turns you enjoy appreciate while there are others which seem artificial enforced dont make much sense example after seeing murder akash ayushmann khurrana behaved like smart intelligent person but when he went police station he looked like idiot i would like ask this group story writers that that very moment where was his friend who helped him coming landan similarly when doctor zakir hussain his helpers tried take out his kidney he very intelligently escaped dangerous situation but soon after same people tied him chair he was not smart enough anticipate possible betrayed so during entire movie i was not able decide that he is smart or dumb so major disappointments was improper incomplete closure around many plot elements there could be many interesting things which could have been done with character radhika apte place adding akashs imaginary friend who helped him coming landan i think reason behind all this is very obvious four writers cocked story arijit biswas yogesh chandekar sriram raghavan pooja ladha surtisanjay agnihotri novelist,0.5825333979745744,0.15580559146735617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
