1.0,Lord have mercy!,"There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!",lord have mercy,there are people out there who will greenlight anything that is only explanation i can offer as why house dead movie exists thats only scary part whole movie its so bad youll go off movies forever i seriously wanted switch this off turn tv over paint drying channel but i was bound by my word suffer whole thing i dont know why i do these bad things myself as if it matters heres basic jist story group twenty somethings are so desperate go out some island pacific northwest canada actually because its cheap rave century which consists about 8 people un raving music that they pay some craggy old fisherman 1000 take them there after they miss main ferry thats gotta be some rave be worth all that dough fisherman warns them that island is also known as island dead hang i thought this was house dead that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda first faults here why would tiny little rave century my foot be held some remote island why would anyone willingly pay loads money get it why pay even more craggy old fisherman take them back when they could just come back with others once they arrive they discover that rave which consists about 2 tents small stage port john has been smashed theres blood everywhere no one is around what would any rationally thinking person do run their lives course but no these clueless obviously blind people decide go look them soon enough they discover old ramshackle house thats 50 times as big inside as it is outside another half hour stumbling around forest follows as excuse kill some lesser characters after much tedium they arrive back at house again characters like movie go nowhere jammed into this ghastly disaster is superabundance gibberish dialogue heinous acting mumbo jumbo exposition zillions clips once popular arcade game same name why this was universally accepted as good idea with filmmakers ill never know clips have no reference any scenes only degrade this trash even further if that is at all possible it has nothing do with game save some cheap throwaway line at end it makes resident evil look like cinematic glory hell even double dragon movie seems multi oscar worthy comparison this junk only one who comes out this with his dignity still intact is jurgen prochnow he could have just taken his money ran but he tries his best with awful script brings tiny bit pathos his character rest cast suck im afraid characters are idiots deserve die plus if you cut out swearing pointless nudity i see no reason why this film cannot be shown saturday morning tv its not frightening slightest pirates caribbean is more scary than skeletal bad guys this film where did all those bad guys come anyway there were only few people island begin with i guess this justifies reason they chose reuse footage over over i kid you not youll see same zombie die dozen times whos ultimately blame that scandalous waste celluloid none other than director uwe boll his control over movie is non existent you can clearly see actors have no idea what they should be doing that zombies arent really taking it all seriously actors seem like theyre reading off cue cards as they constantly pause middle long sentences carry talking as soon as they see next card it all feels very unnatural plus film is shot like two part mini series i have indeed seen better tv productions dont get me started editing film is incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands pointless shots dozens meaningless camera pans no real skill or talent was put into making this at all it truly baffles boggles mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made george romero cant even get anyone take his calls house dead makes some idiotic reference romero lazy attempt be post modern but it only irritates that they think this is same league as real zombie movie what its worth 1 85 1 anamorphic picture looks great dolby 5 1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive only serves pronounce heavily over used adr even more dvd comes with extras but why torture yourself isnt this review warning enough stay away you are all doomed i tell you doomed doomed,0.48891585760517775,-0.054328478964401294,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,Gives crap a bad name...,"There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work, one look at that commentator from ""Plan 9 from outer space"" and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece ""House of Dead"", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.So, the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like ""Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown"" or ""Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence"". No, I'm not kidding.Anyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the ""Rave of the century"", rave in question being a few tents, a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisher-boat ran by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.To make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody T-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die.I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in that famed ""So bad it's good"" category. It's just plain bad. The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on.You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.",gives crap bad name,there are some movies you just know they are going be bad frame one even if you were totally oblivious ed woods work one look at that commentator plan 9 outer space you just know you are not gonna see next cinematic masterpiece just like that when i saw first shot uwe bolls masterpiece house dead with that guy sitting at front house starting his introduction while trying desperately sound like he just arrived sin city i knew im helluva ride so movie starts like this first lead character says that everybody else is going die you know keep you wandering then he starts introducing rest characters with lines like karma thinks shes foxy brown or alicia my ex we broke up recently i had study she had fence no im not kidding anyway this bunch 20 somethings who couldnt act their way out wet paper bag are going rave century rave question being few tents port potty shoddy stage located small island middle pacific our gang missed ferry but thankfully will find way get there way being fisher boat ran by kirk cpt kirk get it man whoever wrote this script is genius his sidekick who is bastard child simpsons cpt mcallister that hook killer who knows what you did last summer make long story short gang gets island finds nobody there except some bloody t shirts then decide run hell away there no wait they do not they actually get all happy like cos theres free booze with that scene movie hits rock bottom then against all odds proceeds go further downhill some guys rubber suits start running around there is some screaming shooting our gang goes some house meet some other gang they go out house meet cpt kirk some police woman who between them have about 500 pounds weapons then decide go back house somewhere along line they transform into s w t team enter matrix rubber suit guys start multiplying like bacteria i start cry because i actually paid see this add insult injury every few minutes there are shots video game this crap is based there is cute game over cut scene few characters when they die i seriously hate this movie it doesnt even fit that famed so bad its good category its just plain bad script is bad zombies are awful there is no tension lines are bad actors are bad list just goes you will probably want see this movie just because its reputation being awful dont there are bad movies that deserve be watched this is not one them,0.47606107660455504,-0.21172360248447203,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,"Beware the ""House of the Dead"", because...","IT SUCKS! I don't mean that it's so bad it's good, I mean it IS the ultimate low. This is as bad as ""Ax 'Em""! My friend unwittingly bought this piece of garbage (not a compliment this time) and we stumbled into watching one of the most excruciating wastes of celluloid EVER! When hearing that Dave ""Dead Hate the Living!"" Parker was to write this, I figured he would provide the fulfillment to go with the ever-so-slight promise I believed I saw in him earlier on. Maybe it was or wasn't his screw-up, but this is just unbelievable. How horrid can a movie get? A dumbass with a video camera (sign of the artist!) makes self-referential quips about Romero films to let you know it's supposed to be a real, bona fide throwback. When various characters die, it's made to look as if they've lost a video game. See actual video game footage spliced into action scenes that make Ed Wood, Jr. look superior! And, no, it's not funny because IT IS THAT DAMN BAD. Everything about it, everything! What a shambles!

1.0,quite possibly the worst movie ever made,"This is one of the worst films I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical. First off, there's no plot. The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is better.",quite possibly worst movie ever made,this is one worst films ive seen only positive thing i can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical first off theres no plot actors appear be reading off cue cards do dumbest things such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting go out look their friends also zombies were terrible no where near as fun as any romeros work who gets s plug movie dumbest part all was they kept showing flashes video game action sequences like we dont get video game is about shooting zombies also all 20 somethings some how know how use automatic weapons hit target without even aiming gun way people die is so stupid its like they run out ammo so stand around waiting be jumped when cornered front house they run out ammo instead shooting door open so dumb final verdict if any these actors appear another film then theyve been blessed with second chance definitely worst film ive seen years b movie cinemax is better,0.6111570247933884,-0.22262396694214875,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,Gilligan's Island meets Shaun Of The Dead,"Laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion, I happened to catch this movie on cable. I wouldn't want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or  heaven forfend!  that I watched it STRAIGHT.Having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House, battling Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.It doesn't.The banal plot revolves around a group of ""crazy kids""  a la Scooby Doo  attending a remote island for a world-shaking ""rave""  whatever that is. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your Pat Boone) After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric), they find the ""rave"" deserted.Passing mention is made of a ""house""  presumably the titular House Of The Dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a  party?! Is that it? Oh, so this ""rave"" thingy is just a ""party""? In the grand tradition of re-euphemizing ""used cars"" as ""pre-owned"", or ""shell shock"" as ""post-traumatic stress disorder"", the word ""party"" is now too square for you drug-addled, silicone-implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. Intelligent thought stops hereI don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation. Zombies can't die  they're already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.Which means that a .45 shot into their ""hearts"" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood. At least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself.Yet each actor-slash-model gets their Matrix-circular-camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from ""Return Of The Jedi"", who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.I suppose the film's writer, Mark Altman, having penned the not-too-shabby ""Free Enterprise"", felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill. There is also a reference to Prochnow's primo role in the magnificent ""Das Boot"", when one of the untrained B-actors mentions that he ""looks like a U-Boat Captain"". "". I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films, as when Prochnow declares, ""Say hello to my little friend"", presaging his machine gun moment. Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video-game concept (i.e. the game ends when you die  you cannot win), this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.A better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School, although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes: priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she's been stabbed, but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast.Attempting to do something more constructive with my time, I pulled out my Digitally-Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate.""

3.0,Wow.,"Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He didn't even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess.Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant!Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long (which is about 1/6 of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie. I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it wasn't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.",wow,okay so im not big video game buff but was game house dead really famous enough make movie sure they went as far as actually put quick video game clips throughout movie as though justifying any particular scene violence but there are dozens dozens games that look exactly same with hand bottom screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon goo ing all kinds aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever case may be its interesting premise house dead with lot college kids loaded college kids as it were kids who are able pay some fisherman something like 1 500 just ride after they miss their boat trying get out this island what is supposed be rave year first thing that comes mind about house dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than exercise coming up with creative ways get lot scantily clad teenagers into exactly same situations at least this case fact that they were their way rave excuses way girls are dressed they look badly out place running around woods cute little halter tops but at least they thought they were dressed occasion clint howard tellingly most interesting character film by far delivers absolutely awful performance greatness which overshadows every other actor movie i cant stand it when well known actors change their accents movies it is so rarely effective howard here shows that it is equally flat have well known actor pretend that hes this hardened fisherman with raspy voice years breathing salty air he didnt even rasp well it sounded like he was eating cinnamon roll before shooting accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something real tough there clint i expected more him but then again he did agree part this mess once we get island movie temporarily turns into any one friday 13th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots teenagers played by actors who were way too old their parts getting naked then killed nudity was impressive i guess but lets consider something minute these kids pay almost two grand get out this island go rave year find no one say well who wants beer even guy who pulled that stack hundreds out his wallet get them all over there didnt think anything it that they found full bar not single solitary person sight here you have input director uwe boll theres alcohol they wont notice that party they came consists no one but themselves so not only do they start drinking not minding fact that whole party seems have vacated island but when one girls goes off into dark woods find out where everyone is dragging one other girl one guys reluctantly along guy girl who stay behind get smashed decide that it would be great idea strip down quickie now that theyre alone its like they expected find island empty now that they rest people that they came over with were gone little while they would have some privacy since theres no one else around brilliant now things that everyone hated judging by reviews that ive read about movie yes intersplicing shots video game into movie mostly order show that yes movie was being faithful directly copying video game sure it was stupid idea i cant imagine who thought up that little nugget but worse than that is matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown over over over over after first time at which point i found it pretentious cheesy movie like this have shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more technique shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation any kind tension film one things that makes zombie film scary gets you edge your seat is have them slowly but relentlessly coming after living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out places run with terrifying shortage things with which fight zombies off with first two are done right movie kids are terrified dont have lot places run since theyre island but since they caught ride over with smuggler they find themselves heavily armed i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything machine guns hand grenades which removes most tension impending walking dead then you have what i call techno slasher scene since rave never happened i guess since uwe boll thought people were going be disappointed at not hearing any techno music movie theres one scene right middle where all humans are fighting off living dead amazingly enough it turns into something music video theres techno music blasting as shots are edited together faster faster until its nothing but blur gory shot mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 1 6 second flashing across screen time with speed techno music clever i guess but it has no place horror movie because it completely removes any sense scariness or tension even gross out effect because you cant see any one thing long enough react it youre just watching these shots fly across screen wondering what hell director was thinking when he decided that it would be good idea put something like this movie ive seen lot people compare this movie resident evil mostly claiming that it copies premise it theyre exactly right i appreciate that at least here as was not case resident evil it wasnt some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able infect other people changing them way vampires turn others into vampires 28 days later was also clearly inspiration this movie its just too bad that house dead didnt do single original thing except somewhat moronic idea putting quick shots video game which it is based just case you forget i really think that this should have been much better movie while obviously i cant say that i know much about game its based just title movie poster deserve much better movie but unfortunately i think thats more often case than not with horror movies its really kind sad when movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as no holds barred horror film scariest thing entire movie is closing

Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. It's unbelievably bad. Just to let you in on how bad it is, I'll offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see corn filled crap like this? There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it.

3.0,Action-filled crap-fest,"I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here?

1.0,Wow...and not in a good way.,"Ok, first of all, I am a huge zombie movie fan. I loved all of Romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of Dawn of the Dead. So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.) Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) Like to play MST3K, the home game.

,So bad its......,"Actually reasonably enjoyable, but in a comic book, silly kinda way. This is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie in any sense, but you cant help but laugh yourself silly through most of it. Plot line is this: A group of ravers travel to an island near Seattle, an island known as Isla del Morte (Island of the dead, and my Spanish spelling is likely incorrect). Once they arrive, they find the biggest rave of the year deserted. Why? they find out once they stumble upon survivors and are shown video footage of what happened. This is really an elementary movie, poorly written by Mark Altman (who did one of my favorite films, ""Free Enterprise"") and equally poorly acted by the mainly unknown cast. Along with Jurgen Prochnow, Ellie Cornell (""Halloween"" 4 & 5) and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) are the only names I recognized. I really don't expect much from Clint (and he certainly delivered in that area) but Ellie and Jurgen usually do a little better than they showed here.Johnathan Cherry is really dull as Rudy, Tyron Leitso's Simon is an irritating little weasel, Ona Grauer's Alicia is really nice to look at, but not much else...so on and so forth.Lots and lots of pop culture references, including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th ""Dead"" film. See this one if you're a Romero fan...please...its a zombie movie and if the industry thinks thats what we want, then we'll get George's final vision that much sooner.

,"""Resident Evil"" Reloaded","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*My dad and I went out to see this one. I knew I was in for something special when the guy at the box office looked surprised when we said, ""Two for ""House of the Dead"" please."" He had a bewildered look on his face but gave us two tickets and mumbled the usual, ""Enjoy your movie."" We went up to the ticket taker, she tore our tickets and said, ""Theater 4 to your right."" It was then that I understood. Theater 4 is where they send the really special films, the ones where they are shocked and surprised when a human being pays to see it. Sure enough, there was NO ONE in the theater but me and dad. One guy shuffled in for ten minutes and left. He must have been looking for ""Kill Bill"".The game makers saw the financial results of ""Resident Evil"", got excited, greenlit their version of it and added an overdose of ""Matrix"" effects to create ""House of the Dead"". So a bunch of morons head to a rave on an island. Zombies appear and the morons shoot them. The end. That's it. There's nothing else. Shows over. Finish your popcorn and get out. Beat it. ""House of the Dead"" lived up to Theater 4's long standing tradition of B-movie ineptness. It's the kind of flick you think you should be enjoying a lot more than you are. There's blood, guts, zombies, a couple of topless women and guns. Lots of guns. So what's not to like? Well, if you stop and think about the incredible lack of logic, you'll probably hate this movie. My advice: Don't think. Watch zombies go boom, splat, ugh. Take the blood and naked breasts and kick back. Any thinking will ruin the movie. Mercenaries with cameras made this movie. They were hired by the game makers to advertise their video game product. ""House of the Dead"": One long, bloody commercial. There is even a SEGA banner hanging over the rave scene just so you know who's throwing this party. Whenever there was a scene change, images from the actual game would pop up. Just when you thought the movie couldn't be any more shameless, it shocks you again.I sincerely hope the makers of this film sent some flowers and candy to the makers of ""The Matrix"" because they were completely in love with their ""Bullet Time"" technology. Shameless again. The only original thought this movie had was to add screen shots of the game into the film. At least it was honest about its intentions: Sell, sell, sell! Buy ""House of the Dead""! The game is more fun! Don't you wish you were playing it?

1.0,dumb film making at its best...,"I'm not sure about this film. Are the film makers idiots or are they just making a film and marketing it to idiots? All I know for sure is that this is a dumb film....no, it's an offensive and dumb film. Everyone in the film seems vacuous and worthless--with dialog and actions that constantly reaffirm this. Their greatest interests in life are partying, cursing and taking off their clothes...period. So, when they all start to get killed off like in a Friday the 13th film, you really could care less.This incredibly obnoxious and unsubtle film was, not surprisingly, made by Uwe Boll--the man responsible for many films based on video games. So, we have perhaps the worst living film director AND a film based on a video game...does it get any worse than this?! Viewers are treated to lots of blood and gore, many explicit scenes of vomiting and girls who take their clothes off for absolutely no reason. The latter is really weird, as the film was filmed in the Pacific Northwest--and people all were wearing jackets and long sleeve shirts--yet, in this bizarro world, girls just gotta rip off their clothes in some of the most gratuitous scenes you could imagine. Perhaps ut even then it might make sense if this were a porn video...a bad porn video. Instead, this crap was marketed mostly to teens and stupid people.The plot, for what it is, is very simple. A group of vacuous and horny young adults(?) take a boat to a party on an island known as ""the Isle of Death"" for some sex and alcohol. Instead, people start turning into zombies and ripping each other to pieces. Yet, inexplicably, many of the prey know cool martial arts skills OR turn out to have high-tech weapons with inexhaustible supplies of bullets!!! The dumbest is the captain of a crappy fishing boat--who suddenly sports a high-powered rifle with a scope and laser!!!! What the heck?!? Overall, it's a movie with all action that's set to a loud Euro-pop beat. There is nothing in the way of plot, acting or caricatures---just zombies, cursing, nudity and death. If you LIKE the idea of a virtually plot less film with no acting or writing--just zombies, death and annoying music, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and clearly deserving its place on IMDb's Bottom 100 list.",dumb film making at its best,im not sure about this film are film makers idiots or are they just making film marketing it idiots all i know sure is that this is dumb film no its offensive dumb film everyone film seems vacuous worthless with dialog actions that constantly reaffirm this their greatest interests life are partying cursing taking off their clothes period so when they all start get killed off like friday 13th film you really could care less this incredibly obnoxious unsubtle film was not surprisingly made by uwe boll man responsible many films based video games so we have perhaps worst living film director film based video game does it get any worse than this viewers are treated lots blood gore many explicit scenes vomiting girls who take their clothes off absolutely no reason latter is really weird as film was filmed pacific northwest people all were wearing jackets long sleeve shirts yet this bizarro world girls just gotta rip off their clothes some most gratuitous scenes you could imagine perhaps ut even then it might make sense if this were porn video bad porn video instead this crap was marketed mostly teens stupid people plot what it is is very simple group vacuous horny young adults take boat party island known as isle death some sex alcohol instead people start turning into zombies ripping each other pieces yet inexplicably many prey know cool martial arts skills or turn out have high tech weapons with inexhaustible supplies bullets dumbest is captain crappy fishing boat who suddenly sports high powered rifle with scope laser what heck overall its movie with all action thats set loud euro pop beat there is nothing way plot acting or caricatures just zombies cursing nudity death if you like idea virtually plot less film with no acting or writing just zombies death annoying music then this movie is you otherwise its waste time clearly deserving its place imdbs bottom 100 list,0.5071319638966698,-0.06202614379084966,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"

But I still wanted to watch it because I'm a huge fan of the game and I wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad. After watching it I do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain-dead? or the girls are?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing!

1.0,Very very very awful,"I guess I might be expressing some bias simply because I'm a huge fan of the games. It's been sad learning about the decline of arcade games, but these were games that I always had fond memories of from my teenage years. I just spent that much time in the theater. I hope they didn't even have this in the arcade of theaters that actually showed this movie. This is in my top ten worst films of all time. I had heard so much about Uwe Boll and was interested in at least seeing what he had done. This is the guy who actually beat up people (in boxing matches) who hated his movies.Honestly, I could challenge him seeing as how I have so much rage for him. The most insufferable thing about this film was probably how it contained stock footage from the actual games. I mean, they just randomly show this footage over and over and it's only one or two seconds long. What's incredible is that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the games at all. You could literally remove the footage and no one would know it was a movie based on ""House Of The Dead"". I mean, I would think that if you included stock footage from the actual thing that you're basing your movie on, you would know what the game was about! It's the worst zombie movie ever made.I heard this movie had one of the highest movie body counts, but it doesn't matter. In one long scene, they just show these monotonous horrible slow motion scenes over and over with all these terrible angles. The main character even flashes back to a bunch of scenes that just happened! It's about this island with zombies on it that's hard to get to. How can it be hard to get to when we see all these ravers there? There's a huge ""Sega"" sign begin displayed. It was as if this movie needed to remind you that it was based on a Sega game. It's more like useless product placement.The movie ends with the main villain appearing and saying that he uses zombie blood or something so he can live forever. Wha...? This has the most random plot lines I've ever heard of. The budget looks terrible, looking more like a TV movie than a theatrically released film. Well, this the worst movie I've seen for Video Game Month and one of the worst ever. I still have a lot more Uwe Boll movies to watch! Remember, he literally said that he was ""the only genius in this whole f**king business"" (his actual words). Let's hope he never gets his hands on Mega Man.

1.0,Lame of the lame,"I knew I was in for some trash, but this movie exceeds my lowest expectations. It's utter trash.House of the Dead (2003) is about a group of friends that ferries a boat to get to an island where some major rave party is happening. When they get there, the island is desolated. They think they have the party for themselves, but, of course, that is the beginning of their trouble.This movie bases itself on a homonymous video game, which I think is funny. It is funny that movies love to get inspiration from video games instead of trying to recreate the video game's plot. I really don't understand.Anyway. I'm ok with trash movies. Sometimes they are acceptable, sometimes they are even masterpieces. This movie is none. It's complete trash with plank acting and nonsense. Characters are just plain dumb and stereotypical. Dismissable.Director Uwe Boll is famous for his video game-into-movie adaptations and boobies. Yes. About 10 minutes of the screenplay and you get your fair share. Bravo.The ending is mediocre, but it has one final little detail. Nice touch. However, by this point, this movie is already dommed.Totally not recommendable to regular watchers. This one is only for hardcore zombie fans. But don't quote me on this one.",lame lame,i knew i was some trash but this movie exceeds my lowest expectations its utter trash house dead 2003 is about group friends that ferries boat get island where some major rave party is happening when they get there island is desolated they think they have party themselves but course that is beginning their trouble this movie bases itself homonymous video game which i think is funny it is funny that movies love get inspiration video games instead trying recreate video games plot i really dont understand anyway im ok with trash movies sometimes they are acceptable sometimes they are even masterpieces this movie is none its complete trash with plank acting nonsense characters are just plain dumb stereotypical dismissable director uwe boll is famous his video game into movie adaptations boobies yes about 10 minutes screenplay you get your fair share bravo ending is mediocre but it has one final little detail nice touch however by this point this movie is already dommed totally not recommendable regular watchers this one is only hardcore zombie fans but dont quote me this one,0.6364468864468864,-0.01164021164021164,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.19}"

Turn the channel NOW to save your sanity and lock the doors since the world is obviously ending when we have run out of garbage to put on TV and are reduced broadcasting this crap..But don't worry.. we edited out the language so your sensitive ears won't ever hear profanity!!!!..

1.0,Only for an Audience of the Dead,"This movie was bad. Not bad as in ""so bad it's good."" Bad as in pathetic. Unnecessary nudity and a story so stupid it's insulting.

The only thing he knows how to do is get the female cast to take their clothes off.The best horror movies do not focus on nudity as the main event. They focus on the rules of how to die and how to stay alive.How much the naked girls mean to him is revealed in a feature on the DVD titled ""The Sexy Babes of the House of the Dead"".

1.0,Bah!!!,"There's a massive rave happening on a jungle infested island that has a demented past. A group of teenagers who are running late hitch a ride on fishing boat and they arrived to find the scene completely deserted. Though, something isn't quite right as they find an abandon house where they discover some party-goers who claimed that they were attacked by some sort of zombies. Now it's up to this group of people to figure a way to get off the island or they shall meet an unpleasant demise from hordes of zombies.So, this is ""House of the dead"" and I just got to say it was just woefully incompetent schlock. I guess my curiosity just got the better of me when I saw it was playing on TV. While watching it, I thought it was on the music channel at times, as it mainly felt like an over-extended music clip. Director Uwe Boll's film is nothing but pretentious garbage and an incredibly lousy effort. It really has nothing going for it well, it did have nice island scenery and fair makeup effects and a good amount of blood and gore. But these things couldn't carry this plain dreadful film. On show are paper-thin material and unlikeable characters. The actual lacklustre plot fails logic, it's filled with yawn inducing clichés, even the back-story of these zombies is poorly setup and it ends with a diabolical finale. Though, what it sorely missed was humour! But then again it probably thought it was funny, but I just didn't see it. It felt like the film was actually taking itself rather serious and if so, well there you go. The performances are either wooden or atrocious and the characters are mundane and annoying. You just don't care for these hoons. There's even a young Bruce Campbell look alike, but he doesn't have the charisma or talent of that great actor. The dialogue is rather mindless drivel, which is filled with bad puns and mind numbing lines. It's nothing but tripe and stereotypical circumstances.The direction is just a muddle. Boll was trying too hard to make his film super coooool. Instead he lacked imagination in his execution, therefore making it super dull and uneventful. What else didn't help was the dumb editing of sequences of the actual video game to cut to new scenes. The score was mostly nonexistent, but not the damn techno soundtrack that pop up during the action scenes my ears!!! It was just too much. When the techno music kicked in, so did the flashy camera-work that also got on my nerves. With its 360 degrees camera shots and shaky panning. Though, it was the slow-mows, which Boll centred on and really, it was not needed. It was just too distracting and rather lame. These action set pieces went on for far too long, which made it feel like everything was in slow-mow. What didn't help these moments was that no tension was generated and the action was mainly unexciting and pedestrian. No scares or thrills are evident. The romance sequences were just odd and rather laughable, with some characters finding love while battling zombies. A lot moments became a real drag because they dwelled on nothingness and too many sequences became really repetitive e.g. too many save yourself scenarios and a lot chasing about I mean a lot! Some shots were actually used over and over again. Yes, this is a pointless and unsatisfying mess of a production. After seeing this film you'll be thinking what the hell was that? Or why did I bother? Just plain boring and numbing is the best way of putting it!",bah,theres massive rave happening jungle infested island that has demented past group teenagers who are running late hitch ride fishing boat they arrived find scene completely deserted though something isnt quite right as they find abandon house where they discover some party goers who claimed that they were attacked by some sort zombies now its up this group people figure way get off island or they shall meet unpleasant demise hordes zombies so this is house dead i just got say it was just woefully incompetent schlock i guess my curiosity just got better me when i saw it was playing tv while watching it i thought it was music channel at times as it mainly felt like over extended music clip director uwe bolls film is nothing but pretentious garbage incredibly lousy effort it really has nothing going it well it did have nice island scenery fair makeup effects good amount blood gore but these things couldnt carry this plain dreadful film show are paper thin material unlikeable characters actual lacklustre plot fails logic its filled with yawn inducing clich s even back story these zombies is poorly setup it ends with diabolical finale though what it sorely missed was humour but then again it probably thought it was funny but i just didnt see it it felt like film was actually taking itself rather serious if so well there you go performances are either wooden or atrocious characters are mundane annoying you just dont care these hoons theres even young bruce campbell look alike but he doesnt have charisma or talent that great actor dialogue is rather mindless drivel which is filled with bad puns mind numbing lines its nothing but tripe stereotypical circumstances direction is just muddle boll was trying too hard make his film super coooool instead he lacked imagination his execution therefore making it super dull uneventful what else didnt help was dumb editing sequences actual video game cut new scenes score was mostly nonexistent but not damn techno soundtrack that pop up during action scenes my ears it was just too much when techno music kicked so did flashy camera work that also got my nerves with its 360 degrees camera shots shaky panning though it was slow mows which boll centred really it was not needed it was just too distracting rather lame these action set pieces went far too long which made it feel like everything was slow mow what didnt help these moments was that no tension was generated action was mainly unexciting pedestrian no scares or thrills are evident romance sequences were just odd rather laughable with some characters finding love while battling zombies lot moments became real drag because they dwelled nothingness too many sequences became really repetitive e g too many save yourself scenarios lot chasing about i mean lot some shots were actually used over over again yes this is pointless unsatisfying mess production after seeing this film youll be thinking what hell was that or why did i bother just plain boring numbing is best way putting it,0.5092111998361997,-0.06219360594360594,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1.0,House Of The Brain Dead,"There are always going to be horrible directors, and then there are people who like to think of themselves as directors when malfunctioning GPS navigators provide better direction. Uwe Boll is categorized in the latter, being in my opinion even worse then Ed Wood. This film is solid evidence of this, stuffed with laughable dialogue and silly teen meanderings, which prevent this from being in the same dimension as watchable. If you get your film inspiration from your favorite arcade game, then maybe your in the wrong field. Three story credits are listed for what seems like a kindergärtners project. A thirty person rave in the middle of the afternoon followed by stupid looking zombies somehow transforms incompetent teens into ace marksmen and markswomen. A creep in a stitched mask looks at people behind trees and when asking a question, one of the characters answers his own question in his question.
