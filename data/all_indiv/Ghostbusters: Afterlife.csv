8,What it feels like to be nine years old again!,"About ten months before the release of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"", and without any knowledge whatsoever that a belated sequel was in production, I re-watched the 1984 original for the first time in 25 years, and together with own kids (aged six and ten). Needless to say, my offspring wasn't the least bit impressed with special effects from the early eighties, and to be totally honest, I found that my childhood favorite had badly dated as well.My biggest regret was that I couldn't pass on that magical feeling of ""discovering"" the world of horror, monsters, F/X, and ectoplasm! But when we saw publicity for the brand new ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" on television, it were my children who spontaneously asked if we could go and see it on the big screen. So, yes, with a slight delay they experienced how I felt when I saw ""Ghostbusters"" for the first time. And I felt 9 years old again, myself.Undoubtedly the best thing that could have happened to the franchise, especially after the flopped 2016-remake, was a return to the roots. The story links straight back to the original, the beloved protagonists show up (albeit briefly) and the co-writer/director is none other than the son of Ivan Reitman; - Jason. ""Afterlife"" is chock-full of gimmicks references towards the original, varying from subtle to plain obvious. The young cast members are refreshing, and fit wonderfully well in the ""Ghostbusters"" universe, but it feels even better to reconnect with the old-fashioned familiar trumps, like the legendary Ghostbusters-vehicle and - of course - the Ray Parker Jr. Theme song. The homage to Harold Ramis, one of the creators of the original concept and the only cast member who passed away, is beautiful.",what it feels like be nine years old again,about ten months before release ghostbusters afterlife without any knowledge whatsoever that belated sequel was production i re watched 1984 original first time 25 years together with own kids aged six ten needless say my offspring wasnt least bit impressed with special effects early eighties be totally honest i found that my childhood favorite had badly dated as well my biggest regret was that i couldnt pass that magical feeling discovering world horror monsters f x ectoplasm but when we saw publicity brand new ghostbusters afterlife television it were my children who spontaneously asked if we could go see it big screen so yes with slight delay they experienced how i felt when i saw ghostbusters first time i felt 9 years old again myself undoubtedly best thing that could have happened franchise especially after flopped 2016 remake was return roots story links straight back original beloved protagonists show up albeit briefly co writer director is none other than son ivan reitman jason afterlife is chock full gimmicks references towards original varying subtle plain obvious young cast members are refreshing fit wonderfully well ghostbusters universe but it feels even better reconnect with old fashioned familiar trumps like legendary ghostbusters vehicle course ray parker jr theme song homage harold ramis one creators original concept only cast member who passed away is beautiful,0.5774776641797917,0.2559408676429953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8,Surprisingly good.,"I'll be honest, after the last Ghostbusters movie, I wasn't keen on it, reluctantly I went along, and have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It feels like a worthy successor to the original film, it doesn't just ignore the past, it supports it. I would advise seeing the original movie ahead of this, as there is a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. I feel like they wanted it to respect the original, that it does.Some really nice special effects, a few perhaps not so good, but that's just me being picky. A good atmosphere, and a really good pace, there's nothing slow about the film, it doesn't lull, nor did it feel overlong. It's a bit goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously.Great to see some old, familiar faces, if you're a fan of the original, you really will love the nostalgia vibe. Paul Rudd was awesome I thought, he stood out for me.8/10.",surprisingly good,ill be honest after last ghostbusters movie i wasnt keen it reluctantly i went along have admit i thoroughly enjoyed it it feels like worthy successor original film it doesnt just ignore past it supports it i would advise seeing original movie ahead this as there is lot nostalgia surrounding it i feel like they wanted it respect original that it does some really nice special effects few perhaps not so good but thats just me being picky good atmosphere really good pace theres nothing slow about film it doesnt lull nor did it feel overlong its bit goofy it doesnt take itself too seriously great see some old familiar faces if youre fan original you really will love nostalgia vibe paul rudd was awesome i thought he stood out me 8 10,0.6255238095238095,0.35661904761904767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.19}"
8,Finally!! A movie that's worthy of the legacy of the first two!,"The first 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most beloved movies of my childhood. The second one gets critized sometimes but I think it's as good as the first. Let's forget that embarrassing awful movie that took place in the 2010's and finally focus on this one: THE TRUEST THIRD MOVIE OF 'GHOSTBUSTERS'. I had no hype for this one (mostly because of the trainwreck that out-of-place-2010's movie), but I felt somewhat compelled to give the benefit of the doubt and realise if my fears were right or wrong... I'll tell you this: watch this movie!It is a heartfelt, coherent and fun story that pays respect to its roots and moves forward the saga on a loving way. The plot hasn't been revealed too much because of a key reason and even if someone has been sadly spoiled, when that part occurs in silver screen is just downright marvelous. But not just that peak: the movie has several peaks. The characters were much, much better than I expected thanks to great and compelling performances. Finally we go back to some terror and some suspenseful sequences that harck back to that so damn missed old style from the eighties. The CGI is good, the soundtrack is on point and the script never dragged to me.All in: a pleasent surprise. If the story ends here, it is the best finale they ever could have pulled off. Whatever happens in the future, this movie made its work so right and so enjoyable (with a truly emotional ending in which I cried) and that's all that matters. This is a joyful, emotional throwback call that must be seen!",finally movie thats worthy legacy first two,first ghostbusters is one most beloved movies my childhood second one gets critized sometimes but i think its as good as first lets forget that embarrassing awful movie that took place 2010s finally focus this one truest third movie ghostbusters i had no hype this one mostly because trainwreck that out place 2010s movie but i felt somewhat compelled give benefit doubt realise if my fears were right or wrong ill tell you this watch this movie it is heartfelt coherent fun story that pays respect its roots moves forward saga loving way plot hasnt been revealed too much because key reason even if someone has been sadly spoiled when that part occurs silver screen is just downright marvelous but not just that peak movie has several peaks characters were much much better than i expected thanks great compelling performances finally we go back some terror some suspenseful sequences that harck back that so damn missed old style eighties cgi is good soundtrack is point script never dragged me all pleasent surprise if story ends here it is best finale they ever could have pulled off whatever happens future this movie made its work so right so enjoyable with truly emotional ending which i cried thats all that matters this is joyful emotional throwback call that must be seen,0.5657665505226479,0.1988966318234611,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9,Ghostbusters Afterlife Is A Winning Entry In The Series And One Of The Most Enjoyable Films Of The Year,"Back in 1984 when big hair and neon were the norms; a movie appeared that soon became a cultural phenomenon. The movie involved a team of unlikely Paranormal Investigators and the mix of comedy, FX, and Ghosts turned the movie into a smash hit and a Pop Culture mainstay. The abundance of products that followed and the inescapable theme song and tagline soon gave rise to a sequel which while a success; did not resonate the way the original film had and thus the ""Ghostbusters"" film franchise became dormant.While a successful video game and merchandise line kept the franchise alive; the 2016 reboot with an all-female team failed to capture the magic at the box office and again put the franchise's cinematic future in question.Thankfully after several delays due to the Covid 19 Pandemic; ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" has arrived and is the worthy sequel that does justice to the original film and sets the stage well for future cinematic exploits.The film follows a down on her luck mother named Callie )Carrie Coon) and her children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard); and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), as they are forced to move to a dilapidated farm in rural Oklahoma following the passing of Callie's estranged father and her subsequent eviction.A series of unexplained earthquakes clues the smart and precocious Phoebe that something is up and with her new friend Podcast (Logan Kim), and teacher Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd); help her uncover her connection to the original Ghostbusters and the abundance and significance of the gear that her Grandfather has left on the farm.Things soon take a turn for the worse and despite skeptical locals and the emerging danger, Phoebe, Trevor, and their friends have to battle the forces of evil to save the world.The movie takes its time getting to the action and spends plenty of time establishing the characters, their motivations, and their relationships with one another. There are abundant homages to the original film; some of which are very subtle and clever but never seem gratuitous or tacked on.The film also does not rely on the FX to tell the tale as while there are some solid effects in the film; this is a character-driven tale and the new cast works well with some surprise guests who pop up throughout the film.Director Jason Reitman; son of the Director of the original film; clearly knows and loves the material as he not only helped craft the story but deftly weaves a new tale into the franchise which also fits well with the first film and does not attempt to reboot but rather continue the franchise.There are two extra scenes in the credits that you will not want to miss as not only are they great fun; but also tease of future adventures to come.The film also has a few touching moments that caused some unexpected emotion from the audience at our Press Screening and helped establish ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" as not only a winning entry into the series but also one of the most enjoyable films of the year.4.5 stars out of 5.",ghostbusters afterlife is winning entry series one most enjoyable films year,back 1984 when big hair neon were norms movie appeared that soon became cultural phenomenon movie involved team unlikely paranormal investigators mix comedy fx ghosts turned movie into smash hit pop culture mainstay abundance products that followed inescapable theme song tagline soon gave rise sequel which while success did not resonate way original film had thus ghostbusters film franchise became dormant while successful video game merchandise line kept franchise alive 2016 reboot with all female team failed capture magic at box office again put franchises cinematic future question thankfully after several delays due covid 19 pandemic ghostbusters afterlife has arrived is worthy sequel that does justice original film sets stage well future cinematic exploits film follows down her luck mother named callie carrie coon her children trevor finn wolfhard phoebe mckenna grace as they are forced move dilapidated farm rural oklahoma following passing callies estranged father her subsequent eviction series unexplained earthquakes clues smart precocious phoebe that something is up with her new friend podcast logan kim teacher mr grooberson paul rudd help her uncover her connection original ghostbusters abundance significance gear that her grandfather has left farm things soon take turn worse despite skeptical locals emerging danger phoebe trevor their friends have battle forces evil save world movie takes its time getting action spends plenty time establishing characters their motivations their relationships with one another there are abundant homages original film some which are very subtle clever but never seem gratuitous or tacked film also does not rely fx tell tale as while there are some solid effects film this is character driven tale new cast works well with some surprise guests who pop up throughout film director jason reitman son director original film clearly knows loves material as he not only helped craft story but deftly weaves new tale into franchise which also fits well with first film does not attempt reboot but rather continue franchise there are two extra scenes credits that you will not want miss as not only are they great fun but also tease future adventures come film also has few touching moments that caused some unexpected emotion audience at our press screening helped establish ghostbusters afterlife as not only winning entry into series but also one most enjoyable films year 4 5 stars out 5,0.4676674579900386,0.09733044733044734,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9,Ghostbusters the next Generation,"I have to admit I had certain expectations and thought about seeing certain people/characters in this. Let's say if I was just rating the movie based on that, I probably would have rated it lower. I also missed out on the opportunity to rewatch the first two movies. But I don't think it would have mattered that much. Even a female character that had a small cameo in here, I sort of remembered her (small) part in the original movies.That being said this adds a few cool people - namely Paul Rudd and the kids. Especially the daughter and the kid who befriends her (Podcast) are a great team together. Really funny and with great respect to the movies that came before it. Maybe minus the one with the all female cast. Now I personally liked that too - if you didn't enjoy that fair enough, can't compare those two anyway.So much weirdness and comedy that works here, because of the script and because of the actors. And yes many flashbacks still - that even if you don't have the movies fresh in your memory work wonders.

4,Ghostbuster KIDS!!!,"The Ghostbusters reboot 'Ghostbusters: Answer the Call' featured all female Ghostbusters. Now with 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' we have ghostbuster kids.... Ugh, give me a moment to recover...Ghostbuster KIDS!! Honestly! The idea - or sight - of 12-year old kids acting as ghostbusters is just not interesting or believable. Seeing them face to face with ghosts, demons, goblins, etc while they just stand their making jokes while zapping them is not exactly my idea of fun. This movie is for kids.Considering the excellent visual effects in the original 'Ghostbusters' way back in 1984, the visuals in 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is nothing to write home about. It's good, make not mistake, but compared to what they've accomplished almost four decades ago, it was nothing special.'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is also very slow. I mean, this film truly moves at a snail's pace. The original film was so much fun and excitement, whereas this film was pretty much about kids making jokes. The 'love interest' between Trevor and Lucky felt so forced and annoying, while Callie and Grooberson could have allowed for a far better love interest. Then again, as mentioned, this is a children's movie, so I guess they opted for a teen love interest. Pfff!!Oh, no, look, Marshmallows again!! These marshmallows felt like Gremlins-wannabes, or even Minions wannabes. This is the part where I just shook my head in disbelief...The film will no doubt garner a fan base due to the appearance of the original Ghostbusters - Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson (and even Harold Ramis in ghost form...). As for me, unfortunately 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' did nothing for my senses. There's a lot of noise and light flashes during the film's climax; I mean jeez! Oh, I suppose I should lighten up, sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is.... ugh, no, scrap that, I didn't like this movie at all. Ghostbuster kids....pff!!!!!Would I watch it again?

5,An expertly crafted commercial product prepared for a specific audience for the purpose of prolonged stimulation of nostalgic sentiments,"The title reflects the way Egon Spengler would've described this. I'll keep this short.I want to say right away that this review reflects purely my individual point of view. And as a viewer who is tired of the constant stimulation of those parts of the brain that are responsible for nostalgia (due to most of the old franchises being constantly milked) I was absolutely insensitive to all such moments in the film.That's why the film itself turned out to be completely hollow for me, apart from a very beautiful visual aspect, there's absolutely nothing in it. If you imagine for a couple of minutes that the original film was never made, or that you haven't seen it, there's nothing left in this movie for you.Every single scene, event, line of dialogue, visual of the first two films are referenced in this. Moreover, apparently, there is absolutely nothing going on in the lives of these characters unrelated to the names and events of past films.I was ready to rate this product a 7 out of 10 even though I did not enjoy it. But the (expected) CGI ending made me feel miserable. I really don't understand why they did that.There are more respectful ways to pay tribute to Harold. And the worst thing is that I hoped they wouldn't, but they did.In the end, mostly due to the first scene after the credits, which was the best part of the whole thing, I stopped at 5 out of 10.If you're up for a 2 hour ""remember this?"" ride - check it out.

8,Reitman's valentine to the original comedy horror classic will make you feelin' good.,"GHOSTBUSTERS: AFTERLIFE (2021) *** Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Logan Kim, Celeste O' Connor, Bill Murray, Dany Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, JK Simmons, Olivia Wilde. (voices of : Josh Gad & Shohreh Aghdashloo). Filmmaker Jason Reitman, son of executive producer and director of the original comedy horror classic, returns the franchise true to form in this valentine to the team of paranormal exterminators with the Spengler family retiring to their estranged paterfamilias Egon (the late, great Harold Ramis) where his granddaughter (Grace, in a winning and often uncanny turn as the famed comedian) discovers her grandfather's plans to stop the return of Gozer the Gozarian to return for another shot at destroying the world, while in the process of uniting her family in their new Mid-west environs. Reitman, who co-wrote with Gil Kenan the chock block of Easter eggs screenplay that wisely incorporates its source material with its new cast (the weight of the legacy rests well on the slender yet able shoulders of Grace, the heart of the film).

5,Imagine Ghostbusters w/out comedians!,"Short and to the point.Imagine the original ghostbusters w/out Bill Murray and w/out Dan Aykroyd. Put Harold Ramis as the lead but gender swap him and halve his age and make him less likeable and more arrogant. Now spend 3/4 of the film on character development that doesn't pay off.It's an OK film. 3rd best in the franchise. More of alove letter to Reitman and Ramis than a Ghostbusters story. Stripped of humour. Rudd and Wolfhard almost carried this film, however, they were sidelined for too long by a humourless lead. If the lead was meant to be autistic, it did not work (I'm a parent to an autistic and have dealt with many autistic kids: this wasn't one) Plenty of nostalgia. A few cameos.

4,Lot more needed.,"Remembering how I felt when watching the original ghostbusters in action with Bill Murray, the on screen chemistry and humour was unbeatable. Then like with other franchises they pass onto... kids. Finn who played Trevor was a very good fit for the role. I loved seeing the original busters in action towards the end. But the rest, flat, lacklustre and very disappointing. Phoebe's performance which the writers and viewers loved I think was especially poor. Much more needed from her even though she was under pressure. She might have a big fan base off screen with her max factor but on screen her acting and skills lacked perhaps too young or out of depth. More from her next time more depth rather than just emotionless. As far as ghosts this packed too.

4,Completely lacking the magic and charm of the 1980's originals,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulCassie (Carrie Coon) and her sons Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (McKenna Grace) fall behind with their rent and other debts, and retreat to a rural farmhouse they inherited from Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), Cassie's dad and one of the original 'Ghostbusters.' Here, they will discover their true connection to the original group. Cassie forms a partnership with Grooberson (Paul Rudd), a teacher at the rundown local school who shows the kids violent 80's horror flicks, like Cujo and Child's Play, while Phoebe strikes a friendship with a kid who calls himself Podcast (Logan Kim.) Everyone is set on a collision course with the resurrection of Goza from the original film.In spite of all the inevitable publicity and hype that surrounded the release of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, I couldn't will myself to drag myself out to the theatre to go and see it. Despite having a notable appreciation of the original 1980's films, I had been underwhelmed by 2016's all female reboot and it just felt like another one of those franchises that had become over-saturated and overblown by its own fan base. But I finally had to see how it held up to those original films. And while I didn't expect it to match the quality of those classic films, I still didn't expect anything as flat and underwhelming as this effort from Jason Reitman, son of original director Ivan Reitman.In an age where only established franchises tend to get a shoe-in, it's understandable with a film series with the cult following this has, that there may be some who would want to see how they would fare to a new generation. But while it's undeniably affectionate towards its source material, right down to having a number of bit part original cast members (including Annie Potts as snarky call handler Janine Melnitz) making an appearance, it's all just completely unengaging, at least twenty minutes overlong and with cardboard characters you feel nothing for. With central characters so weak, you await the anticipated arrival of the original line up right at the very end, but contributing little more than to show their age, aside from a poignant finale where a CGI version of OCM Harold Ramis appears, after his real life death in 2014. His death also ties in with the plot.Overall, this emerges as little more than pointless, spurred on by nothing more than slushy nostalgia for the original. There's some effective light relief, little light touches like mini Stay Puft Marshmallow Men jumping off K Mart shelves, things like that, but generally, if this is the 'Afterlife', I'd prefer to live in limbo. **",completely lacking magic charm 1980s originals,star rating brilliant very good okay poor awfulcassie carrie coon her sons trevor finn wolfhard phoebe mckenna grace fall behind with their rent other debts retreat rural farmhouse they inherited egon spengler harold ramis cassies dad one original ghostbusters here they will discover their true connection original group cassie forms partnership with grooberson paul rudd teacher at rundown local school who shows kids violent 80s horror flicks like cujo childs play while phoebe strikes friendship with kid who calls himself podcast logan kim everyone is set collision course with resurrection goza original film spite all inevitable publicity hype that surrounded release ghostbusters afterlife i couldnt will myself drag myself out theatre go see it despite having notable appreciation original 1980s films i had been underwhelmed by 2016s all female reboot it just felt like another one those franchises that had become over saturated overblown by its own fan base but i finally had see how it held up those original films while i didnt expect it match quality those classic films i still didnt expect anything as flat underwhelming as this effort jason reitman son original director ivan reitman age where only established franchises tend get shoe its understandable with film series with cult following this has that there may be some who would want see how they would fare new generation but while its undeniably affectionate towards its source material right down having number bit part original cast members including annie potts as snarky call handler janine melnitz making appearance its all just completely unengaging at least twenty minutes overlong with cardboard characters you feel nothing with central characters so weak you await anticipated arrival original line up right at very end but contributing little more than show their age aside poignant finale where cgi version ocm harold ramis appears after his real life death 2014 his death also ties with plot overall this emerges as little more than pointless spurred by nothing more than slushy nostalgia original theres some effective light relief little light touches like mini stay puft marshmallow men jumping off k mart shelves things like that but generally if this is afterlife id prefer live limbo,0.5531076710987424,0.13576369562976706,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
