10.0,"Best movie of the MCU, incredible from start to finish.","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end.

10.0,Best Cliffhanger of all Time,"A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",best cliffhanger all time,meticulously planned film down last detail where you can see how much love is behind it course film delivers impressive show values action but besides it is above all interactions characters that are well thought out surprisingly no character is neglected all storylines previous films are brought together amazingly logical end is me one best cliffhangers all time after movie i was whacked end i have ask myself what more do i expect comic book superhero film i was perfectly happy so i can also give comic book adaptation 10 out 10 stars,0.4295138888888889,0.2861111111111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,How MCU should have always been like,"It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.",how mcu should have always been like,it was only after release infinity war that i got interest mcu before that i wasnt very much into superhero movies so couple months after this movie released i skimmed through all mcu movies iron man black panther i didnt put much focus into watching them all since most them were just following one pattern iron man guy gets superpowers beats bad guy who wanted take over world saves day captain america guy gets superpowers beats bad guy who wanted take over world saves day thor guy loses then gets superpowers beats bad guy saves day even avengers age ultron its just now all those guys come together beat bad guy who wanted take over world save day but avengers infinity war is very much different movie begins where post credit scene thor ragnarok ended loki dies very beginning movie while he was trying unsuccessfully deceive thanos this clearly shows that this movie really means business its not afraid killing off characters we have grown like all these years thors hammer has broken so he gets mjolnir meanwhile iron mans team faces thanos yet another very brutal attack captain americas team is able get out their imprisonment after events captain america civil war spite having huge threat looming before them captain america iron man still feel guilty what happened between them previously thanos is undoubtedly biggest threat have ever been shown any marvel movie mcu or otherwise unlike comics where hes just simping behind death show how many people he can kill this time he actually has motivation that motivation is so powerful he is even ready sacrifice his own daughter it he has fought many years find infinity stones there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics concepts like humanity empathy conscience dont hold him back anymore as he was brought up by eternals spite being treated as one them he chose part ways mortals dont matter him anymore his ambition does every scene this movie is shot very well story colour palette choreography costumes score everything is absolutely perfect only part i had problem with earlier was when starlord learnt about thanos having killed gamora then he punches thanos till he wakes up is stopped but later i realised that starlord has always been emotional crybaby this kind behaviour is absolutely suited him he cannot be expected think rationally considering his track record both previous guardians galaxy movies finally end when thanos snapped his finger half universe was gone even though we did know that they are all going come back emotions that were conveyed by characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen end i wont be getting into spoilers because i want keep this review spoiler free so if you havent seen it yet dont just see who all disappear notice how they react when they disappear avengers infinity war is kind avengers movie i always wanted see i really dont like how avengers age ultron have aged so terribly just like joss whedons credibility lol because how campy they look by todays standards sure they did hold their legacy back then but infinity war will hold it decades its best mcu movie all time,0.5383234126984126,0.04809523809523812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.3}"

,A film that pulled off the impossible.,"Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.10/10",film that pulled off impossible,avengers infinity war is film that should be utter crap franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard making great satisfying climax that franchise is nearly impossible considering how many characters marvel had juggle together with this movie there was almost no way this movie wouldnt suck but it didnt marvel pulled it off all characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly action was amazing characters were funny story was compelling marvel made what shouldve been overcrowded mess into one best superhero films ever made this movie will sit you edge your seat 2 half hours hats off writers directors producers marvel studios 10 10,0.6636904761904763,0.1125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8.0,Ambitious cross over,"This review contains spoilers.Avengers: Infinity War is the third movie in the Avengers series and is the culmination of the infinity stone arc that has been hinted at in the previous Marvel cinematic universe movies. This movie explores Thanos in more depth as well as utilizing all characters in the Marvel cinematic universe to resist Thanos' plan. The movie is about the event of the infinity stones being brought together and the heroic response.Avengers: Infinity War is a visually impressive movie. The movie is filled with dazzling special effects in every scene. The sound is likewise at the high quality as the visuals. There is not a weak part of the audio and visual experience. The movie felt like how the Marvel cinematic universe should feel after all of the movies. Thanos' character design resembles his comic counterpart and he looks as realistic within reason as a giant humanoid alien should look. Likewise, Thanos' children have distinct and great designed that allow the audience to pick them out in a wide frame.The problems with this movie lie in its story and approach-ability. This entry in the Avengers film series is the least accessible out of all of the Avengers movies. The audience must watch the previous Marvel movies or they will be lost. There is not a single main character or group that is followed in this movie. The only character that is followed consistently with an arc is Thanos. He could be considered the villain protagonist of the story, but he is still not followed as in a classic movie. The movie starts with the cross-overs and anybody that is not familiar with Marvel characters will be lost. Each of the characters maintain their traits in this movie. The guardians of the galaxy have their character when interacting with Thor, Iron Man, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange. The flip-side is also true where the Earth's heroes maintain their personality through the dialogue. The writers should be commended for the writing these cross-overs well. The movie splits the plot into separate threads where the heroes try different methods to defeat Thanos. Ultimately none of it matters because Doctor Strange already knows the only way to win. It was predictable that Thanos would get all of the infinity stones. What was not predictable was seeing which heroes would fade away when Thanos removes half of the universe's population. The movie's end was unique where the movie is not afraid to shock the audience with such a downer ending.Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is recommended. The movie is highly ambitious and is an interesting movie to watch for its universe. The movie does have some problems and it is highly recommended to watch previous movies before watching this movie.Grade: B.",ambitious cross over,this review contains spoilers avengers infinity war is third movie avengers series is culmination infinity stone arc that has been hinted at previous marvel cinematic universe movies this movie explores thanos more depth as well as utilizing all characters marvel cinematic universe resist thanos plan movie is about event infinity stones being brought together heroic response avengers infinity war is visually impressive movie movie is filled with dazzling special effects every scene sound is likewise at high quality as visuals there is not weak part audio visual experience movie felt like how marvel cinematic universe should feel after all movies thanos character design resembles his comic counterpart he looks as realistic within reason as giant humanoid alien should look likewise thanos children have distinct great designed that allow audience pick them out wide frame problems with this movie lie its story approach ability this entry avengers film series is least accessible out all avengers movies audience must watch previous marvel movies or they will be lost there is not single main character or group that is followed this movie only character that is followed consistently with arc is thanos he could be considered villain protagonist story but he is still not followed as classic movie movie starts with cross overs anybody that is not familiar with marvel characters will be lost each characters maintain their traits this movie guardians galaxy have their character when interacting with thor iron man spider man doctor strange flip side is also true where earths heroes maintain their personality through dialogue writers should be commended writing these cross overs well movie splits plot into separate threads where heroes try different methods defeat thanos ultimately none it matters because doctor strange already knows only way win it was predictable that thanos would get all infinity stones what was not predictable was seeing which heroes would fade away when thanos removes half universes population movies end was unique where movie is not afraid shock audience with such downer ending overall avengers infinity war is recommended movie is highly ambitious is interesting movie watch its universe movie does have some problems it is highly recommended watch previous movies before watching this movie grade b,0.4691644204851752,0.1555884995507637,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,The standard for every crossover movie,"Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",standard every crossover movie,though this is not my favorite mcu movie i think infinity war is best product studio produced both because really high scope because execution itself i think movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask action humor heartfelt moments great cgi fantastic score balanced way furthermore even if culmination mcu happened endgame it was here that every piece marvel universe was brought together first time i remember have astronomical hype at time fact that movie resulted be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that i highly count but best part this movie is its villain thanos i loved him still do he absolutely stole show sets up endgame perfectly clearly infinity war has its flaws i am not here say it is perfect like 10 10 rating would usually mean but what it represented at time way it was delivered i think we couldnt have asked more,0.5939035087719298,0.41355263157894734,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"

8.0,A superior avengers sequel,"Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine.
