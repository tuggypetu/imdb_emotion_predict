10,Succeeds on all levels,"Music is banned in Miguel's household after his musical great-grandfather abandoned his great-grandmother and her young daughter. On Mexico's Day Of The Dead festival, a convoluted series of events sees Miguel transported to the Land of the Dead, where he discovers that the dead disappear when no-one remembers them. He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!The story here is very artificially structured, with all sorts of bits and pieces present s that a predetermined trail of events can be created. But you never notice that, so natural is the narrative flow. This film is highly original, full of truly gorgeous visuals, lovely songs, delightful characters, and touching resolutions to several individual story threads. And yet it appeared in the UK with no publicity, trailers, or warnings whatsoever, and my local multiscreen didn't even get it in 3D despite the fact that it is clear that the 3D would be dazzling.This is as good as any Pixar film over the last several years, and better than most.",succeeds all levels,music is banned miguels household after his musical great grandfather abandoned his great grandmother her young daughter mexicos day dead festival convoluted series events sees miguel transported land dead where he discovers that dead disappear when no one remembers them he also discovers that unless he returns land living by dawn he will join dead there are problems ahead story here is very artificially structured with all sorts bits pieces present s that predetermined trail events can be created but you never notice that so natural is narrative flow this film is highly original full truly gorgeous visuals lovely songs delightful characters touching resolutions several individual story threads yet it appeared uk with no publicity trailers or warnings whatsoever my local multiscreen didnt even get it 3d despite fact that it is clear that 3d would be dazzling this is as good as any pixar film over last several years better than most,0.4607142857142857,0.24625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10,Shocked!,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only reason I was there was to take my daughter to see it is strictly because my wife said there was a short Frozen film that played along with the movie and my daughter just so happens to be the biggest Frozen fan on the face of the planet.Not only was I surprised by Coco, it might be the most in depth best story line I've ever seen in an animated movie.

10,What's not to like?!,"I am very glad I saw ""Coco"" and understand exactly why it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as it's terrifically entertaining, fun to watch...and quite touching as well.The story is set around DÃ­a de Muertos, the Mexican Day of the Dead. Miguel is a nice little boy whose family, inexplicably, HATE music and insist he never can grow up to become a musician. And, wouldn't you know it, but that's EXACTLY what the boy wants to become one day. But after destroying his homemade guitar, he is unable to enter a music contest...so he decides to take one from the local cemetery. Not surprisingly, this creates all sorts of problems...and Miguel is transported to the land of the dead. What's next? Just see the film!The CGI for this film is simply the best you'll currently find...putting it well above the quality of competing studios, such as Universal and Fox. In addition, the scope of the images is just breathtaking....and a treat to see on the big screen. Additionally, the songs, story and characters are all lovely. One warning, however, is that this film will very likely start you crying now and again...be sure to have some tissues nearby, just in case.

10,I cried twice watching this.,"I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.Though the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.Coco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.",i cried twice watching this,i have always been fan pixar they are really good at what they do these guys set bar quality animated movies back then animated movies were pretty much made kids only they were just your usual sunday morning cartoons large eyeballs goofy voice exaggerated slapsticks disney had its classics like bambi fox hound cinderella sleeping beauty however it felt more like fairy tales bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you this day age it wouldnt work that well then came pixar with its revolutionary debut toy story funny sweet modern relatable plus completely 3d animated which marks first time feature film was completely 3d animated pixar has been doing just this ever since though movies they released were still quality entertainment i havent felt like this since toy story 3 toy story 3 made me bawl like baby their newest feature film coco finally made me weep like baby again coco is heart warming experience filled with outstanding animation wonderful music brilliant writing creative models which brings out best mexican culture movie took themes like family aspirations music they merged it marvelously with day dead culture mexico i also feel that this movie sends strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point way this movie talks about possessions inevitable loss that comes will i hope comfort you coco is great movie definitely best animated movie this year emoji movie yeah dont think so could possibly be nominee best picture this year way it tugs our heartstrings emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone its definitely up there among pixars finest if justice league annoys you just see this movie i definitely recommend you bring your families kids grandparents whoever you like im sure theyll like it im sure youll hug em all as soon as credits roll,0.658923483923484,0.34352869352869353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10,"Stunning, beautiful, colorful, powerful, sad, happy. A joy of a ride.","I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town. Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.I got my wish. This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken. This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.Thank you, Pixar.",stunning beautiful colorful powerful sad happy joy ride,i may be biased since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about small mexican town or perhaps i wanted see pixar really get back game go beyond up make complete movie that was as beautiful as first 20 minutes wall e i got my wish this is movie i wanted pixar make once again movie about what family means movie about choices we make roads not taken this is stunning work art itll move you happiness tears memories past joy future understanding remembrance joys pains being alive i cant even begin imagine how pixar made movie about life death that is so colorful so absorbing so poignant so approachable kids with so many layers upon layers upon layers meaning significance adults watch coco is love coco remember cocos your life that are no longer among us thank you pixar,0.5354938271604939,0.3018518518518518,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8,A Charming Depiction of a Beautiful Spanish-Language Tradition,"Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On DÃ­a de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music. In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of DÃ­a de Muertos. Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel. Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about DÃ­a de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about DÃ­a de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes. In high school, my understanding of DÃ­a de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly. It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture.

9,Pixar has created a masterpiece of cinema,"I'm no critic, but Coco is close to movie perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life.

9,A Pure Delight!,"Pixar has done it AGAIN! 'Coco' is a yet another delightful ride from the prolific animation studio, who's winning streak seems to never end. And that's good for all, since 'Coco' is all heart & soul, rewarding the moviegoer wholeheartedly.'Coco' Synopsis: Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.'Coco' captures the themes of Life & Death, with genuine feeling. Themes of family, passion, defeat & redemption also are explored here, but with humor & real emotion. While I laughed for a good share of this winning story, I also found myself weeping in the film's final-act. This is a true fantasy-adventure, that gives life & death true meaning. Adrian Molina & Matthew Aldrich's Screenplay is excellent. Lee Unkrich's Direction is colorful. And of course, the Animation is extraordinary. 'Coco' unfolds gorgeously & not for a second, does the pace drop.Vocal-Performances are top-notch! Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, the protagonist, is a joy, Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal s HÃ©ctor Rivera, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz, the most famous musician in the history of Mexico and Miguel's idol & Ana Ofelia MurguÃ­a as MamÃ¡ Socorro ""Coco"" Rivera, Miguel's great-grandmother, stand out.

So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.We were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)It surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. ""there will be no X in this family!"" X being ""instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past"". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?Did I mention bring Kleenex? A full box.

10,"""Music's the only thing that makes me happy.""","I'm not an animated movie fan per se, so this one caught me in just the right frame of mind or it was indeed brilliantly done. Probably the latter because I'd have no qualms about watching it again, as it was cleverly written, very colorful and had an unusually interesting story line. Not to mention that it had enough Espanol sprinkled in to make my four years of high school Spanish appropriately worthwhile. I also enjoyed some of the traditional folk concepts introduced by the story, like the Mexican 'Dia de Los Muertos', the annual Day of the Dead Celebration, along with it's fantastical sprit creatures called 'alebrijes'. One thing you'll have to do is pay attention at the beginning of the story to understand the relationship of young Miguel to his past and present family members; we go back in time all the way to his great-great grandfather, which turns out to be one of the twists in the story. At first I was upset that Ernesto de la Cruz turned out to be a villain, but the story handled that switch perfectly and helped inspire the entire Rivera Family to love music once again. The best concept for me however was in the explanation of how the spirits in the afterworld disappeared when there was no one left alive to think about them any more. Thoughtful families would do well to take that instruction to heart to keep alive the memories and traditions of their ancestors from the past.",musics only thing that makes me happy,im not animated movie fan per se so this one caught me just right frame mind or it was indeed brilliantly done probably latter because id have no qualms about watching it again as it was cleverly written very colorful had unusually interesting story line not mention that it had enough espanol sprinkled make my four years high school spanish appropriately worthwhile i also enjoyed some traditional folk concepts introduced by story like mexican dia de los muertos annual day dead celebration along with its fantastical sprit creatures called alebrijes one thing youll have do is pay attention at beginning story understand relationship young miguel his past present family members we go back time all way his great great grandfather which turns out be one twists story at first i was upset that ernesto de la cruz turned out be villain but story handled that switch perfectly helped inspire entire rivera family love music once again best concept me however was explanation how spirits afterworld disappeared when there was no one left alive think about them any more thoughtful families would do well take that instruction heart keep alive memories traditions their ancestors past,0.47992063492063497,0.2743145743145743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10,Another great film from Pixar,"This Pixar animation is centred on Miguel a Mexican boy who dreams of becoming a musician. Unfortunately for him his family has banned all music because his great great grandfather had abandoned his great great grandmother to become a musician... they expect him to become a shoemaker like the rest of his family. On the Day of the Dead he plans to sneak off and take part in a music competition but his grandmother destroys his guitar. Needing a new instrument he breaks into the tomb of his hero, legendary musician Ernesto de la Cruz, to borrow his guitar. As soon as he plays a chord something strange happens... nobody alive can see him but he can interact with his dead relatives who can enter the world of the living that one day. He returns to the Land of the Dead with them. He learns that if he stays past the end of the night he will become one of the dead! His family could return him but add the condition that he must give up on music... he refuses believing that Ernesto is his great great grandfather so could return him without such a condition. HÃ©ctor offers to help in exchange for taking his picture back to the Land of the Living. In what follows Miguel learns more about his family and culture.I found this film to be an absolute delight; the story is charming with excitement and genuinely emotional moments. I loved how it was based on the Day of the Dead; a celebration I'd previously heard of but didn't know about in any detail... I'd thought it sounded rather macabre but thanks to this see that it is really something rather beautiful; a day to remember dead family members. As one would expect the animation is great as were the detailed backgrounds. The central story of a child trying to return from a spirit world strongly reminded me of Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away'; the execution is quite different though so I never felt this was copying that film. One might think that a film about characters who are dead might be a bit creepy for younger viewers but the character designs aren't scary; in fact I think the film could be shown to children wondering about death. There are more songs than most Pixar films but it isn't a musical... characters perform rather than just break into song. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to all film fans.",another great film pixar,this pixar animation is centred miguel mexican boy who dreams becoming musician unfortunately him his family has banned all music because his great great grandfather had abandoned his great great grandmother become musician they expect him become shoemaker like rest his family day dead he plans sneak off take part music competition but his grandmother destroys his guitar needing new instrument he breaks into tomb his hero legendary musician ernesto de la cruz borrow his guitar as soon as he plays chord something strange happens nobody alive can see him but he can interact with his dead relatives who can enter world living that one day he returns land dead with them he learns that if he stays past end night he will become one dead his family could return him but add condition that he must give up music he refuses believing that ernesto is his great great grandfather so could return him without such condition h ctor offers help exchange taking his picture back land living what follows miguel learns more about his family culture i found this film be absolute delight story is charming with excitement genuinely emotional moments i loved how it was based day dead celebration id previously heard but didnt know about any detail id thought it sounded rather macabre but thanks this see that it is really something rather beautiful day remember dead family members as one would expect animation is great as were detailed backgrounds central story child trying return spirit world strongly reminded me studio ghiblis spirited away execution is quite different though so i never felt this was copying that film one might think that film about characters who are dead might be bit creepy younger viewers but character designs arent scary fact i think film could be shown children wondering about death there are more songs than most pixar films but it isnt musical characters perform rather than just break into song overall id definitely recommend this all film fans,0.534469696969697,0.21881313131313138,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10,Celebrating the Day of the Dead.,"With a friends daughter having a birthday soon,I looked for a DVD to pick up that they would all enjoy. Having heard praise about this film over the last few months,I was pleased to see that it had come out on disc, leading me to meet Coco.View on the film:Setting the record as the longest PIXAR film in production from 2011-2017, co-writers/(with Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich) directors Lee Unkrich & Adrian Molina remarkably keep any sign of production woes off-screen with a dazzling array of colourful animation. Playing the first notes of Miguel preparing for the Day of the Dead with his family, the directors give the CGI a rich pastel appearance, highlighting the earthy, family connections the event celebrates. Crossing over to the Land of the Dead, the directors show a stunning advancement in CGI with gliding shots along the glittering Land and detailed character designs bringing emotions out of the skinless figures.Whilst the strings are made of the traditional Disney message of family being important, the writers find new melodies, with the use of songs spanning generations of families laying the dimensions of each character, from Miguel learning that family is part of the tapestry of his life,to HÃ©ctor looking back at everyone he ran away from. Getting Miguel changed after showing his singing talents, Anthony Gonzalez gives a splendid performance as the lively Miguel, whilst Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal's gives a smooth melancholy to Hector's fears of being forgotten by Coco.",celebrating day dead,with friends daughter having birthday soon i looked dvd pick up that they would all enjoy having heard praise about this film over last few months i was pleased see that it had come out disc leading me meet coco view film setting record as longest pixar film production 2011 2017 co writers with jason katz matthew aldrich directors lee unkrich adrian molina remarkably keep any sign production woes off screen with dazzling array colourful animation playing first notes miguel preparing day dead with his family directors give cgi rich pastel appearance highlighting earthy family connections event celebrates crossing over land dead directors show stunning advancement cgi with gliding shots along glittering land detailed character designs bringing emotions out skinless figures whilst strings are made traditional disney message family being important writers find new melodies with use songs spanning generations families laying dimensions each character miguel learning that family is part tapestry his life h ctor looking back at everyone he ran away getting miguel changed after showing his singing talents anthony gonzalez gives splendid performance as lively miguel whilst gael garc bernals gives smooth melancholy hectors fears being forgotten by coco,0.5827272727272728,0.25155303030303033,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9,Why I believe it deserves a 10,Pixar has come a long way. To them their creations have become a science into human emotion and I don't know any better company that has nearly perfected the craft. Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified. It takes ones thick skull (pun intended) and supplies human emotion as the medium to communicate the message so as to reach the heart. One may call that manipulation but due to its sincere true message and goodness I humbly give it a 10.,why i believe it deserves 10,pixar has come long way them their creations have become science into human emotion i dont know any better company that has nearly perfected craft soon theyll have 10s across board music picture story characters never have i seen that more than movie wall e this movie is up there more than just its basic elements it dared dive into culture that very few world know about it went above beyond research getting those mexicos stamp approval it touches deeper recess heart where soul lies dormant awakens it with hope optimism it takes differences we often critique judge upon another group only pixar place mirror right front us stare at our own reflection it takes common elements so as identify with characters stir feeling commonality its brilliant ingenious these things alone give it 8 10 is because it was bold dared go places other wont this i found originality something you dont see often these days best part all it unified it takes ones thick skull pun intended supplies human emotion as medium communicate message so as reach heart one may call that manipulation but due its sincere true message goodness i humbly give it 10,0.48468253968253966,0.19621031746031745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10,It is absolutely a celebration of a lifetime,"Have always loved Pixar, and really like to love most of their films (all three 'Cars' films and 'The Good Dinosaur' are my least favourites, and although the second 'Cars' had a lot of problems for me the third one is the only less than average one).As for favourites, they are all three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Up', love 'Wall-E' and 'Finding Nemo' as well. After seeing 'Coco' yesterday, hearing nothing but great things about it and seeing the near-universal critical acclaim, from personal opinion (and many others it seems) it is right up there with the Pixar masterpieces. Would go as far to say it is easily their best since 'Inside Out', which is saying a lot since the films between that and this were lesser Pixar efforts (enjoyed 'Finding Dory' though, though it is a long way from being one of Pixar's best).'Coco' is one of the longest Pixar films, clocking in at nearly two hours, but it sure didn't feel like it. Seeing it in the cinema, the audience was a quite large one, if on a side note not as many as thought. With it being a family film, the weekend and that it was only released three days ago, part of me was thinking it would be sold out. Throughout everybody, children and adults alike, was laughing, in awe and crying. It is also a different Pixar film, with a unique setting and that it is more music/song-oriented, and has replaced 'Inside Out' as their most mature and in depth, with themes that are remarkably daring and relevant.Lets talk about what is so brilliant about 'Coco'. The film is a triumph when it comes to visuals, one of Pixar's best-looking easily. The animation throughout is absolutely spectacular, whether in the real world or the Land of the Dead. The colours are so vibrant and atmospheric and there is so much gorgeous detailing in the backgrounds, nuances in the way the characters look and the skeletal designs and movements have amazing dexterity that is both clever and ghoulish.Just as triumphant is the music. Michael Giacchino's score is one of his best and most multi-layered, capturing the spirit of Mexico in a way that's celebratory. The songs are similarly infectious, ""Remember Me"" is not just a beautiful song but it has a great, upbeat message and adds a lot to the story.The writing has so much spirit, poignancy and entertainment value. The jokes are sophisticated and amusing, neither childish or repetitive to me and Dante is both adorable and funny, and the emotional elements are truly heartfelt, especially in the last act. The story is bright and breezy in pacing, despite the fairly long length one doesn't feel it. The Mexican culture and family values were clearly comprehensively researched and the film feels like a warm, fun and heartfelt tribute and celebration to culture, family, music and even Latino cinema in the Golden Age (the latter proving crucial to the revelation of a major plot twist).Not since 'Inside Out' has a Pixar film made me laugh and bring tears to my eyes as much as 'Coco' did, not since 'Paddington 2' has a film's ending leave me sobbing. The relationship between Hector and Miguel has a huge amount of heart and complexity, one can understand the point of view of the Rivera family (living and dead) and the macabre elements are very imaginatively realised. The twists in particularly the last act keep coming, mostly unexpected and all very clever. Some elements of the reveal with Ernesto were not that surprising (Pixar have done similar and it is fairly clichÃ©d, my one slight criticism with 'Coco' but found it easy to overlook) but none of it was guessable too early and it was extremely well done and tense regardless.All the characters are fully formed and have strengths and flaws. Hector was the most fully rounded and provided the most heart and a lot of us are likely to find ourselves in Miguel and his aspirations. Imelda is also memorable as a character and the chemistry between all the characters is realised beautifully too. Voice acting is first rate, especially the remarkably multi-faceted contribution from Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal as Hector. Anthony Gonzalez also voices with spirit and emotion, Alanna Ubach achieves a balance to Imelda of not wanting to get on the wrong side of her and having a caring side and Benjamin Bratt shows a side that one is surprised is in him. In summary, truly amazing and a celebration of a lifetime. One of the most deserving recipients of a perfect score in a while. 10/10 Bethany Cox",it is absolutely celebration lifetime,have always loved pixar really like love most their films all three cars films good dinosaur are my least favourites although second cars had lot problems me third one is only less than average one as favourites they are all three toy story films inside out up love wall e finding nemo as well after seeing coco yesterday hearing nothing but great things about it seeing near universal critical acclaim personal opinion many others it seems it is right up there with pixar masterpieces would go as far say it is easily their best since inside out which is saying lot since films between that this were lesser pixar efforts enjoyed finding dory though though it is long way being one pixars best coco is one longest pixar films clocking at nearly two hours but it sure didnt feel like it seeing it cinema audience was quite large one if side note not as many as thought with it being family film weekend that it was only released three days ago part me was thinking it would be sold out throughout everybody children adults alike was laughing awe crying it is also different pixar film with unique setting that it is more music song oriented has replaced inside out as their most mature depth with themes that are remarkably daring relevant lets talk about what is so brilliant about coco film is triumph when it comes visuals one pixars best looking easily animation throughout is absolutely spectacular whether real world or land dead colours are so vibrant atmospheric there is so much gorgeous detailing backgrounds nuances way characters look skeletal designs movements have amazing dexterity that is both clever ghoulish just as triumphant is music michael giacchinos score is one his best most multi layered capturing spirit mexico way thats celebratory songs are similarly infectious remember me is not just beautiful song but it has great upbeat message adds lot story writing has so much spirit poignancy entertainment value jokes are sophisticated amusing neither childish or repetitive me dante is both adorable funny emotional elements are truly heartfelt especially last act story is bright breezy pacing despite fairly long length one doesnt feel it mexican culture family values were clearly comprehensively researched film feels like warm fun heartfelt tribute celebration culture family music even latino cinema golden age latter proving crucial revelation major plot twist not since inside out has pixar film made me laugh bring tears my eyes as much as coco did not since paddington 2 has films ending leave me sobbing relationship between hector miguel has huge amount heart complexity one can understand point view rivera family living dead macabre elements are very imaginatively realised twists particularly last act keep coming mostly unexpected all very clever some elements reveal with ernesto were not that surprising pixar have done similar it is fairly clich d my one slight criticism with coco but found it easy overlook but none it was guessable too early it was extremely well done tense regardless all characters are fully formed have strengths flaws hector was most fully rounded provided most heart lot us are likely find ourselves miguel his aspirations imelda is also memorable as character chemistry between all characters is realised beautifully too voice acting is first rate especially remarkably multi faceted contribution gael garc bernal as hector anthony gonzalez also voices with spirit emotion alanna ubach achieves balance imelda not wanting get wrong side her having caring side benjamin bratt shows side that one is surprised is him summary truly amazing celebration lifetime one most deserving recipients perfect score while 10 10 bethany cox,0.5899985165405724,0.2936993769470406,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10,Overwhelmed!,"I'm a 24 year old student who sometimes tends to overthink about the values of life and how one, including myself, expresses these kinds of thoughts through every form of art that tells a story. So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.Coco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the ""Day of the Dead"" tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family's approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds. Quiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn't make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my ""top 10 best movie scenes"" list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me. Actually crying.I could go on and on about Coco, but I'll leave with saying that this is a fantastic movie and I honestly feel grateful that I had the chance to watch it.A must see!!!",overwhelmed,im 24 year old student who sometimes tends overthink about values life how one including myself expresses these kinds thoughts through every form art that tells story so as person that really puts his soul movie he watches i have say that this film is one most beautiful things ive ever had pleasure witnessing coco does fantastic job capturing viewer first moment it cleverly captures beauty day dead tradition by unfolding one most heartwarming stories ive ever seen movie around it film features young musician called miguel pursuit his dream being musician against his familys approval throughout movie while miguel engages adventurous journey through land dead he is caught between love he has music importance family bonds quiet simple pretty well covered subject somehow coco manages so simply beatifully capture essence what it means be human what it means love what it means have passion things people you love story was told such elegant way that it didnt make me think about values it represented but instead it made me feel them without me even analysing what i was watching it did it so gradually that at some point near end i was so overwhelmed by scene which definetely goes my top 10 best movie scenes list that i caught myself crying not tearing up like i usually do when scene touches me actually crying i could go about coco but ill leave with saying that this is fantastic movie i honestly feel grateful that i had chance watch it must see,0.5561755952380952,0.20937499999999998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.26}"

10,Best Pixar Movie Yet!,"Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few ""adult"" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.RATING: 10.0/10.0",best pixar movie yet,yes pixar animation studios has done it again their latest release coco 2017 is not only return form but also manages be their best feature yet 1995 all way up until 2010 pixar knocked it out park with every release save cars 2006 maybe bugs life 1998 however after cars 2 2011 it seems every release theirs has been bad or mediocre except course 2015s extraordinary inside out 2015 luckily coco 2017 manages be second great pixar movie since toy story 3 2010 hopefully return form good this time all i will divulge about plot is that it follows boy named miguel his dog traveling into land dead there story takes you startling visual entertainment emotional heights that no pixar movie no kids movie very few adult movies have ever taken you yes this is even more emotional than up 2009 inside out 2015 both those films moved me tears but never hit me as hard as this one did it touched something deep within my soul unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water bit this one i began openly weep it was emotional catharsis like ive never experienced before aside poignant elements film also manages be enormously entertaining with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels fun pixar hasnt reached since monsters inc 2001 incredibles 2004 they use visually gorgeous land dead they have created their full advantage provide rollicking adventure that combines imagination entertainment brilliantly other thing i should mention is score which is by far best pixar score i have ever had pleasure listening yes even better than finding nemos 2003 ups 2009 inside outs 2015 i suppose that shouldnt come as surprise considering this is most musical movie pixar has ever created but nevertheless was one many many memorable aspects conclusion my favorite pixar movies up until this point have been toy story 1995 finding nemo 2003 incredibles 2004 wall e 2008 up 2009 with monsters inc 2001 ratatouille 2007 toy story 3 2010 inside out 2015 not far behind i have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade by fact that even their originals brave 2012 good dinosaur 2015 have been okay at best even inside out 2015 though i love it is still better at delivering important message children than it is being its own story but with coco 2017 pixar has nailed it it brought me back childhood nostalgia watching pixar classics like finding nemo 2003 toy story 1995 fun adventure laughs tears this is what pixar movie should be this is what kids movie should me this is what any movie should be it is truly one my favorite movies all time rating 10 0 10 0,0.5921839080459771,0.23646551724137926,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.2}"
