4.0,People Need To Lighten Up About This Movie,"This is certainly a consensus pick as one of the worst (if not the worst) movies ever made - and for that very reason I've always wanted to watch it. Now I have, and my suggestion to everyone is - lighten up. Yes, it's bad. The sets are dreadful - worse than you used to see on Saturday morning kids' shows. The special effects are weak - although to be honest I've seen worse portrayals of space flight. And the costumes are hilarious - especially the polar bear and the robot. But come on - you have to admit that there's a certain ""cuteness"" to the story of Martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus so that he can bring happiness to their children. All the characters are pretty one- dimensional. There's good guys and bad guys and fun guys and kids from both Earth and Mars. No one gets particularly well developed. And then, of course, there's Santa. In all honesty, I thought John Call did a decent job as the jolly old man. In this age of high tech special effects and big budget movies there's no doubt that this looks pretty weak - and even by the standards of 1964 it was still pretty weak. But it's good fun, and for the fun alone I don't think it deserves its reputation as one of the worst movies ever.

5.0,"Ludicrous, yet charming, Christmas-based nonsense","Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a low budget kid's movie from the early 60's. It has a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made. But, similar to most such famously trashed films, it actually turns out to be nowhere near the worst of the worst. More accurately, this could be described as an enjoyable slice of cheese. Sure, its rubbish on several levels but it also happens to be memorable on several other levels.The story, such as it is, has the Martians kidnapping Santa Claus and, in the process, abducting two Earth children as well. You see, the Martians want to enjoy Christmas as well. With a plot-line as moronic as that, there's really no point in splitting hairs over details and instead just sit back and watch what unfolds. The sets, costumes and make-up are all bargain-basement but they all work well enough within the confines of the plastic coated world that they exist in. Some of the highlights of the film as a whole include an angry Martian and friendly but stupid Martian, an impressively unconvincing and fake polar bear, a comedy punch up and last, yet surely best of all, a truly infectious theme song about Santy Claus. In the final analysis, there's enough strangeness here to qualify this as a bona fide cult item. It's poor, yet simultaneously quite good.

4.0,Can something this dumb really be harmless?,"Maybe I have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written, badly conceived, silly 1960s children's movies - but I really can't understand why Santa Claus versus the Martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on IMDb. Sure, most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends, but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old Kennel Ration Hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years. Hey, at least it's not a remake, a sequel, or a 2 hour long CGI cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect.Santa Claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians (white guys with bad green makeup and a few dishwasher parts glued to their heads, as well as inexplicable capes), who want to rescue their depressive, antisocial children from the doldrums by giving them all toys and a big red-suited guy with a beard to laugh at... err... with. Santa adapts to life on Mars very well and starts cranking out the toys with the help of Martian machines, but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten the fabric of Martian Society.I'm not kidding.... really.... this is the plot.Aside from the ludicrous plot and mediocre acting (Bill McCutcheon gives the only really enjoyable performance in this film, though Pia Zadora and Vincent Beck are not too bad), this is no worse than many of the kid films of its time. In the age of ADD and general impatience, however, this film is more than a little dated. The only modern kid I can imagine enjoying this film is one with an extraordinarily great attention span and a penchant for B-films. In terms of production, this film has the feel of a 2 hour, 1960s low budget TV show, and is almost as clever.I would recommend avoiding this film unless you're compelled to watch films which go to extremes. I found it cute, funny, and more than a tad ridiculous. To most people, it's a film version of your great Aunt's wallpaper - it's just there on the TV, while far more interesting things are happening in the carpet below your feet.",can something this dumb really be harmless,maybe i have soft spot somewhere my heart poorly written badly conceived silly 1960s childrens movies but i really cant understand why santa claus versus martians is worst 100 movies all time here imdb sure most viewers will breathe sigh relief when it ends but this film really seems downright harmless compared six month old kennel ration hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film last ten or so years hey at least its not remake sequel or 2 hour long cgi cartoon with few human faces tossed effect santa claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians white guys with bad green makeup few dishwasher parts glued their heads as well as inexplicable capes who want rescue their depressive antisocial children doldrums by giving them all toys big red suited guy with beard laugh at err with santa adapts life mars very well starts cranking out toys with help martian machines but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten fabric martian society im not kidding really this is plot aside ludicrous plot mediocre acting bill mccutcheon gives only really enjoyable performance this film though pia zadora vincent beck are not too bad this is no worse than many kid films its time age add general impatience however this film is more than little dated only modern kid i can imagine enjoying this film is one with extraordinarily great attention span penchant b films terms production this film has feel 2 hour 1960s low budget tv show is almost as clever i would recommend avoiding this film unless youre compelled watch films which go extremes i found it cute funny more than tad ridiculous most people its film version your great aunts wallpaper its just there tv while far more interesting things are happening carpet below your feet,0.48953373015873014,0.03608630952380954,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Santa Claus Conquers the Martians... and our hearts.,"I really enjoy this silly little holiday flick. A bunch of serious Martian adults are afraid that their serious Martian children are too serious, so they go to a serious Martian senior citizen. The old guy tells them that the children need to be taught how to laugh, and then he explodes for no reason. The only logical thing left to do, of course, is go to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus, who we meet as he is being interviewed by the Rip Taylor-like Andy Anderson. I liked how in the movie's universe, Santa is unquestionably real and everyone knows about him. He really does deliver toys to everyone, toys made by a dozen elves (who all look like they're suffering from mini-seasonal depression). One toy shown is a toy rocket that runs on ""real rocket fuel"", Santa proudly explains. I would ask, ""Where do little kids get rocket fuel?"" The details of Santa's amazingly speedy mass distribution methods are not brought up, but it's probably black magic-related.The Martians nab Kris Kringle and two little Earth children, who seem to live alone in the woods with no parents or family but are clean and well fed. The Martian leader forces Santa and the children to run their soulless toy machine (Soulless Toy Machine would be a good name for a band). Despite the numerous violations of human rights, it's all in good fun and everybody is nice and happy, except for one mean Martian (with a disturbing droopy mustache and a sidekick that looks like Jamie Farr) who plots to kidnap Santa (even though he's already been kidnapped). Santa encourages the kids, even the Martian kids who have now learned to have fun, to hurl lots of heavy mid-sixties toys at the bad guy's skulls. Through this display of parental negligence and bad music the evil is thwarted, and Santa is permitted to go back to Earth, letting the mewling half-wit comic relief Martian named Droppo take over the reigns of the Martian Toy Empire. (The Martians are out-of-shape guys in tights and helmets with antenna sprouting out of them, and what looks like diarrhea smeared across their faces. Imagine a guy dressed like that mugging worse than the teacher guy in Juan Piquor Simon's ""Monster Island"" and that's Droppo).How can you hate this movie? If I were a little kid in 1964 I'd be enthralled. They packed this movie with nutty stuff. Elves get shot with freeze rays. Mrs. Claus is a frantic goofball. The Martian children sleep under strange lights and eat only pills. The bad guy's hideout looks like that one King Crimson album cover. I loved the part where the villain tries to shoot Santa and the kids out of an airlock, and the part where the bad guys meddle with the toy machine and the toys come out all mixed-up. There's a guy in a goofy robot costume, and a guy in an even goofier polar bear costume. And that deliciously idiotic theme song- ""You spell it S-A-N-T-A C-L-A-U-S, Hooray for Santy Claus!"" Oh, it's so good!I sincerely feel the people making this had the best intentions, and while they didn't have a huge budget they made a fun, silly kids movie. If it was the same exact movie but done in Rudolf-style stop motion animation it would be a regular holiday viewing tradition.Oh, yeah, and Pia Zadora is in this, as if anyone cares.",santa claus conquers martians our hearts,i really enjoy this silly little holiday flick bunch serious martian adults are afraid that their serious martian children are too serious so they go serious martian senior citizen old guy tells them that children need be taught how laugh then he explodes no reason only logical thing left do course is go earth kidnap santa claus who we meet as he is being interviewed by rip taylor like andy anderson i liked how movies universe santa is unquestionably real everyone knows about him he really does deliver toys everyone toys made by dozen elves who all look like theyre suffering mini seasonal depression one toy shown is toy rocket that runs real rocket fuel santa proudly explains i would ask where do little kids get rocket fuel details santas amazingly speedy mass distribution methods are not brought up but its probably black magic related martians nab kris kringle two little earth children who seem live alone woods with no parents or family but are clean well fed martian leader forces santa children run their soulless toy machine soulless toy machine would be good name band despite numerous violations human rights its all good fun everybody is nice happy except one mean martian with disturbing droopy mustache sidekick that looks like jamie farr who plots kidnap santa even though hes already been kidnapped santa encourages kids even martian kids who have now learned have fun hurl lots heavy mid sixties toys at bad guys skulls through this display parental negligence bad music evil is thwarted santa is permitted go back earth letting mewling half wit comic relief martian named droppo take over reigns martian toy empire martians are out shape guys tights helmets with antenna sprouting out them what looks like diarrhea smeared across their faces imagine guy dressed like that mugging worse than teacher guy juan piquor simons monster island thats droppo how can you hate this movie if i were little kid 1964 id be enthralled they packed this movie with nutty stuff elves get shot with freeze rays mrs claus is frantic goofball martian children sleep under strange lights eat only pills bad guys hideout looks like that one king crimson album cover i loved part where villain tries shoot santa kids out airlock part where bad guys meddle with toy machine toys come out all mixed up theres guy goofy robot costume guy even goofier polar bear costume that deliciously idiotic theme song you spell it s n t c l u s hooray santy claus oh its so good i sincerely feel people making this had best intentions while they didnt have huge budget they made fun silly kids movie if it was same exact movie but done rudolf style stop motion animation it would be regular holiday viewing tradition oh yeah pia zadora is this as if anyone cares,0.5387286324786325,0.02611914600550965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,I loved this film as a child,"BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONESTGrowing up in Oxnard Ca this film always played on KTTV Channel 11 around Christmas time. It later moved to KTLA Channel 5 and Pia Zadora even did a fireside chat with television movie host Tom Hatten. Even today watching this film is a huge part of my ""Christmas traditions"". It was a ""Must See"" when I was a child and today I still watch it (Around Christmas)"". I also still watch ""Rudolph"" ""Charlie Brown"" ""Frosty the Snowman"" and MGM's ""A Christmas Carol"". One of the main reasons why I love this film is because I loved John Call as ""Santa Claus"". He is a huge delight. He is a terrific Santa. In this film ""Santa"" gets kidnapped by Martians. The reason is that the children of Mars do not have a ""Santa"". They also do not know how to have ""fun"". So the leader of Mars goes to Earth and kidnaps Santa as well as 2 earth children. ""Santa"" then slowly wins over the Adult Martians even though there are certain forces against him. Now if you are an adult (and you have never seen this) you will think this movie is terrible. Children (Who still believe in Santa) will be entertained. It is harmless fun! Even the theme song ""Hooray For Santa Claus"" is ""Cute & Catchy"".The films low budget is all too apparent here however if this film did have a bigger budget then it might not have the weird charm.I beg all of you to watch this film.

1.0,The best worst awful awesome movie ever!,"(r#30)Basically everything is wrong about this film, and that's what makes it so great. It's hysterical, but even as you're laughing yourself breathless you can't help but feel bad inside that you're actually chewing down this rotten junk food. Because that's what Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is: a case of food poisoning. There are layers and layers of awfulness in this movie, and it really is an unforgettable experience. The actors are all stoned out of their minds and extremely ugly. The title pretty much explains the plot, although there's not really a lot of ""conquering"". Maybe a better title would have been ""Santa Claus Laughs at Inappropriate Times while Hanging Out with Bad Actors in Silly Outfits""? Just saying. I know it isn't as catchy, but at least it's not deceiving.It would be impossible to sum up all the stuff that sucks about this film, so I'll break it down into what I remember most strongly: a man in an ingeniously fake-looking polar bear costume (funnier than the ""bear"" from Hercules in New York); an extra with the most unnatural laugh you're ever likely to hear; an ex-dope addict martian with tics; kid actors who make sure every syllable of their lines are slowly and caaarreee-fulll-yyy prrooo-noun-ceeed; a newspaper headline stating that Santa's been ""kidnaped"", and a giant robot. Yes, you read that right. A giant robot.The worst acting job in here must be when Mother Claus and her elves have been ""frozen"" by the ""Martians'"" weapons. Could they be *more* trembling?

8.0,"A kind of clumsy magic, very savory; the charm and integrity of some primitive productions","I think that the main magic of many of these endearing old camp films comes from the fact that they undoubtedly have something amiable, cordial .In these things, SANTA  excels. From this came a sort a primitive poetry that has emotional relevance and can still be enjoyed, tasted. The effects were clumsy and what not, yet the touch was light and amiable. It elicited, on the viewer's part, a complicity. SANTA  is in no way a classic; but it is a cordial amiable funny movie very aware of its limitations, humble yet confident. It was the joyfulness of the pictures made by another race of movie makers. This is what has been lost since, and is missing today.Such films have an undeserved fame, an unmerited bad reputation; they are not bad, they are clumsy. There are thousands of worst movies; and more clumsy.These are picturesquely clumsy. This is their specific. Only the philistines take them for being 'bad', or even 'the worst'.SANTA  was so long ago labeled, classified, that,as a newcomer to the cult,I knew what to expectand I was not disappointed. I suspect of hypocrisy those who pretend to be amazed (negatively) by what this film is aboutor about what it looks like. Come on, we all already knewthe film but confirms us. Its cult precedes it.Santa Claus is a funny ,serene Sci-Fi adventure for kids.

10.0,Hooray for gloriously rancid no-budget yuletide sci-fi schlock!,"Yes, this infamous Noel clinker is every bit as atrocious as its notorious reputation would suggest, but for all its admitted appalling awfulness it still nonetheless manages to be quite entertaining and often downright sidesplitting because it's just so incredibly silly, inept, and low-rent from the get-go. John Call horribly overdoes the hale'n'hearty merriment as an insufferably jolly Saint Nick. Vincent Beck likewise hams it up to a frighteningly horrendous degree as dastardly no-count meanie Voldar. But the top bad acting dishonors clearly go to Bill McCutcheon as the annoyingly giddy'n'giggly Dropo, who's supposed to be the comic relief of the piece, but instead comes across as a profoundly obnoxious nuisance. Of course, there's also the single most pitiful and unconvincing polar bear to ever shamble its pathetic way in front of a camera. The big clunky robot Torg is markedly less than impressive as well. The sets appear to be built out of cardboard, the cinematography looks ratty and washed-out throughout, the pace plods like a sad snail doped up on anti-depressant drugs, the fumbling (non)direction stinks, and the painfully forced attempts at wacky humor leave a great deal to be desired. Moreover, you'll never be able to forget that irritatingly catchy theme song ""Hooray for Santa Claus"" no matter how hard you try.

10.0,An American Classic of Bad Cinema,"First I saw ""Reefer Madness."" It was bad, but great.Then I saw ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" Horrible, but enjoyable.After that I saw ""Robot Monster."" Awful and yet spectacular.Finally, I saw ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" Wow, how can you make a lame plot for a screenplay worse? By making a low budget film out of it. And that's just what Joseph Levine thought when he released this film onto an unsuspecting Earth. Now I ask you, is this indeed the WORST film of all time? My opinion: NO. In my translation of the meaning ""bad film"" means ""unbearable, unwatchable and disposable."" Not ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians."" This film is a landmark in the American motion picture industry. The makers of this film actually had the guts to create and release this film. Now that takes some serious talent! Let's not forget the actors either. Surprisingly the acting isn't nearly as bad as it's made out to be (people confuse the 'acting' with the 'plot.'). The children, the Martians and even Santa Claus make one heck of an impression on a shoe-string budget film like this (don't forget that weird professor Albert Einstein wannabe). Above all, clever a production design really create a fine sense of cheesiness. Now, how about a brand new DVD 'Special Cheesy Edition' of ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians?"" ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is a rare and satisfying little gem of a film that broke, no, shattered all the rules of making a ""good and enjoyable"" movie.

Either way, this one will appeal to them.For the rest of us, there's the issues of Santa-kidnapping Martians in BRIGHT green makeup and helmets that resemble Yul Brynner's headgear in ""The Ten Commandments""; other Martians that you either want to punch out (Dropo) or try and talk out of future acting opportunities (a young Pia Zadora-???); Santas that walk around saying ""Merry Christmas"", despite the fact that Christmas is not even close; pop guns that immobilize people; polar bears that have extremely long hind legs; and blah, and blah, and blah...But DOES Santa Claus actually conquer the Martians of the title, like it says? Yep, but he doesn't hit, punch, kick, bite, scratch, claw or anything. Sorry kids, green blood does not flow here. You see, Santa puts in a Martian North Pole workshop and wins over the Martians with peace and good will towards men...and Martians too, I guess.

2.0,There should have been a sanity claus.,"Since plan nine failed, the Martians are at it again. Martian children have become obsessed with American TV, and apparently in possession of really good TV rabbit ears), so their fathers decide to grab earthling children and later Santa Claus for themselves. The children of earth discover the plot to kidnap Santa and decide to stop them.The Martians here, wearing very tight, revealing clothing, look exactly like humans except they have green tinted skin (making me believe that the Wicked Witch of the West must have been a Martian) and felt skulls with antennas, some with moustaches and some able to laugh. There's even one who could have been the Mickey Rooney from Mars. One of the Martian children is the young Pia Zadora who would go on to become the greatest film star of the 1980's. The art direction is actually pretty interesting, but it looks closer to a 60's TV science fiction show (like ""Lost in Space"") than the serious sci-fi films of the time. Get a loaf of the fake polar bear in the north pole sequence and a giant robot that is truly laughable.What makes this film really bad is the idiotic dialogue and the acting which really seems like the actors (if you can call them that) memorize the script that morning and never rehearsed before the cameras rolled. The Martians also use guns that look like they are shooting nerf balls. At least there's that zippy ""Hooray For Santa Claus!"" song for audiences to sing as they left the theater.
