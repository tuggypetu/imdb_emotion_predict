10.0,"""We Intend To Watch This Basket Very Closely.""","The Great Escape tells the amazing story of a whole bunch of allied prisoners who accomplish a mass breakout during World War II, some of whom actually did make it to freedom and the allied armed forces once again. The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.To insure that the American movie public would be buying tickets, several American players got into The Great Escape. Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and a pair of American TV cowboys just breaking into big screen star status, James Garner and Steve McQueen were put in the film. Director John Sturges had worked with McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson in his last film The Magnificent Seven. Sturges does a grand job in never letting his audiences attention flag for one minute in this almost three hour length film.What the Nazis have done in this film is to build a brand new prison camp and have put all the perennial escape artists in this one. Of course by doing so a whole lot of talented escape artists in one place.And the organized effort is led by Richard Attenborough. Without going overboard into a whole lot of flag waving, Sturges and Attenborough give us the portrayal of a deeply patriotic man who if he can't back into the fight himself, is going to do what he can from a POW camp to bedevil the people making war on his country. He leads the mass escape attempt with an almost corporate efficiency.The opposite of course is Steve McQueen. I've always thought of Captain Virgil Hills as the ultimate Steve McQueen role of individualism. He and flight officer Angus Lennie are going to get out, no matter what, on their own or with the group. Angus Lennie is the former jockey now RAF flight officer and his death amidst a Fourth of July party that McQueen, Garner, and Jud Taylor have is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. McQueen decides to play for the team after that.The Great Escape allowed McQueen to indulge in one of his hobbies of motorcycling. His race through the German country side on a stolen Nazi uniform and motorcycle is a spectacular one, aided and abetted by Elmer Bernstein's magnificent film score.James Garner bonds with Donald Pleasance in the film. Garner is an American in the RAF Eagle Squadron, Americans who couldn't wait for their own country to get into the war who enlisted in the RAF. A lot of Garner's TV character of Bret Maverick is in his role as Hendley the scrounger/con artist. Pleasance is his room mate, the shy bird watcher who does the work of forging documents for the escaping prisoners. He's going blind as it turns out, my guess would be from untreated glaucoma. It's nice to see Donald Pleasance for once as a nice guy on the screen. His death due in part to his incipient blindness is also a moving one.Charles Bronson is also another foreign volunteer for the RAF, from Poland as befitting Bronson who is of Polish origin. He's the tunnel digger who suffers from claustrophobia and his scenes are primarily with British teen idol John Leyton. This was another of a long series of great character roles for Bronson on his way to stardom.James Coburn shows that like Robert Mitchum, he too had a good ear for accents. His Aussie speech pattern is as good as Mitchum's was in The Sundowners.The Germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally. Robert Graf is the not too bright corporal who isn't exactly happy to be at war, but is grateful he ain't serving in Russia. He gets unmercifully conned by Garner. Hannes Messemer is the commandant of the POW camp, an officer in the Luftwaffe. The prisoners are nearly all RAF officers and enlisted men and the Luftwaffe is in charge of the camp. Messemer is as fearful of the S.S. and the Gestapo as his prisoners are. He's also as very conscious of the atrocities those worthy organizations are capable of and my favorite scene in the film is him having to tell of one to the Senior British officer in the camp, James Donald. Messemer is conscious also of his failure to watch the basket of rotten eggs put in his charge very closely.The Great Escape does the one essential thing for a movie to do, it moves. Even in just the scenes of planning and preparation you are aware of movement. I mentioned Elmer Bernstein's film score. It's one of Bernstein's best, maybe one of the best known of any film in cinema history. The Great Escape is one of those films you can watch dozens of times and never tire of. It's a wonderful film, a real tribute to the best in mankind under some of the worst circumstances.",we intend watch this basket very closely,great escape tells amazing story whole bunch allied prisoners who accomplish mass breakout during world war ii some whom actually did make it freedom allied armed forces once again film is so good that you do not mind fact that some american players were tossed into story as real story was one accomplished by british insure that american movie public would be buying tickets several american players got into great escape charles bronson james coburn pair american tv cowboys just breaking into big screen star status james garner steve mcqueen were put film director john sturges had worked with mcqueen coburn bronson his last film magnificent seven sturges does grand job never letting his audiences attention flag one minute this almost three hour length film what nazis have done this film is build brand new prison camp have put all perennial escape artists this one course by doing so whole lot talented escape artists one place organized effort is led by richard attenborough without going overboard into whole lot flag waving sturges attenborough give us portrayal deeply patriotic man who if he cant back into fight himself is going do what he can pow camp bedevil people making war his country he leads mass escape attempt with almost corporate efficiency opposite course is steve mcqueen ive always thought captain virgil hills as ultimate steve mcqueen role individualism he flight officer angus lennie are going get out no matter what their own or with group angus lennie is former jockey now raf flight officer his death amidst fourth july party that mcqueen garner jud taylor have is one most moving scenes ever put film mcqueen decides play team after that great escape allowed mcqueen indulge one his hobbies motorcycling his race through german country side stolen nazi uniform motorcycle is spectacular one aided abetted by elmer bernsteins magnificent film score james garner bonds with donald pleasance film garner is american raf eagle squadron americans who couldnt wait their own country get into war who enlisted raf lot garners tv character bret maverick is his role as hendley scrounger con artist pleasance is his room mate shy bird watcher who does work forging documents escaping prisoners hes going blind as it turns out my guess would be untreated glaucoma its nice see donald pleasance once as nice guy screen his death due part his incipient blindness is also moving one charles bronson is also another foreign volunteer raf poland as befitting bronson who is polish origin hes tunnel digger who suffers claustrophobia his scenes are primarily with british teen idol john leyton this was another long series great character roles bronson his way stardom james coburn shows that like robert mitchum he too had good ear accents his aussie speech pattern is as good as mitchums was sundowners germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally robert graf is not too bright corporal who isnt exactly happy be at war but is grateful he aint serving russia he gets unmercifully conned by garner hannes messemer is commandant pow camp officer luftwaffe prisoners are nearly all raf officers enlisted men luftwaffe is charge camp messemer is as fearful s s gestapo as his prisoners are hes also as very conscious atrocities those worthy organizations are capable my favorite scene film is him having tell one senior british officer camp james donald messemer is conscious also his failure watch basket rotten eggs put his charge very closely great escape does one essential thing movie do it moves even just scenes planning preparation you are aware movement i mentioned elmer bernsteins film score its one bernsteins best maybe one best known any film cinema history great escape is one those films you can watch dozens times never tire its wonderful film real tribute best mankind under some worst circumstances,0.4671650717703349,0.2510925039872408,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,"If you're going to critique the history, then know the history.","I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is. It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part, very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see ""Hart's War"" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).All in all, ""The Great Escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",if youre going critique history then know history,i find it difficult believe that some reviewers negative reactions this film are based their misguided beliefs that none this could possibly have happened comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people dont know about history is appalling if you are going judge film based historical fact it helps if you know what it is it is well documented what amazing technical feats pows were able accomplish stalags there was even entire section british secret service dedicated coming up with all sorts clever ways send these captured men tools they needed facilitate their escape attempts i e sandwiching maps between split sides record album yes germans allowed prisoners have records camps or compasses pens at colditz castle one more forbidding stalags actually offlag since is was officers only many many tunnels were dug disguises created one man actually created german sergeants uniform totally scratch donned moustache created overall impersonation so realistic it fooled two out three sets sentries some pows built concealed entire glider that would have carried two men off roof over wall only reason it didnt fly was because prison was liberated before they got chance colditz experience is well documented there are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs including one by german officer confirming these amazing escapes attempts reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly mother invention should look them learn something as prisoners not being jumpsuits as suggested by one reviewer as one reason question authenticity film ludicrous pows wore what they were captured german military different gestapo ss considered them soldiers allowed them keep their badges rank as film itself it is long but absorbing there are historical flaws as there are all movies but several former pows participated filming process keeping it most part very authentic as emphasis americans its true they were not among escapees per se but several did assist effort before they were transferred out as mentioned by previous reviewer however you must remember that movie was made american audience 1963 long before international distribution revenue became so important studios bottom line they needed american stars who would appeal american audience who knows perhaps if they were remake it today cast would be all british german but i doubt it see harts war where not only plot but all british canadian characters that were book disappeared all all great escape is entertaining movie telling fascinating story what ordinary men can achieve adverse circumstances its well worth time,0.44083333333333335,0.11055555555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.53}"
10.0,"Not just great, simply magnificent more like!","""Wait a minute, you aren't seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there, and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need""Smart, witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges, The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score to never let the blood settle, and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type, in fact one of the best films ever.Sturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.The cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.A wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with the action and suspense laden plot. 10/10",not just great simply magnificent more like,wait minute you arent seriously suggesting that if i get thru wire case everything out there dont get picked up turn myself get thrown cooler couple months so you can get information you need smart witty directed with adroit hands by john sturges great escape is standing test time as joyous multi cast family favourite based real accounts allied soldiers escaping en mass german pow camp back 1942 film is involving start finish due main wonderful array characters show we follow them moment they arrive at camp right through stunning climax it is with great joy i say that none cast lets side down they all do great work astute undervalued sturges number great set pieces align with elmer bernsteins fabulous score never let blood settle among cheeky slices humour is palpable tension make this simply one best films its type fact one best films ever sturges his writers james clavell w r burnett adapt book written by paul brickhill someone who speaks experience having been one prisoners super pow camp stalag luft iii which course is what great escape is born sturges was fascinated by story after trying without fail over decade get it onto screen he finally succeeded success three years earlier his star ensemble western magnificent seven enabled sturges realise his vision result which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year cast is made up notable thespians iconic heroes steve mcqueen enticing american audience one feels richard attenborough charles bronson james donald donald pleasance james coburn james garner david mccallum john leyton gordon jackson which course is pretty tidy roll call but input impact hannes messemer as camp commandant colonel von luger should not be understated his scenes have real humanistic quality that shows softer side germany one ruled by certain despot finale here offering up counter opposite war writers smartly rightly not tarring nation with same old brush wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart bed with action suspense laden plot 10 10,0.5248903024413228,0.3434129929027888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,"A vast, multi-star war epic with great score by Elmer Bernstein...","'The Great Escape' had the advantage of a fine source, and a fine script... Each actor realizes his potential in a very detailed manner, giving a feeling lost in the actual cinema...Sturges is careful with the pace in the first half, allowing the escape plans develop slowly... Humor, excitement and human drama are wonderfully blended, and smartly underscored by Elmer Bernstein's memorable background music... The film opens with several truckloads of Allied officers, mostly pilots, being transferred to a new German maximum-security prison camp at Sagan... The Camp 'Kommandant', Von Luger (Hannes Messemer), tells Captain Ramsey (James Donald), 'We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.'But since all the British and American officers in his charge are men who have made several attempts to escape from other prison camps, Von Luger knows his words are meaningless... The master planner is 'Big X,' Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), who has just endured three months of Gestapo/SS torture, and plans to strike back, getting as many men as possible out of the camp, in order to 'harass, confuse and confound the enemy' behind the lines...He announces a terrific plan for a mass break-out of 250 men and schemes three simultaneous tunnels Tom, Dick, and Harry... The plan, so precise, proceeds in an orderly fashion, with a great deal of attention placed on caution and ruse to deflect German attentions... The captives involve themselves in much surface activity, which masks the underground work... Hilts (Steve McQuenn), the 'Cooler King,' leads the Germans on a memorable motorcycle chase through back roads and across the fields right up to the Swiss frontier...Hendley (James Garner), the 'Scrounger' is a charming thief whose particular gift is the misappropriation of all the required supplies for an escape...Blythe (Donald Pleasance) has the talents of a 'Forger', and makes visas and passports... He suggests in one scene: ' Tea without milk is so uncivilized.'Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is the experienced Polish-American 'Tunnel-King.' Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn) is the 'Manufacturer' of bellows-operated ventilation...Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) is the 'Dispersal' with his ingenious methods of getting rid of the dirt generated by the tunneling activities... Andy McDonald (Gordon Jackson ) is 'Intelligence,' the officer who develops a fantastic security system to protect the compounds from the German ""Ferrets."" Archibald Ives (Angus Lennie) is the 'Mole,' whose fragile mind has been taxed by several years in the camps, repeated failed escape attempts, and time in the cooler...Dennis Cavendish (Nigel Stock) is the 'Surveyor' who miscalculates the distance to the trees...Guard Werner (Robert Graf) is the 'Ferret' who affirms to Hendley: 'I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.' 'The Great Escape' is a pretty good motion picture where the toll of freedom is precious, and the movie's ending provokes deep and serious meditation...

10.0,The Great Movie,"The Germans, ""with madness in their method"" have taken every captured flier who has made repeated attempts to escape and put them in a POW camp which they have devised to be inescapable. Under the supervision of Richard Attenborough, they immediately begin to dig tunnels to break out 250 men.There are anhistorical elements here. There were four tunnels dug, not the three in the movie; the date of the escape was changed; most notably, several American flyers took part in the breakout. While Americans did take part in the planning and construction, they had been moved to a different camp by the time of the event. This was an American film, and director John Sturges had been trying to get this project off the ground for the better part of a decade before he and the Mirisches got United Artists to foot the bill, so James Garner, Steve McQueen, and Charles Bronson (as a Pole) got major roles. UA also wanted a shorter running time, and some women, which Sturges was able to resist.It's a great, gripping blend of suspense and thrills, with some pawky humor thrown in, and a canny shift in camerawork. The first two-thirds, with its closed-in spaces sustains an element of oppression, culminating with the breakout, at night in the confined space of the tunnel. This is followed by brightly lit and open vistas as the escapees make their ways towards freedom. Because Sturges had directed THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the remake of Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, I thought for many years this dichotomy was taken from Kurosawa's HIGH AND LOW. However, the latter picture was released four months after Sturges'.170 minutes is a very long time for a feature film, and this was undoubtedly released in a road show version with an intermission. The natural place for a break would be right after the Germans discover the primary tunnel. Nowadays, when I watch this, I can take a break whenever I like. Even knowing how it comes out, it's a struggle to stop the movie at any point.",great movie,germans with madness their method have taken every captured flier who has made repeated attempts escape put them pow camp which they have devised be inescapable under supervision richard attenborough they immediately begin dig tunnels break out 250 men there are anhistorical elements here there were four tunnels dug not three movie date escape was changed most notably several american flyers took part breakout while americans did take part planning construction they had been moved different camp by time event this was american film director john sturges had been trying get this project off ground better part decade before he mirisches got united artists foot bill so james garner steve mcqueen charles bronson as pole got major roles ua also wanted shorter running time some women which sturges was able resist its great gripping blend suspense thrills with some pawky humor thrown canny shift camerawork first two thirds with its closed spaces sustains element oppression culminating with breakout at night confined space tunnel this is followed by brightly lit open vistas as escapees make their ways towards freedom because sturges had directed magnificent seven remake kurosawas seven samurai i thought many years this dichotomy was taken kurosawas high low however latter picture was released four months after sturges 170 minutes is very long time feature film this was undoubtedly released road show version with intermission natural place break would be right after germans discover primary tunnel nowadays when i watch this i can take break whenever i like even knowing how it comes out its struggle stop movie at any point,0.46891865079365075,0.2872172619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...,"I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love ""The Great Escape"" as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.I could review the film at length, but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting, really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find.

9.0,A genuine timeless classic.,"During World War Two the Germans build a new prison camp, Stalag Luft III, for the express purpose of housing many of their most troublesome captured Allied airmen. However, all this serves to do is to pool the resources of some of the most ingenious escape artists in captivity and fill them with a resolve to engineer a mass breakout from the camp.  Based largely on real events, this film has assumed classic status over the years and its easy to understand why. Quite simply, it excells in many departments. Director John Sturges was at the height of his creative powers and he keeps a firm grip on the proceedings. Although the film runs close to three hours it never feels sluggish, while at the same time winding up the tension gradually and developing the characters. The production design is first rate, to the point where Donald Pleasance (who had been a P.O.W.) felt quite intimidated by the vast set on his arrival. Daniel Fapp's beautiful photography shows this and the picturesque German locations off to full effect. Put these virtues together with a good script, inspired casting and a classic score by Elmer Bernstein, and you have an object lesson in how to create an intelligent and exciting big budget adventure film.  On the subject of the cast; Much is made of Steve McQueen's role. While I am a huge McQueen fan, I feel that some of the other performances are equal to, if not better than his. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and Gordon Jackson are all excellent. Good too are James Coburn, James Donald, David McCallum and Hannes Messemer as the sympathetic Commandant.  This is one of those films that I can happily watch time and time again. In September of this year a new print was screened at the NFT in London as part of an 'Attenborough at 80' season. It was a pleasure to see this on the big screen at last. For the most part the print was in very good condition. The DVD was one of the first that I ever bought some three and a half years ago, and I watched its inevitable Christmas screening on BBC2 last night. I just never tire of it.

,We Choose the Cooler,"Spoilers herein.Films are like people in the respect that some are leaders but most followers. That's because most movies are not about life, but about previous movies. This film established not only a genre (I chose to resee it after `Chicken Run') but played a role in inventing a society. I'm of the belief that culture invents some art that in turn reinvents the culture. More about that in a minute.What's so special about this is that it places the American rebel (with his motorcycle) in mainstream American society. Before, the beatnik or `bohemian' was unamerican, nonmainstream. This film invents memories of the war for the generation after the war -- it takes an essentially British story and uses it as background to establish a new vision of the American rebel. This rebel is centrally American, heroic even. Independent of sex.There are four forces in this film. The evil Gestapo (with the majority of Germans, but the film glosses that); the two forces of the British and German Air Force stuck in a duel of gallantry from a prior generation; and then the McQueen force. All at once, we have the cockiness and independence of Brando and Dean transformed into a patriotic center, into something directed, seemingly casually, against intrinsic evil.I saw an advance screening of this in most peculiar circumstances. I was a cadet in a midwestern military academy whose commandant was the senior American officer at the POW camp during the planning of the escape. (Americans were moved shortly before, and the reason is an interesting story in itself.) We 850 mostly sons of republicans mostly hawks, all white were given a vision of necessary disturbance, of a strange patriot that we couldn't internalize. Only a couple months later JFK was murdered. The Cooler King was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide to reinvent ourselves. Check it out. This contributed to a national identity that actually lived for a while. Never plan to win, just make your own statement.Attenborough knows something about manipulating the British image for American consumption. His `Ghandi' is a masterpiece of posture. Talent. Sturges' camera is quiet, still, non-modern, so that you lose awareness that this is a film. This stance is dated -- wouldn't work today, and makes things feel as of a different era. Attenborough's camera sweeps (see his short episode -- the Indian sequence -- in `Close Encounters.') Attenborough's acting style here (indeed his role too) mirrors that. It is a fulcrum of everything, a subliminal sweep under Sturges' stillness.Check out the score by Bernstein. If you take out just a little of the march tempo, you have Williams' copy for Indiana Jones. Indy echoed the tone for a by that time narcissistic notion of rebellion: mystical forces of evil accommodated by selfish acquisition and pathetic self-deprecation -- the Reagan American. Williams intended to quote Bernstein to make this point, I think.If you haven't seen it yet, look for the Cooler guard. His hesitation at the end is priceless, indicating that every soul is malleable. It is why the film wasn't made for eight years, bombed when it came out, but is now in the IMDB top 100.",we choose cooler,spoilers herein films are like people respect that some are leaders but most followers thats because most movies are not about life but about previous movies this film established not only genre i chose resee it after chicken run but played role inventing society im belief that culture invents some art that turn reinvents culture more about that minute whats so special about this is that it places american rebel with his motorcycle mainstream american society before beatnik or bohemian was unamerican nonmainstream this film invents memories war generation after war it takes essentially british story uses it as background establish new vision american rebel this rebel is centrally american heroic even independent sex there are four forces this film evil gestapo with majority germans but film glosses that two forces british german air force stuck duel gallantry prior generation then mcqueen force all at once we have cockiness independence brando dean transformed into patriotic center into something directed seemingly casually against intrinsic evil i saw advance screening this most peculiar circumstances i was cadet midwestern military academy whose commandant was senior american officer at pow camp during planning escape americans were moved shortly before reason is interesting story itself we 850 mostly sons republicans mostly hawks all white were given vision necessary disturbance strange patriot that we couldnt internalize only couple months later jfk was murdered cooler king was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide reinvent ourselves check it out this contributed national identity that actually lived while never plan win just make your own statement attenborough knows something about manipulating british image american consumption his ghandi is masterpiece posture talent sturges camera is quiet still non modern so that you lose awareness that this is film this stance is dated wouldnt work today makes things feel as different era attenboroughs camera sweeps see his short episode indian sequence close encounters attenboroughs acting style here indeed his role too mirrors that it is fulcrum everything subliminal sweep under sturges stillness check out score by bernstein if you take out just little march tempo you have williams copy indiana jones indy echoed tone by that time narcissistic notion rebellion mystical forces evil accommodated by selfish acquisition pathetic self deprecation reagan american williams intended quote bernstein make this point i think if you havent seen it yet look cooler guard his hesitation at end is priceless indicating that every soul is malleable it is why film wasnt made eight years bombed when it came out but is now imdb top 100,0.4272623210123211,0.030564227439227445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,Heroes underground.,"I imagine it was the lengthy running time that kept me for so many years from seeing The Great Escape, although that doesn't explain why I haven't seen hordes of other movies. But I've been going back and watching all the old classics and The Great Escape is one of the best ones I've seen so far. The movie is not only wildly entertaining throughout it's nearly three hour duration, but shows some actors who went on to become famous for other roles in decades and generations to come. Granted, I am speaking from the perspective of a different generation of moviegoers, which is why I know Charles Bronson more from Death Wish than this film, or James Coburn from films like Payback and Affliction, Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis and Richard Attenborough as John Hammond from the Jurassic Park films.I think the thing I loved the most about the movie was how open everyone was about their plans to escape. Not that they tried to escape out in the open, but they made no effort to hide the fact that they were analyzing their surroundings, trying to find a way to get out. As we soon learn, it is their sworn duty as captured officers to consistently try to escape and, failing that, to make life as confusing and frustrating as humanly possible for their captors. The story involves a lot of British officers being held captive by the Germans, at a prison where all of the most consistent escapers have been compiled for special supervision. When the prisoners arrive at the beginning of the movie, many of them, including Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) walk into the gates and then immediately walk to the fences around the outsides of the compound, looking up and down the length of the fences, studying where the guard towers are, looking in broad daylight for ways to escape.What follows is a brilliant competition between the proud British officers being held captive and the Germans guarding them, as the British make every attempt to escape and receive minimal punishment when they're caught. 20 days in the cooler for a failed escape attempt (doubled from only 10 for mouthing off) is pretty light compared to what I would have expected POWs to have suffered at the hands of the Nazis in World War II.Because the escapes are only hidden during their preparations, there are portions of The Great Escape that play almost like a sports movie more than a war film, because of the atmosphere of competition and, among other things, there is so much comic relief, One of my favorite scenes is the one where they first begin digging under the floor in their bunker. Danny Velinski (Bronson) is under the floor digging away when the Germans march in for a surprise inspection, and he jumps out, they put the cover back on the hole and smear clay around it and then pour water into it, one guy starts mopping the floor, everyone else goes back to playing cards or milling about, and Velinski hops in the shower, and the suspicious officers come in and demand to know what they're each doing. The guy mopping explains that he's mopping, Velinski says he needed a wash, and Louis Sedgwick (Coburn), says about Velinski, ""I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard!""It's also a great scene when Hilts (McQueen) tells Bartlett (Attenborough) and the other officer his plan for escape. Steve McQueen is the star of the movie but spends most of it pretty much out of the loop. He was in the cooler when the plans for the great escape were first hatched, so when he finally got out most of the camp was involved in planning this epic breakout, and Hilts comes up to Bartlett and one other officer and gleefully tells them about his and Ives' nutty plan to burrow three feet down and dig straight out, sticking metal tubes through the ground to the surface so they can breathe. Bartlett and the other officer leave both of them out of the plans for the time being, for reasons that are explained later in the film.The movie is expertly written, with outstanding dialogue and even better performances and direction that I like to think is still inspiring filmmakers throughout the world. I learned from another reviewer on the IMDb that the music is almost competing within itself, with different instruments representing the British and the Germans, so I was watching for it when I watched the movie. Not only is the different music representative of the two opposing sides, but it does it within scenes and even within individual shots. Consider, for example, the scene where Hilts and Ives are first brought into the cooler. The music is almost reacting to what is going on on screen, like it's trying to describe where each character is within the frame. That is true film-making brilliance. The movie ends with a massive setback, a tremendous downturn in tone, but does so without turning into a tragedy or overshadowing everything else that has gone on before that and, most importantly, while remaining true to the real life story. It displays the pride and determination of British military as well as was done in The Bridge on the River Kwai, and that is a major accomplishment.

,GREAT MOVIE: MORE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE THAN SOME REALIZE...,"This is a great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit for. So many who say otherwise are ill-informed and obviously don't know much about the actual history of that actual escape. The depiction of what happened to the recaptured prisoners in the movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE is reasonably accurate as detailed on the historyinfilm site...specifically on the ""Reprisal"" page; along with being detailed in the various published accounts.Hitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by Goering, Feldmarschall Keitel, Maj-Gen Graevenitz and Maj-Gen Westhoff, and dictated that more than half the prisoners be shot and cremated. So, as depicted in the film, several of those recaptured were not executed and were indeed returned to confinement. In fact, even those executed were not ""shot on the spot"" for the most part, but were actually executed later after being turned over to the Gestapo; most being shot while being allowed to relieve themselves, under the guise of ""trying to escape"".Furthermore, there are many accounts as to how much more humane the environment was within the camp (which even had a popular and very successful theatre, featuring prisoners who would later be name performers) than many other POW camps...and certainly nothing like the harsh conditions associated with the Concentration or Extermination camps.To quote one source:""It must be made clear that the German Luftwaffe [the German Air Force], who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war, maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers, and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo. The Luftwaffe treated the POWs well, despite an erratic and inconsistent supply of food.Prisoners were handled quite fairly within the Geneva Convention, and the Kommandant, Oberst (Colonel) Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, was a professional and honourable soldier who won the respect of the senior prisoners.""Finally, virtually all the major engineering aspects in regards to the tunnels and the initial escape in the film are as they were actually acheived in the real escape.It would behoove some to learn a little more actual history or do a little simple research before shooting from the hip with supposed ""knowledge"" of reality. THE GREAT ESCAPE certainly takes liberties in tone and character portrayal, but not in the key elements that are disparaged out of sneering ignorance.BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also a great film, but took even greater liberties with the technical details of the events described than THE GREAT ESCAPE did....and offering up VON RYAN'S EXPRESS as a more realistic alternative is simply delusional and ridiculous.",great movie more historically accurate than some realize,this is great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit so many who say otherwise are ill informed obviously dont know much about actual history that actual escape depiction what happened recaptured prisoners movie great escape is reasonably accurate as detailed historyinfilm site specifically reprisal page along with being detailed various published accounts hitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by goering feldmarschall keitel maj gen graevenitz maj gen westhoff dictated that more than half prisoners be shot cremated so as depicted film several those recaptured were not executed were indeed returned confinement fact even those executed were not shot spot most part but were actually executed later after being turned over gestapo most being shot while being allowed relieve themselves under guise trying escape furthermore there are many accounts as how much more humane environment was within camp which even had popular very successful theatre featuring prisoners who would later be name performers than many other pow camps certainly nothing like harsh conditions associated with concentration or extermination camps quote one source it must be made clear that german luftwaffe who were responsible air force prisoners war maintained degree professional respect fellow flyers general attitude camp security officers guards should not be confused with ss or gestapo luftwaffe treated pows well despite erratic inconsistent supply food prisoners were handled quite fairly within geneva convention kommandant oberst colonel friedrich wilhelm von lindeiner wildau was professional honourable soldier who won respect senior prisoners finally virtually all major engineering aspects regards tunnels initial escape film are as they were actually acheived real escape it would behoove some learn little more actual history or do little simple research before shooting hip with supposed knowledge reality great escape certainly takes liberties tone character portrayal but not key elements that are disparaged out sneering ignorance bridge river kwai is also great film but took even greater liberties with technical details events described than great escape did offering up von ryans express as more realistic alternative is simply delusional ridiculous,0.4899119543650795,0.22542472718253964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.58}"

10.0,One of the all time great war movies,"I cannot dislike The Great Escape, with its great cast, anthem-like music score and of course its attention to detail. The film is brilliantly shot with beautiful cinematography, and of course the music score is great, very iconic. It may be a little annoying to some people, as the theme is repeated over and over again, but there is something triumphant about it so I find it hard not to like it. The script is great, but it is the cast and the attention to detail that sticks in the mind. This escape yarn has everything from collapsing tunnels, probing searchlights to the classic movie image of Hilts attempting to escape to freedom on a motorbike. And then there are the characters, for example we have Donald Pleasence's timid forger, James Garner's smooth-talking scrounger and most obviously Steve McQueen's super cool Captain Virgil Hilts. Garner, Pleasence, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough and Charles Bronson fit their parts perfectly, but for me it is McQueen's movie.

3.0,Off in tone,"This film may be based on true events and for that the people it's based on have my utmost respect, but this dramatization felt incredibly phony. It's true from the moment the Allied soldiers arrive, are allowed to mill around, and one grabs the top bunk in his sleeping quarters with the glee of a kid arriving at summer camp. There's no feeling that they are worn down, demoralized, or scared for having been in the hell of war and are now captured - they're all squeaky clean in their normal uniforms (not prison attire), show a lot of bravado, and sass the German officers, who are in turn only a slight step above the hapless Colonel Klink from the old TV show Hogan's Heroes. There is no menace or violence from the German guards, and the demeanor and dialogue from everyone rings false. Steve McQueen breaks out his baseball mitt and starts tossing a ball around for Christ sake! I like him in other films but he's awful here, and he's not alone. A dapper, freshly coifed James Garner shares a cigarette and light small talk with an amiable German guard before picking his pocket. A jug of moonshine is made and an American flag is raised before a patriotic parade with fife and drum is led around the compound. It's all ridiculous (true story, bulls***!).The tone John Sturges gave us here is meant to entertain and perhaps to honor the bravery of these men (note: the vast majority of whom were not actually Americans), but I think it badly missed and did them a disservice, glamorizing war and underrepresenting the severity of the conditions they faced.Eventually things turn more serious, and that's at about the 90 minute point of this very bloated film. Even then, with a guy gunned down trying to go over the wall, the scene is played so cartoonishly it was hard to feel a deep emotional impact. When the actual escape goes down at around the 2 hour point, Charles Bronson's character (the Polish soldier, of course not an American), a guy who's dug all sorts of escape tunnels, gets anxious with claustrophobia. Later Steve McQueen goes motorcycling off through the beautiful scenery in Bavaria. Is that because it happened, e.g. consistent with ""every detail of the escape is the way it really happened"" as the opening credits claim? No, it's because the Hollywood actor wanted to show off his motorcycling ability. It's just one damn annoying scene after another, set to jaunty music that says ""yay, we're busting out, isn't this a great adventure!"" Why put all this extra crap in there? The real, unvarnished story would have been compelling on its own. The film seems to try to make up for this at the end with the pathos of German retaliation, but it's too little, too late. The German officer is actually apologetic over it, reporting the news of 50 deaths to an Allied officer as if he was a schoolboy confessing a misdeed to his father. Good grief.",off tone,this film may be based true events that people its based have my utmost respect but this dramatization felt incredibly phony its true moment allied soldiers arrive are allowed mill around one grabs top bunk his sleeping quarters with glee kid arriving at summer camp theres no feeling that they are worn down demoralized or scared having been hell war are now captured theyre all squeaky clean their normal uniforms not prison attire show lot bravado sass german officers who are turn only slight step above hapless colonel klink old tv show hogans heroes there is no menace or violence german guards demeanor dialogue everyone rings false steve mcqueen breaks out his baseball mitt starts tossing ball around christ sake i like him other films but hes awful here hes not alone dapper freshly coifed james garner shares cigarette light small talk with amiable german guard before picking his pocket jug moonshine is made american flag is raised before patriotic parade with fife drum is led around compound its all ridiculous true story bulls tone john sturges gave us here is meant entertain perhaps honor bravery these men note vast majority whom were not actually americans but i think it badly missed did them disservice glamorizing war underrepresenting severity conditions they faced eventually things turn more serious thats at about 90 minute point this very bloated film even then with guy gunned down trying go over wall scene is played so cartoonishly it was hard feel deep emotional impact when actual escape goes down at around 2 hour point charles bronsons character polish soldier course not american guy whos dug all sorts escape tunnels gets anxious with claustrophobia later steve mcqueen goes motorcycling off through beautiful scenery bavaria is that because it happened e g consistent with every detail escape is way it really happened as opening credits claim no its because hollywood actor wanted show off his motorcycling ability its just one damn annoying scene after another set jaunty music that says yay were busting out isnt this great adventure why put all this extra crap there real unvarnished story would have been compelling its own film seems try make up this at end with pathos german retaliation but its too little too late german officer is actually apologetic over it reporting news 50 deaths allied officer as if he was schoolboy confessing misdeed his father good grief,0.46666666666666673,0.0019396551724137825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Outstanding Entertainment,"Credit should be given to the brilliant score by Elmer Bernstein. If you listen to it closely, it literally is a battle between the Allied Prisoners (flutes & woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas). The escape scenes with the little boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and his heroic Germanic Operas. The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps is breathtaking. I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism, humor, and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement of what is essentially a cruel and tragic story. As a child growing up in the seventies, our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and we had the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisoner from that era. He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape, but was placed on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was on surviving the war and going home alive.",outstanding entertainment,credit should be given brilliant score by elmer bernstein if you listen it closely it literally is battle between allied prisoners flutes woodwinds germans tubas escape scenes with little boat scenic german river is evocative wagner his heroic germanic operas scenery german countryside alps is breathtaking i believe that scriptwriters emphasized heroism humor character prisoners make uplifting statement what is essentially cruel tragic story as child growing up seventies our 7th grade glass was reading paul brickhill book we had opportunity meet former american stalag luft iii prisoner that era he had arrived at camp after great escape but was placed monument detail 50 executed men he said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident emphasis was surviving war going home alive,0.5294444444444445,0.10194444444444443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.05, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.45}"
5.0,Hogan Never Had It So Good,"This film had a stellar cast, and most of them delivered. The score was unusually cheerful and eerie, too. A strange combination. In reality, allied POW's in German detention camps were treated with contempt and without mercy. What we have in this film, however, are a bunch of guys who act like they belong in a country club. The country club/summer camp they reside in is a fun place, except you'll get shot if they catch you climbing the fence. That's it - no mention of the terrible brutality these guys actually endured or the fact that they were given barely enough food to live on. No mention of the atrocities regularly visited upon them by their Nazi captors, including beatings, executions, and forced marches. Instead, we get gentlemanly or comical Germans who seem to actually care what the POW's think of them.James Garner's character seems to epitomize the relaxed country club type who seems to be on vacation. He never takes off his turtleneck, which, no doubt, would cause the average person to perspire and stink after awhile. Steve McQueen, as usual, was the coolest guy in the room, but why would the Nazis allow him to have a baseball and glove to keep himself amused while in solitary confinement? Why didn't they just shoot him or beat the hell out of him after he was captured? Instead, they treated him like a naughty school boy. Richard Attenborough turned in a fine performance, but in reality, the Nazis would have never allowed him to take such a leadership role among the other prisoners. They would have singled him out and broken him instead of giving him respect.The film had many powerful moments: the motorcycle chase, the fatal error on the bus, the massacre, the shooting of the fence climber....these were all extremely well done. The film ultimately failed, though, because it did a disservice to the men who actually lived through this by failing to convey the wretched conditions of a German POW camp.The film had many moments where you had to suspend reality for such banal situations. Why in the world would the Nazis have ever allowed the Americans to hold a 4th of July celebration that include a parade, a picnic, and free-flowing vodka? Why would they allow a still on the premises to make homemade vodka from potatoes? Where did the Americans find a large American flag and why were they allowed to run it up a flagpole? Where did they find the smaller 13-star flag to wave around? Wasn't it out of character for Hilts to suddenly become a master flutist, blowing out a flawless rendition of ""Yankee Doodle""? Colonel Klink would never have allowed Hogan and the boys such privileges! I'm surprised the Nazi guards didn't bake them cookies! What about when Hilts took out the planks from the bunkbeds (all of them) to use to reinforce the tunnel? The beds were now unusable, but the Germans didn't seem to notice all the guys sleeping on the floor, I guess. I could go on and on about these lapses in reality and this is why I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone over the age of 11. Add to this the 1960's film making habit of over illuminating all indoor scenes to the point where it seems like the actors need to wear sunglasses, and you have a very poor rendering of a POW camp. Was I the only one who noticed that the interactions and dialogue of these impeccably dressed and well-groomed men seemed like the goings-on in an upscale gay social club?",hogan never had it so good,this film had stellar cast most them delivered score was unusually cheerful eerie too strange combination reality allied pows german detention camps were treated with contempt without mercy what we have this film however are bunch guys who act like they belong country club country club summer camp they reside is fun place except youll get shot if they catch you climbing fence thats it no mention terrible brutality these guys actually endured or fact that they were given barely enough food live no mention atrocities regularly visited upon them by their nazi captors including beatings executions forced marches instead we get gentlemanly or comical germans who seem actually care what pows think them james garners character seems epitomize relaxed country club type who seems be vacation he never takes off his turtleneck which no doubt would cause average person perspire stink after awhile steve mcqueen as usual was coolest guy room but why would nazis allow him have baseball glove keep himself amused while solitary confinement why didnt they just shoot him or beat hell out him after he was captured instead they treated him like naughty school boy richard attenborough turned fine performance but reality nazis would have never allowed him take such leadership role among other prisoners they would have singled him out broken him instead giving him respect film had many powerful moments motorcycle chase fatal error bus massacre shooting fence climber these were all extremely well done film ultimately failed though because it did disservice men who actually lived through this by failing convey wretched conditions german pow camp film had many moments where you had suspend reality such banal situations why world would nazis have ever allowed americans hold 4th july celebration that include parade picnic free flowing vodka why would they allow still premises make homemade vodka potatoes where did americans find large american flag why were they allowed run it up flagpole where did they find smaller 13 star flag wave around wasnt it out character hilts suddenly become master flutist blowing out flawless rendition yankee doodle colonel klink would never have allowed hogan boys such privileges im surprised nazi guards didnt bake them cookies what about when hilts took out planks bunkbeds all them use reinforce tunnel beds were now unusable but germans didnt seem notice all guys sleeping floor i guess i could go about these lapses reality this is why i wouldnt recommend this film anyone over age 11 add this 1960s film making habit over illuminating all indoor scenes point where it seems like actors need wear sunglasses you have very poor rendering pow camp was i only one who noticed that interactions dialogue these impeccably dressed well groomed men seemed like goings upscale gay social club,0.4987788660614747,0.0608112177677395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,All Time Favorite,"Based on a true story, ""The Great Escape"" is one of the greatest movies ever filmed. Directed by the genius John Sturges and starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and one the most talented ensemble casts ever assembled, the film does not have any weak parts. From the almost authentic reproduction of an actual NAZIS prison camp set, to the great score from Elmer Bernstein and excellent performances by the cast, this movie gets 100 out of 100 stars, hands down.The World War II action/adventure story, deals with POW's who devise an elaborate escape from a German Prisoner of War camp. ""The Great Escape"" will demand your complete attention from start to finish and you will find yourself watching it over and over again!!Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, and many, many more stars, enough words cannot be said?? How the OSCARS voters snubbed this movie in 1963 with only 1 nomination for editing is a complete travesty to this day.",all time favorite,based true story great escape is one greatest movies ever filmed directed by genius john sturges starring steve mcqueen james garner one most talented ensemble casts ever assembled film does not have any weak parts almost authentic reproduction actual nazis prison camp set great score elmer bernstein excellent performances by cast this movie gets 100 out 100 stars hands down world war ii action adventure story deals with pows who devise elaborate escape german prisoner war camp great escape will demand your complete attention start finish you will find yourself watching it over over again steve mcqueen james garner charles bronson james coburn richard attenborough donald pleasance many many more stars enough words cannot be said how oscars voters snubbed this movie 1963 with only 1 nomination editing is complete travesty this day,0.6071256038647342,0.37910628019323667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,Steve McQueen plays Steve McQueen.,"There are only two things wrong with The Great Escape:(1) There was no sequel.(2) I have never figured out how to get my A-2 flight jacket to look as beat up as the one worn by Virgil Hilts.McQueen personifies the American Air Force officer in WW2. He is a strong individualist, put off by Mickey Mouse discipline but has put up with it in order to fly. Yet when faced with a political and moral challenge- escaping from a POW camp, or harassing the enemy, both to maintain his dignity and continue the fight, he shows an inner discipline and strong team player mentality.McQueen's own military experience shows though here and gives real depth and credibility to his character (despite his arrogance, Hilts addresses the German Commandant by ending each response with ""Ya Voll, Herr Oberst"" [Yes sir, My colonel]. As he passes the Senior British Officer [SBO] in the last scene, he nods and acknowledges his superior officer with a simple ""...sir""). These are traits of an experienced soldier, not an actor reading lines. McQueen plays his role this way throughout the movie.Like every other McQueen fan, I keep watching the film again and again, because I know if I do he will eventually jump the motorcycle over the barbed wire fence and head off to freedom.(Note: The character Hilts was based upon was an OSS agent named Sage. Sage eventually did escape from another POW camp later in the war, so even though the bike jump wasn't successful, Hilts was. Somewhat of a consolation).A beautiful Elmer Bernstein sound track is hauntingly choreographed with stunning German Bavarian scenery. John Sturges has assembled his cast of ""usual suspects"": McQueen, Coburn & Bronson from previous war and western flicks. Sir Richard Attenborough is superb as ""Big X"" the escape committee mastermind, and James Garner plays James Garner plays James Garner...as (Bret Maverick) the perennial wise cracking thief and scrounger.Even after nearly 40 years, I still love watching the intro credits roll and the music start...Once the POWs jump down from the trucks I'm absorbed into the plot all over again.",steve mcqueen plays steve mcqueen,there are only two things wrong with great escape 1 there was no sequel 2 i have never figured out how get my 2 flight jacket look as beat up as one worn by virgil hilts mcqueen personifies american air force officer ww2 he is strong individualist put off by mickey mouse discipline but has put up with it order fly yet when faced with political moral challenge escaping pow camp or harassing enemy both maintain his dignity continue fight he shows inner discipline strong team player mentality mcqueens own military experience shows though here gives real depth credibility his character despite his arrogance hilts addresses german commandant by ending each response with ya voll herr oberst as he passes senior british officer last scene he nods acknowledges his superior officer with simple sir these are traits experienced soldier not actor reading lines mcqueen plays his role this way throughout movie like every other mcqueen fan i keep watching film again again because i know if i do he will eventually jump motorcycle over barbed wire fence head off freedom note character hilts was based upon was oss agent named sage sage eventually did escape another pow camp later war so even though bike jump wasnt successful hilts was somewhat consolation beautiful elmer bernstein sound track is hauntingly choreographed with stunning german bavarian scenery john sturges has assembled his cast usual suspects mcqueen coburn bronson previous war western flicks sir richard attenborough is superb as big x escape committee mastermind james garner plays james garner plays james garner as bret maverick perennial wise cracking thief scrounger even after nearly 40 years i still love watching intro credits roll music start once pows jump down trucks im absorbed into plot all over again,0.48576940035273364,0.23804012345679018,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.47}"
