9.0,just superb,"Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it's like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best 'steamed broccoli' (ok, insert your favorite entr√©e) I've ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that's been me with ""Hamilton."" For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn't all that. So, now I'm here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.Unfortunately (because of what I mentioned above) this can't be a comparison of a live stage performance and the film version. Instead, this will briefly outline what I noticed in the movie. First, and I believe this is key, the original stage director Thomas Kail is back to direct the film. It should be noted that the film version is a blend of a couple of recorded live shows, plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited in. This is the original cast doing what they do best, and the edits are imperceptible. Second, the main cast is filled with dynamic performers. In many stage shows, one or two actors are head and shoulders above the others. Not so here. At a minimum the top seven actors are as skilled and fun to watch as any you've seen. Third, this is a true musical in that the songs drive the story. Some of the early songs require serious concentration to catch the lines, but even if you miss some lyrics, the gist of what's happening is pretty clear. These aren't so much catchy sing-along types, but you'll easily recall the scenes when you hear the songs again at a later date. We see a perfect melding of music-performance-story.Of course most everyone knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creative force behind the show. He credits writer Ron Chernow's book on Alexander Hamilton as the inspiration for the production, but it's Mr. Miranda that appeared on every talk show for a couple of years, and he also performs as Alexander Hamilton. Daveed Diggs has dual roles as the flamboyant Marquis de Lafayette and the equally flamboyant (at least here) Thomas Jefferson. Renee Elise Goldsberry takes over the stage with her powerful voice as Angelica Schuyler, and Chris Jackson is a dominating physical presence as George Washington. Jonathan Groff (from ""Mindhunter"") is absolutely hysterical and unforgettable as King George III, both through song and strut. Everyone will have their favorite performers, and truly they are all exceptional, and I'd like to point out the two that took my breath away. Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton has a pristine voice that will bring tears to many eyes. She may not be as involved with the political elements of the story, but in the most emotional moments, she is front and center. Lastly, the passion Leslie Odom Jr brings to his role as Adam Burr is beyond description. He may be the ""villain"", but he makes Burr accessible and easy to understand ... plus Odom is a terrific singer and performer, and he lights up the stage.It's easy to overlook the dance and stage choreography since it's never over-the-top, but the dancers are terrific and the performers make great use of the single set - although props are regularly brought in and taken away. Perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is the expert use of cameras and editing. We see the full stage when we should, and we are offered close-ups when it's most effective. I do hope to catch the live show at some point, but if my Hamilton experience is limited to this cinematic version, well ... ""that would be enough.""",just superb,greetings again darkness you know what its like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened think back pre pandemic then you start hear your friends co workers raving about it best steamed broccoli ok insert your favorite entr e ive ever tasted having been burned many times with high expectations you remain skeptical but make reservation well thats been me with hamilton almost 5 years hype was just too much surely folks were caught up frenzy peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasnt all that so now im here throwing myself at mercy theater gods thanks disney plus i only needed invest little ok lot time rather than few hundred dollars ticket this is me humbly admitting i was wrong show is fantastic i only wish my first viewing had been live performance unfortunately because what i mentioned above this cant be comparison live stage performance film version instead this will briefly outline what i noticed movie first i believe this is key original stage director thomas kail is back direct film it should be noted that film version is blend couple recorded live shows plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited this is original cast doing what they do best edits are imperceptible second main cast is filled with dynamic performers many stage shows one or two actors are head shoulders above others not so here at minimum top seven actors are as skilled fun watch as any youve seen third this is true musical that songs drive story some early songs require serious concentration catch lines but even if you miss some lyrics gist whats happening is pretty clear these arent so much catchy sing along types but youll easily recall scenes when you hear songs again at later date we see perfect melding music performance story course most everyone knows that lin manuel miranda is creative force behind show he credits writer ron chernows book alexander hamilton as inspiration production but its mr miranda that appeared every talk show couple years he also performs as alexander hamilton daveed diggs has dual roles as flamboyant marquis de lafayette equally flamboyant at least here thomas jefferson renee elise goldsberry takes over stage with her powerful voice as angelica schuyler chris jackson is dominating physical presence as george washington jonathan groff mindhunter is absolutely hysterical unforgettable as king george iii both through song strut everyone will have their favorite performers truly they are all exceptional id like point out two that took my breath away phillipa soo as eliza hamilton has pristine voice that will bring tears many eyes she may not be as involved with political elements story but most emotional moments she is front center lastly passion leslie odom jr brings his role as adam burr is beyond description he may be villain but he makes burr accessible easy understand plus odom is terrific singer performer he lights up stage its easy overlook dance stage choreography since its never over top but dancers are terrific performers make great use single set although props are regularly brought taken away perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is expert use cameras editing we see full stage when we should we are offered close ups when its most effective i do hope catch live show at some point but if my hamilton experience is limited this cinematic version well that would be enough,0.5126596053519132,0.19655451691165976,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Blimey!!,"I know a little bit about America's founding fathers. Not a lot, it's not really taught in the UK. That's not important though. Knowing any history to enjoy this I mean, not America's independence. Musicals aren't my thing either and certainly not musical theatre, which this is with several exclamation points. What we have here is the theatre production, filmed, fairly simply. A few camera angles covering the stage, mostly wide to show off a lovely set, occasional close up to, well to provide some variation in the edit, nothing more. This is the thing, it's a show designed to be enjoyed in the room. There's no set camera positions. The camera is normally your eye from your seat. That's not possible right now though, which is why this exists. So it's not a film. It works though and it's undeniably a spectacle. If you don't like singing and dancing, you might think you're buggered. Honestly though, this is pretty top quality singing and dancing, you're in safe hands. It's fast and fun, the energy dialled all the way up. The mix of humour, hip hop and show tunes will make even the most hardened cynic smile. Alright it's gimmicky, actors spitting bars wearing frock-coats, declaring war, but I guess the rules are different in theatre and it's very effective. In film it's often said that if the actors look like they're having too much fun, the audience aren't. I don't think that applies here either, everybody looks to be having the time of their lives and the live audience, that we hear but don't see, seem to be too. It's pretty lengthy, but there's a lot in there, not least a pretty eventful life story. Alexander Hamilton. Rags to revolutionary. A social climbing agitator, with a love of writing and setting up financial institutions. Weddings, duals, adultery, bribery, a bloody big war and a lot of political manoeuvring. The historical content is top line stuff, covering the basics. They're touch points really, never allowing the story to get too dry, but it manages this without dumbing it down too much and the razor sharp humour helps, ""Immigrants we get the job done"". The cast are wonderful. Daveed Diggs as both Lafayette and Jefferson is the standout for me. There are quieter moments, but there's sequences where it's one bombastic banger after another. Canon fire and scratching, the score gets pretty raucous. I went it with a little trepidation, but Lin-Manuel Miranda has indeed created something marvellous. It. Is. Spine-tinglingly brilliant. I might have to stop saying I don't like musicals.",blimey,i know little bit about americas founding fathers not lot its not really taught uk thats not important though knowing any history enjoy this i mean not americas independence musicals arent my thing either certainly not musical theatre which this is with several exclamation points what we have here is theatre production filmed fairly simply few camera angles covering stage mostly wide show off lovely set occasional close up well provide some variation edit nothing more this is thing its show designed be enjoyed room theres no set camera positions camera is normally your eye your seat thats not possible right now though which is why this exists so its not film it works though its undeniably spectacle if you dont like singing dancing you might think youre buggered honestly though this is pretty top quality singing dancing youre safe hands its fast fun energy dialled all way up mix humour hip hop show tunes will make even most hardened cynic smile alright its gimmicky actors spitting bars wearing frock coats declaring war but i guess rules are different theatre its very effective film its often said that if actors look like theyre having too much fun audience arent i dont think that applies here either everybody looks be having time their lives live audience that we hear but dont see seem be too its pretty lengthy but theres lot there not least pretty eventful life story alexander hamilton rags revolutionary social climbing agitator with love writing setting up financial institutions weddings duals adultery bribery bloody big war lot political manoeuvring historical content is top line stuff covering basics theyre touch points really never allowing story get too dry but it manages this without dumbing it down too much razor sharp humour helps immigrants we get job done cast are wonderful daveed diggs as both lafayette jefferson is standout me there are quieter moments but theres sequences where its one bombastic banger after another canon fire scratching score gets pretty raucous i went it with little trepidation but lin manuel miranda has indeed created something marvellous it is spine tinglingly brilliant i might have stop saying i dont like musicals,0.5110753968253968,0.15401378066378069,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Musical history,"'Hamilton' was a major surprise for me when seeing and hearing it. Music is such a big part of my life, being now a semi-professional singer and raised into a musical family, and am a fan of musicals, especially the golden age ones. History was also one of my favourite and best subjects in most of my up and down school life, until it didn't work out in sixth form when my confidence went and my comprehension and drive worsened. So having a musical to combine the two immediately intrigued me, despite not being the biggest fan of the dominant styles here (was raised on classical music and opera personally).That is what was meant when saying that 'Hamilton' was a major surprise. Hearing that a filmed version of a production was coming to Disney+, which has been a much needed distraction, there was no doubt in my mind about seeing it. So that the mix of history and music, the meaningful and relevant lyrics, the brilliant performances and the energy and heart it has can be revisited again. It does play fast and loose with history, blame that on the musical and not the production, sure and the style(s) of music that dominates the score here are not my first choices usually, but actually for its entertainment value, emotional impact and how well crafted it is as an overall whole, 'Hamilton' was a real winner. As was this production. Which was very much needed after suffering through 'Artemis Fowl', a musical surprise adapted masterfully and so accessibly and through a particularly unsettling time in a terrible few years.It, the production that is, looks great. The sumptuous and true to the respective periods costumes especially and the setting is not too elaborate or overblown while still never looking cheap. Personally thought that the production was very well filmed, certainly compared to other filmed productions of musical theatre, opera and ballet seen and have seen many of each (being a major fan of all three). It made me feel like a member of an audience seeing it live, expect seeing it far more accessibly in terms of money and locations. Which is what is so great about these live/streamed performances and they have proven to be invaluable. Of which 'Hamilton' has been a big highlight.Musically, 'Hamilton' is on point. Those that don't like the styles are best staying away unless wanting to see what the hoopla is all about, but as someone that saw it with an open mind and wanting to stretch even more my musical horizons 'Hamilton' made me appreciate hip hop and rap much more because they were so well done in their own way. When they are well done and not too repetitive or preachy, yes it is dependent on how they're executed in my view rather than any bias towards the styles, that is when it is easy to appreciate them and that is what 'Hamilton' excels so well in. Also found it very well accompanied.What also comes over brilliantly is how 'Hamilton' is written. The musical and performance are very song heavy, which some may not like dependent on what your feelings on musicals, hip hop and rap are (some love it, others hate it and it is all down to taste which is fair enough). Found the melodies very clever and easy to remember, amazing considering how many there are and not an easy thing to achieve these days. It was the lyrics though that made a bigger impression on me, these lyrics were vastly entertaining and also at times quite emotional but what is just as admirable are their honesty and how relevant they are. These are lyrics that are likely to connect for many, and from the sounds of it have done. Historically, it is far and loose but that didn't matter for me being somebody that watched not expecting a history lesson. 'Hamilton' does very well at making people more interested in history and the particular time periods depicted, that is from my experience from seeing it with people that felt exactly the same as me. What is great about this production is how it does so well in being true and capturing the spirited energy and heart of the musical itself, which is what filmed adaptations of musicals in my mind should do.Really loved 'Hamilton's' performances. Have seen both love and hate for Lin Manuel Miranda's performance. Personally loved his work here, he was very heavily involved in making 'Hamilton' work, his dilligent efforts very much obvious here, and he gives the equivalent of the performance of his life here. He is charming and has great authority and comic timing and really do disagree that he doesn't have singing ability, he proved in 'Mary Poppins Returns' in my view that he could and he does great in this regard too. Dramatically he is the stuff of legends as is the joy that was Leslie Odom Jr. Daveed Diggs brings tremendous energy in Act 2 especially and Jonathan Groff is absolutely hilarious here. Phillipa Soo and Renee Elise Goldsberry shouldn't be overlooked either, Soo is especially good. Okieriete Onaodowan has great chemistry with Diggs and holds his own against him when they're together, especially as Madison.Concluding, truly brilliant in my view. It won't be for all tastes but even if one is put off by the first twenty minutes if not knowing what to expect my advice really is to stick with it. It is not worth certainly not bragging about turning it off about 15 minutes or something, that is the equivalent of barely seeing it. One of the easiest 10/10's given recently.",musical history,hamilton was major surprise me when seeing hearing it music is such big part my life being now semi professional singer raised into musical family am fan musicals especially golden age ones history was also one my favourite best subjects most my up down school life until it didnt work out sixth form when my confidence went my comprehension drive worsened so having musical combine two immediately intrigued me despite not being biggest fan dominant styles here was raised classical music opera personally that is what was meant when saying that hamilton was major surprise hearing that filmed version production was coming disney which has been much needed distraction there was no doubt my mind about seeing it so that mix history music meaningful relevant lyrics brilliant performances energy heart it has can be revisited again it does play fast loose with history blame that musical not production sure style s music that dominates score here are not my first choices usually but actually its entertainment value emotional impact how well crafted it is as overall whole hamilton was real winner as was this production which was very much needed after suffering through artemis fowl musical surprise adapted masterfully so accessibly through particularly unsettling time terrible few years it production that is looks great sumptuous true respective periods costumes especially setting is not too elaborate or overblown while still never looking cheap personally thought that production was very well filmed certainly compared other filmed productions musical theatre opera ballet seen have seen many each being major fan all three it made me feel like member audience seeing it live expect seeing it far more accessibly terms money locations which is what is so great about these live streamed performances they have proven be invaluable which hamilton has been big highlight musically hamilton is point those that dont like styles are best staying away unless wanting see what hoopla is all about but as someone that saw it with open mind wanting stretch even more my musical horizons hamilton made me appreciate hip hop rap much more because they were so well done their own way when they are well done not too repetitive or preachy yes it is dependent how theyre executed my view rather than any bias towards styles that is when it is easy appreciate them that is what hamilton excels so well also found it very well accompanied what also comes over brilliantly is how hamilton is written musical performance are very song heavy which some may not like dependent what your feelings musicals hip hop rap are some love it others hate it it is all down taste which is fair enough found melodies very clever easy remember amazing considering how many there are not easy thing achieve these days it was lyrics though that made bigger impression me these lyrics were vastly entertaining also at times quite emotional but what is just as admirable are their honesty how relevant they are these are lyrics that are likely connect many sounds it have done historically it is far loose but that didnt matter me being somebody that watched not expecting history lesson hamilton does very well at making people more interested history particular time periods depicted that is my experience seeing it with people that felt exactly same as me what is great about this production is how it does so well being true capturing spirited energy heart musical itself which is what filmed adaptations musicals my mind should do really loved hamiltons performances have seen both love hate lin manuel mirandas performance personally loved his work here he was very heavily involved making hamilton work his dilligent efforts very much obvious here he gives equivalent performance his life here he is charming has great authority comic timing really do disagree that he doesnt have singing ability he proved mary poppins returns my view that he could he does great this regard too dramatically he is stuff legends as is joy that was leslie odom jr daveed diggs brings tremendous energy act 2 especially jonathan groff is absolutely hilarious here phillipa soo renee elise goldsberry shouldnt be overlooked either soo is especially good okieriete onaodowan has great chemistry with diggs holds his own against him when theyre together especially as madison concluding truly brilliant my view it wont be all tastes but even if one is put off by first twenty minutes if not knowing what expect my advice really is stick with it it is not worth certainly not bragging about turning it off about 15 minutes or something that is equivalent barely seeing it one easiest 10 10s given recently,0.5167315881950029,0.22352910188276043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9.0,And that's how musicals should be made!,"If you're not a fan of musicals and can't bear listening to songs for more than 150 minutes without any dialogues, then this film isn't for you. Everything is expressed through songs and you won't listen them talking without being in rhythm. It has 50+ songs (yes, you read that right) in its 2 hour 40 mins runtime. Like other musicals, it does not have songs of a definite genre, but it comprises jazz, rap, hip-hop, acapella, soft songs and many more. Since musicals have a limited audience, it won't gain much popularity. It's a pity that films like Extraction and 365 Days get so much hype whereas a great work like this goes unnoticed.A lot of films like The Sound of Music, Amadeus, My Fair Lady have been adapted from award winning plays. But, this one did it in another way, they filmed the entire play and released it as a film. As a result, you get to be in the room where it happened and experience the magic of watching a live play sitting at home. Lin-Manuel Miranda stars in and as Hamilton along with being the writer of this musical. He does a magnificent job along with the whole cast delivering impactful performances.To me, this is the best of 2020 so far and arguably the best musical of this century.

9.0,Hamilton,"One critic recently wrote a list of three great musicals that must be seen on stage. Hamilton was one of them.To my surprise, I have seen all three of those listed. Mind you I have only seen three musicals live on stage in my life so far. What a coincidence!I went to see Hamilton in London's West End because my kids were keen to see it. They may not know much about American history but they knew the songs by the time we got to the theatre.I did tell them if they were so keen on Hamilton, I would had pointed out where he was buried the last time we visited New York. As I did study American history, I was aware of Hamilton and especially the circumstances of his death.I did enjoy the West End show although you have to concentrate hard on the songs. Not only some of the rap parts go fast. The lyrics convey a lot of information like setting up a constitution or how to win a revolutionary war.This Disney presentation was actually filmed four years ago with the original Broadway cast. It is essentially a stage presentation in front of an audience. I understand that the British version had some slight differences with a bigger role for George III.Like the stage play Amadeus. The setting is the rivalry between Founding Fathers Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. It spans pre revolutionary America to well after independence was gained. I noticed the rivalry was more profound watching it onscreen. This time noting that one of the signature song's, My Shot has a more layered meaning.The set for Hamilton looks remarkably simple and plain. Yet is it so cleverly constructed, some of it requires split second timing from the performers. It was astonishing watching this on television just how slick it all was.As for the cast, Lin-Manuel Miranda has become world famous as he not only plays Hamilton. He wrote the book, songs and music. The more showy role is Daveed Diggs as Talleyrand/Thomas Jefferson. It is Leslie Odom Jr who steals it as the 'Salieli' like Burr. The man who never gets to be in the room where it happens, where the big decisions are made.I was mildly amused that the American audience appreciated Jonathan Groff's King George each time he appeared with his barbed lyrics.Hamilton is a world away from the traditional musicals. This one has a modernity as seen by the music and its casting. Maybe that is a reason why it has proved to be popular with a younger audience.

8.0,How much you enjoy this is highly dependent on your age.,"Yesterday, a bazillion folks tuned in to Disney+ to see the debut of ""Hamilton""...a recording of the Broadway show back in 2016. Because it's not a traditional movie-style musical, it's pretty difficult to compare it to a typical film in the genre. It's also a film whose enjoyment definitely depends on your age. I am in my mid-50s....hardly the age to like hip-hop style music in a musical. But, despite this, I did respect what the show was trying to accomplish--to bring America history to the masses AND to make it more accessible to minorities as most of the parts were played by Black and Hispanic actors and actresses. So, while having the likes of George Washington and Aaron Burr played by black actors isn't historically accurate, it does help make history more inclusive....as did the very modern music. And, as an ex-history teacher, I am thrilled about these things even if I wasn't all that fond of the singing. Well worth seeing....and a nice chance to publicize a few nearly forgotten great Americans.",how much you enjoy this is highly dependent your age,yesterday bazillion folks tuned disney see debut hamilton recording broadway show back 2016 because its not traditional movie style musical its pretty difficult compare it typical film genre its also film whose enjoyment definitely depends your age i am my mid 50s hardly age like hip hop style music musical but despite this i did respect what show was trying accomplish bring america history masses make it more accessible minorities as most parts were played by black hispanic actors actresses so while having likes george washington aaron burr played by black actors isnt historically accurate it does help make history more inclusive as did very modern music as ex history teacher i am thrilled about these things even if i wasnt all that fond singing well worth seeing nice chance publicize few nearly forgotten great americans,0.457283950617284,0.1649382716049383,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.21, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,A magnificent production the hypes justified,"I thought after all I've heard and read about this musical phenomenon that July 4th would be an appropriate evening to judge for myself and I'm so pleased to say all the hype about Hamilton is true it is truly a fabulous stage show.I could have seen Hamilton on our last trip to New York but two things put me off it's very expensive ticket cost and the gamble that I may not like it . Also I thought it would be an all wrap music show which is not my favourite musical genre but pleased to report the wrap lyrics are very clever and there are many other musical styles in this 2 hour 40 biographical musical.Since then I've become a huge fan and admirer of Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda the new wunderkind of Broadway and Cinema .Miranda has said that Hamilton reminded him of rapper Tupac Shakur, which is how he came up with the idea for a diverse hip hop musical about Hamilton's life. Miranda worked on ""Hamilton""- a project that people, including his mentor Stephen Sondheim, told him would never work.Lin -Manuel Miranda based Hamilton the musical on an unlikely source: a dense, 818-page biography of Alexander Hamilton by the historian Ron Chernow many of his lyrics to the show are actually based directly on speeches from the book.His first musical ""In the Heights "" had an Australian Premier and I saw it at the Sydney Opera House in 2019 and loved it as it reminded me of West Side Story. It also has a wrap hip hop score butlike Hamilton features other forms of theatre music like reggae traditional ballads and great orchestrations . Lin -Manuel has recently filmed ""In the Heights "" as a full feature movie to be released in 2021 and word on the street is it's a winner.This version of Hamilton is a filmed version of the original multi eleven Tony Award winning musical directed by Thomas Kail the staging looks simple but it's a very complex and effective series of moveable multi tiered timber scaffolds that frame the stage for the large cast allowing plenty of space for the action and choreography to take place.Whenever I see credits mentioning the same person has composed , written and is starring as well as an executive producer in their own show which is very rare I think they're either a genius, or just a complete egomaniac. In the case of Hamilton Lin- Manuel Miranda is a genius in every category and his masterwork Hamilton truly deserved the 11Tony Awards it won in 2016 just one short of the record breaking 12 Tonys for Mel Brooke's musical The Producers.Hamilton was filmed across three days in 2016, a few weeks before the original cast finished their contracts.The musical's original director, Thomas Kail, assembled a crack team of filmmakers, put them in front of the stage and lovingly captured the story the way it was intended to be: as a piece of theatre.Nine cameras recorded two full performances before live audiences. Between shows, the makers refilmed the production to allow for angles that would be impossible for audiences to see within the theatre including close-ups of intimate and dramatic moments and sweeping overhead shots that capture the entire stage.Hamilton the musical is set in the not so United States of America of 1776 to 1800 and there are definite comparisons to the Political situation in that country today.The musical has been receiving rave critical reviews and sold out tickets to all productions in and outside the United States it broke box office records in London and Broadway is set to do the same in Sydney next year.""Hamilton"" is the story of America then, told by America now. It features a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, R&B and Broadway, ""Hamilton"" has taken the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and created a revolutionary moment in theatre-a musical that has had a profound impact on culture, politics, and education.It's no wonder John Bolton titled his recent book on President Donald Trump ""The Room Where it Happened "" the great song from Act 2 of "" Hamilton "" is titled The Room Where it Happens and takes place when Alexander Hamilton Americas first Secretary to the Treasury is ushered to a Secret Meeting where President Thomas Jefferson and his friend and future President James Maddison agree on an unprecedented compromise to move the Capital city of the new nation to their Southern electorate without consulting the American People or Aaron Burr who was the 3rd Vice President of the U. S. A.The opening number ""Alexander Hamilton ""sets the show off beautifully sung by Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast then leads to another great action song ""My Shot."" and a good example of the clever lyrics ""I am not throwing away my shot I am not throwing away my shot Hey yo, I'm just like my country I'm young, scrappy and hungry And I'm not throwing away my shot The whole cast in this original Broadway Production are superb of course Lin -Manuel is wonderful as Alexander Hamilton but this is an ensemble piece .The two Schuyler sisters Angelica Renee Louise Goldsberry and Eliza Phillipa Soo who becomes Eliza Hamilton Alexander's wife sing beautifully and look beautiful in their roles and costumes as does the whole cast by costume designer Paul Tazewell .Some of the most sublime and more emotional moments of Hamilton feature these two talented women especially their first song in Act 1 titled The Schuyler Sisters.The other major male roles Leslie Odam Jnr as Aaron Burr and Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette add to the drama and comedy of Hamilton and it's hard to imagine a better cast. Other great supporting roles that add so much to Hamilton are Chris Jackson as George Washington and a star turn by Jonathan Groff as King George 111 who has a great song and dance number "" You'll Be Back ""referring to America's separation from England.I've often read that the American musical theatre has over the last one hundred years had 3 pivotal evolutions that have forever influenced the genre forever Jerome Kern's 1927 Showboat which for the first time progressed a dramatic story with a musical score that changed the art of musicals from comedy reviews or light weight romantic librettos .Then the next great change came in 1943 with Rodgers and Hammerstein's groundbreaking musical ""Oklahoma "" which was the first musical that raised the curtain on the solo character Curly singing ""Oh What a Beautiful Morning "" and developing from the earlier Show Boat, epitomising the development of the ""book musical"", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions.Then in 1957 ""West Side Story"" with the music of Leonard Bernstein and the spectacular Broadway debut Of Stephen Sondheim as lyricist bought gang warfare and a revolutionary contemporary song and instrumentally inventive orchestrations that have become classical milestones of many orchestra and Opera Houses the world . We will see a new film version next year directed by Stephen Spielberg.Hamilton I predict will join these 3 famous musicals in history as a revolutionary and innovative game changer that will help keep the Broadway musical alive and thriving.Is it worth $8.99 a month or $89.99 a year a Disney channel subscription? You'll have to judge that but it's the best seat in the house for a fraction of the cost of a ticket for Hamilton the musical. . I've noticed some great High School professional productions of various musicals and other movies and animated features on Disney so it's a yes for me and I'm not on commission .I've added to my Christmas wish list a ticket to the Australian production of this great musical in Sydney next year at the Lyric Theatre.Composers that have the talent to star in their own musicals are less than a dozen and Lin - Manuel has written and starred in two Washington Heights and Hamilton.Disney Plus Channel paid $75 million for the screening rights for Hamilton and the franchise rights which will create huge dividends for Disney now and into the future.Lin -Manuel reportedly made $ 6.4 million off Hamilton in 2017 alone before this Disney deal. He is a modest multi millionaires owning two luxury pre-war apartments in Upper Manhattan, but otherwise lives a relatively modest lifestyle and still rides the subway. The latest estimate of his net wealth after the Disney deal is $80 million .Broadway made Lin-Manuel Miranda a star, but philanthropy-from disaster relief in Puerto Rico to arts education at home in New York-is truly the family business.This filmed production of a stage musical is definitely the best I've ever seen and I really can't wait to see what our Australian production is like next

9.0,Alexander Hamil-WIN!,"This was an exciting thing for me. I, like most people, had heard of Hamilton. It was/is a HUGE phenomenon on Broadway and launched the careers of some incredible people. Miranda is always the fun, quirky, goofy musical wizard that pops up in shows now and then. Leslie Odom Jr. has always had this impishly wicked energy to him. Oh, and lets not forget Daveed Diggs, the up and comer who, after Blindspotting and a couple other things, I would watch in just about anything. Unfortunately, I live light years away from any decent stage so the odds of me seeing this in real life seemed like something that may just never happen. Enter the magical world of Disney and I am given the opportunity to finally experience the phenomenon myself, albeit not in the original form. Of course, with all the build up and all the hype, I was worried it couldn't possibly measure up.Now, to be perfectly honest, I knew next to nothing about this before watching it. I knew that Miranda created it, I knew Diggs was in it and I had some vague notion that it was about Alexander Hamilton, the founding father, and that it was a musical. I know that might seem like a lot and yet when this kicked off I felt completely blindsided by what I got. The music was catchy in a way I hadn't anticipated, to the point that I'm listening to the soundtrack right now as I write this out. The performances were full of life and energy and charisma, every character so wonderfully brought to life with Miranda and the performer's visions. Though, I have to say that Jonathan Groff as King George was an absolute scene stealer every second he was on stage.There are two magic tricks I think Hamilton not only pulls off, but pulls off effortlessly. First, the cast is remarkably diverse. This is never made into a ""thing"" or used as some tool to drive home some clumsy point in the way a lot of movies do, instead they're just people, people who do an exceptional job and I love that. I never once felt like a single person was miscast or not befitting their role and honestly, the fact that they never draw overt attention to it allows each actor to simply play their part exceptionally. Secondly, this draws attention to an imperfect man of great significance in American history that... Yeah, I'm sure I learned about him in school but honestly didn't know all that much about him. The fact that they essentially make something that's one part highly entertaining musical and another part educational and historical piece is wonderful.Negatives? I only really have one and it's sort've minor. There are a LOT of characters portrayed here and a lot of the actors play more than one role and it can be difficult at times to keep things straight. This is a fleeting issue, a few minutes after an actor steps into a new character and it's clear who they are, but there's that initial moment of 'Huh?' that can be briefly distracting. I get the feeling this is just a part of stage shows and I'm just the uncivilized dullard that doesn't know better but it is what it is.Now, as of me writing this, Hamilton is under fire and on the ever-growing cancel list. I don't agree with that. No, it doesn't focus on all of his faults, but Hamilton definitely doesn't portray Alexander as a saint by any means, not in my eyes. I think this absolutely worth watching and forming your own opinion on. Do the actions of the real man that died in 1804 mean that a 2020 musical can't be enjoyed? Can we judge the past with modern sensibilities? These are the deep, philosophical issues that this can bring out and I think these are discussions worth having. Personally, I separate the art from the inspiration and found this to be wildly entertaining. If you don't believe you are able or willing to do that, then your experience may vary wildly and that is perfectly alright by me.",alexander hamil win,this was exciting thing me i like most people had heard hamilton it was is huge phenomenon broadway launched careers some incredible people miranda is always fun quirky goofy musical wizard that pops up shows now then leslie odom jr has always had this impishly wicked energy him oh lets not forget daveed diggs up comer who after blindspotting couple other things i would watch just about anything unfortunately i live light years away any decent stage so odds me seeing this real life seemed like something that may just never happen enter magical world disney i am given opportunity finally experience phenomenon myself albeit not original form course with all build up all hype i was worried it couldnt possibly measure up now be perfectly honest i knew next nothing about this before watching it i knew that miranda created it i knew diggs was it i had some vague notion that it was about alexander hamilton founding father that it was musical i know that might seem like lot yet when this kicked off i felt completely blindsided by what i got music was catchy way i hadnt anticipated point that im listening soundtrack right now as i write this out performances were full life energy charisma every character so wonderfully brought life with miranda performers visions though i have say that jonathan groff as king george was absolute scene stealer every second he was stage there are two magic tricks i think hamilton not only pulls off but pulls off effortlessly first cast is remarkably diverse this is never made into thing or used as some tool drive home some clumsy point way lot movies do instead theyre just people people who do exceptional job i love that i never once felt like single person was miscast or not befitting their role honestly fact that they never draw overt attention it allows each actor simply play their part exceptionally secondly this draws attention imperfect man great significance american history that yeah im sure i learned about him school but honestly didnt know all that much about him fact that they essentially make something thats one part highly entertaining musical another part educational historical piece is wonderful negatives i only really have one its sortve minor there are lot characters portrayed here lot actors play more than one role it can be difficult at times keep things straight this is fleeting issue few minutes after actor steps into new character its clear who they are but theres that initial moment huh that can be briefly distracting i get feeling this is just part stage shows im just uncivilized dullard that doesnt know better but it is what it is now as me writing this hamilton is under fire ever growing cancel list i dont agree with that no it doesnt focus all his faults but hamilton definitely doesnt portray alexander as saint by any means not my eyes i think this absolutely worth watching forming your own opinion do actions real man that died 1804 mean that 2020 musical cant be enjoyed can we judge past with modern sensibilities these are deep philosophical issues that this can bring out i think these are discussions worth having personally i separate art inspiration found this be wildly entertaining if you dont believe you are able or willing do that then your experience may vary wildly that is perfectly alright by me,0.5188092983405483,0.22931682900432895,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,"""The Story of America Then, Told by America Now""","The time has come. The lights go down. King George III welcomes us to the show. Hamilton has finally arrived in a beautiful HD presentation! You've heard of it, you've listened to it more times than you can count, you've bopped to it and belted the words on your friend's aux to their absolute shock/confusion. Now we can FINALLY enjoy it on loop over and over again on a non bootleg copy, that's right NO MORE SLIME TUTORIALS! Considering it's called a ""Hamilton film I would say it's right in my ballpark don't you?? First of all, the show is amazing. It's among the best the stage has to offer in the modern age. The music, the performances, the writing, the production, it's all BEAUTIFUL, if you haven't seen it yet WATCH IT NOW, but what truly makes it SO good? In the words of Lin Manuel Miranda, ""It's a story about America then, as told by America now."" The Founding Fathers are played by actors of color, among other characters featured in the story. The show is having us leave whatever cultural baggage we have about these historical figures at the door, and embracing this story through the eyes of America NOW. Yes it does leave some factors out, yes it's not all historically accurate, but people need to realize the point isn't to tell an IN DEPTH biographical story of Hamilton, but rather show us how his life and the events that he took part in helped form the foundations and ideals of what this country was built upon. This show is very Patriotic but it reminds me of what America is SUPPOSE TO BE. WHAT IT COULD BE. Much like the young people of my generation going out and marching for the racial injustices in this country, Hamilton was a 20 year old immigrant that fought for the freedom of this land and helped shaped the principles in which we aspire to uphold. This show isn't going to acknowledge our systemic racism roots with people like Washington and Jefferson who factually owned slaves, but it challenges us to contemplate our OWN feelings about this country and where we came from. How far have we come? What has changed and what could WE do better? Could our founding fathers have done more to abolish slavery? Absolutely, but think about what they did try to create and lay the foundations for. Who knows what they could've done if they had more time? It's not meant to idolize these people, it's a piece about the birth of America, and what people like Hamilton did to help a struggling new country find its own identity. When I watch/listen to this show, I believe in that. I believe that America WAS already great, we just lost sight of it and let the wrong people get in charge. If you want to know why, watch Hamilton. The story of an immigrant that fought in a war, and made a name for himself in a ludicrous political game, is a story that will be remembered for generations. Miranda and his team found an incredible medium to tell these people's stories, and that's what it's all about, who tells our story? How will we be remembered? Hamilton's now available on Disney+, I highly suggest you watch it for your 4th of July this weekend and many days after... But as a final reminder don't forget, this is at its heart, live theatre. Hopefully when Covid ends we can actually experience it all together the way we're suppose to, in front of the stage, LIVE. But for now, this will of course do! 10/10.",story america then told by america now,time has come lights go down king george iii welcomes us show hamilton has finally arrived beautiful hd presentation youve heard it youve listened it more times than you can count youve bopped it belted words your friends aux their absolute shock confusion now we can finally enjoy it loop over over again non bootleg copy thats right no more slime tutorials considering its called hamilton film i would say its right my ballpark dont you first all show is amazing its among best stage has offer modern age music performances writing production its all beautiful if you havent seen it yet watch it now but what truly makes it so good words lin manuel miranda its story about america then as told by america now founding fathers are played by actors color among other characters featured story show is having us leave whatever cultural baggage we have about these historical figures at door embracing this story through eyes america now yes it does leave some factors out yes its not all historically accurate but people need realize point isnt tell depth biographical story hamilton but rather show us how his life events that he took part helped form foundations ideals what this country was built upon this show is very patriotic but it reminds me what america is suppose be what it could be much like young people my generation going out marching racial injustices this country hamilton was 20 year old immigrant that fought freedom this land helped shaped principles which we aspire uphold this show isnt going acknowledge our systemic racism roots with people like washington jefferson who factually owned slaves but it challenges us contemplate our own feelings about this country where we came how far have we come what has changed what could we do better could our founding fathers have done more abolish slavery absolutely but think about what they did try create lay foundations who knows what they couldve done if they had more time its not meant idolize these people its piece about birth america what people like hamilton did help struggling new country find its own identity when i watch listen this show i believe that i believe that america was already great we just lost sight it let wrong people get charge if you want know why watch hamilton story immigrant that fought war made name himself ludicrous political game is story that will be remembered generations miranda his team found incredible medium tell these peoples stories thats what its all about who tells our story how will we be remembered hamiltons now available disney i highly suggest you watch it your 4th july this weekend many days after but as final reminder dont forget this is at its heart live theatre hopefully when covid ends we can actually experience it all together way were suppose front stage live but now this will course do 10 10,0.5624211268529449,0.2627264528400892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
