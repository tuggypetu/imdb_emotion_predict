10.0,Holds up as a classic.,"Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.Fantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.The music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she's upstaged by the creature.You can't help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.A cinematic masterpiece. 10/10",holds up as classic,alien remains one most original terrifying movies all time compare this with lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays 1979 it still packs huge punch fantastically atmospheric chilling terrifying even now story holds up incredibly well special effects were incredible time no wonder franchise is still demand though sadly nowhere near quality this one or its amazing successor music is fantastic direction is incredible as alien itself way ahead its time weaver is phenomenal but arguably shes upstaged by creature you cant help but remember scenes days after watching it it definitely has chill factor cinematic masterpiece 10 10,0.6880952380952382,0.0954004329004329,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.59, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,A Timeless Science Fiction Masterpiece,"'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

10.0,One of the best classic sci-fi horror films of all time - A masterpiece,"A masterpiece one of the best classic sci-fi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the sci-fi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about ""extraterrestrial life form"" it is interesting, brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect, the script, the actors, puppetry, models, and special effects about Alien design. I would give this movie an 8 but it deserves a perfect 10 because it has a vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. Dan O'Bannon wrote brilliantly a story and screenplay with help from Ronald Shusett. Both of them make a brilliant imaginative story. This film has no plot holes I don't see them. Helen Horton as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo's computer was believable and realistic and well performed. The design for the parasite (the facehugger) was excellent designed and brilliant. Everyone from the cast in here at acting is spectacular and acts believable. I love all the characters: Parker, Brett, Lambert, Ripley, Ash, Captain Dallas, Kane and even Jonesy the cat. He was really trained I love that cat in this movie. The design about the ship Nostromo is fantastic and so is space and the computers in this film. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger which the effects and designs were excellent spectacular created in the film. Jerry Goldsmith makes an excellent music score for the film that I have enjoy it. My favorite scene in this film is when Parker torchers with flamethrower on Ash's corpse and burns his remains great a special effect. This movie stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Bolaji Badejo and Helen Horton they are all believable in their roles.This is my favorite science fiction film tough I prefer Aliens over this film (because it is my favorite film), The Thing, Leviathan even The Blob as a horror films because I enjoy them more but ""Alien"" is my favorite science fiction film the best of it's kind. 10/10 doesn't deserve the hate.",one best classic sci fi horror films all time masterpiece,masterpiece one best classic sci fi horror films 70s i have ever saw experience first time i saw this film was 97 when i was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time even today people talks about it watching first time this film i must say i loved it i love this film death all sci fi films today this one is best one beats them all this is real science fiction film about extraterrestrial life form it is interesting brilliant about time space life form that wants whip whole humanity out this is ridley scotts masterpiece one his best films all time everything about this film is perfect script actors puppetry models special effects about alien design i would give this movie 8 but it deserves perfect 10 because it has vision most imaginative directors earth dan obannon wrote brilliantly story screenplay with help ronald shusett both them make brilliant imaginative story this film has no plot holes i dont see them helen horton as voice mother nostromos computer was believable realistic well performed design parasite facehugger was excellent designed brilliant everyone cast here at acting is spectacular acts believable i love all characters parker brett lambert ripley ash captain dallas kane even jonesy cat he was really trained i love that cat this movie design about ship nostromo is fantastic so is space computers this film eponymous alien its accompanying elements were designed by swiss artist h r giger which effects designs were excellent spectacular created film jerry goldsmith makes excellent music score film that i have enjoy it my favorite scene this film is when parker torchers with flamethrower ashs corpse burns his remains great special effect this movie stars tom skerritt sigourney weaver veronica cartwright harry dean stanton john hurt ian holm yaphet kotto bolaji badejo helen horton they are all believable their roles this is my favorite science fiction film tough i prefer aliens over this film because it is my favorite film thing leviathan even blob as horror films because i enjoy them more but alien is my favorite science fiction film best its kind 10 10 doesnt deserve hate,0.632312925170068,0.48348922902494335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.18}"

10.0,The Purina Dog Chow company will expand and make a big mistake!,"Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic, documentary-like sci-fi films ever made. Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 10/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company)",purina dog chow company will expand make big mistake,ridely scott is such minimalist alien that many sci fi nuts find it slow unexciting so many people prefer aliens its sequel this one i think aliens directed by james cameron is another sci fi masterpiece maybe best action film ever made but i think alien is much better fact i would say that it is among best films ever made sci fi only second 2001 plot absolutely lacks contrivance all plot points develop how they would naturally there are great surprises throughout film even if you havent seen film you know about chest bursting scene you probably saw it parodied dozens times but watch scene where ian holm reveals his secret that is one amazing scene i actually saw sequel first so i kind knew that secret too but it still shocked me it was so well directed notice how dialogue works it never particularly draws attention itself it actually reminds me robert altman how he directed such movies as nashville where many characters are speaking at same time nothing seems more or less important than anything else it is just like real life alien is one most realistic documentary like sci fi films ever made also notice setting nostromos design is so believable that i feel that im actually seeing real space vehicle alien ship also beams with its spookiness characters are also extremely believable they are so well written that even first character who dies is completely developed if you get dvd they actually created dossiers about each crew members it also has extra scenes which round out characters even more i think ripley is one most endearing characters film history even last two sequels which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed ripley held my interest i teared up when she died at end 3 if they made fifth one i would go no matter how terrible i knew it would be acting is also top notch ian holm great actor gives one his best performances here i love last scene that he is truly master course sigourney weaver could have just as easily been nominated oscar her performance here as she was aliens i wish she would make more movies shes so talented most important part film my mind is mood boy does alien have one most genuinely spooky movies ive ever seen make sure you watch it after sun has gone down also watching it alone will help special effects are kind cheap but scott knows this well enough he only shows alien seconds at time besides keeping us seeing shoddiness those puppets this technique makes alien seem all more creepy mysterious 10 10 no doubt at all btw symbols all over nostromo are same insignias as those purina dog chow company,0.5076984126984128,0.18501984126984128,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
,Classic horror,"The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level.",classic horror,further we go special effects more movies show us ignore unseen more people will return dark horrors like this one its hard look at this film without considering sequels knowing alien itself however when made alien was mostly unseen mystery its difficult forget what youve seen but its important approach this film first if possible rather than joining series late its amazing that this is over 20 years old apart actors looking so young film doesnt feel dated at all sci fi visions here are still bleak futuristic as they were then this is not star trek vision future foreboding exists long before john hurt spills his secret scotts direction is excellent throughout once alien is born tension is cranked up characters dispatched one by one formula we know oh so well now however here characters are not merely alien food but have some dimension them weaver is excellent while support cast is full great support actors stanton kotto hurt skerritt holm but course real star is one we see least we barely see alien full detail most time it is set shadows moving with deadly intent alien here is not simply killing machine as seen later films but is cruel with it witness alien trap female crew member slowly rub up her leg moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed kill another crew member sneaking up behind it slow movements betray aliens pure cruelty film is study terror it may not be as action packed as other films series but it brings claustrophobia being hunted new level,0.5598290043290042,0.003655844155844168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,A horror classic that has stood the test of time! Still by far the best movie in the series.,"'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough.

10.0,Classic tale of terror,"This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad.

,My favourite tagline for a movie,"""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film.",my favourite tagline movie,space no one can hear you scream this remains my favourite tagline ever movie when alien was released 1979 it caused almost as much talk as star wars did when released two years earlier science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time alien had horror characteristic it which was psychological visually striking compelling with type strength silence not seen since 2001 space odyssey 1968 definitely big influence blockbuster film making alien has spawned three sequels so far is great horror science fiction classic not be missed it is director ridley scotts best effort big screen making fear best character film,0.4895833333333333,0.203125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Iconographic Horror,"ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android ""revival"" are fairly notorious). There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars.

The futuristic cargo ship picks up an unwanted passenger : a malicious extraterrestrial . After searching for survivors, the ill-fated crew heads home only to realize that a deadly bioform has joined them . The merciless alien lives on human flesh and continually changes form . Then the Earthlings have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous being that is running amok . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s and 80s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creature by the artist HR Giger , it was conceptual artist Ron Cobb who came up with the idea that the Alien should bleed acid . Extraordinary as well as astounding special effects in the chestburster scenes , the rumor that the cast, except for John Hurt, did not know what would happen during scenes is partly true and it was filmed in one take with four cameras; for instance, Veronica Cartwright did not expect to be sprayed with blood. The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien . ¨Alien¨ is clearly inspired by ¨It ¡ the terror from beyond space¨ . Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship such as Tom Skerritt who is awesome in compelling lead role as commandant , Harry Dean Stanton , Veronica Cartwright , Yaphet Kotto , John Hurt and special mention to Ian Holm . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Ridley Scott who keeps everything bouncing at an absolutely frantic pace . Ridley Scott cites three films as the shaping influences on his movie: George Lucas' Star Wars (1977) and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) for their depiction of outer space, and Tobe Hooper's Texas chain saw massacre (1974) for its treatment of horror .It is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance ; ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet with Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott .

10.0,A new appreciation of this film's excellence,"Seven members of a space mining cargo ship who are headed back to Earth are awakened from hypersleep when their ship detects a signal from an intelligent civilization on a small, uncharted planet. When they locate the source of the signal, they find more than they bargained for, and all of their lives are endangered.My feelings about this first film in the Alien series have vacillated slightly over the years. I loved it when I first saw it as a young teenager in the theater back in 1979. Later, I wasn't as enamored with it, and had actually rated it as low as a 7 out of 10--at one point believing it to be my least favorite of the series. Now, however, my appreciation of the film has matured a bit, and I'm back to thinking it's a solid 10 out of 10.The film's strong points are rooted in director Ridley Scott's focused commitment to sustaining a desolate, dark atmosphere and gradually building suspense over the course of the film. Alien is unusual for its era in its pacing, its lack of comic relief, and its refusal to provide breaks from its growing tension. All three of these facts make it a somewhat ""difficult film"". It's not recommended for light viewing. It's not a ""popcorn film"". You have to be in the mood to sit down, slow down, concentrate, invest emotion, and let yourself be enveloped in the film's world.With Alien, Scott has created a kind of bleak tribute to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is evident in many characteristics of the film, such as the graceful slowness of the cinematography, editing and much of the action in the first section of the film, including sustained pans across sterile-looking environments and wide external shots of (a) hulking but elegant spacecraft, the personification of the ship's computer, known as ""Mother"" here rather than Hal, a few subtle instances of classical music, the surprise discovery of a monumental structure on another celestial body, and so on. However, there are no instances of pleasant psychedelia here, no retreats into dreamworlds, no messages of hope, no benevolence from alien beings. Alien is strictly concerned with making its sci-fi an issue of classic horror. At a base level, it is about a malevolent monster, first encountered in a dark, Gothic environment and later chasing our heroes through a cross between a haunted house and crypt-like labyrinths.Much has been said about visual artist H.R. Giger's alien and production design, and the film wouldn't be nearly as successful without it. Giger is largely responsible for the look of the beacon ship on the small planet, both its exterior and interior, the cocoon later encountered on the cargo ship, and the creatures. His work also inspired a lot of smaller elements, as can be seen in doorways, pipes, and other features of the cargo ship. Like most of his work, these features are a combination of metallic and organic, mechanical and biological, futuristic and Gothic. They complement the austere Kubrickian sensibility in a surprising but completely successful way.Scott also uses simple effects like steam, as well as unique lighting and sound effects to help build the film's thick tension. These techniques gradually become more conspicuous as the film goes on, finally culminating in a claustrophobic symphony of flashing lights, constantly hissing pipes and hoses, and an incessant audio alarm.Finally, the last key to the excellence of the film is the cast. Although a somewhat stereotypical movie-world ragtag bunch, their characterizations provide more depth than the norm, with Sigourney Weaver as the standout, in perhaps the defining role of her career, and one of the more admirable filmic portrayals of a woman--she's the smartest, most sensible, strongest, and certainly most sexy of the bunch.",new appreciation this films excellence,seven members space mining cargo ship who are headed back earth are awakened hypersleep when their ship detects signal intelligent civilization small uncharted planet when they locate source signal they find more than they bargained all their lives are endangered my feelings about this first film alien series have vacillated slightly over years i loved it when i first saw it as young teenager theater back 1979 later i wasnt as enamored with it had actually rated it as low as 7 out 10 at one point believing it be my least favorite series now however my appreciation film has matured bit im back thinking its solid 10 out 10 films strong points are rooted director ridley scotts focused commitment sustaining desolate dark atmosphere gradually building suspense over course film alien is unusual its era its pacing its lack comic relief its refusal provide breaks its growing tension all three these facts make it somewhat difficult film its not recommended light viewing its not popcorn film you have be mood sit down slow down concentrate invest emotion let yourself be enveloped films world with alien scott has created kind bleak tribute stanley kubricks 2001 space odyssey 1968 this is evident many characteristics film such as graceful slowness cinematography editing much action first section film including sustained pans across sterile looking environments wide external shots hulking but elegant spacecraft personification ships computer known as mother here rather than hal few subtle instances classical music surprise discovery monumental structure another celestial body so however there are no instances pleasant psychedelia here no retreats into dreamworlds no messages hope no benevolence alien beings alien is strictly concerned with making its sci fi issue classic horror at base level it is about malevolent monster first encountered dark gothic environment later chasing our heroes through cross between haunted house crypt like labyrinths much has been said about visual artist h r gigers alien production design film wouldnt be nearly as successful without it giger is largely responsible look beacon ship small planet both its exterior interior cocoon later encountered cargo ship creatures his work also inspired lot smaller elements as can be seen doorways pipes other features cargo ship like most his work these features are combination metallic organic mechanical biological futuristic gothic they complement austere kubrickian sensibility surprising but completely successful way scott also uses simple effects like steam as well as unique lighting sound effects help build films thick tension these techniques gradually become more conspicuous as film goes finally culminating claustrophobic symphony flashing lights constantly hissing pipes hoses incessant audio alarm finally last key excellence film is cast although somewhat stereotypical movie world ragtag bunch their characterizations provide more depth than norm with sigourney weaver as standout perhaps defining role her career one more admirable filmic portrayals woman shes smartest most sensible strongest certainly most sexy bunch,0.49822386118682416,0.07356278837760319,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,"""Alien"" is not just the monster, it's the atmosphere and the way you feel!","In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains. All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10",alien is not just monster its atmosphere way you feel,alien we follow seven man crew en route earth board huge space freighter nostromo crew is cryosleep but board computer interrupts journey when foreign radio signal is picked up it originates uninhabited planet crew lands investigate there they make contact with alien life form what makes alien so great is constant feel uneasiness right beginning you have feeling that something is wrong crew is not particularly friendly towards each other you truly feel all group tension ship itself is huge worn out industrial style maze halls corridors it feels more like prison than place live it is as if not only alien but also ship itself is against humans alien itself is scariest monster history because it is ruthless soul less parasite completely devoid any human or civilized traits design monster is stroke genius sure it has humanoid form but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence alien is more or less opposite everything human civilized plus creature is more well adapted inhumane interior ship than humans who build it sum up you then have setting where humans are caught web group tensions inhospitable ship perfect killer which thrives ships intestines you almost get feel that humans are ones who are alienated each other their own ship ridley scott tells story with perfectly synchronized blend visuals sounds actors do superb job portraying their characters subtle but very realistic way seven man crew is not bunch hollywood heroes they are ordinary people with strengths weaknesses likes dislikes this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with enemy as mentioned ship is very claustrophobic ridley scott adds eeriness by using camera movement lights shadows effective way living quarters are bright should be comfortable crew but there is something sterile about it all rest ship is basically huge basement music by jerry goldsmith underlines eeriness so well movie wouldnt have worked without his score combined with sounds ship it all adds uneasiness this is not story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil its story about ordinary people facing true fear which is fear without face fear we cant understand cant negotiate with because its only goal is survive expense us its story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by terror its story where people killed completely random way there is no higher order justice behind who gets live who dies all seven characters are just part race where fittest not necessarily most righteous will prevail all seven characters start race equal footing none them are true heroes none them are true villains all above makes alien so great as horror movie terror isnt just alien itself its entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin that you just cant shrug it off after end credits like you can with so many other hollywood horror movies title alien doesnt just refer monster it is theme movie it is feeling you have during after movie 9 10,0.6154225654225653,0.0777604715104715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.54}"
10.0,The mother of all movies,"Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.RATING: 10",mother all movies,back early 20th century lumi re brothers didnt have clue what they were playing with im freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks their work movie like alien would have been made future they both would have died sudden shocked by consequences their labor like honest scientist would if he was shown evil use his research that sense but best way imaginable alien is atomic bomb my opinion alien is only perfect movie history cinema course this could be debatable but all films ive watched since i was born this is only one which i havent been able find slightest flaw it gets golden ten out ten bright solid massive i could go with panegyric but ill try be short accurate direction is just perfect every shot is marvellous every movement camera is breathtaking there is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract touch it you spoil it seriously acting is splendid performances build credible world centuries away i dont know about you but this take future was unveliabably acceptable sigourney weaver is more than revelation john hurt is master rest are nothing short marvellous script is work art story is mesmerizing well constructed well developed free absurd twists its simplicity efectiveness are yet 25 years after be matched atmosphere is pure genius gothic claustrophobic sometimes baroque use light dark is beyond description use sound is as creepy as it gets fx are best possible 1979 time release some scenes were stomach churning score jerry goldsmiths work matches images so perfectly it seems bleed them it is will be best soundtrack sci fi flick space ever tagline space no one can hear you scream this is tagline course alien only alive creature that can steal weaver movie its design is most innovative ive seen it has spawned dozens disgraceful imitations this is real deal not only look but complete design life form including biological features acid instead blood jaws inside jaws what more could you possibly want this is how movie is done very good sign movie that has gone down history is amount collectively well remembered scenes well alien has so many that i wont go into it this movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become icon itself so what else i urge all young directors watch this movie zillion times as ive already done take notes all along but not order rip off it as many others have done but learn learn learn learn learn how movie should be done casablanca you must be joking oh i almost forget theres lovable cat it rating 10,0.610790297339593,0.1965079365079365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,The start of a great anthology,Alien has a slow and mysterious beginning. It starts like nothing special - some people eating and talking on a space ship. But it gets more intense when they detect an unknown planet and land on it so they can explore it. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching.,start great anthology,alien has slow mysterious beginning it starts like nothing special some people eating talking space ship but it gets more intense when they detect unknown planet land it so they can explore it audience has wait more than 1 hour see thing they paid xenomorph this waiting makes its emergence one greatest moments cinematic history still we see xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes alien more mysterious gives movie horror character course another reason we see xenomorph so rarely is because cgi wasnt very well developed at that time it was pretty hard make aliens appearance alien 1979 is great start alien anthology even though bad cgi its best movie whole anthology movie is worth watching,0.6421343537414967,0.14340986394557828,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,"This Ageless, Silent, Haunted House Floating in Silent Space","Before gore, special effects, and the denouement of the alien itself in future sequels, this was the movie that revolutionized the concept of the ""haunted house"" and merged it in a seamless sieve with ""body horror"" and its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space.The story had been done before, in different genres, never veering too far from its horror origins. Lovecraft (and others) had written about expeditions that had gone to ""investigate"" and ""collect important data"" only to find themselves being hunted down one by one, be it an unseen terror or their own fears.Ridley Scott's ALIEN looks and feels like a science fiction movie. However, it is not. Everything in its look and tone suggests horror of a more cerebral kind. When three crew members come across what seems to be a large space-jockey with a thing attached to its face, dead, we feel our stomach turn. If something that small was able to take over a creature this large, they are in deep trouble here. The scene is masterful, restrained, but a classic in the horror-movie sense: it's as if we had been witness to terrible events which had taken place and decided to get to the bottom of it. Scott tightens the noose employing age-old tricks of the horror genre and only once shows blood and guts -- one which follows a calm dinner sequence. He never allows the viewer to get a true glimpse of this sadistic killer much like Spielberg in JAWS and this becomes nerve-wracking because again, fear of the unseen is more powerful than what comes into view. The theory dictates: ""I was afraid of that thing? I thought it was bigger!"" All we see of this alien are his teeth and in one memorable, twisted scene, his tail snaking up Lambert's (Veronica Cartwright) leg. Later on, as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough role), the quintessential Final Girl, makes her escape, it is possible to hear Lambert shrieking. What the alien is doing to her we can only imagine and recoil.",this ageless silent haunted house floating silent space,before gore special effects denouement alien itself future sequels this was movie that revolutionized concept haunted house merged it seamless sieve with body horror its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space story had been done before different genres never veering too far its horror origins lovecraft others had written about expeditions that had gone investigate collect important data only find themselves being hunted down one by one be it unseen terror or their own fears ridley scotts alien looks feels like science fiction movie however it is not everything its look tone suggests horror more cerebral kind when three crew members come across what seems be large space jockey with thing attached its face dead we feel our stomach turn if something that small was able take over creature this large they are deep trouble here scene is masterful restrained but classic horror movie sense its as if we had been witness terrible events which had taken place decided get bottom it scott tightens noose employing age old tricks horror genre only once shows blood guts one which follows calm dinner sequence he never allows viewer get true glimpse this sadistic killer much like spielberg jaws this becomes nerve wracking because again fear unseen is more powerful than what comes into view theory dictates i was afraid that thing i thought it was bigger all we see this alien are his teeth one memorable twisted scene his tail snaking up lamberts veronica cartwright leg later as ripley sigourney weaver her breakthrough role quintessential final girl makes her escape it is possible hear lambert shrieking what alien is doing her we can only imagine recoil,0.633350586611456,0.09558316080055211,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place?,"I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place. Needless to say, given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo, a merchant vessel carrying, if I remember correctly, something like 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore, there was hardly a lack of companionship. At any rate, I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep. It doesn't matter, because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes. That being said, I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail, which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films. No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody, gory death scenes, the alien, masterfully designed, isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design, we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie. Like Jaws, Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation. The Nostromo is a merchant ship, which allows for a non-military crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand. The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds, and so it wakes up the crew to investigate. The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important. The transmission didn't just appear, the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule, because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen. And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financial-minded crew members, it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence. The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect. When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated, they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship, complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair. A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside, creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to. One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs, gets attacked, and is brought back on board the ship. Significantly, protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention. When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite, a new and particularly difficult challenge arises. How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed? And to make matters worse, the very ship is programmed to work against them. They are in the most hostile environment imaginable, worse than anywhere on earth. They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship, and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival. They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on. Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy.Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been (and possibly ever will be) thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel, Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for, the darker, more sinister and dangerous side. The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes. In fact, by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now, you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years. Back then, this was horror/science fiction. Today, it's science fiction/horror. But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today, it is significant that, while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror, the movie has lost none of its powerful effect. Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it, it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right.",whose idea was it bring cat first place,im little confused as why there was cat board first place needless say given that there was entire crew board nostromo merchant vessel carrying if i remember correctly something like 20 000 000 tons mineral ore there was hardly lack companionship at any rate i can easily brush aside my curiosity about effort that went into designing life support system that would have been needed keep cat alive along with rest humans as they traveled months end deep sleep it doesnt matter because cat was involved most scariest scenes that being said i think that one things that really makes alien great is that it explains all twists turns its plot great detail which is almost unheard science fiction horror films no one displays ludicrous behavior allow construction bloody gory death scenes alien masterfully designed isnt rushing across screen every scene allow maximum payoff costume design we dont even see it until well past halfway point movie like jaws alien takes its time allow characters gradually grasp enormity their situation nostromo is merchant ship which allows non military crew be faced with mortal enemy that they do not understand ship intercepts strange transmission that must be intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds so it wakes up crew investigate subtlety way conflict is introduced is very important transmission didnt just appear ship awoke crew months ahead schedule because it was programmed do so should anything like that happen chagrin couple money financial minded crew members it is also their contracts investigate any such occurrence movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly great effect when they reach planet which transmission originated they find spectacular discovery what appears be crashed alien spaceship complete with dead alien pilot still his chair brief look at body suggests that pilot may have exploded inside creating curiosity about his death that movie never satisfies but doesnt need one crew members discovers what look like dozens leathery eggs gets attacked is brought back board ship significantly protocol is broken get him alien life form back board medical attention when they discover that alien has blood that melts through hull ship like thermite new particularly difficult challenge arises how do they kill deadly enemy without making it bleed make matters worse very ship is programmed work against them they are most hostile environment imaginable worse than anywhere earth they are being stalked by unknown creature that they cant injure fear damaging hull spaceship ship itself has placed survival alien life form above their own survival they have trick alien into submission without letting ship know whats going even hal wasnt this creepy released at time when science fiction was probably at most popular that it had ever been possibly ever will be thanks recent release star wars soon follow first sequel alien came along capitalized area science fiction that people evidently were very eager darker more sinister dangerous side side science fiction with bloody deaths rather than light sabers heroes fact by looking at way people probably saw alien 1979 way they see it now you can learn lot about how science fiction horror have evolved over years back then this was horror science fiction today its science fiction horror but while it was more horrible 1979 than it is today it is significant that while other films that have come along over years have overshadowed alien as far as intensity horror movie has lost none its powerful effect rather than reinventing science fiction genre by adding horror it it is now maintaining life science fiction genre by reminding us how good it can be when its done right,0.5899824134199134,0.03151555735930736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,Alien.....the one that started it all........,"Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about....",alien one that started it all,alien creature film legend one that started it all one that led one greatest sequels ever made one that got comic book mini series 2 cross over films with predator this is film without doubt greatest horror film ever created this totally makes halloween look like chicken little you can forget about all those rubbish friday 13th or nightmare elm street movies cause alien just takes horror up so many levels alien we find ourselves distant future with crew just coming back haul 20 million tons ore back earth but while crew members are stasis their ship picks up sos nearby planet once crew is awakened they are forced by company regulations follow that signal then when they land planet it turns out that something terrifying is store them when hostile organism attaches itself one crew members later it becomes clear that crew member was being impregnated then dies horrible violent death deadly breed other worldly life form now rest crew must fight off creature as other classic films should always have alien does great characters course most recognizable one is lead woman ellen ripley who is played then unknown sigourney weaver she provides very human face youre gonna feel like youre actually watching real life woman here it could be because her accent or her mannerisms but as film progresses she develops into more mentally tougher woman while combating alien there are times when she totally keeps it cool times when shes afraid times when shes angry times when its just ripley being ripley thanks weavers acting talents she can really dish out one hell character rest supporting cast are nothing short spectacular parker brett are selfish sarcastic men who only want make profit through most film you can feel tension that ripley parker have lambert who one my favorites here is second woman who happens be opposite ripley total coward dallas who viewer might get vibe that he is main character 1st 15 minutes or so is pretty much leader here kane is tired dead looking guy who is one that carries alien species inside him finally ash is one with sinister purpose you start suspect that hes up no good at some point movie characters need have their own personalities thats what alien has as alien itself well what can i say it is most horrifying creature history cinema period i mean how could you stop it it has acid blood is very lethal fight face face special effects were over 20 years ahead its time face hugger kane looked so freaking real that youre gonna be scared just by looking at it even it doesnt do anything except breathe most time sets couldnt have been better very futuristic yet theres always something ominous dark about them suspense is impossible resist as sequences deliver chills at times when you least expect it when you do expect something happen nothing happens alien is one very few horror films that understands that you cant scare people by raking up bodies blood but you have build up suspense do it director ridley scott is such genius he shows that here he absolutely knows how make any kind film ones that can scare alien one that can sadden thelma louise one that can excite thrill gladiator ridley really keeps up dark atmosphere especially beginning when theres no talking 1st 5 minutes or so we get feeling that somethings not right all time some parts are very quiet very depressing we feel exactly what we see this is legend that im talking about here folks dont miss chance see this because it will scare living daylights outta you more than any other movie youre gonna see your life take my word it im practically movie buff so i know what im talking about,0.544375633232016,-0.0141919959473151,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"

,Exemplary horror (spoilers),"What makes Alien such an effective horror film is how quiet it is. After all, most horror films make the mistake of equating fear with noise. But that's often a mistake, as silence is usually infinitely more effective. And so it is with Alien. The scariest moments are all devoid of intrusive scoring, jagged editing and overblown sound effects. Instead most of the sound and music is pulled out and shots are held for a long time.One of the best examples is when Brett is killed. He has to chase after a cat and he's led into a dark corner of the ship. You know he's going to get killed but Ridley Scott knows that you know. Therefore the sequence is dragged out. All the time you're waiting. You're waiting for the inevitable. But Scott doesn't rush things. He racks up the tension by having Brett wander for an inordinate length of time and by having him wash his face in a shower of dripping water as chains rattle in the background. And when the Alien does appear, it's not with a sudden jolt. It just appears quietly behind Brett before killing him. And the way that the death is played on the face of the cat, which has a look of almost stunned curiosity, makes the whole sequence rather spooky. It's not really a crash, bang, wallop sort of horror film.Not that there aren't plenty of jump moments. There are actually quite a few. But because the lead-up is so quiet and ominous it makes the pay-off a whole more effective. For example, when Kane looks into the egg. Again the sequence takes its time, but when he finally has a peek and the facehugger leaps out, it has the perfect timing of a great joke.Another fantastic piece of timing is when the Alien takes Dallas. You go through another long, drawn out sequence of him scurrying through narrow air vents before the Alien finally pops out of a dark corner. But although the moment is fantastically timed, the lead up is where the fun lies. Although I do have to say that the lead up is probably the most frightening thing in the film. Dallas scurries through narrow corridors trying to take the Alien out, but you know it's futile. And the dark, claustrophobic corridors are full of iris-shaped doors that open and close slowly and forebodingly, which really does add to the air of dread that fills the sequence. And the tracker is the icing on the cake  it racks up the tension to an even greater extent.The second most frightening sequence is when Ripley is finally alone in the ship. She sets the Nostromo to self-destruct so that she can take the shuttle but then with strobe lights flashing she sees the Alien. She then goes back and tries to reverse the self-destruct sequence, but it's too late. It's frightening because Ripley has to run around the ship, not knowing where the Alien might be. No longer does she have the option of just hiding. And with everyone dead she no longer has anyone to talk to or help her out. She's all alone. But perversely, once everyone's dead, the film finally gets loud. There's a countdown sequence (which is brilliant in the way that it adds tension) and the ship begins to destruct. Just when Ripley might have needed the silence to find out where the Alien is, she has to run around in cacophony of noise knowing that the Alien could be anywhere.But the silence comes back in the final sequence, and it's quite ingenious the way that the Alien is camouflaged in the shuttle. I nearly messed myself when I first saw it as a kid.What I also like about the final sequence is that it's weirdly sexual. Ripley strips down to her underwear and then the Alien appears. And the Alien then begins almost stroking the console it's resting on. And of course, Ripley penetrates the Alien a harpoon. Nice.Another excellent bit of weird sexuality is when Ash the robot tries to choke Ripley with a magazine. He shoves it her mouth and he looks rather turned on as she gags on it. Perhaps robots don't come with all the parts. Perhaps this is his way of venting his frustration. But there's also the way that the Alien kills Lambert. Its tail inches up the insides of her thigh and then you cut away and hear her screaming like she's being violated  the screaming is actually pretty damn chilling. And of course, Kane getting ripped open goes back to the male fear of childbirth. (The birth scene is still great. The blood, the sound and the way it takes the Alien two or three attempts to burst through is fantastic. But I do have to say that the way the Alien shoots off the table looks rather dodgy.) Going back to the Lambert killing, though As well as being chilling, this scene is also quite frustrating because Parker (Yaphet Kotto) gets killed as well. I mean, Parker is just The Man. I swear he could have taken the Alien had it not been for the cowardly Lambert. (It's quite surprising that the coward and the black character survive so long  they're usually the first two to go.) But although I dig Parker, I think Ian Holm as Ash delivers the best performance. It's quite subtle the way that he hints at his true identity  I like the way he jogs on the spot to get his joints working. And he's so smug and slimy. He's more of a villain than the Alien.But I think everything in the film is fantastic  the music, the special effects, the sequence on the alien planet, the production design, the moody atmosphere, the script I just wish I had more room to waffle.",exemplary horror spoilers,what makes alien such effective horror film is how quiet it is after all most horror films make mistake equating fear with noise but thats often mistake as silence is usually infinitely more effective so it is with alien scariest moments are all devoid intrusive scoring jagged editing overblown sound effects instead most sound music is pulled out shots are held long time one best examples is when brett is killed he has chase after cat hes led into dark corner ship you know hes going get killed but ridley scott knows that you know therefore sequence is dragged out all time youre waiting youre waiting inevitable but scott doesnt rush things he racks up tension by having brett wander inordinate length time by having him wash his face shower dripping water as chains rattle background when alien does appear its not with sudden jolt it just appears quietly behind brett before killing him way that death is played face cat which has look almost stunned curiosity makes whole sequence rather spooky its not really crash bang wallop sort horror film not that there arent plenty jump moments there are actually quite few but because lead up is so quiet ominous it makes pay off whole more effective example when kane looks into egg again sequence takes its time but when he finally has peek facehugger leaps out it has perfect timing great joke another fantastic piece timing is when alien takes dallas you go through another long drawn out sequence him scurrying through narrow air vents before alien finally pops out dark corner but although moment is fantastically timed lead up is where fun lies although i do have say that lead up is probably most frightening thing film dallas scurries through narrow corridors trying take alien out but you know its futile dark claustrophobic corridors are full iris shaped doors that open close slowly forebodingly which really does add air dread that fills sequence tracker is icing cake it racks up tension even greater extent second most frightening sequence is when ripley is finally alone ship she sets nostromo self destruct so that she can take shuttle but then with strobe lights flashing she sees alien she then goes back tries reverse self destruct sequence but its too late its frightening because ripley has run around ship not knowing where alien might be no longer does she have option just hiding with everyone dead she no longer has anyone talk or help her out shes all alone but perversely once everyones dead film finally gets loud theres countdown sequence which is brilliant way that it adds tension ship begins destruct just when ripley might have needed silence find out where alien is she has run around cacophony noise knowing that alien could be anywhere but silence comes back final sequence its quite ingenious way that alien is camouflaged shuttle i nearly messed myself when i first saw it as kid what i also like about final sequence is that its weirdly sexual ripley strips down her underwear then alien appears alien then begins almost stroking console its resting course ripley penetrates alien harpoon nice another excellent bit weird sexuality is when ash robot tries choke ripley with magazine he shoves it her mouth he looks rather turned as she gags it perhaps robots dont come with all parts perhaps this is his way venting his frustration but theres also way that alien kills lambert its tail inches up insides her thigh then you cut away hear her screaming like shes being violated screaming is actually pretty damn chilling course kane getting ripped open goes back male fear childbirth birth scene is still great blood sound way it takes alien two or three attempts burst through is fantastic but i do have say that way alien shoots off table looks rather dodgy going back lambert killing though as well as being chilling this scene is also quite frustrating because parker yaphet kotto gets killed as well i mean parker is just man i swear he could have taken alien had it not been cowardly lambert its quite surprising that coward black character survive so long theyre usually first two go but although i dig parker i think ian holm as ash delivers best performance its quite subtle way that he hints at his true identity i like way he jogs spot get his joints working hes so smug slimy hes more villain than alien but i think everything film is fantastic music special effects sequence alien planet production design moody atmosphere script i just wish i had more room waffle,0.5786766735679778,0.055992063492063475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,The original masterpiece that launched a dynasty,"As the credits of ""Alien"" open, the slowly paced opening titles and soft, eerie score give some indication of what viewers will experience when watching this film. It starts off so unassumingly that first-time viewers are unlikely to be moved by the story or inspired by the slight character development in the film's first half. It is in fact this lack of certainty that makes ""Alien"" work so well, for as the film hits it second half it shifts dramatically from slow space road movie to an intergalactic haunted house fright show. This flip in drama, pace and tension makes for an unnerving ride into the unknown and results in one of the landmark sub-genre-sci-fi movies of the 20th century. The film is directed by Englishman Ridley Scott, who had a total of one feature and numerous commercials under his belt when he took control of proceedings. Since the success of ""Alien"", Scott has had an uneven career with highlights like ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Gladiator"" and most recently ""Black Hawk Down"" and low points like ""Legend"", ""G.I. Jane"" and the bore-fest ""1492"". ""Alien"" represents the overtly stylistic and slick approach Scott brings to his films, traits that are useful in science fiction but can sometimes seem out of place in more realistic genres. Here Scott retires the glitz and glamour of ""Star Wars"", which had been released two years before ""Alien"". Instead he portrays the spacecraft and crew as nothing more than a cargo ship and a rag tag bunch of intergalactic truckers. This works very well, as the viewer gets the distinct sense of the tedium and oppressive vastness of space travel. The way the crew are so nonchalant about visiting another planet makes the audience feel that yes, perhaps one day man will view space travel with a shrug. The opening scene shows us a huge spaceship, named the Nostromo, returning to earth with 20,000,000 tonnes of mineral ore on board. The crew sleep in hibernation, until the onboard computer awakens them. It seems the computer has picked up a possible distress signal on an alien planet. Under the law of the nameless and faceless 'Company', the crew are obliged to investigate. The waking scene is superbly filmed. Kane (John Hurt) slowly rises, like a chick from and egg. Squinting and only partially awake, slow dissolves from one angle of Kane to another emphasise his delirium and partial consciousness. The final dissolve dissipates to the mess hall. Here we meet the entire crew of the Nostromo for the first time. The ship is led by Dallas (Tom Skerrit), with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as the first officer. Ash (Ian Holm) is the odd, skittish science officer, Kane (John Hurt) is weathered but adventurous, Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the whiny and weak navigation officer, and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) are the engineering grunts. The ship is controlled by Mother, a mute version of HAL 9000 from 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Like ""2001"", the reasons for having humans on board is unknown; they almost seem pointless as the ship can basically control itself. Are they simply pawns or guinea pigs awoken at the will of the computer? They respond to the distress signal after landing on the desolate planet. The beacon is tracked to a derelict spaceship, which Kane, Lambert and Dallas enter. Curious and naïve, Kane wonders into a cavern of eggs. Stumbling on the slippery surface, he slips and comes into contact with the living contents of the egg. With the parasite attached to his face, Dallas and Lambert rush Kane back to the ship. On board Ripley, who is now in command, demands that Kane be kept in quarantine for 24 hours. Against her wishes, the odd Ash lets the three crew in. Upon removing Kane's helmet they find a claw shaped being attached to his face. It eventually falls off and dies and amazingly, Kane awakens, seemingly unscathed. At this stage the film remains slow and ponderous. Intent on getting back to earth, they have one final meal before returning to hibernation. As they eat Kane convulses violently and a creature bursts through his chest. In utter disbelief the crew watch it skuttle away to the far reaches of the ship.From this point the film takes off. Space and distance are enclosed as Scott uses a brilliant mix of close ups and wide angled shots to display the vastness of the Nostromo and the claustrophobia in the crew. The alien and set design are outstanding. The massive sexual overtones of Swiss artist's H.R. Giger's alien and derelict ship are truly breathtaking, as is the futuristic-retro styling of Michael Seymour's sets. Grubby yet cool, the production quality of ""Alien"" is something to admire. It took seven more years before a sequel was made and when James Cameron took over the directing chair he revolutionised the series by making it all out action over spooky sci-fi with ""Aliens"". It may be a better movie, but the original remains a quality stand alone film and a landmark in the sci-fi horror sub genre that has not been matched by any other saga.",original masterpiece that launched dynasty,as credits alien open slowly paced opening titles soft eerie score give some indication what viewers will experience when watching this film it starts off so unassumingly that first time viewers are unlikely be moved by story or inspired by slight character development films first half it is fact this lack certainty that makes alien work so well as film hits it second half it shifts dramatically slow space road movie intergalactic haunted house fright show this flip drama pace tension makes unnerving ride into unknown results one landmark sub genre sci fi movies 20th century film is directed by englishman ridley scott who had total one feature numerous commercials under his belt when he took control proceedings since success alien scott has had uneven career with highlights like blade runner thelma louise gladiator most recently black hawk down low points like legend g i jane bore fest 1492 alien represents overtly stylistic slick approach scott brings his films traits that are useful science fiction but can sometimes seem out place more realistic genres here scott retires glitz glamour star wars which had been released two years before alien instead he portrays spacecraft crew as nothing more than cargo ship rag tag bunch intergalactic truckers this works very well as viewer gets distinct sense tedium oppressive vastness space travel way crew are so nonchalant about visiting another planet makes audience feel that yes perhaps one day man will view space travel with shrug opening scene shows us huge spaceship named nostromo returning earth with 20 000 000 tonnes mineral ore board crew sleep hibernation until onboard computer awakens them it seems computer has picked up possible distress signal alien planet under law nameless faceless company crew are obliged investigate waking scene is superbly filmed kane john hurt slowly rises like chick egg squinting only partially awake slow dissolves one angle kane another emphasise his delirium partial consciousness final dissolve dissipates mess hall here we meet entire crew nostromo first time ship is led by dallas tom skerrit with ripley sigourney weaver as first officer ash ian holm is odd skittish science officer kane john hurt is weathered but adventurous lambert veronica cartwright is whiny weak navigation officer parker yaphet kotto brett harry dean stanton are engineering grunts ship is controlled by mother mute version hal 9000 1968s 2001 space odyssey like 2001 reasons having humans board is unknown they almost seem pointless as ship can basically control itself are they simply pawns or guinea pigs awoken at will computer they respond distress signal after landing desolate planet beacon is tracked derelict spaceship which kane lambert dallas enter curious na ve kane wonders into cavern eggs stumbling slippery surface he slips comes into contact with living contents egg with parasite attached his face dallas lambert rush kane back ship board ripley who is now command demands that kane be kept quarantine 24 hours against her wishes odd ash lets three crew upon removing kanes helmet they find claw shaped being attached his face it eventually falls off dies amazingly kane awakens seemingly unscathed at this stage film remains slow ponderous intent getting back earth they have one final meal before returning hibernation as they eat kane convulses violently creature bursts through his chest utter disbelief crew watch it skuttle away far reaches ship this point film takes off space distance are enclosed as scott uses brilliant mix close ups wide angled shots display vastness nostromo claustrophobia crew alien set design are outstanding massive sexual overtones swiss artists h r gigers alien derelict ship are truly breathtaking as is futuristic retro styling michael seymours sets grubby yet cool production quality alien is something admire it took seven more years before sequel was made when james cameron took over directing chair he revolutionised series by making it all out action over spooky sci fi with aliens it may be better movie but original remains quality stand alone film landmark sci fi horror sub genre that has not been matched by any other saga,0.5479190863337206,0.037635501355013555,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"
