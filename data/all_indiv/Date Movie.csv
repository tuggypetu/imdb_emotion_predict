1.0,Not even Alyson Hannigan can pardon this turkey,"I'd imagine that the main reason that people are paying to watch this is because it stars Alyson Hannigan. Well, she's in it, and she makes the most of a thoroughly unchallenging role, but unless you're a total completist, that shouldn't be enough of a reason to waste even 80 minutes of your life on this appalling waste of talent.What the writer/directors seem to have missed is that if you're going to parody or satirise a scene from a decent movie, you actually have to add something. It's not sufficient to just throw a bunch of stolen scenes together in the hope that the conjunction will generate humour by itself. I honestly could not see one - not ONE - original thought or idea or line in the script or direction. That in itself is something of an achievement. The whole thing plays like it was scripted by teenagers, and not teenagers from the top end of the grade curve.In fact, I have to wonder if this films is deliberately aimed at the lowest common denominator. If so, it missed by several yards to the south.",not even alyson hannigan can pardon this turkey,id imagine that main reason that people are paying watch this is because it stars alyson hannigan well shes it she makes most thoroughly unchallenging role but unless youre total completist that shouldnt be enough reason waste even 80 minutes your life this appalling waste talent what writer directors seem have missed is that if youre going parody or satirise scene decent movie you actually have add something its not sufficient just throw bunch stolen scenes together hope that conjunction will generate humour by itself i honestly could not see one not one original thought or idea or line script or direction that itself is something achievement whole thing plays like it was scripted by teenagers not teenagers top end grade curve fact i have wonder if this films is deliberately aimed at lowest common denominator if so it missed by several yards south,0.4533333333333333,0.0972222222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,"Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low, you get ""Date Movie.""","""Date Movie"" is a movie that spoofs romantic comedies. The movie follows Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) as she goes through all the events that take place in order to marry her prince Grant (Adam Campbell). This process involves meeting the parents, breaking up, meeting the ex-girlfriend, planning the wedding and everything else that the romantic comedy genre has thrown our way. Laughs are supposed to ensue Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low comes ""Date Movie,"" a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in Hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it. ""Date Movie"" is by far the worst pile of crap I have seen in several years and can possibly go down in the history of film as being one of the worst movies ever made.This movie contained zero laughs, none of the spoofs were even remotely funny. It was an insult to anyone who dished out any kind of money to see this film. The saddest part about all of this is that I knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but I didn't think it could ever be as bad as it actually was. All the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time I wanted to find a way to end my life so I wouldn't have to sit through another second of this horrid movie.There really isn't a positive thing I can say about this movie. The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea. Why spoof comedies? Comedies are already funny so why spoof them? This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing ""Date Movie"" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted. While ""Date Movie"" only runs 75 minutes they try to spoof everything they can including Bridget Jones's Diary, Kill Bill, Say Anything, My Best Friend's Wedding, Napoleon Dynamite, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, The Bachelor, Meet the Parents, Sleepless in Seattle, Rize, King Kong, Wedding Planner and so many more. You would think that one joke would work but in all honesty not a single one did. You just sit there staring at the screen, losing your brain cells, and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage.I guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it's not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying ""from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie"" but there is always that small part of me that says it can't be as bad as it looks but in this case it's worse than it looks. It's a train wreck and if anyone finds this movie funny I am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature.This movie took 2 people to write and two people to direct. If I ever meet Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer the writers and directors behind this crap I will demand that they give me my $6.75 back for paying to see this movie. These guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like ""Date Movie."" There should be a law in Hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics and audiences alike that you should be placed in a cell and beaten until you write everyone who watched your film a huge letter of apology. I really wonder what crap can come out of Hollywood next that can be worse than this film.So to sum it up, ""Date Movie"" sucks, plain and simple. Even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed. I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn't walk off the set after the first day of shooting. Why is it that we have to suffer through movies that are this bad? And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a movie like ""Date Movie"" I can totally understand why people aren't going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out. This is the worst film to come out of Hollywood in years even worse than ""Gigli,"" ""Batman and Robin"" and ""You Got Served."" MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Date Movie"" is a 0 out of ten. This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn't have to be tortured like this when they see a movie.",just when you thought hollywood has reached all time low you get date movie,date movie is movie that spoofs romantic comedies movie follows julia jones alyson hannigan as she goes through all events that take place order marry her prince grant adam campbell this process involves meeting parents breaking up meeting ex girlfriend planning wedding everything else that romantic comedy genre has thrown our way laughs are supposed ensue just when you thought hollywood has reached all time low comes date movie movie that proves that anything can be made into film hollywood no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money see it date movie is by far worst pile crap i have seen several years can possibly go down history film as being one worst movies ever made this movie contained zero laughs none spoofs were even remotely funny it was insult anyone who dished out any kind money see this film saddest part about all this is that i knew before seeing this movie that it was going be bad but i didnt think it could ever be as bad as it actually was all jokes fell flat half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time i wanted find way end my life so i wouldnt have sit through another second this horrid movie there really isnt positive thing i can say about this movie first question that comes mind though is who hell came up with idea why spoof comedies comedies are already funny so why spoof them this is question i wondered when i first heard about movie now after seeing date movie i know it cant be done shouldnt even be attempted while date movie only runs 75 minutes they try spoof everything they can including bridget joness diary kill bill say anything my best friends wedding napoleon dynamite how lose guy 10 days my big fat greek wedding hitch bachelor meet parents sleepless seattle rize king kong wedding planner so many more you would think that one joke would work but all honesty not single one did you just sit there staring at screen losing your brain cells wondering how earth someone got money produce this pile garbage i guess you should know that movie is really bad when its not screened critics trailer tries sell you movie by saying 2 6 writers scary movie but there is always that small part me that says it cant be as bad as it looks but this case its worse than it looks its train wreck if anyone finds this movie funny i am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature this movie took 2 people write two people direct if i ever meet jason friedberg or aaron seltzer writers directors behind this crap i will demand that they give me my 6 75 back paying see this movie these guys have no right what so ever make movie when they put out movie like date movie there should be law hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics audiences alike that you should be placed cell beaten until you write everyone who watched your film huge letter apology i really wonder what crap can come out hollywood next that can be worse than this film so sum it up date movie sucks plain simple even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed i despise everyone who was involved with this movie entire cast who somehow read this script said this is going be good interns who didnt walk off set after first day shooting why is it that we have suffer through movies that are this bad hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay 6 10 see movie like date movie i can totally understand why people arent going would be leery what hollywood puts out this is worst film come out hollywood years even worse than gigli batman robin you got served moviemanmenzels final rating date movie is 0 out ten this movie doesnt even deserve 1 because nothing worked at all people shouldnt have be tortured like this when they see movie,0.5200812690396024,-0.13022361511944847,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
1.0,I'm writing this to save you,"Its true. Everything you've read is true. This really, really, really is the worst parody ever. This movie was so bad that I spent the entire ride home from the theater, frustrated that I couldn't come up with the vocabulary to describe how I felt about it. IT IS NOT FUNNY. I, like most other people who have seen it, chuckled a few times. The rare laughs were part genuine enjoyment and part trying to make the best of a horrible situation. On the whole, though, 98% of this movie is just mind-numbingly bad. And not just because it has a lot of toilet humor and fat person jokes. The worst parts of the movie are the ones that are not only devoid of humor, but they just flat out are so stupid they don't make sense. I've never had an experience where I've sat through an hour and a half film and felt like I was watching a bunch of two minute clips of stupidity that had almost nothing to do with each other.

6.0,I thought this movie was pretty funny.,Date movie is the first of three(so far) spoof movies that 2 out of 6 of the writers from the scary movies wrote. This one is probably the funniest of them with its obvious references to the past 10 years or so of romance comedies that have graced and disgraced out screen. The story is about Julia Jones a lonely girl who just wants the perfect romance but her father wants hr to marry a Chinese-German Jew or something like that. She then meets the love of her life and all is well until his ex fiancée comes into the picture. I recommend this film over Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans for it is funny and direct but they still can not get away from thinking that dancing from famous characters is really funny. Oh well just watch this movie and TRY NOT to think for a change is that too hard.,i thought this movie was pretty funny,date movie is first three so far spoof movies that 2 out 6 writers scary movies wrote this one is probably funniest them with its obvious references past 10 years or so romance comedies that have graced disgraced out screen story is about julia jones lonely girl who just wants perfect romance but her father wants hr marry chinese german jew or something like that she then meets love her life all is well until his ex fianc e comes into picture i recommend this film over epic movie meet spartans it is funny direct but they still can not get away thinking that dancing famous characters is really funny oh well just watch this movie try not think change is that too hard,0.5773809523809523,0.128968253968254,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
2.0,"Wow, something crappy this way comes","This won't be a long review, as this movie doesn't warrant much more than a warning not to waste your money on it. I'm not sure how a movie so god-awful can make it to screen, but my faith in the system has been shaken. The film isn't funny, I'm not sure if it tries to be or not, but it's not. It references other movies (Meet the Parents, When Harry met Sally etc.) but doesn't really spoof them. This was the biggest problem I believe, as it doesn't have any semblance of flow or sense. Random scenes pop up, trying to get a laugh by basically reenacting the scene, not exaggerating it or making fun of it. I managed to sit through House of the Dead, but this film actually made me angry it was so unfunny. Please skip it, have one of your friends go see it instead and then ask about it. If they don't knock your teeth out for setting them up to lose money and 90 minutes of their life, then you can go see it yourself.",wow something crappy this way comes,this wont be long review as this movie doesnt warrant much more than warning not waste your money it im not sure how movie so god awful can make it screen but my faith system has been shaken film isnt funny im not sure if it tries be or not but its not it references other movies meet parents when harry met sally etc but doesnt really spoof them this was biggest problem i believe as it doesnt have any semblance flow or sense random scenes pop up trying get laugh by basically reenacting scene not exaggerating it or making fun it i managed sit through house dead but this film actually made me angry it was so unfunny please skip it have one your friends go see it instead then ask about it if they dont knock your teeth out setting them up lose money 90 minutes their life then you can go see it yourself,0.5266339869281046,-0.08970588235294116,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,An erudite analysis of contemporary feline culture,"In an age where cinema is bogged down with lighthearted fare like 12 Years a Slave and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, comes a refreshingly original exploration of what it means to be one of the feline species. I feel sincerely that the director and writers should be extremely proud of taking on such a difficult topic with such aplomb, to say nothing of the fantastic cast, who breathe rich life into such well rounded characters.But really, the star of this piece is Jinxers. For too long have felines been forced to live in the shadow of their canine cousins. Often portrayed as ruthless, evil creatures hellbent on world domination. Finally, thanks to a shrewd script we witness the true side of the cat world. Intelligence, creativity and sexual prowess.To say that the feline defecation scene exemplifies cinematic art at it's finest would be an understatement. Creatively shot, it carefully depicts the skill and mental ability that cats bring to this world. With deft scripting we are able to witness a side of the feline not previously shown on celluloid. For too long have bigots trodden the cat name into the ground with falsehoods about litter boxes and small piles of faeces in the gardens of fellow neighbours. Finally the truth is revealed.At a time when Oscar nominations are going to such hacks as Robert De Niro, Jinxers executes his role perfectly. With subtle movement and flare he conveys the emotional trauma of cat crappery. People have dared to suggest to me that Jinxers is, in fact, animatronic. How offensive. Such a skilled performance could only be accomplished by such a fine thespian and people should miss his work at their peril.This movie is an unrequited masterpiece and I am appalled that this ever shallow world of low brows and Daniel Day Lewises more people are unable to recognise such fine artistry.",erudite analysis contemporary feline culture,age where cinema is bogged down with lighthearted fare like 12 years slave boy striped pajamas comes refreshingly original exploration what it means be one feline species i feel sincerely that director writers should be extremely proud taking such difficult topic with such aplomb say nothing fantastic cast who breathe rich life into such well rounded characters but really star this piece is jinxers too long have felines been forced live shadow their canine cousins often portrayed as ruthless evil creatures hellbent world domination finally thanks shrewd script we witness true side cat world intelligence creativity sexual prowess say that feline defecation scene exemplifies cinematic art at its finest would be understatement creatively shot it carefully depicts skill mental ability that cats bring this world with deft scripting we are able witness side feline not previously shown celluloid too long have bigots trodden cat name into ground with falsehoods about litter boxes small piles faeces gardens fellow neighbours finally truth is revealed at time when oscar nominations are going such hacks as robert de niro jinxers executes his role perfectly with subtle movement flare he conveys emotional trauma cat crappery people have dared suggest me that jinxers is fact animatronic how offensive such skilled performance could only be accomplished by such fine thespian people should miss his work at their peril this movie is unrequited masterpiece i am appalled that this ever shallow world low brows daniel day lewises more people are unable recognise such fine artistry,0.571031746031746,0.06423417851989281,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"
1.0,I would pay someone to kick me in the balls for paying to see this movie.,"This movie is one of the most horrible experiences of my life. With once having sat through twelve hours of constipation, I have yet to sit through a dump that was more excruciatingly painful than watching this two hour film. The worst part is it isn't even two hours, it's eighty minutes, but it makes you feel like you must have aged four or five years through this. I feel they must have added in Sophie Monk and Carmen Electra not because of their amazing acting talent, but because they felt the humor was so poor they needed to wake people up from this painfully dumb movie. The audience's reaction to the film provided more laughs than the actual movie itself. I can't decide whether I find it comical or depressing that this film managed to parody movie scenes and make them worse. Truly, the people saying these writers aren't talented are wrong, it takes an art to be able to make something this bad. The movie is a complete non sequiter too. In one scene, after the family has toasted at the rehearsal wedding dinner table, Lil' Jon comes in and says, ""What? Yeah. Okay."" and that's the punch line. Seriously, Hotel Rwanda was funnier than this movie. The film also contains tons of gross out humor, with a man coughing up a hairball, a woman with a hairy back, and a cat humping a corpse. Real clever guys. This is the kind of stuff that makes angels cry, and kills orphan babies. I would've walked out of this monstrosity had it not been for me hoping that maybe, just maybe, it might be slightly enjoyable than the previous torturous minutes. I mean you know something is wrong when the funniest part of a movie is a cat crapping into a toilet. This film is only really a mess of parodies thrown together that don't make any sense. I really have to say it's as witty as it gets when Frodo delivers a swift kick to the nads of Gandolf, and he screams, ""My precious!"" Finally, the ending seemed to have been thrown in to make an attempt to give the male audience a boner so maybe the wouldn't come out of the theater asking for a gun. No, the worst travesty is not that I spent $6.75 on this movie, but that I will never be the same person I was before. This is the stuff nightmares are made of. Don't go see this under any circumstances. If your significant other wants to see this, fake your death. Anyway you can get out of this movie is truly a blessing.P.S. My cellphone started ringing during the movie. Why, oh why didn't I pick it up?

1.0,Alyson Hannigan Deserved Better,"Are you short for cash, Alyson? Is that why your beautifal face had to be seen on screen in this joke of a parody movie? I went to this movie with high expectations. I mean very high. I am a sucker for the parody genre. Ever since The Naked Gun films and Airplane!, Wrongfully Accused, Spy Hard, Scary Movie.. I've been a nut for these types of movies. So why was this one so bad? I can't really explain.. I saw all the movies they parodied, and still.. it just wasn't funny. I am absolutely in love with Alyson Hannigan. She's a very beautifal and very talented actress. Eddie Griffin is one of the funniest comedians to grace the silver screen in years. And please, Lil' Jon is in the movie! What's not to like? Well, the fact that basically, a lot of the parodies were just word for word retellings of some of the movies. The dinner scene was an ENTIRE ripoff of the Meet the Parents scene to a t. This movie tries too hard to be funny, and at sometimes its okay (the Pimp My Ride scene comes to mind), but honestly.. it just tries too hard and doesn't go anywhere. I can't say I was disappointed, it was beyond that.

There were so few laughs in this supposed comedy. They few chuckles I heard from the audience was a nervous laughter (as in, ""I can't believe I wasted my money on this...""). The toilet humor (literally) was simply retarded, and a few jokes almost worked... if they were funny. Pretty much all of the characters were annoying, and most of the parodies themselves were just unfunny. I really don't know what could have been done to save this movie and actually make it funny.

2.0,Easily the worst parody I've ever seen.,"""I didn't think it would be that bad,"" Mr. Shade remarked as we walked out of the theater, despondent over the fact that 80 minutes of our lives were wasted and there was nothing we could do about it. ""I'd say that's the worst parody I've ever seen,"" he continued.I couldn't agree more. And I like parodies. When they're funny. Unlike ""Date Movie,"" a film whose severe lack of humor suggests that the script couldn't have taken much more than an hour to write. I understand that it can be hard to write good comedy, but at least put forth an effort. I'm sorry, but was I supposed to laugh when Alyson Hannigan popped a huge zit on her face and the force of the ""stuff"" coming out catapulted her through a wall? That's funny? No, no it isn't.Like I said, it's hard enough to write good comedy. And yes, I sincerely believe that ""stupid"" comedy CAN be funny, so don't even bother claiming I'm just some snobby reviewer who can't appreciate stupid humor. Believe me, I can - I enjoyed ""Scary Movie 3"" for goodness' sake! But it's even harder to cleverly satirize movies that are funny in the first place. Perhaps it's just a special brand of talent that can take funny scenes from existing movies and make them completely unfunny. Congratulations writers! If that was your goal then you succeeded.I don't know; maybe it's me. I guess I should blame the fact that nowadays my comedic standards call for something more than a cat having sex with a human corpse. I didn't realize anybody on earth would find that humorous, but it looks like I was wrong. And I suppose I've gotten to the point in my life where extended scenes involving a cat with diarrhea just don't put a smile on my face.I was also under the impression that the ""I'll have what he's having"" joke had run its course, but the writers of ""Date Movie"" have proved that no joke is too old or tired for them. Nor will anything stop them from dragging a scene out way beyond an acceptable length. Oh look, Eddie Griffin's face just slid up and down Fred Willard's hairy chest and Eddie pulled a hairball out of his mouth, and it only took him two or three extremely unfunny minutes to get to the big ""payoff."" Wow, talk about funny. Ha. Ha. My gut just busted. I better see a doctor.A girl sticks a cherry stem in her mouth and pulls out a carousel, and I'm supposed to laugh? Hardy har har. Uh-oh, it's shock value time! They're talking about a vaginal thermometer that has been in the family for generations and how for good luck it can't be washed. Please, try not to hurt yourself from laughing too hard. These guys are pushin' the envelope and walkin' the edge! As gross and ridiculous as all that is, the worst is when some old woman is having a romantic dinner with a fake cat and later makes out with it. Uh-huh. That's high quality stuff right there ... IF YOU HAVE THE IQ OF KEVIN FEDERLINE! Sheesh. Are you getting the picture? If you're reading this and thinking, ""Man, all that sounds hilarious!"" then I weep for our future. But if you're sitting there with a look of disgust because you can't believe that somebody greenlighted a budget for this tripe then you know to avoid this like Paris Hilton with the plague, and you give me hope.Mrs. Shade had to stay at work late, but she quickly headed straight from work to the theater, arriving just in time for the screening. After the movie, she grimaced and said, ""I rushed over here for this?"" I can't fault her anger. At least she didn't have to pay to see the movie. Just imagine if you go to the trouble to drive to the theater AND shell out at least $8 a ticket. Please, learn from our painful experience.

6.0,Actually Not as Bad as I Expected,"I really dislike the ""Scary Movie"" series, and since this is same group of idiots, I assumed I'd hate this film, too. But despite the fact I wanted to hate it, and despite the fact it really was awful, I still feel fairly entertained. And best of all, the film was really short (roughly 73 minutes).The bad: The is film is nothing more than 50 other movies (mostly romances or chick flicks) strung together in a very exaggerated way. So if you are looking for something unique, this is the last place you want to check. The acting is also rather poor, and the soundtrack seems to be just Kelis and the Pussycat Dolls repeated over and over. I would not take a date to see this ""date movie"" unless she was 12, but then I'd have bigger problems than this movie.The good: I sadly must admit I enjoyed the cat using the toilet. At first it was stupid, but they stretched the scene way beyond the time necessary. Sometimes when you repeat a bad joke long enough it becomes great. For me, this was that moment. Also, this film featured two of my three favorite Buffy actors. Alyson Hannigan was beautiful and fun, and less obscene than in the ""American Pie"" movies. And Tom Lenk shows up in a cameo appearance as Frodo Baggins, a scene that makes no sense with the rest of the movie but I found to be juxtapositionally hilarious. If only this film also had Michelle Trachtenberg.The ugly: The disgusting parts were actually much less than in the Scary Movie series. Other than pimple joke, I think the only really gross thing was the way this film portrayed fat people. A fat joke here or there I can understand, but they stretched the jokes to the limit with this movie and it was rather nauseating.Don't rent this movie. Although if you like the stupidity that passes for humor these days, this might be up your alley. Heck, I deplore this film and still confess I laughed out loud at least twice. But don't tell anyone I said that, because this movie is not good.",actually not as bad as i expected,i really dislike scary movie series since this is same group idiots i assumed id hate this film too but despite fact i wanted hate it despite fact it really was awful i still feel fairly entertained best all film was really short roughly 73 minutes bad is film is nothing more than 50 other movies mostly romances or chick flicks strung together very exaggerated way so if you are looking something unique this is last place you want check acting is also rather poor soundtrack seems be just kelis pussycat dolls repeated over over i would not take date see this date movie unless she was 12 but then id have bigger problems than this movie good i sadly must admit i enjoyed cat using toilet at first it was stupid but they stretched scene way beyond time necessary sometimes when you repeat bad joke long enough it becomes great me this was that moment also this film featured two my three favorite buffy actors alyson hannigan was beautiful fun less obscene than american pie movies tom lenk shows up cameo appearance as frodo baggins scene that makes no sense with rest movie but i found be juxtapositionally hilarious if only this film also had michelle trachtenberg ugly disgusting parts were actually much less than scary movie series other than pimple joke i think only really gross thing was way this film portrayed fat people fat joke here or there i can understand but they stretched jokes limit with this movie it was rather nauseating dont rent this movie although if you like stupidity that passes humor these days this might be up your alley heck i deplore this film still confess i laughed out loud at least twice but dont tell anyone i said that because this movie is not good,0.5706845238095237,-0.05431547619047618,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.2}"
3.0,They should have fired these two writers as well.,"I have enjoyed the Scary Movie parodies to varying extents, finding in each installment at least a few laugh out loud moments. Date Movie provided two maybe three light chuckles. That was it.The best they could come up with for a clever tag line in the poster art was ""From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie."" Uh okay. Well, why'd you keep these two? It was honestly like they didn't even try. I could write a better parody than this and, since I'm not a good enough writer to be hired by a studio, I just have to assume that the writers are capable of better.There was nothing original. They were drawing such a creative blank that they spent a good five minutes having the camera watch a hand-puppet cat squirm around on a toilet seat. They interspersed fart sounds and quick shots of facial expressions from the stars. Oh yeah, that made it better.A good parody will take the existing content it is lampooning, and present it in a humorous way by providing ironic twists. Here they simply made sets, costumes and situations similar enough for you to recognize the source material and then either laid vulgarities or toilet humor on top of it. There's no thought in that. Just pitiful.Comedy of this nature almost always demands a straight man. In silly parodies, the straight man is often the least absurd of the various characters. In the Scary Movie series, star Anna Faris carried this role well. She's not up to a Leslie Nielsen standard yet, but she's getting better with each installment. Her delivery, her deadpan, her timing are all very nice. In Date Movie, Alyson Hannigan cannot do this at all. She used a total of two facial expressions to convey her character's reaction to each situation. It just became annoying.I think Hannigan has proved herself to be a charming actress, not without talent. So I'll assume that the problem here was the two writers. Hopefully they'll now go join the other four.",they should have fired these two writers as well,i have enjoyed scary movie parodies varying extents finding each installment at least few laugh out loud moments date movie provided two maybe three light chuckles that was it best they could come up with clever tag line poster art was 2 6 writers scary movie uh okay well whyd you keep these two it was honestly like they didnt even try i could write better parody than this since im not good enough writer be hired by studio i just have assume that writers are capable better there was nothing original they were drawing such creative blank that they spent good five minutes having camera watch hand puppet cat squirm around toilet seat they interspersed fart sounds quick shots facial expressions stars oh yeah that made it better good parody will take existing content it is lampooning present it humorous way by providing ironic twists here they simply made sets costumes situations similar enough you recognize source material then either laid vulgarities or toilet humor top it theres no thought that just pitiful comedy this nature almost always demands straight man silly parodies straight man is often least absurd various characters scary movie series star anna faris carried this role well shes not up leslie nielsen standard yet but shes getting better with each installment her delivery her deadpan her timing are all very nice date movie alyson hannigan cannot do this at all she used total two facial expressions convey her characters reaction each situation it just became annoying i think hannigan has proved herself be charming actress not without talent so ill assume that problem here was two writers hopefully theyll now go join other four,0.5469901168014374,0.10685534591194971,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"

8.0,"It's a PARODY, and a very good one!","People really need to realize that in order for a parody to be good, it has to be cheesy and in other words, bad. I know it's a paradox, but that is the only genre it is actually applied to. I was surprised to see the average rating of all newer parody stuff on IMDb: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, etc. They all have 2.something average rating and it's mostly because people are not well informed on the whole concept of this genre.For a parody to be successful, it has to take elements from real life and/or movies/other media that are seemingly serious, but cheesy, little overrated, over the top, inaccurate, ignorant, full of prejudice... etc. So, the good mocking of this just HAS to go a bit further to make the vague inaccuracies more obvious and laughable. I think that this movie succeeded in that. Everything that is bad or over the top is INTENDED to be so, hence, planned and I like it.Alyson Hannigan and Adam Campbell have good chemistry and acting skills and I enjoyed their performances very much. Adam is an underrated actor and he needs more recognition overall. Also, the cast is full of talented parody performers, like Jennifer Coolidge, Eddie Griffin and Tony Cox.For anyone who doesn't particularly find romantic comedies good, and considers them cheesy and overrated, this is the film. It's particular 'victims' are precisely romantic comedies, mostly My Best Friend's Wedding, Meet the Fockers, Wedding Planner, Hitch, Bridget Jones' Diary, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and most wedding films.Alyson Hanigan's character is named Julia Jones, parody of Bridget Jones and Julia Roberts, and Adam Campbell plays Grant Fockyourdaughter, parody of Hugh Grant and Fockers. Sophie Monk's character is parody of Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and typical 'bitch' characters, Tony Cox is Hitch, Julia's family is mostly parody of My Big Fat Greek Wedding family with all national prejudice in it. All the characters are hilarious and deliver their puns on time. I was laughing all the time, it's so on spot about all romantic clichés. The moment at the end, with all the most cheesy love declarations ever is my favorite, I can't restrain from laughing hard at that point.Also the films contains Jinxters, the most disgusting cat you just have to LOVE! Let's just mention he doesn't restrain from gerentophilia and necrophilia. His scenes are so disgustingly nauseous, but one of the funniest ever! I will probably never get tired of watching this and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good laughter and mocking romantic clichés.It's 9/10 in everything it was supposed to be no matter what critic say!",its parody very good one,people really need realize that order parody be good it has be cheesy other words bad i know its paradox but that is only genre it is actually applied i was surprised see average rating all newer parody stuff imdb date movie meet spartans epic movie vampires suck etc they all have 2 something average rating its mostly because people are not well informed whole concept this genre parody be successful it has take elements real life or movies other media that are seemingly serious but cheesy little overrated over top inaccurate ignorant full prejudice etc so good mocking this just has go bit further make vague inaccuracies more obvious laughable i think that this movie succeeded that everything that is bad or over top is intended be so hence planned i like it alyson hannigan adam campbell have good chemistry acting skills i enjoyed their performances very much adam is underrated actor he needs more recognition overall also cast is full talented parody performers like jennifer coolidge eddie griffin tony cox anyone who doesnt particularly find romantic comedies good considers them cheesy overrated this is film its particular victims are precisely romantic comedies mostly my best friends wedding meet fockers wedding planner hitch bridget jones diary my big fat greek wedding most wedding films alyson hanigans character is named julia jones parody bridget jones julia roberts adam campbell plays grant fockyourdaughter parody hugh grant fockers sophie monks character is parody julia roberts my best friends wedding typical bitch characters tony cox is hitch julias family is mostly parody my big fat greek wedding family with all national prejudice it all characters are hilarious deliver their puns time i was laughing all time its so spot about all romantic clich s moment at end with all most cheesy love declarations ever is my favorite i cant restrain laughing hard at that point also films contains jinxters most disgusting cat you just have love lets just mention he doesnt restrain gerentophilia necrophilia his scenes are so disgustingly nauseous but one funniest ever i will probably never get tired watching this i highly recommend it anyone who loves good laughter mocking romantic clich s its 9 10 everything it was supposed be no matter what critic say,0.5439460784313728,0.12917892156862745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.25}"

1.0,Don't eat before watching this film.,"I believe the title speaks for itself. Date Movie has indeed earned a well deserved place in IMDb's bottom 100. The film is packed with disgusting images that would make any decent human being sick to his or her stomach. From the cat humping a nearly mummified corpse to Eddie Griffin spitting out a mammoth hairball in slow motion, the humor in this movie is downright distasteful. Sure, everyone needs a dumb comedy to laugh at once in a while, but there is nothing funny about the family cat raping Grandma's freeze-dried remains.There are several moments in this movie that could be funny were they not dramatically overdone. For instance, when the cat is sitting on the toilet with diarrhea for two whole minutes. It was comical for the first thirty seconds, but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end. Even more so is the opening sequence when Alyson Hannigan is dancing through the street in a fat-suit. No offenseI'm a bit on the heavy side myselfbut no one wants to see a soaking wet obese woman dancing on her hands and knees. In the dinner scene, Adam Campbell's orgasmic and continuous shouts of ""YES!"" are awkward to watch. Judah Friedlander plays Nicky, a fat slob covered from head to toe in grease stains who states one of the most disgusting lines of the film, ""When I think about the honeymoon my sac gets all tingly and s--t."" That's just nasty. Carmen Electra's parody of Paris Hilton's car washing commercial for the Hardee's thick burger is sickening and it is shown in at least four flashbacks throughout the film. It's simply overkill.To its credit, this film does have some key elements that most audiences enjoy in a movie. Boy meets girl, boy thinks girl is beautiful, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl face obstacles in their relationship, boy and girl overcome said obstacles, and they all live happily ever after. Sadly, this film could have been something enjoyable, but it instead we are faced with this warped piece of trash that only the most sick and uncouth can laugh at. This is a movie that will mean absolutely nothing to future generations (if it even exists to them at all). Yes, it had potential, but it turned out to be something repulsive.Really, Date Movie doesn't deserve the attention it's getting from me writing this review. I'm trying to impress upon all movie-goers what a saddening waste of time this film is. I heard warnings from friends, critics, and fellow movie buffs, but like an idiot I watched it anyway. Don't make the same mistake I did.

1.0,The first scene is a good indication... (spoilers),"'Date Movie' continues the seemingly never ending franchise of comedies intended to lump together every cliché from recently popular films, a trend set off by the 'Scary Movie' series. The story essentially follows a hopeless over-weight girl (Alyson Hannigan) who spends about 80 minutes trying to find true love. What might actually seem like a good couple of laughs, at least judging from the trailers, actually falls apart fairly quickly.

1.0,Horrible movie,"My friends and I went into this movie expecting something along the lines of a dumb but funny movie like ""Scary Movie"" or ""Not another Teen Movie"".Sad to say, this was the worst movie I've seen since the beginning of 2005. DO NOT see this movie and DO NOT believe the advertisements for this movie as those scenes were the best parts of the film. I admit, I laughed during the Napoleon Dynamite skit, but that was probably the only funny scene in the whole film.This film is stupid, but not stupid in a funny way. It is stupid in an EXTREMELY boring way. The only (barely) entertaining parts of the movie were in the first 10 minutes. The rest of it was filler as the scriptwriter probably ran out of dumb ideas.I, along with probably most of the audience, felt like leaving on the spot. This is a bad film with no redeeming features.",horrible movie,my friends i went into this movie expecting something along lines dumb but funny movie like scary movie or not another teen movie sad say this was worst movie ive seen since beginning 2005 do not see this movie do not believe advertisements this movie as those scenes were best parts film i admit i laughed during napoleon dynamite skit but that was probably only funny scene whole film this film is stupid but not stupid funny way it is stupid extremely boring way only barely entertaining parts movie were first 10 minutes rest it was filler as scriptwriter probably ran out dumb ideas i along with probably most audience felt like leaving spot this is bad film with no redeeming features,0.7333333333333334,-0.12499999999999999,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,Not worth your money,"I'm glad I saw this movie for free, because I would not dish out $2 to see it. The acting is horrible and the parodies of the other movies are not done well. I don't think I laughed more than twice the entire movie, and even those were small chuckles. The soundtrack used in the movie is comprised of simply played out songs that have appeared in many movies already. Even though the point of the movie was to have shocking plot twists by referencing various pop culture ideas and movies, the movie was completely predictable at all times. The only thing that kept me watching this movie was Alyson Hannigan herself.Save your money on this one.",not worth your money,im glad i saw this movie free because i would not dish out 2 see it acting is horrible parodies other movies are not done well i dont think i laughed more than twice entire movie even those were small chuckles soundtrack used movie is comprised simply played out songs that have appeared many movies already even though point movie was have shocking plot twists by referencing various pop culture ideas movies movie was completely predictable at all times only thing that kept me watching this movie was alyson hannigan herself save your money this one,0.5535714285714286,-0.007812500000000003,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1.0,In a Word: Awful,"I took my sister to see this movie on President's Day when we both had the day off. I was expecting a funny movie in Scary Movie fashion. What I got was this piece of crap that was a complete waste of an hour and a half and my 6.50. What's the problem? Oh where to begin...first of all, the plot is stupid. It's simple enough, I guess, but there's so many random things that just don't make sense (the random weird flashbacks during the Kill Bill sequence, for one). I don't know if it's just that the parody genre is being stretched so thin that there isn't anything left anymore, or if this movie was just bad writing. The acting isn't terrible, though some is cringe worthy. I think they tried so hard for going over the top that the jokes turn out disgusting, offensive, gratuitous, and just plain not funny. Nearly every sequence with ""Jinxers"", the Jones family cat, are horrid and disgusting. Nearly 98% of the jokes I had to tell my sister I would explain to her when she was older. And to complete it all, I was in a theater full of teenage boys, and not one of them laughed once, which goes to show how much the film falls on its face. The only time the audience gave a half-hearted chuckle was during the Mr. and Mrs. Smith sequence. So save yourself the time and money. Skip this absolute zero.",word awful,i took my sister see this movie presidents day when we both had day off i was expecting funny movie scary movie fashion what i got was this piece crap that was complete waste hour half my 6 50 whats problem oh where begin first all plot is stupid its simple enough i guess but theres so many random things that just dont make sense random weird flashbacks during kill bill sequence one i dont know if its just that parody genre is being stretched so thin that there isnt anything left anymore or if this movie was just bad writing acting isnt terrible though some is cringe worthy i think they tried so hard going over top that jokes turn out disgusting offensive gratuitous just plain not funny nearly every sequence with jinxers jones family cat are horrid disgusting nearly 98 jokes i had tell my sister i would explain her when she was older complete it all i was theater full teenage boys not one them laughed once which goes show how much film falls its face only time audience gave half hearted chuckle was during mr mrs smith sequence so save yourself time money skip this absolute zero,0.5588988095238093,-0.1641071428571429,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"

1.0,Awful Movie,"My four other friends and I wanted to see a movie that would make us laugh and have a good time. We narrowed it down to Pink Panther or Date Movie. We decided on Date Movie. We went to the theater about 15 minutes early and when we first came in we were the only ones there, which surprised us. By the time the movie started, there were only three other groups of people, which surprised us. By ten minutes into the movie, we were no longer surprised. The movie was horrid. It was full of disgusting jokes, and not just in a sexual way. I was surprised anyone even bothered making this movie. About 45 minutes in, I was disgusted and bored. My friends were, too. I'm not the type to walk out during a movie. I never have before, but this movie was a waste of my time, the 11 bucks I spent on the ticket, and the five bucks I spent on popcorn/ candy. I have never seen a movie as bad as this one, and I have seen a lot of bad movies. Usually I'm not this prude, but this movie made me worry about our generation.",awful movie,my four other friends i wanted see movie that would make us laugh have good time we narrowed it down pink panther or date movie we decided date movie we went theater about 15 minutes early when we first came we were only ones there which surprised us by time movie started there were only three other groups people which surprised us by ten minutes into movie we were no longer surprised movie was horrid it was full disgusting jokes not just sexual way i was surprised anyone even bothered making this movie about 45 minutes i was disgusted bored my friends were too im not type walk out during movie i never have before but this movie was waste my time 11 bucks i spent ticket five bucks i spent popcorn candy i have never seen movie as bad as this one i have seen lot bad movies usually im not this prude but this movie made me worry about our generation,0.5718106995884774,-0.1140946502057613,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.21}"
