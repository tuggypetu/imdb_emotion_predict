3,"I'm BEGGING you, please make Rated R movies","Movies like Venom and Morbius need to be Rated R. They would be significantly better if they weren't restrained. And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.But that's far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as a PG-13 movie. So why didn't I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup for me. It didn't even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.Unfortunately this movie is a complete mess. It's poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is barely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome, entertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: ""The action was gibberish."" You couldn't see anything.I really tried to like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And the climax/conclusion has zero impact.The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and the visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots are visually appealing.After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side universe has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of making great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)The mid-credits scenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony Marvel universe. I can't come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to their universe of origin. But for the Vulture, that's the MCU. So why would he switch?On top of that, they have this super weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesn't flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He seems to be ""a good guy,"" but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that they're not know to be a villain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesn't feel right.1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us with the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the fans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.I have to ask, what were they thinking?",im begging you please make rated r movies,movies like venom morbius need be rated r they would be significantly better if they werent restrained weve now seen multiple highly successful rated r superhero movies deadpool logan im begging movie studios have courage go all out but thats far only reason this movie failed me venom was still awesome as pg 13 movie so why didnt i love this i love superhero movies i love vampire stuff this should have been layup me it didnt even have be good entertaining cool would have been enough unfortunately this movie is complete mess its poorly made most aspects story is disjointed dialogue is basic character depth is barely there relationships are superficial but all this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome entertaining action scenes my friend put it best action was gibberish you couldnt see anything i really tried like this movie i tried forgiving poor quality hopes some mindless entertainment but it never came climax conclusion has zero impact only things that stood out me as positives are one early action scene visuals during action scenes action itself is terrible but effects during some slow mo shots are visually appealing after fantastic start with venom 8 stars spider verse 8 stars sony marvel side universe has faltered with venom carnage 5 stars failed with morbius please do better i know you are capable making great movies 1 viewing opening thursday 3 31 2022 spoilers also spider man no way home mid credits scenes are puzzling they show sky splitting effects no way home vulture transfers sony marvel universe i cant come up with any logical reason this would happen no way home they sent everyone back their universe origin but vulture thats mcu so why would he switch top that they have this super weak sinister six setup it doesnt flow with where character morbius is at end this movie he seems be good guy but now he wants join villain gang i guess you could argue that theyre not know be villain gang at this point but as viewer it doesnt feel right 1 post credit scene venom carnage teases us with possibility beast tom hardy as venom vs mcu spider man 2 immediately followed by middle finger fans when no way home cancels that possibility by sending venom home 3 now this morbius mid credit scene debacle i have ask what were they thinking,0.48939594356261024,0.1697971781305114,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
6,Simple start...,"""Morbius"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Morbius"" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.",simple start,morbius is action adventure movie which we watch dr michael morbius biochemist trying find cure behind extremely rare blood disease he infects himself he is completely changed by it i have admit that i do not understand reason behind low rating this movie i am not saying that its masterpiece it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating i can understand that its small duration didnt help main character evolve i believe that there was not enough time end it interpretations both jared leto who played as dr michael morbius matt smith who played as milo were good their combination worked very well sum up i have say that morbius is nice entertaining action movie i recommend you watch it because i am sure you will enjoy it i advise you lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed,0.49646825396825395,0.10833333333333332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"
1,An absurd movie,"I collected comics, specifically Marvel/Spider-Man. Spidey was my favorite and this character, Morbius, was one of my favorite to battle Spider-Man. This aside, I won't bother presenting my detailed autopsy of this travesty. I will say that they strayed too far from the original story and made things convoluted.

3,An absolute mess,"Morbius is one of those rare films that pretty much gets everything wrong.The story, the character development, the action... everything about it felt very dated and messy, with practically no redeeming qualities to be found anywhere.There was no depth to any of the characters which made it so hard to get invested in what was going on. In truth I don't think any of the performances were bad per se, but they were all so bland.It didn't help the characters that the writing was so poor. They had no faith in the audience at all, spoon feeding us exposition in the most clunky ways imaginable.The action was truly dreadful. It was either in super slow-mo which exposed the poor CGI, or it was at super speed to the point you were just watching blurs.The story was so basic and formulaic. I hate to say it but I was actually bored watching it. The pacing also felt very off, as the film came to a very abrupt end, before subjecting us to some bonkers credits scenes.I can forgive bad writing. I can forgive bad action. I can forgive a weak plot. But there is one thing in a film I can't forgive and that is when it leaves me bored. As a result Morbius scores a measly 3/10.",absolute mess,morbius is one those rare films that pretty much gets everything wrong story character development action everything about it felt very dated messy with practically no redeeming qualities be found anywhere there was no depth any characters which made it so hard get invested what was going truth i dont think any performances were bad per se but they were all so bland it didnt help characters that writing was so poor they had no faith audience at all spoon feeding us exposition most clunky ways imaginable action was truly dreadful it was either super slow mo which exposed poor cgi or it was at super speed point you were just watching blurs story was so basic formulaic i hate say it but i was actually bored watching it pacing also felt very off as film came very abrupt end before subjecting us some bonkers credits scenes i can forgive bad writing i can forgive bad action i can forgive weak plot but there is one thing film i cant forgive that is when it leaves me bored as result morbius scores measly 3 10,0.5818181818181819,-0.1779040404040404,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.26}"
3,A profoundly bad movie. Sony is 100% guilty of false advertising. Early review.,"This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then skip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and advertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood disease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go head first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared over the past two years.Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this film. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive meddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a disaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men Origins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. It's just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I don't know if the director, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief of Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous production that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony.",profoundly bad movie sony is 100 guilty false advertising early review,this is early review there are no plot details spoilers here however if you want go completely clean then skip rest this review not that there is anything reveal basic set up as depicted trailers advertising is that michael morbius is doctor marvel universe who is afflicted by rare gruesome blood disease setting out find cure himself others his ilk he winds up becoming vampire proceeds go head first into adventures same vicinity spider man this is all marketing material that has appeared over past two years speaking trailer there is zero connection other marvel movies nor mcu this film essentially everything you saw trailers does not exist this movie like at all this is studio executive meddling false advertising at its pinnacle terms technical filmmaking this is mess action is disaster it harkens back disastrous comic book entries days yore la horrific fan4stic x men origins wolverine thor2 green lantern its just one messy cgi pg13 cut scene after another i dont know if director daniel espinosa or studio are blame however given fact that tom rothman perpetrator chief sony was also head 20th century fox back when they were churning horrific movies my money is that disastrous production that is morbius is be blamed tom rothman his henchman suits at sony,0.4833333333333334,-0.19777777777777777,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
6,Overdone CGI and editing aside- I enjoyed this one,"Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10.",overdone cgi editing aside i enjoyed this one,entertaining very atmospheric morbius manages serve up yet another helping campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws ill start off with problems i had with this film that mainly being its blatant editing cgi i know many people say this about lot superhero films but coming horror lovers perspective as well as fitting atmospheric tone life director daniel espinosa seemed pair within it this movie really should have been rated r it feels like sony really did censor edit this one as much as they could have with blood violence being as limited as possible it takes away experience as whole one moment particular where man acts like his throat is cut open but there is literally nothing there unsurprisingly as with case with lot films like this cgi can be bit overused at times most part i liked look vampire blood hungry morbius taken by jared leto but other similar cgi at times that cgi itself can feel bit too ugly forced comfort fight scenes towards end particular are also overdone with cgi i just really wish sony would have let people working this film give some life project instead worrying about its box office gross i know ive complained lot so far but terms film i oddly did enjoy this one most part sure its messy matt smiths character is bit over top it has some formulaic moments but it is very entertaining film leto arjona give their all their performances it has lot cool ideas concepts that are interesting see fleshed out screen particularly with morbius particular as he begins learn how control himself theres lot humanity hidden beneath surface this film though even with some formulaic moments theres lot depth heart put into titular character it really allows you empathize both with films story as well as leto screen end i enjoyed morbius it is far perfect but it was solid superhero endeavor im curious see what they may do with this character next my rating 6 3 10,0.45032203907203905,0.14453983516483518,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5,Snore-bius,"Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed.Will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges.....You know when a studio knows that a film may be in trouble, when they plaster the Marvel name everywhere on the poster, just in case nobody knows who Möbius is. And this film is a lot of trouble.It's nowhere near as bad as a lot of reviewers have said, but its the same as saying a hammer to the foot is better than the hand. It's clunky, unfunny, and worse of all, boring.Leto looks so uninterested with his character, and lacks the oomph that Möbius needs. Yes, whilst he is in vampire form, it's undeniably pretty cool to look at, but its all CGI and only took a green screen and Leto wearing a few ping pong balls. So Leto is a major problem, he's a good actor, and has been in some fascinating films, but this is him just phoning it in.The rest of the cast are okay, Smith is really chewing the scenery with his Milo, and whereas in other films he would grate like Ruby Rhod, he brings some much needed life to the film when he's ever in it.The nods to the MCU are so in your face, that it makes you wonder if the studio thought the audience would forget it's in the MCU. There is a daily bugle, and then the end credit sequences that are only there just to reiterate to the audience that they are watching another MCU film.The boat is named the Murnau a nod to Nosferatu, Möbius uses his lab like a gym, a reference to The fly. This just makes you want to watch those films, because they are infinitely better.And if the slow motion was taken out of this film, it would only be fifteen minutes long, there is that much in this film.It's too dark to be camp, too self-absorbed to be funny, and this is what the film desperately needs.It's one of those films that you will go back to again and again, just for the 'what the' factor.It's not the poorest comic book movie ever made, the remake of Fantastic Four holds that crown, but it's on a par with Superman 4 and Batman & Robin, rubbish, but for some reason you can't help but watch it every once in a while.",snore bius,dangerously ill with rare blood disorder determined save others suffering his same fate dr morbius attempts desperate gamble while at first it seems be radical success darkness inside him is unleashed will morbius succumb his mysterious new urges you know when studio knows that film may be trouble when they plaster marvel name everywhere poster just case nobody knows who m bius is this film is lot trouble its nowhere near as bad as lot reviewers have said but its same as saying hammer foot is better than hand its clunky unfunny worse all boring leto looks so uninterested with his character lacks oomph that m bius needs yes whilst he is vampire form its undeniably pretty cool look at but its all cgi only took green screen leto wearing few ping pong balls so leto is major problem hes good actor has been some fascinating films but this is him just phoning it rest cast are okay smith is really chewing scenery with his milo whereas other films he would grate like ruby rhod he brings some much needed life film when hes ever it nods mcu are so your face that it makes you wonder if studio thought audience would forget its mcu there is daily bugle then end credit sequences that are only there just reiterate audience that they are watching another mcu film boat is named murnau nod nosferatu m bius uses his lab like gym reference fly this just makes you want watch those films because they are infinitely better if slow motion was taken out this film it would only be fifteen minutes long there is that much this film its too dark be camp too self absorbed be funny this is what film desperately needs its one those films that you will go back again again just what factor its not poorest comic book movie ever made remake fantastic four holds that crown but its par with superman 4 batman robin rubbish but some reason you cant help but watch it every once while,0.5553382663847778,0.04706659619450317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.26}"

7,Turned out to be rather enjoyable...,"I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching ""Morbius"" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.But then the movie was delayed and delayed again, and once finally out a lot of bad reviews were swarming the movie, so I was actually somewhat reluctant and hesitant about actually sitting down to watch it. But I decided to ignore the bad reviews and go see how the movie would treat the comic book character.Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless managed to put together a fair enough storyline. I will say that it was aimed more at an audience fully and wholly unfamiliar with the Michael Morbius character. And I can understand that approach to the first movie with the character, as to introduce a whole new audience of viewers to the character, and not go in on the deep end and do fan service to us whom have been reading the comic books for years.Personally I had hoped for a bit more in terms of story, but it was actually adequate enough in terms of entertainment. An origin story for a character new to the cinema screen is in its place, I suppose.I was also somewhat hesitant about it being Jared Leto to don the mantle of the living vampire, given the swing and miss performance of Joker in the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"", but then again he was amazing in the 2000 movie ""Requiem for a Dream"". Thankfully, then his performance as Michael Morbius was quite good and actually was suitable for the character from the comic books.Visually then you are in for quite a treat, given the fact that this is a Marvel movie. The CGI and special effects are quite impressive in the movie, as they are in all Marvel movies. So if you enjoy flashy CGI and special effects, then ""Morbius"" doesn't disappoint.All in all, then I will say that I was more than adequately entertained by the 2022 movie ""Morbius"", though I had hoped for a bit more in the story department. But hopefully the future will add more layers to the character and his story.My rating of director Daniel Espinosa's 2022 movie lands on a seven out of ten stars.",turned out be rather enjoyable,i have admit that i had really been looking forward watching morbius ever since i saw first trailer having been reading comic books i will say that michael morbius is one my favorite marvel characters so it was nice that character was finally brought big screen but then movie was delayed delayed again once finally out lot bad reviews were swarming movie so i was actually somewhat reluctant hesitant about actually sitting down watch it but i decided ignore bad reviews go see how movie would treat comic book character writers matt sazama burk sharpless managed put together fair enough storyline i will say that it was aimed more at audience fully wholly unfamiliar with michael morbius character i can understand that approach first movie with character as introduce whole new audience viewers character not go deep end do fan service us whom have been reading comic books years personally i had hoped bit more terms story but it was actually adequate enough terms entertainment origin story character new cinema screen is its place i suppose i was also somewhat hesitant about it being jared leto don mantle living vampire given swing miss performance joker 2016 suicide squad but then again he was amazing 2000 movie requiem dream thankfully then his performance as michael morbius was quite good actually was suitable character comic books visually then you are quite treat given fact that this is marvel movie cgi special effects are quite impressive movie as they are all marvel movies so if you enjoy flashy cgi special effects then morbius doesnt disappoint all all then i will say that i was more than adequately entertained by 2022 movie morbius though i had hoped bit more story department but hopefully future will add more layers character his story my rating director daniel espinosas 2022 movie lands seven out ten stars,0.49072230238896913,0.21218053551386887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.38}"
3,"""I... am... Venom""? Movie, just because you aim low doesn't mean you can reach it, not if you're gonna put in this little effort","Dr Michael Morbius(Jared Leto, playing the role fairly lowkey, perhaps to avoid reminding people of Juggalo Joker. ...I mean, he's playing a vampire. Just saying, iIt's not unreasonable to expect some ham) has a rare blood disease. He figures that the answer is bats, and tests it on himself. Let's be honest, who of us wouldn't do that, in that situation? Of course, it goes wrong and he becomes a creature of the night, which is a slight upgrade from merely dressing, talking and moving like one.I am at this point slightly concerned that I may have made this sound more interesting, complex, and unconventional, than it actually is. In a lot of ways this feels like it should have come out 15 to 20 years ago. It's been in development for that amount of time, so maybe they just didn't do that much to change it anytime recently, to keep it up-to-date, since this is a subgenre that has evolved tremendously in that time? Without a doubt if this had come out one to two decades ago, we would be looking at it as a product of its time, rather than something that is completely out of date. It still wouldn't be good. Not even close. But we'd be going easier on it than we, rightfully, are now.Clearly Matt Smith is enjoying himself. And his enthusiasm is infectious. For a while I was thinking, ""it doesn't really fit with the rest of what's on screen but it is fun watching him metaphorically dance all over the place"". And then he started doing that literally. On more than one occasion. In separate scenes. The action is decent, although the meh, and at times possibly unfinished, special effects do make it harder to make out. This was clearly trimmed down, and a lot of the things we were excited about from the trailers are either majorly altered or a scene that is now just a clip with narration.I recommend this to those who miss the bad old days of the first Ghost Rider flick. 3/10.",i am venom movie just because you aim low doesnt mean you can reach it not if youre gonna put this little effort,dr michael morbius jared leto playing role fairly lowkey perhaps avoid reminding people juggalo joker i mean hes playing vampire just saying iits not unreasonable expect some ham has rare blood disease he figures that answer is bats tests it himself lets be honest who us wouldnt do that that situation course it goes wrong he becomes creature night which is slight upgrade merely dressing talking moving like one i am at this point slightly concerned that i may have made this sound more interesting complex unconventional than it actually is lot ways this feels like it should have come out 15 20 years ago its been development that amount time so maybe they just didnt do that much change it anytime recently keep it up date since this is subgenre that has evolved tremendously that time without doubt if this had come out one two decades ago we would be looking at it as product its time rather than something that is completely out date it still wouldnt be good not even close but wed be going easier it than we rightfully are now clearly matt smith is enjoying himself his enthusiasm is infectious while i was thinking it doesnt really fit with rest whats screen but it is fun watching him metaphorically dance all over place then he started doing that literally more than one occasion separate scenes action is decent although meh at times possibly unfinished special effects do make it harder make out this was clearly trimmed down lot things we were excited about trailers are either majorly altered or scene that is now just clip with narration i recommend this those who miss bad old days first ghost rider flick 3 10,0.4795380545380544,0.1088013838013838,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"

1,A toothless and inept Marvel offering,"Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.An incredibly inept feature from director Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand casts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the Marvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI, amateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that can't come to an end quick enough.Failing as an origin story, with Michael's entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene, an unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, it's hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its potentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role that begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is nothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story that's hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out of the cinema.Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does there's snippets of what might have been found within them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but that's not the case with Espinosa and Leto's blockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the only slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smith's villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout most of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone else is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.Undoubtedly developed by Sony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how anyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest movie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for Leto's charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite possibly the worst Marvel film we've yet seen.Final Say -Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even the most pessimistic of pundits could've expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without purpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden away slumber.1/2 a blood bag out of 5.For more reviews visit

7,Morbius is another interesting yet scattered offering from the Sony-verse that delves into the more horror aspects of this anti hero.,Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse. Some hate it because it's not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.,morbius is another interesting yet scattered offering sony verse that delves into more horror aspects this anti hero,much like venom it seems people are going either love or hate anything sonyverse some hate it because its not mcu still uses characters mcu spiderverse some love it its more dark delivery darker comedy i actually enjoy what sony is doing by making movies more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded most part mcu rarely touches those important details morbius is very much like first venom its set up gives nice origin story with some intriguing body horror more gruesome than normal imagery comic book film definitely has some scattered plot pieces but its serviceable also leaves more room expansion world if sonyverse leto was great imo still proves hes fantastic actor visuals are very effective vibrant overall film is what i expected it was solid,0.5644444444444444,0.18808080808080813,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"

5,two of us against many,"Greetings again from the darkness. Trust the science, they said. Dr. Michael Morbius is a brilliant doctor/scientist who has devoted his life to formulating a cure for the rare and crippling blood disease he and his friend Milo were born with. This is an origin story pulled from the Marvel comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa (LIFE 2017, SAFE HOUSE 2012) with a script adapted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who previously collaborated on DRACULA UNTOLD (2014) THE LAST WITCH HUNTER (2015) and GODS OF EGYPT (2016). Sometimes past work tells you what you need to know.An opening sequence features the always cool shots of a helicopter zipping around the water and cliffs of Costa Rica, before landing at the mouth of a cave that houses zillions (I counted) of vampire bats. The brilliant Dr. Morbius plans to blend vampire at blood with human blood in his latest try at finding a cure. All of his work is funded by the ultra-rich and equally suffering Milo, both men desperate for relief from their deteriorating bodies. We flashback 25 years to a clinic in Greece where young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2016) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by Dr. Nikolis (Jared Harris, ""Mad Men"").Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, who is known in Marvel comics as ""The Living Vampire"", so we kinda know where things are headed. It's a surprisingly subdued performance by an actor renowned for his characterizations that are anything but. His grown-up friend Milo is played by the always entertaining Matt Smith, and Morbius' love interest and research partner is Dr. Martine Bancroft (an excellent Adria Ariona). You've probably guessed that the blood blend works ... right up until it turns Morbius into a blood thirsty killing machine. This puts FBI agents played by Tyrese Gibson and (master of wisecracks) Al Madrigal on his trail. And yes, we know this is headed to the high noon (or midnight) showdown between childhood blood buddies and it's the do-the-right-thing Morbius versus the 'hey, I like this superhuman power' Milo.The first segment of the film does a terrific job of setting the stage, but the story, the characters, and the execution let us down for the final two acts. The fight scenes feature some of the worst special effects I've seen in years. Sure, the film's release has been delayed a couple of years, but that's no excuse for what we see. On the bright side, some of the effects do work, and Matt Smith is fun to watch in a couple of his scenes. We do wish for more of Martine's story, and for a better story overall (after the intro). The film is part of the SSU (Sony Spider-man Universe) and perhaps its best comparison is VENOM, sans the chuckles. It's clear this film's mission was to set the stage for a sequel, and that becomes even more obvious in the mid-credit scenes. Normally, I wouldn't mention this, but since the director has already discussed, and an appearance was made in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, I believe it's fair game. The great Michael Keaton pops in as Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture), giving us an indication where the sequel is headed.Opening in theaters April 1, 2022.",two us against many,greetings again darkness trust science they said dr michael morbius is brilliant doctor scientist who has devoted his life formulating cure rare crippling blood disease he his friend milo were born with this is origin story pulled marvel comic book characters created by roy thomas gil kane film is directed by daniel espinosa life 2017 safe house 2012 with script adapted by matt sazama burk sharpless who previously collaborated dracula untold 2014 last witch hunter 2015 gods egypt 2016 sometimes past work tells you what you need know opening sequence features always cool shots helicopter zipping around water cliffs costa rica before landing at mouth cave that houses zillions i counted vampire bats brilliant dr morbius plans blend vampire at blood with human blood his latest try at finding cure all his work is funded by ultra rich equally suffering milo both men desperate relief their deteriorating bodies we flashback 25 years clinic greece where young michael charlie shotwell captain fantastic 2016 milo joseph esson first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by dr nikolis jared harris mad men jared leto stars as dr michael morbius who is known marvel comics as living vampire so we kinda know where things are headed its surprisingly subdued performance by actor renowned his characterizations that are anything but his grown up friend milo is played by always entertaining matt smith morbius love interest research partner is dr martine bancroft excellent adria ariona youve probably guessed that blood blend works right up until it turns morbius into blood thirsty killing machine this puts fbi agents played by tyrese gibson master wisecracks al madrigal his trail yes we know this is headed high noon or midnight showdown between childhood blood buddies its do right thing morbius versus hey i like this superhuman power milo first segment film does terrific job setting stage but story characters execution let us down final two acts fight scenes feature some worst special effects ive seen years sure films release has been delayed couple years but thats no excuse what we see bright side some effects do work matt smith is fun watch couple his scenes we do wish more martines story better story overall after intro film is part ssu sony spider man universe perhaps its best comparison is venom sans chuckles its clear this films mission was set stage sequel that becomes even more obvious mid credit scenes normally i wouldnt mention this but since director has already discussed appearance was made spider man no way home i believe its fair game great michael keaton pops as adrian toomes aka vulture giving us indication where sequel is headed opening theaters april 1 2022,0.554507986344721,0.2437010042112083,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
