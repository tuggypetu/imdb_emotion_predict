10.0,Just wow,"When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it.

10.0,Benchmark forever.,"The Matrix - 1999This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.",benchmark forever,matrix 1999this was real change filmmaking like watching it again 2020 i e after 21 years it still feels fresh iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up if we say it sci fi at its best it wont be wrong hype was real it is still not easy match level matrix where we experience connection humans science that too with amazing action fight chase scenes not just normal scenes they were multiple exposures slow motion 3d moves oh my god its understandable as well like what are characters up what storyline they are entering into script was very well written executed otherwise it could have been mess special appreciation managing theme with those black color costumes scientific zone with unimaginable equipment props doing unbelievable things two worlds created no spoilers but action scenes climax where protagonist goes save someone agents are really breathtaking technology used at its best salute wachowski brothers team creating this masterpiece it will be great competition motivation as well many films coming future,0.47556935817805385,0.23473084886128368,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,A watershed moment in film-making – and what a kick-ass masterpiece,"** May contain spoilers **There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a ""liberator"" or even a ""messiah"" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",watershed moment film making what kick ass masterpiece,may contain spoilers there arent many movies i watched theatre twice let alone same day but immediately after credits had rolled still pumped up by rage against machine i queued up next screening matrix i was so blown away by that film i feared probably rightly so that i hadnt caught every detail what id just seen i later found out that many my friends had had similar reaction film i know virtually no one who liked film didnt watch it at least twice its simply one those rare films that are so rich you just have watch them several times structure style concept matrix was ground breaking it marked first time visual style manga comic books anime such as akira or ghost shell had been successfully translated live action film apart blade runner which has totally different mood pace but is also masterpiece visionary film making there simply hadnt been anything even remotely like it jaw dropping action sequences have such raw gripping energy they feel like adrenalin overdose but unlike most action films they never overshadow story contrary they enhance it make complete sense within that universe as story itself i think this is one most original fascinating sci fi tales youll likely ever see screen clearly inspired by japanese anime manga yet also by authors like isaac asimov or philip k dick story about humanitys war against its own creation machines artificial intelligence that have evolved point where they have become dominant species vastly superior their creators could take place same world as blade runner or terminator albeit several hundred years later but there is also mythical even religious undercurrent story themes prophecy liberator or even messiah make matrix transcend science fiction genre become even more unique matrix was watershed moment filmmaking every respect even though two inferior sequels have left bit stain film they cant distract what uncompromising hugely influential masterpiece this is sci fi movies that were released after matrix have tried very hard achieve similar look tone but original still owns them all 10 stars out 10 favorite films masterpieces tv shows reviewed,0.48043022682445746,0.1723488850892697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 -

9.0,A sci-fi action thriller milestone,"'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox",sci fi action thriller milestone,matrix may not be one very greatest examples its genre like 2001 metropolis blade runner back future star wars original trilogy alien aliens but that it is revolutionary how its visuals use sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied it is not film be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth with forced underdeveloped love subplot between neo trinity being matrixs sole weak spot this ended up not being that huge problem me because everything else is so well executed particularly striking about matrix is its production values simply put film looks amazing its audacious production design dazzling special effects that are some most ultra cool imaginative exist super slick editing often jaw dropping cinematography so much more than film with ground breaking special effects use camera work that broke boundaries use sound was also striking how pulsating hypnotic music score was used andy larry wachowski direct adeptly while script is intelligent mix complex well explored themes mysticism philosophy even lewis carroll story is often invigorating intensely taut with smart concept brilliantly done action is superbly shot edited way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense breathless its energy kung fu has rarely been more vertigo inducing despite how this sounds this is not bad thing as it added hugely intensity paranoia storys atmosphere film keanu reeves is one his best most iconic roles has never looked cooler certainly has not looked this comfortable while before then carrie anne moss is strong even better are imposingly charismatic laurence fishburne also one his best roles amusing joe pantoliano deliciously wicked hugo weaving summing up not one best genre but mile stone nonetheless great one followed by two sequels both nowhere near same ball park 9 10 bethany cox,0.6178354978354978,0.3865367965367965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever,"My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing."" Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character.

10.0,"20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....",20 years release some random thoughts revisiting matrix spoiler its still brilliant,20 years after its release several years since i last saw it some reflections experience rewatching matrix no particular order 1 it still look great i mean this is one amazing stylish looking phone very little about look film has dated mobile phones obviously neos computer very briefly couple visual effects creak but otherwise this looks as amazing at it did release its sumptuous 2 i think i was one many who misjudged keanu reeves all those yeas ago i made easy jokes about his vacant stare apparent intelligent this vantage point we can see hes been good number successful intelligent films its also become clear that within industry he as reputation as decent hardworking man who is pleasure work with 3 its apparent again how literate cine literate film is i knew this 20 years ago but since then ive seen lot more films read lot more books this time around i especially loved way film nods its head other film genres influences i noticed lot peckinpah did i see nod kurosawa there too i was reminded that english literature graduate like me this is goldmine quotes allusions references 4 seen 20 years its influence cinema since is clear theres lot we could talk about here but i was especially struck by how indebted director like christopher nolan is keeper flame intelligent blockbusters especially with inception 5 id forgotten that narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about neos identity until just before end im not sure this really works anyone whos read many books or ever done anagram will not find that most suspenseful part narrative 6 despite run time 2 quarter hours it never flags attention never wonders film fizzes with kinetic energy time flies by its lean film without wasted moment 7 film is course packed with religious allusions when i wrote chapter this my ba theology dissertation i said i thought film was neo bhuddist forgive pun please i stand by that rewatching course theres lots allusions christian other theology matrix spawned some really bad reading film by christians which has never really stopped when will some christians learn read film book etc with integrity understanding what film is trying do its spiritually confused mish mash film but still gloriously entertaining one 8 all these years later it turns out matrix was somewhat prophetic about role technology would play our lives humans permanently plugged networks different layers reality that are somehow more real than what we think as real wachowskis saw all that more coming 20 years ago artists are weather vane society we really should learn pay attention them 9 bottom line i still bloody love this film im trying work out if i have requisite strength revisit sequels,0.5171216475095787,0.1777658045977011,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Welcome to the Real World.,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",welcome real world,without doubt one best most influential movies all time matrix is defining science fiction film 1990s biggest leap genre has taken since stanley kubricks 2001 space odyssey ridley scotts blade runner matrix is ground breaking motion picture that not only raised bar all science fiction films come after it but also redefined action genre with its thrilling action sequences revolutionary visual effects film tells story thomas anderson computer hacker that world hacking goes by alias neo when he is contacted by mysterious outlaw morpheus having always questioned his reality he is awakened truth that world hes been living is simulated reality called matrix that hes nothing more than slave this dystopian world created controlled by i powered machines direction script by wachowskis is fantastic as they drew ideas inspirations every other great sci fi cyberpunk movie anime before film combining it with stunning action putting it into one picture that has enough style substance subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation story research that went into preparation screenplay is quite extensive but manner which it is presented big screen is also very impressive every character presented film has well defined arc purpose their motivations are clear cinematography is impeccable it was very innovative use camera angles movements zooms slow motion captures different color palette used differentiate matrix real world editing is flawless as it makes sure that every scene is integral story ensures pace film stays ferocious through its entire runtime each frame is also packed with so much visual information viewer devour visual effects introduced us bullet time effect their impact can still be felt todays movies performances are also incredible each member cast gave their best performances brought characters they portray life but one that stands out most is hugo weavings disciplined rendition his character agent smith powerful computer program made search destroy human rebellion undoubtedly greatest performance his career conclusion matrix is masterpiece everyone should see it is one most thought provoking inventive pioneering influential stylish movies all time its also full philosophical religious allegories waiting interpretation immortal its contribution cinema pop culture its brilliant combination inventive visual effects excellent vision exquisite action easily makes it one best most influential most entertaining movies ever made,0.566765873015873,0.3822916666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,One of my favorites,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",one my favorites,at first i wasnt interested seeing matrix but after hardly hearing any bad reviews it believe me i hear bad reviews every movie i enjoy i decided give it try at first although i really loved fights graphics characters plot confused me anyone confused by plot at all should go www knowthematrix com youll find out everything you could want know by second time i watched it i really understood it which made movie even more enjoyable i really loved this movie just about every character good or bad is very interesting cool acting was excellent even though i think this was keanu reeves at his best best acting jobs were done by laurence fishburne morpheus carrie anne moss trinity hugo weaving did excellent job as agent smith joe pantoliano was great as cypher as well plot is one best movie plots ive seen movie accountant by day computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake that we are actually giant computer program run by robots that we created course order them get power not only that but he finds out that he is one who is according prophecy going put end it greatest thing is that you learn things just as neo does so you can really relate his character my favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it you will learn more about it i guarantee this some may not like this movie because plot is too complicated but i recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away,0.586685463659148,0.2643170426065163,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.27}"

,"What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.

10.0,The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come,"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.",benchmark all sci fi films come,story reluctant christ like protagonist set against baroque mtv backdrop matrix is definitive hybrid technical wizardry contextual excellence that should be benchmark all sci fi films come hollywood has had some problems combining form matter sci fi genre there have been lot visually stunning works but nobody cared about hero or nobody simply cared about anything there few though which aroused interest intellect but nobody ooh ed or aah ed at special effects with matrix both elements are perfectly en sync not only did we want cheer heroes victory we wanted them bludgeon opposition not only did we sit awe as neo evaded those bullets limbo rock fashion we salivated but what makes matrix several cuts above rest films its genre is that there are simply no loopholes script written by wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky kung fu sequences were deftly shot something even bruce lee wouldve been proud photography was breathtaking i bet if you had cut every frame reel had it developed printed every single frame would stand its own acting maybe not best keanu reeves but name me actor who has box office appeal but could portray uneasy vulnerable protagonist neo t way reeves did but come think it if you pit any actor beside laurence fishburne youre bound confuse that actor bad acting as morpheus mr fishburne is simply wicked shades his mentor role higher learning nobody exudes that aura quiet intensity than mr fishburne his character battle scarred but always composed morpheus is given extra dose mortality he loves neo fault only mr fishburne can flesh out people will say what they want say about how good matrix is but bottomline is this finally theres philosophical film that has cut through this generation my generation wachowski brothers probably scribbled little p s note when they finished script saying think moment about your existence what is matrix you ask something thats closer reality than you think either that or its my personal choice best film all time,0.5265873015873017,0.15828373015873015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Still hip as heck even after 20 years,"You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo.

I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene.

10.0,"Agent Smith: Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.","The Matrix is a high concept film, that succeeds in its endeavour with awesome cinematography. Deserving of its praise, though not perfect.The concept and the villains are what I love most about it. Everything about the agents excellent, Hugo Weaving gives his best performance. Cypher who's Judas, the true villain of the film, the most sensible. The character development and the choice of casting in regards to Trinity, the only real weakness of the film. I feel like we could of got to know the Neo character some before this, we have no idea what he's thinking at any point, all we know is that he was the greatest hacker and that's because he's the one. The trinity character's too butch, the other female crew member in a lesser role too, what's with this? Like Cypher, I would rather just go back into the Matrix. I get that you become hardened in a certain environment, but I don't see that as the case here. So Trinity loves Neo and he has to love her back, okay.

10.0,The world of computers,"Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human rebellion.This was excellent beginning to the franchise and probably the only good film out of the trilogy.

10.0,"The more you watch it, the better it gets","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too.",more you watch it better it gets,wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie its brilliant movie number different levels directing is excellent camera work is great visuals are stunning kung fu is acting is executed with style conviction plot is truly inspired its really hard use enough superlatives this movie itd be 10 10 except ending having neo do what he does at end really lets it down my opinion however theres couple sequels way so lets see what wachowskis can do make up it other than that like i said above movie is operating so many different levels that each time you watch it you pick up something new this isnt by accident either wachowski brothers had actors read number definitive works simulation simulcra was one i believe modern literature psychology applied liberal dashings aspects major religions provide best sci fi movie decade if not ever im yet meet somebody who hasnt enjoyed it its my favourite movie watch good cinema system too,0.500439174352218,0.3098539745278876,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.21}"
,A great epic that sets the stage for the next level in sci-fi...,"Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George Lucas, you may have just met your match... :)",great epic that sets stage next level sci fi,who is say what is real or not we are defined by our view reality no matter how twisted or demented it is comparison normal people evil eye yes i see you all looking mirror trying decipher whether or not your view is reality we all share matrix not only supplies world with whole new level special effects mixed with style substance it also brings whole new meaning word paranoria this is one those great epics that becomes milestone our present day world mark which just about everybody can appreciate not since original starwars trilogy has science fiction film reached across almost entire population gripped it with awesome special effects great sound overall feel ground breaking movie making magic it also serves up good dose paranoid delusions we all need our lives every now then with that i leave you with fact that ive seen more different types people liking this one film than most other films date move over george lucas you may have just met your match,0.5535154500671742,0.2271383788625168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!,"Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one.
