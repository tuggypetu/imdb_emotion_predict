10.0,"""Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*""","That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant ""hungry for more."" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful. I appreciate the positive feedback from everyone!

10.0,One of Pixar's best,"This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks' latest release, SHREK III. In many ways, this is very ironic, as one of Pixar's best films, MONSTERS INC., was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success. I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie, people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC. was an exceptional film. Now, Pixar gets some payback with one of their best, RATATOUILLE.Actually, RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film, though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES. The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative--I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film (something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II). Plus, after years of making CG movies, the look is taken to a whole new level in this film--it just looks breathtaking.Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors. Sure, it can be enjoyed by the kids, but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept (illegitimate birth) and includes a swear word (though not one the really ""bad"" ones, you can be sure). Also, while the rats are kind of cute (and a marketer's dream), most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes. No, instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities--something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC. to be seen (incorrectly) as ""just a kid's movie"".Amazing animation, excellent writing and, the rarest of rare, a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered. I can't wait to see it again.",one pixars best,this film is exactly what pixar needed steal thunder dreamworks latest release shrek iii many ways this is very ironic as one pixars best films monsters inc was overwhelmed when it was released due first shreks success i honestly think if shrek hadnt been such wonderful movie people would have noticed that monsters inc was exceptional film now pixar gets some payback with one their best ratatouille actually ratatouille is probably pixars best film though i did enjoy toy story ii incredibles reason i was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original creative i simply cannot compare plot any other film something you can do with incredibles toy story ii plus after years making cg movies look is taken whole new level this film it just looks breathtaking now i need point out that ratatouille is not as much kids movie as its predecessors sure it can be enjoyed by kids but story line is tad darker covers adult concept illegitimate birth includes swear word though not one really bad ones you can be sure also while rats are kind cute marketers dream most rest story isnt there are no catchy kids tunes no instead this film is aimed more at teens adults its sensibilities something that really helped make shrek financial gold mine cursed monsters inc be seen incorrectly as just kids movie amazing animation excellent writing rarest rare completely original captivating plot make this winner film that will be long remembered i cant wait see it again,0.585463478320621,0.4003102453102452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Among the Greatest Animated Features,"The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him.

10.0,Best Animated Film in Creation,"The combination of Disney and Pixar never ceases to amaze, but with Ratatouille, their newest effort, animated features are brought to new heights with the best one to date. Ratatouille is stunning, surreal while at the same time realistic, and a joy to watch. The writing is, in one word, just amazing, and the voice acting is sensational. The characters are poetic and real, and the rats are some of Disney/Pixar's cutest creations. Ratatouille is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), and features stellar voice acting from Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, and Janeane Garofalo.Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is a little rat who dreams of becoming a chef just like his idol, the human Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett). After a mishap, Remy loses his family in the sewers and comes upon a fading restaurant that had previously been owned by Gusteau before his untimely death. He comes upon a lowly garbage boy, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and together they set out to revive the once-legendary restaurant.Ratatouille is filled with loads of surprises and lots of twists and turns. The animation is even more stunning here than in some of the other Disney/Pixar productions, and the breathtaking landscape of Paris, France, really adds a layer of realism to the film. The food looks so real and delicious, and the humans and rats look incredibly realistic. Remy and Linguini are both lovable characters, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way. Surprisingly enough, this movie is the funniest of the Disney/Pixar films, with very subtle and unique humor.As previously stated, the voice acting really makes the film different, and each actor is perfectly suited to his or her role. The best among the bunch happens to be Lou Romano, as he deals with his character extremely well and is incredibly believable. There are times when the acting and animation is so excellent that you forget you are watching an animated film altogether. Brad Garrett is actually tolerable for once, and is excellent in his role as Gusteau, who acts as Remy's conscience for the majority of the film. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are rooted from Gusteau's chats with Remy and many others come from the relationship between Linguini and Remy. On another note, Patton Oswalt does a magnificent job voicing Remy, and Peter O' Toole is very memorable as Anton Ego, the food critic for 'The Grim Eater'.Overall, you can't ask for a better film than Ratatouille, a new classic from Disney/Pixar that is filled with humor, amazing animation, and, most importantly, lots of heart. Some of the scenes are so poetic and perfect that they just bring tears to your eyes. It may be hard to believe, but Ratatouille is far better than any other animated films you will see this year, or perhaps that you will ever see. It manages to be better than Toy Story, better than Finding Nemo, even better than the fantastic Meet the Robinsons. I saw a pre-screening of the film on Saturday, June 16, but I cannot wait to see it again once it hits theaters everywhere on June 29. See Ratatouilleit is highly original, heartwarming, uplifting, and a very thrilling movie that has to be the best animated feature of the last few decades.",best animated film creation,combination disney pixar never ceases amaze but with ratatouille their newest effort animated features are brought new heights with best one date ratatouille is stunning surreal while at same time realistic joy watch writing is one word just amazing voice acting is sensational characters are poetic real rats are some disney pixars cutest creations ratatouille is written directed by brad bird incredibles features stellar voice acting peter otoole patton oswalt ian holm brian dennehy lou romano brad garrett janeane garofalo remy voiced by patton oswalt is little rat who dreams becoming chef just like his idol human gusteau voiced by brad garrett after mishap remy loses his family sewers comes upon fading restaurant that had previously been owned by gusteau before his untimely death he comes upon lowly garbage boy linguini voiced by lou romano together they set out revive once legendary restaurant ratatouille is filled with loads surprises lots twists turns animation is even more stunning here than some other disney pixar productions breathtaking landscape paris france really adds layer realism film food looks so real delicious humans rats look incredibly realistic remy linguini are both lovable characters audience is rooting them entire way surprisingly enough this movie is funniest disney pixar films with very subtle unique humor as previously stated voice acting really makes film different each actor is perfectly suited his or her role best among bunch happens be lou romano as he deals with his character extremely well is incredibly believable there are times when acting animation is so excellent that you forget you are watching animated film altogether brad garrett is actually tolerable once is excellent his role as gusteau who acts as remys conscience majority film some funniest scenes movie are rooted gusteaus chats with remy many others come relationship between linguini remy another note patton oswalt does magnificent job voicing remy peter o toole is very memorable as anton ego food critic grim eater overall you cant ask better film than ratatouille new classic disney pixar that is filled with humor amazing animation most importantly lots heart some scenes are so poetic perfect that they just bring tears your eyes it may be hard believe but ratatouille is far better than any other animated films you will see this year or perhaps that you will ever see it manages be better than toy story better than finding nemo even better than fantastic meet robinsons i saw pre screening film saturday june 16 but i cannot wait see it again once it hits theaters everywhere june 29 see ratatouille it is highly original heartwarming uplifting very thrilling movie that has be best animated feature last few decades,0.5506859131859132,0.3249129811629811,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,"truly devilish fun and mind-blowingly entertaining as classic cartoon style, but also very successful in storytelling- magnifique!","It's pretty easy to make little rodents charming and fun characters (just ask Disney himself, to a clichéd extent), but it's even harder to make them work in such a way that's original and exciting as comedy in conventional ways for today's audiences. But Brad Bird shouldn't be lumped into the group of today's CGI animators. He doesn't really think in those terms, but rather in how to make things look real, and yet at the same time keeping in full mind that it's a cartoon, not reality. This goes not simply for the rats themselves- the funniest, probably even funnier, that Disney's remotely had to market since the Great Mouse Detective- but the human characters too, who have their own distinct shapes and qualities based on personality and relevance to the story (whether they're good or bad, or maybe even more complex too). He places the designs for the characters right up there with the rest of the atmosphere, and then also adds in just the right way to make that wonderfully formulaic Pixar storyline- you know a lot of what may unfold, though not everything, and you know that you're in excellent hands because of the levels of detail and nuance in the comedy chaos at times. It'll be hard to beat this (to put it in a corny phrase) 'gourmet selection' as the best animated film of the year, and certainly the best that Pixar's done since, um, the last Brad Bird movie! The story is the fish out of water, or in this case rat, where a little rodent named Remy, who is totally immersed in the style of Augustus Gusteau, a famous French chef who dies, and who's position is filled by a lowly garbageman named Linguini. He can't cook, of course, but somehow Remy, separated from his rat family, cooks something up on the spot as a not-quite accident, sending Linguini as the one who supposedly made it. On the fluke, he becomes the new chef at Gusteau's...only, the chef's a rat, literally, hilariously pulling Linguini's hair to make him a cooking puppet (early on this makes for some of the best physical comedy of any Pixar movie). This fluke becomes the start of the usual ball of string unraveled bit by bit, involving an heir to Gusteau's fortune, a love interest in aggressive chef Colette, and Remy's reconnection and estrangement from his huge rat clan and his father. All the while Bird throws in such dangerous and downright devilish comedy for a *G* rated animated movie. And there's morales to be learned too, or sort of taken away, I guess, only this time in the true Disney form instead of Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket, it's Remy and the, well, illusion of Gusteau's ghost appearing to him as a quasi-conscious.What makes Ratatouille stand out of the pack from the fellow summer far of the moment, particularly 4th of July fare, is how there's such deft to Bird and his team navigating along the lines of making the comedy work to its excessive lengths while always keeping a firm grip on which turn the story will take next (the moments I didn't quite expect- the whole heir angle involving Linguini, and the climactic scenes with the rats preparing the restaurant's dinners, all washed before going to work, and keeping 'under wraps' the health inspector at the same time!). I probably laughed just as much during this film as I would at something much raunchier like Knocked Up or Grindhouse, to give recent examples, but as mentioned there's a riskiness to Bird's style here.One scene I particularly loved is when Remy is training linguini to command the muscle-controlled hair pulling scheme at his home, and there's a build-up to what seems like a knife going to cut into his fingers while he's chopping vegetables (up to this point he's been hopeless in his training), but at this very point where we should expect the worst, which is funny unto itself, it starts to level out and he's sort of under control. Sort of in that he'll still be naturally clumsy enough to spill the wine on his own head. Same goes for little things like the quite silhouetted bit Remy passes by with the lover about to shoot the other and then falling into full embrace, or the actual fellow employees at Gusteau's, one of who has the wildest thumb ever shown in a movie, least of all a 'family' movie, that I can remember (albeit Bird does come out of working on the Simpsons).So many masterstrokes of comedy go on that it's almost neglected to note how exciting a lot of the film is too, the run-around Remy has in the kitchen first time he comes in or the chase through Paris between the crooked head cook Skinner and Remy, and how seamless voice-work and the (now highly expected) advances in Pixar's technical innovations go together. It was a good guessing game who was the voice of Ego (it's O'Toole, but then it could be any given old regal British person), and to pick out that it's Ian Holm or Garofolo voicing some of the other parts, but it's not something that is immediately meant to be stand-out like in other CGI movies where it's being sold mostly on celebrity voice talent. It's almost like a lot of this comes quite naturally to Bird and his team, and yet because it isn't it reverts to becoming all the more remarkable. Ratatouille is simply an exceptionally fun picture, loaded with sight gags and puns and slips of behavior, and never overbearing with any of the usual messages that come pre-packaged for kids in these movies, all the more remarkable as it comes nearer to Pixar reusing previous ones.",truly devilish fun mind blowingly entertaining as classic cartoon style but also very successful storytelling

10.0,"An Amazing film, made for film lovers, with an artistic/indie appeal","I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.Ratatouille is a treat for film lovers. It feels like a classic. The animationis absolutely beautiful, especially the scenery of Paris which evoked awes from the audience, as if we were seeing a grandiose fireworks show.The story is oh so classy and universal, especially when you look at it as a parable to yourself and society. Sometimes the story seems familiar, yet it is packed with so much genuine heart and individuality, that it might even be too ""indie"" for most audiences. But those who are patient and willing to open their minds and hearts, even when it may challenge the viewers to rethink their own personal biases, will find within this entertaining, sweet, simple film a remarkable message about challenging societal norms and not letting anything stand in your way of your dreams. When you follow your dreams, you never know what an impact it will have upon you, or those you might encounter on the journey. Just see the film, and be open to its message, and I am sure if you allow it too, it will touch you as well.P.S. : The short in front of the feature is the funniest animated short film pixar has ever done, so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it to be, the short film will have everyone in stitches, as it did our entire theater. So just go and see it, and be prepared for a wonderful two hours.",amazing film made film lovers with artistic indie appeal,i caught sneak peak yesterday must say this film is classic it is not as flashy as cars or as action packed as incredibles but it is masterpiece restraint heart that matches classics golden age film industry pixar has always been groundbreaking smart fun animated features but ratatouille might just be what puts them over top as one best all around film making teams history ratatouille is treat film lovers it feels like classic animationis absolutely beautiful especially scenery paris which evoked awes audience as if we were seeing grandiose fireworks show story is oh so classy universal especially when you look at it as parable yourself society sometimes story seems familiar yet it is packed with so much genuine heart individuality that it might even be too indie most audiences but those who are patient willing open their minds hearts even when it may challenge viewers rethink their own personal biases will find within this entertaining sweet simple film remarkable message about challenging societal norms not letting anything stand your way your dreams when you follow your dreams you never know what impact it will have upon you or those you might encounter journey just see film be open its message i am sure if you allow it too it will touch you as well p s short front feature is funniest animated short film pixar has ever done so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it be short film will have everyone stitches as it did our entire theater so just go see it be prepared wonderful two hours,0.5460826210826212,0.2527167277167277,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.23, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Incredible,"Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.The next thing to talk about is the ""genre"" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.10/10",incredible,remember how everyone was talking about toy story when it first came out incredible visuals unique style vividly imagined world next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about computer animated movie was finding nemo im excited say that ratatouille will be next one redefine visual creativity technical detail computer animated movies honest goodness i was awestruck by animation that never happens me it is visual masterpiece movie if ever term applies next thing talk about is genre movie as pixar enthusiasts will tell you brad bird director ratatouille also directed incredibles which has most inspired creative action sequences any pixar movies ratatouille while not so straightforward with its action has almost as much as incredibles did unique ways most memorable is shotgun scene near beginning youll know what im talking about when you see it other than that this is expected comedy with heart movie pixar that so many have grown love voice acting spot every voice is distinctive it never feels like celebritys voice tacked character shrek im looking at you it feels like characters themselves speaking you cant ask more voice acting finally script story entire irony story street rat with passion fine food is beautiful tight smart wonderful script flows this pacing story is odd choppy at places but this is very forgivable grievance only other minor fault is that few dramatic one liners feel bit forced other than that this is most layered complex satisfying script pixar since incredibles overall i recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters i was lucky enough see pre release screening though not perfect it is animated masterpiece true pixar form with breathtaking animation visual design 10 10,0.4865558292282429,0.18682266009852214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,A Nutshell Review: Ratatouille,"The Pixar juggernaut continues! I've always been enthralled by the movies that Pixar puts out ever since Toy Story, and through the years, Pixar has built a brand of trust amongst movie goers, with quality storytelling using animation as a tool to tell them, not because it's cool to do things through the medium, but that it adds a certain powerful, believable dimension, with stories rooted to universal themes, yet jazzed up by the structure in which it's told. The Incredibles ranked amongst my favourite so far, but writer-director Brad Bird has topped that with Ratatouille, a story about a rat, and probably the most mature of the Pixar stories to date.One of the rare successful rats in the animated genre is Mickey, but Remy here (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has more character, and with that photo realistic quality to him, will give Mickey a run for his money. It's a class act story about a rat who dreams of being somebody, of wanting to follow that dream in becoming a chef in Paris, and is undeterred by his size, and well, form, even though in any kitchen, the last thing you want is a rat in it. And to realize his dream, he forms a symbiotic friendship with bumbling Linguini (Lou Romano), a garbage boy who just joined the restaurant which Remy's idol, the late renowned chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), founded.It's a story about the tussle between friendship and family, with the latter providing an added emphasis, and you'll happen to just about find a familiar chord to it. Remember the time when your folks frown upon the friends you keep, and how sometimes, through their good intentions, unwittingly stifle your hopes and desires? Or how family becomes that obstructing stone on the pathway to success, or being taken for granted to provide for greedy, unabashed family and so-called friends? Ratatouille explores these and more, though they're kept veiled and subtle for the narrative to move on, and never provided a dull moment for kids and adults alike.Pixar's animation continues to astound, and provide inspiration to the many 3D animators out there - they have always set new benchmarks for others to follow, and I think they're on top of their game with the excellent animated portrayal of Paris, the kitchen, and of course, the rats, with that touch of photo realistic quality to it all, which does wonders to the food presented. Amongst the food, I like the crusty breads best - you can almost feel the texture, and the rustling sound is just to die for. And the cheese, you can just feel it melt in your mouth. Mmm mmm!The story's adversaries might be familiar - a mean boss Skinner (Ian Holm) and a mightier- than-though food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), but it's the latter, despite his shorter screen time, that does its best to chill, and it was such an obvious jab with making him English. The comedy's here top notch, not necessarily relying solely on slapstick to bring on the laughs, but possessing many sly moments throughout as you root for little Remy and his escapades, less so for Linguini though, who comes off as that perfect loser in life.Ratatouille is a perfectly delicious offering worthy of that Pixar stamp, and definitely gonna be a crowd pleaser. I'm not sure why the delay in getting it released here, and having to suffer watching poor quality animation along the way. But the wait is well worth it, and I bet everyone will be pleasantly surprised indeed, with all the ingredients coming together for that wonderful presentation, that tastes and looks ju st wonderful. Despite the overkill of trailers, pre-screening warnings to turn off your mobile phones, etc, continue to put your trust in that little rat Remy, and savour what Ratatouille has to offer. No regrets - highly recommended, and another contender for my top movie of the year listing.Ratatouille is preceded by the trailer for the next Pixar movie Wall-E, and a short Pixar featurette titled Lifted, about two aliens and one of their attempts in passing the Alien Abduction course.

10.0,Another Disney-Pixar Masterpiece!,"This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today's youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don't have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. ""Ratatouille"" is my new Disney-Pixar favorite!

10.0,"Mmm, perfecto!","Another masterpiece from Disney and Pixar, this year they bring us another family classic for generations to come, Ratatouille. My friend and I saw Ratatouille tonite and we just had a blast watching it, this film was such a pleasure and was so funny and cute. I would say that actually this is Pixar's best work, they have come such a long way from Toy Story, it's incredible. But Ratatouille had amazing animation that was so real, makes you wonder if we'll ever need actors in the future, lol. The story is just so charming and a perfect fit for any family to watch, even just to watch this film on your own, I guarantee you will have fun watching it.Remy is a rat with a special gift, a gift of smell, he uses this gift to cook. He's not just any ordinary cook, but an amazing one at that, but when he gets separated from his family, he is haunted by the most famous chef in the world, he ends up in Paris. Where he finds a restaurant that was once grand and has slipped up when it comes to good food. An ordinary garbage boy messes with a stew in the kitchen, when Remy sees this, he helps him out. Linguini, the garbage boy, accepts Remy and together they create masterpieces and bring the restaurant back up. They must keep it a secret how they create these fantastic foods; but that gets so much harder when people try to find out how he's so talented.Ratatouille is such a charming Disney/Pixar film, the animation is great, and the story is just terrific. The actors voices were so great and fit the characters well. If you are looking for a film to see this summer, Ratatouille is definitely a recommendation, it's good to know that Pixar is going to keep giving us these great animation films that I know will be considered classics for a very long time.

,Hyper Reality,"Its easy to see how this story came about. Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: ""Lifting."" It features a novice ""animator"" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.Count on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.In this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by ""the critic."" So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.It appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how ""Ted's law"" is followed: the distance between the ""real"" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the ""living cartoon"" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.So these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.Having said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.One of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)You can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.But there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.There's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.The credits of this movie ostentatiously say that """"Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film."" You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.Its a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.One character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. These folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",hyper reality,its easy see how this story came about animators are puppeteers first so if you asked animator come up with story naturally you will find two features one would involve two screen characters one animator other we have many jokes associated with how imperfectly screen animator our hero works his puppet at first incidentally this movie is preceded theater by short lifting it features novice animator precisely this type being graded notice infinite panel switches that short count pixar find yet another way fold introspection into form this is elaborated by character critic we see him first coffin like office hes only capable destruction it seems voiced by peter otoole stentorian voice about theater he likes what he sees tastes its great trick you see usually this trick is form screen audience watching some sort climactic performance when they cheer we do too as we become folded into story this case that is handled by place made us occupied by critic so we have place story animator viewer what else well need place animation right we have it it appears first as book by now dead corpulent chef this book natch comes alive look how teds law is followed distance between real world ourselves animated movie is same as that animated movie living cartoon within its explicit fold fact that inner cartoon has open personal feel it conveys personal feel we are intended have with pixar movie so these three folds story is story animator viewer introductory short sets this up too having said that there are couple noteworthy segments terms actual craft pixar has two areas which it innovates one these how space is handled pixar guys realized early that if three dimensions are going be modeled anyway you can zip camera around new ways early game they did this overt way thats been picked up by summer action films best them including depp pirate business another disney project benefiting eye motion lab you can see this throughout project there are both all sorts well managed unusual perspectives constant overlay new shots by this i mean that every shot is just little different than what youve seen just little canted little closer perhaps little movement that physical camera cannot do well but there are some big production sequences as well im particularly interested architectural water its unique cinematic challenge its not one done well animation because mathematics simply making water look real is daunting pixar has done what needs be done they have made water hyper real dramatic theres sequence here that is something like that pinnochio sequence 67 years ago with whale but its so new fresh exciting look at water see that it has million tiny agents all seeking be angry do damage but never reaching consensus just how attack this alone is worth admission theres another thing that is uniquely pixar how characters move its tricky thing that as with water it is not ever enough that they move realistically you can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors translating that created beings it captures nuance if you have particularly skilled source actor he or she will move not as real person would but as actor would convey reality real isnt real we need hyperreal special ways get read reality credits this movie ostentatiously say that our quality assurance guarantee 100 genuine animation no motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used production this film you can see it we are entering new era where both cameras characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes bodies its challenge viewers what do we accept as embodiment so far answer is that non natural movements must always be service conveying or seeming natural but i imagine at speed this is developing we may soon see something more one character note colette is voiced by remarkable janeane garofalo as with our hero she has that french nose as love develops between these two she becomes decidedly more sexy both voice appearance its appearance that i remark here its all done with postures motorcycle that motorcycle is there part allow her bend forward change her lower anatomy these folks at pixar are good darn good glad its steve jobs as creative inspiration instead that evil other guy teds evaluation 3 3 worth watching,0.48852121715493824,0.12287765529044599,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,"""Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.""","When ""Ratatouille"" (2007) was released last summer, I was not too eager to see the animated 106 minutes long film about a rat in a kitchen of a five-star Parisian restaurant. The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that ""Ratatouille"" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, ""little chef"" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. ""Ratatouille"" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: ""How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it."" Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw ""Ratatouille"" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a ""grim eater"", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.Not every year, an animated film is nominated for five Academy awards, and I wish ""Ratatouille"" victories in every category.

10.0,"Amazing, spectacular, and perfect.","The greatest test of whether or not a film is truly admirable is how well it holds up years after its release. It has been almost three years since Ratatouille has been released and I have now seen it at least four times, maybe more. I am proud and thrilled to say that it has not lost any of its charm, still looks amazing and holds up better than almost any film I've seen as many times as I've seen this.It's hard to put your finger on, but why exactly is Pixar able to create these astonishingly good films that aren't just entertaining and delightful, although they certainly are that. They are able to tap into the very realms of the human condition, and with this bring to the surface emotions and feelings you come to not expect from an animated film because after all, animated automatically infers a film for children.Of course Ratatouille breaks that mold and I am just so pleased that I got caught up in the world of Remy once again. With their endless budget from Disney, Pixar can create and explore any aspect necessary and writer/director Brad Bird does just that. The story here comprises elements of drama, sadness, family relations, job pressures, as well as a wonderful monologue near the end by a critic for critics. The story is pitch-perfect, always understandable and the foundation for which the film is made.And, since it is Pixar and Disney, the look and feel of the film is so engrossing, it looks better than other animated films made after it. One of the things Pixar does so well is find the middle ground in making elements of the frame look real but not too real, thus still maintaining an animated universe. They did it with the water in Finding Nemo, the cars in Cars, and they do it here with the food, which at times looks so real you want to taste it.I really can't say anything bad about Ratatouille. Even the story elements of how Remy and his human counterpart, Linguini, are able to work together work because this is the animated world which lends itself to more freedoms than our world. The voices are terrific from Patton Oswalt to Ian Holm to the great Peter O'Toole as deathly-thin food critic Anton Ego. There really isn't anything here that doesn't work and Michael Giacchino's score emits the spirit of Paris that sets the background for this story. This is just a great film, perfect in its story, its characters and the wonderful, vibrant world it creates. Years after its release, Ratatouille continues and will continue to impress and immerse viewers in a touching story with beautiful surroundings about the cutest rat in the world becoming a chef in Paris.

10.0,Nothing less than the finest movie ever made,"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so...This movie is perfect. This movie is the reason why I write movie reviews. This movie helped me appreciate effort and art. This movie helped me defeat my prejudices against things I don't really know.It is a perfect kids movie, it is a perfect adult movie. Most Pixar movies actually contain very mature messages and this movie's message, ""anyone can cook"" is why we watch movies. Movies are meant to inspire the audience and this movie does a great job. Show this to a kid, they will watch it over and over again. I know because I used to watch this movie every single day.This is not Remy's movie, this is not Linguini's movie, this is definitely not Gusteau's movie. This is Anton Ego's movie. The character development of Anton Ego is phenomenal. We see an arrogant critic become a humble and honest person, and it is what we should become at the end of the day. Most of us start out as arrogant and we do not appreciate effort and talent. However we must learn to give credit where it is due. We see Ego's journey in becoming this modest person, he changes for the better.The final scene is one I cannot praise enough. Seeing Ego complete his arc This movie is an inspiring masterpiece, something we really need in the movie industry today.Maybe I highly rate this movie because of my memories watching it. The scene where he tastes the ratatouille is exactly how I felt re-watching this movie. When I rewatched this movie I experienced something new, an appreciation of kids movies and their messages. This movie changed my whole perception on animated movies. Today, most movies are cash grabs produced with the sole purpose of making profit from tickets and action figures. We need more movies like Ratatouille in this world. In this critic's opinion, this movie is nothing less than the finest movie in history.",nothing less than finest movie ever made,many ways work critic is easy we risk very little yet enjoy position over those who offer up their work their selves our judgment we thrive negative criticism which is fun write read but bitter truth we critics must face is that grand scheme things average piece junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so this movie is perfect this movie is reason why i write movie reviews this movie helped me appreciate effort art this movie helped me defeat my prejudices against things i dont really know it is perfect kids movie it is perfect adult movie most pixar movies actually contain very mature messages this movies message anyone can cook is why we watch movies movies are meant inspire audience this movie does great job show this kid they will watch it over over again i know because i used watch this movie every single day this is not remys movie this is not linguinis movie this is definitely not gusteaus movie this is anton egos movie character development anton ego is phenomenal we see arrogant critic become humble honest person it is what we should become at end day most us start out as arrogant we do not appreciate effort talent however we must learn give credit where it is due we see egos journey becoming this modest person he changes better final scene is one i cannot praise enough seeing ego complete his arc this movie is inspiring masterpiece something we really need movie industry today maybe i highly rate this movie because my memories watching it scene where he tastes ratatouille is exactly how i felt re watching this movie when i rewatched this movie i experienced something new appreciation kids movies their messages this movie changed my whole perception animated movies today most movies are cash grabs produced with sole purpose making profit tickets action figures we need more movies like ratatouille this world this critics opinion this movie is nothing less than finest movie history,0.5158803877282137,0.27035184923771877,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,A fantastic story that adds to Pixar's stellar reputation,"I checked out a sneak preview of Ratatouille last night, and I must say I truly loved this movie. Everything from the animation to the score to the voice acting to the story (and especially the story) was EXCELLENT.I don't know if it appeals to kids as much as other Pixar offerings, but this one upholds their legacy of excellence.Casting Patton Oswalt as Remy was PERFECT. The rest of the voice cast was outstanding as well...including Pixar ""house voice"" John Ratzenberger. See if you can tell which guy he is without foreknowledge (as in, don't read the cast list).Michael Giacchino's score was as perfect for this story as the award-winning one he created for ""The Incredibles"" and the incredible music he has created for most of J.J. Abrams' recent projects, including ""Alias"" and ""Lost"". Even with my 3-year-old son making it really hard to concentrate, and our ""we got to the theater late and had to sit up front"" seats, this movie was fantastic. Everyone should go see it, even if they don't have kids.Brad Bird - you done right by us movie fans again...Ratatouille is great!",fantastic story that adds pixars stellar reputation,i checked out sneak preview ratatouille last night i must say i truly loved this movie everything animation score voice acting story especially story was excellent i dont know if it appeals kids as much as other pixar offerings but this one upholds their legacy excellence casting patton oswalt as remy was perfect rest voice cast was outstanding as well including pixar house voice john ratzenberger see if you can tell which guy he is without foreknowledge as dont read cast list michael giacchinos score was as perfect this story as award winning one he created incredibles incredible music he has created most j j abrams recent projects including alias lost even with my 3 year old son making it really hard concentrate our we got theater late had sit up front seats this movie was fantastic everyone should go see it even if they dont have kids brad bird you done right by us movie fans again ratatouille is great,0.6282879818594104,0.36281179138321995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.18}"

9.0,A First Rate Film,"I just saw ""Ratatouille"" tonight.It's a first class movie. Several thoughts come to mind...-The character performances are so good, I think there's no sort of movie they couldn't make. I've heard Pixar's John Carter of Mars is going to be live action? No! I want them to do it all animated.-""Cars"" definitely _was_ a lower-value softball they threw to finish out that original Disney-gets-half-of-everything-plus-sequel-rights contract they were in at the time. I remember all the clucking last summer about how Pixar had lost its way.-There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely ""real"".-There was one scene in the latter part of the film where I thought ""I can't believe they are doing this tired movie cliché"" but they pulled out of it at the last second and made it something new.-The 2D-ish end credits were great. Stick it out to the very end to see the mo-cap disclaimer!-With this, Brad Bird is certainly one of the animation gods now.",first rate film,i just saw ratatouille tonight its first class movie several thoughts come mind character performances are so good i think theres no sort movie they couldnt make ive heard pixars john carter mars is going be live action no i want them do it all animated cars definitely was lower value softball they threw finish out that original disney gets half everything plus sequel rights contract they were at time i remember all clucking last summer about how pixar had lost its way there were few moments when they seemed lose that stylized reality they had established things looked merely real there was one scene latter part film where i thought i cant believe they are doing this tired movie clich but they pulled out it at last second made it something new 2d ish end credits were great stick it out very end see mo cap disclaimer with this brad bird is certainly one animation gods now,0.3296320346320346,0.129767316017316,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,The best yet!,"At this point, Brad Bird is no longer making great animated movies -- he's making great movies, end of sentence.From the standpoint of writing, this one keeps an astonishing number of themes going, creates great multifaceted characters, and maintains believable suspense and motivation, all without ever seeming strained or ""written."" From the standpoint of animation, it's unbelievable. The translucency of a rat's paw, the dented shine of a copper kettle, the complex texture of a crumb of bread, are all rendered with breathtaking accuracy. (And Paris has never looked lovelier -- if the French tourist board didn't subsidize this production, they should have.) From the standpoint of voice acting, it ranges from believable and unshowoffy (unlike the annoying star turns we're seeing in a lot of these days) to the stentorian sneer of the great Peter O'Toole.And, most of all, the character creation and animation is beyond belief. The facial expressions, the unique-to-each-character body movements, the sense of weight and texture are so incredibly closely observed and reproduced that at times I had to work to remember that what I was seeing was animation and not Oscar-caliber acting.If this one doesn't go up in the Best Picture category instead of simply Best Animated Feature, there's no justice in Oscar-land.",best yet,at this point brad bird is no longer making great animated movies hes making great movies end sentence standpoint writing this one keeps astonishing number themes going creates great multifaceted characters maintains believable suspense motivation all without ever seeming strained or written standpoint animation its unbelievable translucency rats paw dented shine copper kettle complex texture crumb bread are all rendered with breathtaking accuracy paris has never looked lovelier if french tourist board didnt subsidize this production they should have standpoint voice acting it ranges believable unshowoffy unlike annoying star turns were seeing lot these days stentorian sneer great peter otoole most all character creation animation is beyond belief facial expressions unique each character body movements sense weight texture are so incredibly closely observed reproduced that at times i had work remember that what i was seeing was animation not oscar caliber acting if this one doesnt go up best picture category instead simply best animated feature theres no justice oscar land,0.5523809523809525,0.43452380952380953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,Anyone Can Cook,"In the country of France, the rat Remy has accurate taste and smell, and he worships the chef Auguste Gusteau. People uses to say that the best food in the world is in Paris, more precisely in Gusteau's, and Remy dreams on becoming a chef. On the same day that his idol dies after reading a bad review of the arrogant critic Anton Ego, Remy gets lost from the clan of his father in the sewers and ends in Paris in front of the famous restaurant. Remy does not resist and goes to the kitchen, improving the soap that is being prepared with ingredients and spices. The clumsy garbage boy Linguini receives the credits for the successful recipe; he is promoted to cook and starts a partnership with the little chef. But the greedy chef Skinner is not happy with the success of Linguini that is jeopardizing his future project for Gusteau's.""Ratatouille"" is a delightful animation, with a very funny and original story. It is inconceivable to imagine a rat in the fanciest restaurant of Paris; imagine a rat as a prominent chef, having a clan of rats in the kitchen helping him to prepare sophisticated meals for the upper-class of Paris and a harsh critic of restaurants. Only this sequence would be enough to make laugh. But the story has nice characters and good messages about the importance of making a dream come true and creativity in your work, friendship and loyalty. The story has many plot points and the resolution is great. In the end, I loved this animation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ratatouille""",anyone can cook,country france rat remy has accurate taste smell he worships chef auguste gusteau people uses say that best food world is paris more precisely gusteaus remy dreams becoming chef same day that his idol dies after reading bad review arrogant critic anton ego remy gets lost clan his father sewers ends paris front famous restaurant remy does not resist goes kitchen improving soap that is being prepared with ingredients spices clumsy garbage boy linguini receives credits successful recipe he is promoted cook starts partnership with little chef but greedy chef skinner is not happy with success linguini that is jeopardizing his future project gusteaus ratatouille is delightful animation with very funny original story it is inconceivable imagine rat fanciest restaurant paris imagine rat as prominent chef having clan rats kitchen helping him prepare sophisticated meals upper class paris harsh critic restaurants only this sequence would be enough make laugh but story has nice characters good messages about importance making dream come true creativity your work friendship loyalty story has many plot points resolution is great end i loved this animation my vote is eight title brazil ratatouille,0.64,0.30541666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,He calls it his Tiny ChefRatatouille,"Brad Bird is by far the best writer/director of animated films coming out of America in a long time. Besides a Hayao Miyazaki, there is no one else with the track record that this guy has. From The Iron Giant to the Incredibles to now Ratatouille, Bird just gets better and better with each new move. This new Pixar installment is definitely the most intellectually stimulating yet, but really which of his films haven't been intelligent first, kiddie-catering second? Ratatouille is by all means cinematic in scope and execution. There is nothing to this movie that screams animation besides the fact that it is a cartoon. The characters are all well fleshed out with emotions and inner struggle to survive the lives they want at the expense of that laid before them. Each frame is also composed with a sense of cinematography for real life. The expanses of Paris are breathtaking to behold and many camera movements stay within the constraints of a true machine there to capture the action. Bird's world on display is all encompassing and you will be fully immersed into the tale, no matter what age, because it never loses its integrity or ability to surprise with its never ceasing authenticity.Pixar will always be at the top of the computer graphic echelon because they have never catered to the increasing trend of dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. It appears that the current trend in America has been to try and make everything too equal, thus simplifying things in order for those less motivated souls to understand and laugh at, at the expense of the intellectuals which should be allowed some intellectual stimulation as well. Rather than go for the ""fart jokes"" and clichéd old-hat humor, Disney's newly bought animation studio has proved time and again that story is paramount and that without it, no means of skill or effects can survive. Locking up a talent like Bird for his most recent two films shows the dedication they have in getting the right people involved in the creative process. The backbone impetus of this story is not at all truly original. It is very much an ugly- duckling type tale of someone who has decided to go along a path different then his people have for generations. While being slightly ostracized at home, he goes into the world in order to find meaning and a use for his extraordinary skill. Since that skill is a keen sense of smell, what better occupation than gourmet chef is there for mixing those flavors at his service in unique and wonderful ways? Unfortunately, our hero is a rat, and we all know that they don't go with hygienic kitchens very well. He must find a kind soul to help him do what he was born to do, and with that fateful meeting in Gusteau's restaurant, our tale unfolds. By going against the stealing mentality of his fellow rats and living amongst the humans, I was starting to think we would eventually get to a point where his clan speaks of how he has angered the rat Gods and their supply of garbage has been cleaned up by environmentalists around Europe. I quickly hit myself in the head, remembered that this wasn't Happy Feet with rats, and sat back to enjoy a real fairytale story that didn't try to shove an agenda down my throat. Fairy tales tell of morals and happiness and originality succeeding over prejudice and Disney/ Pixar still knows how to deliver.Animation-wise, Ratatouille is a sight to behold. The fur on each rat is as tactile as that on Sully from Monsters Inc. and the liquids on display are gorgeous. Whether sewer water, Parisian streams, or blood red wine, each fluid is rendered with amazing clarity and realism. Even the human characters, something not often attempted by Pixar, are caricatured enough to make them slightly abnormal so that instead of looking at their humanistic flaws, we see them as just other animated creatures in a world of their own. Also, the set pieces are elaborate and highly detailed. The restaurant dining room is fantastically displayed and each swoop through the double doors of the kitchen brings you into a new world beyond the sinks and utensils. Even the underbelly passages of the rats are highly detailed as we go through them fast and furiously while our hero Remy runs to get above ground, going past numerous rooms that are seen through cracksa comically French domestic dispute among them until we get our first glimpse at the grandeur of Paris.Despite the beautiful graphics and the unobtrusively effective voice-overswhen you find you aren't wondering who is who, you know the acting is successfully integrated into the wholeit is the story that really shines. Bird has culled his imagery from many sources, including a bit of what I feel is Tim Burton for the nemesis food critic Anton Ego who eerily reminded me of Christopher Lee, yet has made everything his own. Remy the rat must fight against his heritage and his very being in order to live his life the way he wants to. There is a lot of comedy involved in getting the human Linguini to become his friend and partner on the journey to culinary perfection, but there is even more heart behind it all. We are treated to some nicely quirky supporting roles, but none are ever put to the forefront in order to overshadow the real stars. While not the ensemble these types of films usually are, our leads are strong and never falter to the point you wish we had more of the others. I accepted the terms of the plot early on and never tired of the journey Brad Bird and company led me on.
