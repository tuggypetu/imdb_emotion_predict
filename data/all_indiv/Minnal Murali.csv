7,Malayalam Cinema's Debut In New-Age Superhero Genre Is A Lesson To Indian Cinema.,"Minnal Murali (2021) : Movie Review -Hollywood is ruling the Superhero genre like no other cinema industry in the world cinema. Right from the 70s when they made Superman and later went realistic with the Batman Film during the late 80s. Marvel and DC both have sucked out everything possible in this genre from original adaptations to reboots to cinematic universe, even the biggest grossers recently belong to the same genre. Indian Cinema has remained far behind in that. We hardly have any memorable Superhero film except for that 90s nostalgia 'Shaktimaan' serial and Hrithik Roshan's Krrish- a child born to Hindi adaptation of Steven Speilberg's groundbreaking 'ET The Extra Terrestrial"". It is sad to know that Indian Cinema is not just behind but it's not even trying to crack the formula of Superhero Genre. From now onwards, we won't be able to say that because Basil Joseph has just come up with something astonishing called 'Minnal Murali'. What's more surprising is that this film came from Malayalam Cinema which is a much smaller industry than Bollywood. Malayalam Cinema is simply unmatchable when it comes to content-driven cinema. Forget all time lists, just have a look at 2021. The Great Indian Kitchen, Drishyam 2, Operation Java, Aarkkariyam, Nayattu, Malik, Kuruthi, Home, Kurup and Kaanekkaane, Malayalam Cinema has ruled 2021 like no other cinema industry in India. I'm glad to announce that Minnal Murali has joined this elite club, just a week before year end.Minnal Murali is Malayalam Cinema's foray into Superhero genre with not so high budget. It's a story about a young tailor Jaison (Tovino Thomas) who gets struck by lightning on a Christmas Eve and gains superpowers after the incident. On the same Eve, a heartbroken fella Venkidi goes through the same incident and gains the same powers. While Jaison uses those superpowers to transform himself into the superhero, Venkidi misuses the powers and the battlefield is set for a grand fight between good and bad. Despite the fictional idea of superpowers, Anirudhan and Matthew's script stays close to reality. It has those conflicts we have in almost every superhero film over the years but still it keeps you engaged with that human-connect. It is a comedy film alright but not much spoofy about the same. Inhad few laugh but not memorable ones.Performances in the film uplift the quality of the product. Tovino Thomas is so much into the character that after an hour or so you start believing in him as a superhero. Guru Somasundaram presents the best heroic villain you've ever seen in Indian Superhero films. He isn't bad because he loves being an antagonist, he becomes bad because people made him so. That intelligent writing piece gives credibility and reliability to his character. Aju Varghese, Femina George, Harisree Ashokan, Mammukoya and Baiju Santosh add their support in this superbly balanced cast. Minnal Murali is 160 minutes long, which is little bit more than expected but as we know it is coming on Netflix, you don't really mind about the runtime. Surely, it could have been 15 minutes shorter, especially in the first half.What people seek the most from Superhero movies is Visual Effects and Minnal Murali scores first class grades despite a moderate budget. Had this film got a budget like 'Bahubali' and '2 Point 0', the VFX team would have defeated all Indian films in Visual effects. The action scenes are so intriguing and have got so much intensity in it. The way Guru smiles arrogantly and Tovina looks helpless in front of him, its a great example of how perfect one cinematic frame can be during a big action sequence. Mind-blowing! Basil Joseph has made a visual spectacle with great cinematic sense. The saddest thing that happened to Indian cinema in 2021 is that Minnal Murali was not released on the big screen. This one is a big-screen phenomena. Having said that, it's not gonna make much difference for true cinema lovers who really understand the cinematic aspects of filmmaking. You know Visual grandeur isn't everything, there is a lot more beyond that and you will get to learn that while watching this impeccable superhero drama by Basil. Undoubtedly, the Best Indian Superhero Film so far, and one had to work really hard to surpass it. It's really appalling to know that Malayalam Cinema has made such a fabulous movie without the help of the biggest production banners of India. Truly an Astonishing Achievement for Mollywood but more than that, it's a new beginning for Indian Cinema in the Superhero Genre. Please give a grand welcome to the new Indian superhero, he deserves it more than those typical commercial potboilers.RATING - 7/10*",malayalam cinemas debut new age superhero genre is lesson indian cinema,minnal murali 2021 movie review hollywood is ruling superhero genre like no other cinema industry world cinema right 70s when they made superman later went realistic with batman film during late 80s marvel dc both have sucked out everything possible this genre original adaptations reboots cinematic universe even biggest grossers recently belong same genre indian cinema has remained far behind that we hardly have any memorable superhero film except that 90s nostalgia shaktimaan serial hrithik roshans krrish child born hindi adaptation steven speilbergs groundbreaking et extra terrestrial it is sad know that indian cinema is not just behind but its not even trying crack formula superhero genre now onwards we wont be able say that because basil joseph has just come up with something astonishing called minnal murali whats more surprising is that this film came malayalam cinema which is much smaller industry than bollywood malayalam cinema is simply unmatchable when it comes content driven cinema forget all time lists just have look at 2021 great indian kitchen drishyam 2 operation java aarkkariyam nayattu malik kuruthi home kurup kaanekkaane malayalam cinema has ruled 2021 like no other cinema industry india im glad announce that minnal murali has joined this elite club just week before year end minnal murali is malayalam cinemas foray into superhero genre with not so high budget its story about young tailor jaison tovino thomas who gets struck by lightning christmas eve gains superpowers after incident same eve heartbroken fella venkidi goes through same incident gains same powers while jaison uses those superpowers transform himself into superhero venkidi misuses powers battlefield is set grand fight between good bad despite fictional idea superpowers anirudhan matthews script stays close reality it has those conflicts we have almost every superhero film over years but still it keeps you engaged with that human connect it is comedy film alright but not much spoofy about same inhad few laugh but not memorable ones performances film uplift quality product tovino thomas is so much into character that after hour or so you start believing him as superhero guru somasundaram presents best heroic villain youve ever seen indian superhero films he isnt bad because he loves being antagonist he becomes bad because people made him so that intelligent writing piece gives credibility reliability his character aju varghese femina george harisree ashokan mammukoya baiju santosh add their support this superbly balanced cast minnal murali is 160 minutes long which is little bit more than expected but as we know it is coming netflix you dont really mind about runtime surely it could have been 15 minutes shorter especially first half what people seek most superhero movies is visual effects minnal murali scores first class grades despite moderate budget had this film got budget like bahubali 2 point 0 vfx team would have defeated all indian films visual effects action scenes are so intriguing have got so much intensity it way guru smiles arrogantly tovina looks helpless front him its great example how perfect one cinematic frame can be during big action sequence mind blowing basil joseph has made visual spectacle with great cinematic sense saddest thing that happened indian cinema 2021 is that minnal murali was not released big screen this one is big screen phenomena having said that its not gonna make much difference true cinema lovers who really understand cinematic aspects filmmaking you know visual grandeur isnt everything there is lot more beyond that you will get learn that while watching this impeccable superhero drama by basil undoubtedly best indian superhero film so far one had work really hard surpass it its really appalling know that malayalam cinema has made such fabulous movie without help biggest production banners india truly astonishing achievement mollywood but more than that its new beginning indian cinema superhero genre please give grand welcome new indian superhero he deserves it more than those typical commercial potboilers rating 7 10,0.47723179315016057,0.17466637953882852,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8,"Delightful ""Minnunna"" Entry of the Superhero Genre into Malayalam","You'll feel a sense of wicked delight originating from the cinematic social milieu that Basil Joseph is so known to masterfully create as you sit down in your living room and watch Baiju and Rajesh Madhavan in their policemen characters waiting in a ""thattukada"" for a man to give him an earful, perhaps a handful. The man is a poovalan who's supposed to come down to a bus stop to meet his girlfriend. That deed may or may not happen but that is not the point of this fantastic sequence that introduces almost everyone in the film that needs an introduction.It is therefore this world-building that I want to point out that makes Minnal Murali (Lightning Murali, Mister Murali) a fresh wave into the Malayalam cinema. With equal weightage given to the primary and secondary characters (especially the central duo) and a weaving plot that experiences starting trouble but soon takes off, Minnal Murali maintains a steady pace with a mix of dry humour, heavy drama, and scattered social commentary. None of these take centrestage though as the story evolves into a bona fide superhero template that still doesn't feel trite. The background score and surprisingly well-done VFX were the highlights for me as I sat down being enthralled by the sheer magic in the way the story is written.Minnal Murali has heralded the superhereo genre with the punch that it demanded and I for one am riding the happy wave. More than anything, this is clever cinema, one that makes you marvel at all the tiny and larger bits of writing that make up this jubilant confluence. Something that you can use to forego the cliched shadow that hangs over the plot sore. You can't miss how the story evolves at a meandering pace, narrating the origin of the evil and the good equally well. Something that I don't see usually in this genre. Watch it, you'll like it.(Reviewed post embargo on 22 Dec.

10,Say hello to a new Indian superhero.,"Minnal Murali already had me impressed with its promos and visuals, and the viewing experience only made it better. The fact that it is at heart an Indian story instead of something intending to stand at par with Hollywood, should be enough to describe the film in fewer words. There's everything you can expect from a superhero origin story, be it the action sequences, the thrill or the visual spectacle. However, it is also very grounded and despite some predictability visible to those like me who have watched a lot of superhero movies, this is a fine watch and memorable by the time it ends.The film's tone is perfectly balanced between funny and serious. While the VFX is not the strongest aspect of this gem, its character investment and development are first-rate. Both the hero as well as the villain are written brilliantly. Some might notice influence from popular superhero movies a few times here and there, but this is Minnal Murali, an INDIAN superhero story and the Indian feel never fades away.The action scenes are fantastic and the background music is cool. The length never actually becomes an issue, thanks to the fine editing. All in all, Minnal Murali is a captivating superhero film studded with action, comedy, emotion and all the excitement a new superhero's first on-screen adventure demands. I would be glad if they make another one of this. Also, I hope this new superhero gets love from all across India and the whole world.",say hello new indian superhero,minnal murali already had me impressed with its promos visuals viewing experience only made it better fact that it is at heart indian story instead something intending stand at par with hollywood should be enough describe film fewer words theres everything you can expect superhero origin story be it action sequences thrill or visual spectacle however it is also very grounded despite some predictability visible those like me who have watched lot superhero movies this is fine watch memorable by time it ends films tone is perfectly balanced between funny serious while vfx is not strongest aspect this gem its character investment development are first rate both hero as well as villain are written brilliantly some might notice influence popular superhero movies few times here there but this is minnal murali indian superhero story indian feel never fades away action scenes are fantastic background music is cool length never actually becomes issue thanks fine editing all all minnal murali is captivating superhero film studded with action comedy emotion all excitement new superheros first screen adventure demands i would be glad if they make another one this also i hope this new superhero gets love all across india whole world,0.553128054740958,0.293841642228739,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8,Celebrate this for what it is & for what Indian cinema could be because of it.,"For a change, it was refreshing to watch a superhero movie that isn't about saving (certain parts of 👀) the world, that doesn't have sophisticated technology. As a superhero movie in Mollywood/Indian Cinema, it could have easily followed the regular Hollywood tropes, but it didn't & I thought that it stayed grounded, relevant to the industry and the audience.Great cinematography, great sound design, people aren't happy with the VFX - I didn't mind it at all, a story that could have been all over the place - but isn't, humor, great acting, this film has it all. In an era where we have high budget films (without superheroes) in which modified cars are sent to space (press F for Family), MM proves that you don't need anything flashy/over-the-top to make a film work. Bruh's out running in his 'Hawaii Chappal' despite being a superhero as he's figuring his powers out. There's enough time spent on the antagonist and his backstory. Good character development overall.In the process of explaining everything, did the movie become a tad too slow and long in the first half? Maybe, or maybe not. All that said this was a good 'origin' story. I would really like to see a sequel or two for this, but now that everything's been explained, a similar pacing in a future movie might become an issue.But I choose not to worry about that RN, this movie is one that needs to be celebrated not only for what it is, but what Indian cinema could be in several years' time. Imagine a day when superheroes from different film industries in India crossover into each other's movies and eventually team up! Hell, 3-4 movies down the line, maybe Minnal Murali is so popular that MCU figures out a way to make him cannon, or at least for a cameo?Excited to see what comes from this.",celebrate this what it is what indian cinema could be because it,change it was refreshing watch superhero movie that isnt about saving certain parts world that doesnt have sophisticated technology as superhero movie mollywood indian cinema it could have easily followed regular hollywood tropes but it didnt i thought that it stayed grounded relevant industry audience great cinematography great sound design people arent happy with vfx i didnt mind it at all story that could have been all over place but isnt humor great acting this film has it all era where we have high budget films without superheroes which modified cars are sent space press f family mm proves that you dont need anything flashy over top make film work bruhs out running his hawaii chappal despite being superhero as hes figuring his powers out theres enough time spent antagonist his backstory good character development overall process explaining everything did movie become tad too slow long first half maybe or maybe not all that said this was good origin story i would really like see sequel or two this but now that everythings been explained similar pacing future movie might become issue but i choose not worry about that rn this movie is one that needs be celebrated not only what it is but what indian cinema could be several years time imagine day when superheroes different film industries india crossover into each others movies eventually team up hell 3 4 movies down line maybe minnal murali is so popular that mcu figures out way make him cannon or at least cameo excited see what comes this,0.5023770519603852,0.2280665784832452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.29}"

Compelling characters, good CGI, a great plot, dope music and scenes which induce goosebumps!First of all, let me just mention that this is a very ambitious project in a way. A huge chunk of Malayalai audiences are often very divisive about superheroes and CGI and stuff. We did know that we would be getting Malayalam's first superhero here, but we also got a supervillain! With So, Basil Joseph is a very talented director and I love his style of directing. His movies mostly revolve around small towns and peculiar yet great characters.

This is original stuff right here.Yeah, there are a few superhero movie clichés but in a way, those are unavoidable.The character development is also really on, and I'm glad that the villain and his arc recieved just about the same attention as the hero and his arc. Those are compelling arcs as well, so... Need I say more?!Yeah, there were a few issues with the pacing, but y'know, I did mention that they focused a lot on character development here, so... Yeah. It just takes time to build up. Other than that, I seriously don't have an issue with this movie.Tovino's Minnal Murali and Guru Somasumdaram's Vellidi Venkidi are brilliantly acted and written characters.So, Minnal Murali is every bit worth the hype imo.

9,Long live the Basil-verse!,"It takes particular gall to attempt a superhero movie within the budgetary confines of Malayalam cinema, especially with the advent of the New Wave of Mollywood, rooted in realistic, down-to-earth storylines. Director Basil Joseph not only dares to delve into the genre but excels in his storytelling by giving us a bunch of affable, authentic characters and emotional sequences that are easy to relate to and empathize with.The eponymous Minnal Murali played by an excellent Tovino Thomas, is your classic village everyman, too ambitious and self-confident for this own good. He gains superhuman abilities after a freak accident and the rest of the story tracks how he comes to terms with his newfound powers and the mayhem that ensues in the village thereafter.Basil Joseph is minimalistic and downright stingy in his use of VFX and elaborate sets, instead focusing on the human side of the troubled superhero. Writers Arun Anirudhan and Justin Mathew deserve special praise for their excellent character development, so much so that they have the audience empathizing on occasion with even the antagonist, played by a terrific Guru Somasundharam.Amidst the superhuman hullabaloo, the director effortlessly blends in his signature elements of witty and quirky comedy, in the same vein as his earlier hits Kunjiramayanam (2015) and Godha (2017). Aju Varghese and Baiju are both in sparkling form, performing a delicate balancing act between treacherous villainy and bungling comedian at various points in the film.The first half is full of with moments of sheer comedy gold, peppered with callbacks and references to several Malayalam classics that will leave you with a smile on your face.Rajesh Madhavan has made nonchalant, straight-faced humour his own personal hallmark, delivering another compelling performance after Kanakam Kaamini Kalaham. Femina George marks her debut with an earnest performance while Harishree Ashokan shines in a rare serious character role.It is, however, master Vasisht Umesh who is my pick of the bunch when it came to the supporting cast, such is the sheer fun and genuine energy he brought to the character 'Josemon', giving off vibes of Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) from the MCU Spiderman series.The score and songs from the combined forces of Sushin Shyam and Shaan Rahman had captured our imagination when the lyrical videos and trailers of the movie released but they transport us to an altogether different realm when combined with Basil's brilliantly tailored visuals.Basil Joseph has cracked the 'Holy Grail' of genres and delivered the first authentic Malayali superhero that we can all be proud of. Minnal Murali is an able addition to the Indian pantheon of 'desi' superheros, right up there with Bhavesh Joshi Superhero (2018) and Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (2018) as the handful of Indian films that have managed to make a dent in a genre otherwise dominated by Hollywood.Be scared, MCU. Be very scared. Basil is gunning for you.

10,"Heard some words about the growth of Malayalam film industry a few years ago, this film proves that point.","This movie is only my fourth or fifth malyalam movie I have watched so far and it also provides us with a quality content like others watched previously and can say that in proportion of movies released it provide better content to the viewers as compared to Bollywood. Prior to this, we have only seen shaktimaan in hindi dramas and some animations and Krish (based on ET the Extra Territorial) thus, not much development in superhero genre. In contrast to this, we have seen many successful Hollywood movies in superhero genre like Batman Trilogy by Christopher Nolan and Marvel Avengers Endgame which have received high praises and popularity, even in India and they continue to extract as much from the genre.Coming to the story, in a self-contained village a ambitious tailer (because he wants to go to US to earn a fortune ) named Jaison played by Tovino Thomas suffered a lightening phenomenon on Christmas eve along with other guy named Shibu played by Guru Somasundaram, a worker in a tea shop who also plays the antagonist. After discovering the powers, they tried to test them and use it in daily life and the latter used it for robbing bank, killings to approach his love Usha. It brought him in conflict with villagers and minnal murali fight with him to save people of the land. The story writing is good and well implemented on screen although some cons are there. The acting was very good with special mention of Tovino Thomas and Guru Somasundaram and same can be said about music. The cinematography was excellent which is very visible in Jaison fight scene with the police and good VFX (visible in the fight scenes in the end) add stars to it, so I would like to appreciate the efforts of VFX team. It do takes inspiration from the Hollywood superhero movies but not a copy of it and provides a base for more superhero films in India. Not many cons, the first part of film which explores the lightening phenomenon and test of powers by two leads is bit slow but it pick up pace after that and also the powers are portrayed as bit hazy (not classified properly), maybe due to long story. Before ending, I would like to acknowledge it once more as both leads i.e. Protagonist and antagonist are given more or less equal screen time unlike other super hero movies, so great work from Basil Joseph. So, its a recommended film to people across various age groups and can be watched in a family space (not possible much in the period dominated by OTT players and poor content on TV).

10,A MUST WATCH Indian Superhero Film. ⚡,"Finally, we've got our own superhero with an amazing origin story. The best thing of Minnal Murali is its characters which are written perfectly. Among them I loved our villain/anti-hero the most. Guru Somasundaram as Shibu nailed his role, actually loved every actor's portrayal.The screenplay is written very carefully. I can say that writing wise, this film is better than many foreign superhero films. Action scenes are also very good. There's a sequence where our hero and villain encountered for the first time, for me that was the standout moment of this film. Definitely will wait for its sequels, hope they'll focus on its writing just like they've done here.
