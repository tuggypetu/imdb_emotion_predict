10,One of the best films of this decade,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.",one best films this decade,i am remarkably stingy with my 10 10 ratings ill be first person acknowledge this roughly 2600 titles ive rated here only 34 have 10 parasite is one them if this isnt masterpiece then i dont know what is im going keep it vague plot front because i didnt know anything about it going was really excited see it progress unfold satisfying unexpected ways what i will say is that this film more than just about any other ive seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent parts this movie were hilarious parts were heartbreaking other parts were insanely suspenseful im honestly not sure if ive felt this close edge my seat since final season breaking bad way back 2013 it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed amazingly acted every single member its cast all characters are understandable sympathetic some degree amount conflict drama tension derived narrative with no clear heroes villains is staggering you come care just about all them im stumped come up with any flaws this movie sure ive seen many movies that are hard fault but its rare that movie appeals me gut level excites me this degree while also being so close technically perfect its extremely entertaining thoroughly moving so many different ways as icing cake theres ton social commentary some heavy themes chew once movies over this ones not going leave my head while i can tell catch this one when you can believe hype joon ho bong has made many great films so far no bad ones but this even manages stand head shoulders above all others when it comes time consider what best film 2010s was this one will surely be up there,0.6553174603174604,0.24656084656084656,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8,"You name a genre, this movie covers it","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.",you name genre this movie covers it,i cant remember last time i saw movie that contained as many genres as parasite movie starts out almost like oceans eleven heist film then expands into comedy mystery thriller drama romance crime even horror film it really did have everything it was strikingly good at all them too i love film that respects its audience there are so many details this movie that are crucially important yet film trusts its audience notice them acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats there are lot layers this film i suspect this reason its rewatch ability factor will be very high film was incredibly entertaining too i cant think boring scene this movie yet surface large parts film you would say not lot is happening at least terms action fascinating characters brilliant dialogue are what create this i had great time with parasite i think most that give it chance will too,0.5658959435626102,0.29259611992945334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10,Thoroughly entertaining,"PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.",thoroughly entertaining,parasite is excellent effort korean director bong joon ho talent ive long admired since seeing host over decade ago hes had his ups downs over years although theyve generally been ups rather than downs but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece its quiet reflective work his maturist yet parable playing out which looks at class divide scathing extremely telling way issue is universal which is why this film did so well abroad at oscars although ive been championing quality south korean cinema long time technical qualities are exemplary acting is particularly astounding with unusual storyline building unexpected climax film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think,0.6023809523809524,0.11607142857142858,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10,For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.",those who didnt like movie because its second half,its not really review but my attempt explain how i interpreted movie those who complain that film is overrated especially if reason is that they didnt like second half it its much easier understand message movie when good guys win or bad guys get punished end im not saying that all hollywood films are so naive their portrayal moral values but still i believe that parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed watching which theres character with clearer moral center whom audiences can easily relate so i think its no surprise if message this film had failed register some audiences some complained that they dont understand ki taeks motive killing mr park but fully appreciate this you need understand meaning recurring expression dialogue which is crossing line its deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other peoples privacy or as one should mind ones own social position instead meddling with affairs those different position if interpreted as latter meaning it can serve as another image that emphasizes subject matter narrative along with more easy notice metaphor two families respective dwellings it would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if movie focused underprivileged but more likable family exploiting cold hearted snobbish family comical manner but movie would have lost all its genuine charms if bong joon ho chose such path he is too good director not see such danger instead he chose make mr park reasonable enough character despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature he seems treat ki taek fairly enough at first but he also warns latter not cross line if ki taek attempts pry into his private life at first it seems that its quite easy ki taek other members his family sneak into mr parks house various roles mingle with them ki taek even compliments how nice mr parks family is but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard when he was hiding under table what mr park really thinks him almost different species human being who doesnt even smell like him ki taeks final disillusionment came when mr park cringes smell dead basement dweller shows much more concern his sons shock while virtually ignoring ki taeks daughters status whos dying ground spurting blood stab wound that moment ki taek realizes how mr park sees him his whole family as not equal human being but something much more insignificant he also realizes line that separates two families is not just that courtesy or proper social behaviour instead it is line that can even determine life those lesser human beings be less important than passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock those proper human beings however easy it was ki taeks family sneak into mr parks house or however they try socialize mingle with mr parks family their existence is no better than that parasite which is also visualized so effectively by presence hidden basement room inside house with such disillusionment anger ki taek chose kill mr park as parasite could its host like parasite he keeps hiding deep inside dead hosts body until he could claim whole carcass use it as nourishment his offsprings tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice either mr parks or ki taeks personalities instead its line drawn by invisible hand separating those classes according their respective social conditions which can be so brutal as be able deprive two families their humanity contrasting manners that is what i believe be message this film is trying convey course not every movie must make commentary society rather than providing care free pastime that everyone can understand but without if movie didnt change its gear second half shed light serious inherent problem our society it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy instead deserving candidate be called best film year,0.4527210884353742,0.0901360544217687,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.",meritocracy its metaphorical,meritocracy success fortune are reserved those who deserve it those who develop solid plans according their talents abilities who execute those plans through hard work determination anyone can rise top some lucky cinderella plucked cinders gussied up gowns meritocracy represents heights perfect egalitarian society i started with nothing ended up with everything i ever desired you too can achieve you dreams if only you try promise unobstructed sunshine at top mountain becomes justification bitter competition backstabbing deceit callousness you climb crooked ladder until you make it straight one then perhaps when you at last feel secure you can afford be kind confident generous its easy be nice when youre rich mother this film jang hye jin at one point observes but its very long very crooked ladder sometimes rungs give out beneath your grip sometimes theyve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you sometimes ladder itself is simply kicked down either by those above you or just as often by those staring up ground below there are lot people trying climb that one ladder but meritocracy you cant blame ladder or other people trying climb it nor can you blame fact that all good stuff is kept so many stories up instead down at ground where everyone can easily reach it no you must blame yourself you should have tread more carefully you should have climbed more quickly you should have used firmer more precise grip anticipated disasters known just when leap if you fail meritocracy its all your fault you should have tried harder better luck next time kim ki woo choi woo sik young man who is main character parasite several times refers metaphors film itself is course metaphor surface level viewers are treated very thrilling engaging well paced well plotted crime story at all times however bubbling up beneath slick surface this genre film there are deeply personal meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer these insights are rarely foregrounded they are so subtly interwoven fact that if youre like me you may be completely surprised when final shots film roll you realize that you are emotionally devastated by intimate humanist story youve just witnessed bong joon hos filmmaking is so extraordinary here that hell make you fully invested lives his characters without you even realizing hes done so i want avoid spoilers here but suffice it say that parasite is masterpiece beautifully lensed enthrallingly edited superbly acted intimately involving south korea has population that is one sixth size united states that population is stacked into skyscrapers area slightly smaller than state kentucky higher education is widespread so parents with means try make their children stand above pack by hiring them tutors signing them up extracurriculars afterschool programs i lived korea once children i taught there were sometimes engaged learning ten twelve hours day six days week public school english immersion private school piano class soccer team taekwondo math camp chess club so i routinely worked sixty seventy hours week salary but at bars i would meet young men my age who were expected work far more than that who slept at their desks so that they did not need pry themselves work too long as father song kang ho film at one point says this is country where fifty young men with college degrees apply mere security guard job one cant afford not struggle themes this story are not just localized korea however they are story global capitalism specter american materialism imperialism note indians looms heavily over film meritocracy makes cannibals us all its nice dream sometimes dreamers who plan struggle well enough can indeed climb out basement into sunshine how nice ending it is when they do but film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning dreaming may be maybe just whims fancy more often it seems our pipe dreams are content leave us with nothing more than whiff spewed sewage,0.5115422300607486,0.17663237311385452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10,Thought It Might Win Best Foreign Movie,"When the buddy who got into college tells him he's moving to the US, and he's passing on the 14-year-old he's been tutoring -- just tell 'em you're enrolled in college, even though you aren't -- the son of a family so low class they've sunk through the foundation finds them very nice, very accepting, and very clueless. So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion.

7,Parasite,"Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that.",parasite,parasite became first foreign language film win best picture oscar first third film had me wondering why film opens dilapidated smelly semi basement south korea kim family is so poor that they need borrow neighbours wifi lose it when it becomes password protected they make living by folding cardboard pizza boxes dad ki taek is weak link he cannot even fold boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted son ki woo gets stroke fortune when friend helps him get well paid tutoring job with fake diploma ki woo tutors daughter wealthy park family who live lavish mansion soon ki woo gets his sister ki jung job as art tutor disruptive younger son wily ki jung conspires get parks family chauffeur fired have him replaced by their father before long they manoeuvre get housekeeper dismissed by preying her allergy peaches be replaced by their mother chung sook all them claim be strangers park family pretty soon kims are earning good money living well they are street smart who have taken advantage naivety wealthy parks their good fortune is threatened when one night when parks are away break former housekeeper returns looking something she left behind i thought movie would turn out be similar joseph loseys servant which was scripted by harold pinter it goes that direction but then swerves off when bong joon ho accepted his best director oscar he publicly thanked martin scorsese it was his movies bong studied film school key is scorseses own british influences ranging ealing films hitchcock powell pressburger there is parasite park household but film is about class fatalistic metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into twisted blood soaked tragedy parasite has heightened reality parks are wealthy who never look down even their own house as they have no need they are nice but when one them inadvertently mentions odour ordinary working people like those who travel crowded tube trains they seal their fate bong shows that those bottom rung south korean society cannot advance very far ki woo has dream but it is more likely be dashed fate fortune will ensure that,0.5362840862840863,0.1621818921818921,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes.

9,"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.","A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10",parasite review comedy drama suspense yes even horror,family who doesnt have lot money or opportunities life starts working wealthy family but will this change life poor family director bong joon ho screenwriters bong joon ho han jin wan cast song kang ho lee sun kyun cho yeo jeong choi woo shik park so dam lee jung eun chang hyae jin movie we follow kim family who doesnt have much money by chance son family starts working wealthy park family he teaches their daughter english now rest family sees opportunities make money they have plan remove rest staff who work wealthy park family then take jobs themselves bong joon ho addresses deeper themes but he always manages create entertainment some surprising scenes that bring out smile movie is mostly charming until kim family discovers big secret house then movie starts get darker it explodes into wonderful finale where we see understand message movie title movie turns things its head because what i thought be quite obvious at beginning movie is turned upside down i got aha experience parasites are found all classes society technical aspect i think this was beautifully crafted film direction cinematography there are so many beautiful scenes movie its pretty well done considering that most action takes place inside big house not so big garden my favorite sequence is when kim family has run home when rain is pouring down you feel like theyre board titanic they must run top down engine room what wonderful sequence its so beautiful watch cast was fantastic everyone fit needs their roles characters were well written with performances complementing that perfectly it does great job creating collection characters that feel like real people whom despite their eccentricities maintained grounded realistic feel musical score complements scenes nicely elevates emotional responses without feeling overbearing so if you like foreign films thrillers or movies that can make you think little check this one out its crisp film technical aspect with blend great writing acting you cant go wrong it was solid film that treats audience with intelligence 9 10,0.5285460992907801,0.2688829787234042,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.25}"
9,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times.

8,A black comedy on social inequality,"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.",black comedy social inequality,there is no shortage films that depict injustice social inequality but originality is scarce with large proportion its population below poverty line it is noteworthy that filmmaker south korea has produced work that has attracted almost universal acclaim parasite 2019 generates great deal conversation but be warned it is not film everyone especially those averse gory endings if you step back storys twists turns narrative premise is simple family petty crooks living abject poverty get lucky as one by one each tricks their way into being employed by same heartlessly wealthy family roles like tutor driver housekeeper gullible family is easy deceive while crooks manufacture various scenarios their own advantage occupation luxurious home by crooks adds new meaning concept home invasion however plan comes un stuck when they find secret dungeon that leads horrific consequences film takes too much time developing central premise various sub plots more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens but that is not point film director joon ho bong paints intricate portrait normalisation poverty class privilege with both sets family never questioning their place south koreas social order this acceptance its destructiveness human spirit makes change impossible condemns korean society moral bankruptcy there is more this film than political discourse as black comedy it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments filming style expresses polemic obvious ways juxtaposing world occupied by smelly cramped underclass with opulent world rich is low hanging fruit one can also find elements magical fantasy as it requires unequivocal suspension disbelief accept that family losers can so easily dupe family high achievers acting tends towards wooden it is difficult warm any particular character films climax offers little other than ambivalent balance between hope nihilism leaving viewers decide which family are parasites many critical pendulum swings towards masterpiece label but it is perhaps closer reality describe this as original engaging disturbing tale endemic class tension oppression helplessness although tenuous message has universal relevance,0.4911369762313158,0.07103426447766072,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10,"Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""","If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of ""helping the poor"". Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of ""would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family"".Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is.",without spoiling it parasite is amazing film equivalent is it wrong steel bread feed starving family,if theres argument thats been part society since dawn time is that class days cavemen roman empire enlightment even modern times philosophers scholars storytellers have explored ideology wealthy poor its something that people have wanted fix create more equality people that discuss whether things should be equal at all its hard give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints thats its challenging paint who exactly is wrong there are good wealthy people bad poor people vice versa this is also something that many movies has dived into fact one my favorite movies 2000s is science fiction thriller snowpiercer it was creative way look at corrupted societies how it unfavorably placed poor without way out its movie with lot layers korean director boon joon ho knew it was important make it just as entertaining as it was explore read into it looks like hes made another movie about class except parasite is smaller story about two families but is still as impactful we start with family four living slums basement under store father kim ki taek played by song kang ho mother chung sook played by jang hye jin son kim ki woo played by choi woo shik daughter kim ki jeong played by park so dam they struggle work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes when friend son comes visit he offers kim ki woo english tutoring job wealthy familys daughter he accepts sees world he only dreamt fancy house built by famous architect wide space backyard nice cars after some convincing family scheme is made so that daughter is hired as art therapist youngest son father as new driver errand runner mother as new housekeeper family is overjoyed that their con has fooled other family this leads into them celebrating when other family leaves camping trip by eating drinking living room things go wrong when previous housekeeper returns get something though there is second half movie i cant talk about it without spoiling it parasite is one those movies that spans lot genres yet keeps it focused enough make it one best movies 2019 it may sound like typical dark comedy but because character development focuses all four members family it allowed story go variety directions that i didnt expect at front this is still story class difference lot these movies will revolve around theme helping poor thankfully parasite is smarter movie tries something different parasite doesnt try make wealthy family out be villains but they dont try paint main family complete positive light either these are all grey characters that are simply living life lengths their going climb up this could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting party together child if anything it tries lean into how stabbing others back get what they want is bad but even that can depend number factors this movie is prime example would you steal loaf bread feed starving family not only is movie written directed beautifully but its acted amazingly though movie is korean you can tell actors are still giving it their all as they each understand complexities their situation why each one would make decisions they make this also remains one better ensemble pieces ive seen this year hence why im not naming them one by one i noticed this as well snowpiercer with how bong joon ho knows how cast as whole work with what he has ill give this ten fancy houses out ten it may be different language but this is already one my favorite movies year this is kind movie that can be hard describe but my best bet is simply tell others see it i feel like that even talking about it little could ruin it check it out see just how complicated class difference really is,0.5823333052229154,0.10887445887445887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"

10,The Best Film in Years.,"Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.4/4",best film years,maybe its just me but i have known decline film quality since 2017 2016 was very good year film last great year altogether have i simply seen too many films 2016 earlier there were whole bunch films that i could say now that is one very best films i have ever seen since 2017 most that i could say about i film i love would have been i love this film but i dont adore it one best year not ever finally near end decade comes film i can comfortably say is one finest motion pictures i have ever laid eyes movie is korean so there are subtitles it does run over two hours but throughout that duration time stands still we are fully immersed this tale shakespearean portions hitchcockian brains parasite follows two families dirt poor kims filthy rich parks being opposite ends social spectrum many people interpret this as social satirical film i can see where they are coming but i didnt care about that many different themes such as identity are also looked at but that is all just icing cake placing them opposite ends spectrum just makes story characters another relationships all more great it is sad seeing kims such bad living conditions so we root them right away get out slums ki woo is son who aspires get out poverty by attending university he is approached by one his university friends who is going overseas study take over tutoring park da hye english ki woo does not know english well but figures he can fake it make some money he may be just tutor but it pays well he finds out that parks are looking therapist their son so ki woo gets his sister assume new identity be boys therapist with more money coming only two more people kim family need good job it all seems like sinch get them but getting rid people their way keeping their true identities under wraps parks will be harder than they could fathom parasite could be simplified as family vs family but there are couple more characters other than regular family members that are all so interesting most movies cannot handle developing these many characters they are smart sympathetic even likeable reason i call this film hitchcockian is because its power thrill us take viewer places they could never imagine even when movie is unpredictable payoffs are plausible viewer is able tie things together easily but with this each time twist comes which is frequent viewer is still left flabbergasted completely caught off guard director really pulls out rug underneath watching this movie was such breath fresh air director bong joon ho could easily have messed up at any moment but there is not one second wasted or subpar material fact it it just opposite movie keeps building just gets better by minute thrills get stronger stronger as twists get smarter more intricate with all that happens parasite becomes imservie film experience that you will never forget 4 4,0.4737956992502446,0.23353076216712582,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.36}"

Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws.

It is shame that I had to watch it online because they aren't showing it in my cinema.,i really cant compare it any other movie,probably best movie this year i was edge my seat through whole movie acting is so natural trailer didnt reveal anything me im grateful that this is another korean masterpiece it reminds me little oldboy it is shame that i had watch it online because they arent showing it my cinema,0.31071428571428567,0.16964285714285715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.56, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.22}"
7,Lacks any realistic human dimension,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink.

7,Great,"I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.7 stars",great,i tried watch this movie once faded out after first ten minutes its surprising too as first scenes with slacker family were very very funny entertaining it reminded me beginning old boy way upon my second viewing i was stunned fully engrossed entertained all way through this is perhaps best film year i havent seen little women or 1917 yet story is about slacker family who stealthy make their way into lives rich family by becoming their employees rich family doesnt know they are related poor family discover man living basement who happens be former maids husband violence ensues movie just becomes more detailed fun thrilling entertaining all way through usually movies tend drop out near end or close climax i find i usually get bored at this point this film doesnt do that it almost reminds me fight club with its dark humor thrills fact thats only movie that comes mind though they are very different films parasite does have its own take class which is very prevalent it seems rich poor are very similar with middle class not even being presented movie overall this is tremendous movie im glad i gave it second chance probably best movie year 7 stars,0.5166666666666667,0.2011458333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.56, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.18}"
