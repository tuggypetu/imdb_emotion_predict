,Never seen a Bollywood film? then DCH is the best place to start.,"DCH is like a breath of fresh air. It shows how bringing youth into an industry is always a good thing. Just compare this film with Yaadein, from Bollywood veteran Subash Ghai.Where as Yaadein is probably one of the worst things to come out of a camera, DCH is one the best. It's just one of those films you'll find hard not to like, basically because it's exactly how the medium of Indian films should be used.Rather than just cut and paste a song into the film, the filmmakers have done very well to make each song feel wanted, visually interesting, and they never drag. The result is a near 3hr film that just flies by. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work, and some truly excellent casting. Everyone carries the film, and the 3 guys, Safi, Akshay and Aamir are too good together!Hopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. Technically DCH can easily stand up against anything from the West. Editing, Directing, Cinematography, lighting, set design -- everything just works so well.Sometimes Bollywood can produce some truly great films, and this is most definately one of them!! You must watch it.",never seen bollywood film then dch is best place start,dch is like breath fresh air it shows how bringing youth into industry is always good thing just compare this film with yaadein bollywood veteran subash ghai where as yaadein is probably one worst things come out camera dch is one best its just one those films youll find hard not like basically because its exactly how medium indian films should be used rather than just cut paste song into film filmmakers have done very well make each song feel wanted visually interesting they never drag result is near 3hr film that just flies by comedy drama great songs love stories that work some truly excellent casting everyone carries film 3 guys safi akshay aamir are too good together hopefully this film is wake up call rest bollywood who seem be obsessed with unoriginality technically dch can easily stand up against anything west editing directing cinematography lighting set design everything just works so well sometimes bollywood can produce some truly great films this is most definately one them you must watch it,0.5188492063492064,0.33531746031746035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,the most realistic depiction of Indian youth in Bollywood,"After a string of Bollywood stinkers, this film was a breath of fresh air! Upon first glance, it might seem like the story has been rehashed from the plotlines of several other Indian films. But the presentation blew me away! Yes, I agree that Dil Chahta Hai has been heavily influenced by the Hollywood style of filmmaking. But it still retains the same passion and romanticism that has become a Bollywood staple ever since the beginning, thus making DCH a thousand times better than other ""Hollywood-wannabees"".Another thing that you might notice while watching the film is that there is not much of a plot. It just... floats along. But that's what makes it great; you never know where the next scene might lead you. What ties the story together is the bond of friendship shared by the three main leads. All the performances were terrific, especially Aamir Khan, who is probably the most respected actor of his generation.Ultimately, what's great about the film is that it connects to the youth. The depiction of youth is so dead-on and realistic that you would be disgusted at the way youth is treated in other Bollywood films, where every college student aside from the hero/heroine are party-going idiots or jittery nerds! In DCH, however, the people talk like how they're supposed to talk, and nothing seems unrealistic about their personality. While watching the film, it becomes quite evident that Farhan Akhtar belongs to a breed of young, talented directors. What they lack in experience, they make up with an ambitious vision and raw talent.If you haven't seen the film yet, go watch it. You'll be surprised at how much hope is still left in Bollywood.",most realistic depiction indian youth bollywood,after string bollywood stinkers this film was breath fresh air upon first glance it might seem like story has been rehashed plotlines several other indian films but presentation blew me away yes i agree that dil chahta hai has been heavily influenced by hollywood style filmmaking but it still retains same passion romanticism that has become bollywood staple ever since beginning thus making dch thousand times better than other hollywood wannabees another thing that you might notice while watching film is that there is not much plot it just floats along but thats what makes it great you never know where next scene might lead you what ties story together is bond friendship shared by three main leads all performances were terrific especially aamir khan who is probably most respected actor his generation ultimately whats great about film is that it connects youth depiction youth is so dead realistic that you would be disgusted at way youth is treated other bollywood films where every college student aside hero heroine are party going idiots or jittery nerds dch however people talk like how theyre supposed talk nothing seems unrealistic about their personality while watching film it becomes quite evident that farhan akhtar belongs breed young talented directors what they lack experience they make up with ambitious vision raw talent if you havent seen film yet go watch it youll be surprised at how much hope is still left bollywood,0.5104506604506605,0.07103729603729604,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,AAMIR- the best actor in bollywood,"Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident. The acting is just phenomenal. All-star cast. All-good film. The story is great - plenty of laughs to be had here, with sad moments, too.

9.0,Dil Chahta Hai - most appropriate title,"This movie was released in the year 2001, the time when bollywood seemed to be in doldrums, producing one trash after another, the same year when another masterpiece ""Lagaan"" was released from bollywood and the year I finished my college and entered my first job and wow what an experience - it was just like a fresh breath of air.The first movie by an unknown young guy Farhan Akhtar (may be known earlier because of his famous parents Javed Akhtar - lyricist in this movie - and Honey Irani) and what a fantastic job he did both in direction and script writing. For me, he did a great job by experimenting with a novel idea, moving away from the well established norms of the bollywood industry and not presenting yet again melodramatic bollywood plot.The story revolves around three friends (supposedy born to very rich parents) - their relationship and their personal lifes - the guys with totally different natures and with their different meaning of life. However, the only thing that keeps them ever together is their never ending friendship.The story is not so great, doesn't convey any specific message but it keeps you glued and is refreshing as many times you watch it. In fact, many of the college going Indian youth (and even from other countries) would be able to relate themselves with the three main movie protagonists.All the actors have given very good performance. Aamir Khan simply reaffirmed his talent. He plays a prankster, who has knack of turning every thing into funny and the one who doesn't believe in the institution of love, but ultimately falls for it. For Saif Ali Khan this movie may even be called his re-birth. He plays a character who falls for every other girl, but is unable to express it when he really starts loving the one. Akhshay Khanna playing a bit mature and serious character may have seemed slightly weaker than the other two, but he played his character very well. This guy has a very different meaning for love and falls for an older woman. Preity Zinta looks amazing (as always) with an all different hair style. Sonali Kulkarni didn't seem so much at ease with the commercial cinema, but then too gave pretty good performance.Music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy combination was also refreshing and different from all that mushy mushy Hindi film music. The great thing about songs that they didn't break the movie rhythm and seemed more to be part of the movie's story.In all, a must watch movie.",dil chahta hai most appropriate title,this movie was released year 2001 time when bollywood seemed be doldrums producing one trash after another same year when another masterpiece lagaan was released bollywood year i finished my college entered my first job wow what experience it was just like fresh breath air first movie by unknown young guy farhan akhtar may be known earlier because his famous parents javed akhtar lyricist this movie honey irani what fantastic job he did both direction script writing me he did great job by experimenting with novel idea moving away well established norms bollywood industry not presenting yet again melodramatic bollywood plot story revolves around three friends supposedy born very rich parents their relationship their personal lifes guys with totally different natures with their different meaning life however only thing that keeps them ever together is their never ending friendship story is not so great doesnt convey any specific message but it keeps you glued is refreshing as many times you watch it fact many college going indian youth even other countries would be able relate themselves with three main movie protagonists all actors have given very good performance aamir khan simply reaffirmed his talent he plays prankster who has knack turning every thing into funny one who doesnt believe institution love but ultimately falls it saif ali khan this movie may even be called his re birth he plays character who falls every other girl but is unable express it when he really starts loving one akhshay khanna playing bit mature serious character may have seemed slightly weaker than other two but he played his character very well this guy has very different meaning love falls older woman preity zinta looks amazing as always with all different hair style sonali kulkarni didnt seem so much at ease with commercial cinema but then too gave pretty good performance music by shankar eshaan loy combination was also refreshing different all that mushy mushy hindi film music great thing about songs that they didnt break movie rhythm seemed more be part movies story all must watch movie,0.5728077268643308,0.23878930817610056,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.44}"
9.0,Dil Chata Hai - What the Heart Desires,"I am not a fan on Hindi movies at all, but since I decided to study in India, learn a little Hindi and whatever else, I have expanded my Hindi film repertoire from just Lagaan and Amar Prem to include Dil Chata Hai.The story is simple  at first, and is largely interspersed with a lot of English. Even I could understand the story without any subtitles. (Although you might turn it on for intense moments of extreme speed Hindi) Three spoilt rich best friends grow up, and in doing so, learn that their relationships between themselves, women and their families becomes tense as they mature and travel.""What the Heart Wants"" is a sort of theme that persists throughout the film. One friend is stuck to a girl he cannot get, another to an older woman, and the last one is just struggling with many girls he cannot choose between. For a Hindi film, the dance-music numbers are not terrible (but of course not great) and the music without the dance is quite nice, with a lot of meaning attached to it. So after a major fallout they realize many things separately, and learn about their own relationship in turn.I recommend this film to anyone as a primer to Bollywood films  I know I used it as one. High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane, although still sticking to the three plus hours.""Can what the Heart Want be controlled?""

10.0,Fantastic fun and full of surprises,"I stumbled over this film on late night TV and immediately ordered the DVD. It's a corker! Fresh, invigorating, romantic, bizarre even!They don't make films like this in the West - and more's the pity but hence the freshness. The three lead actors are gorgeous - so it hardly matters that they must be the oldest students in town. The cinematography is beautiful - especially in the Australian sequences. The song and dance routines are as welcome as they are surprising.As with all Hindi films, it is pure melodrama of course. The ability to suspend one's disbelief is a necessity. But that aside, it has all the attributes of a good old fashioned Hollywood romance. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl... etc., times three.The core theme of friendship is a delight - as are the subtle homo-erotic overtones of Akash and Sid's relationship. Intended or not, I wouldn't have minded if they'd ended up together - but this is Bollywood remember!All in all, fantastic fun which I plan to watch again and again. Highly recommended.",fantastic fun full surprises,i stumbled over this film late night tv immediately ordered dvd its corker fresh invigorating romantic bizarre even they dont make films like this west mores pity but hence freshness three lead actors are gorgeous so it hardly matters that they must be oldest students town cinematography is beautiful especially australian sequences song dance routines are as welcome as they are surprising as with all hindi films it is pure melodrama course ability suspend ones disbelief is necessity but that aside it has all attributes good old fashioned hollywood romance boy meets girl boy loses girl etc times three core theme friendship is delight as are subtle homo erotic overtones akash sids relationship intended or not i wouldnt have minded if theyd ended up together but this is bollywood remember all all fantastic fun which i plan watch again again highly recommended,0.5221527777777777,0.23955357142857148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.34, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Bollywood 2.0,"Less is more in Farhan Akhtar's 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Strip away melodramatic plots which always drag on longer than they are supposed to. Get rid of unbelievable protagonists who have all the answers and can fight off a horde of villains. Have no 'villains' to speak of, with the exception of the dude engaged to the girl you fancy, who acts like a bit of a prick.Build a story about the people you spend most of the time with - your friends, your dawgs, your posse, and ponder how you guys are going to sort out the really important things in your life. Like falling in love. Cracking on your friend who seems to fall for every girl he sees. Or your sensitive friend Sid who is in love with a much older woman - is he crazy? Wince as two of your best friends get into a very heated argument which splits them up and wonder what you will do now that you're caught in the middle. Hope for love and friendship to find a way through to reconciliation.Make a smart movie, without elaborate dance pieces set to a sweet soundtrack that remains in the top 10 a year after the film's release. In fact have a song that parodies the 'running around trees' segment that every other Hindi film since the 1950s has had and that the guys at school used to kid about. I mean, guys don't express their love for girls that way! Keep out guns, drugs, politics, strife, and family melodrama. Lace up your script with generous doses of humor which brings to light the hereunto underused Saif Ali Khan. Finally make sure the 'heroes' have shown some growth at the end of it. Of course it's been done to death in LA. That it could have been done so well in Mumbai is the astonishing thing.Finally, make reality cool again. Whatever your heroes wear, however they cut their hair, right down to the way they interact has to be believable. Make short hair and a goatee beard the national craze amongst guys. Put some real thought into color coding and matching outfits and give a laid-back style to the proceedings.Welcome ""Dil Chahta Hai"". The film that has had the largest influence of the look and hopefully the story of the biggest Bollywood films to follow it. A film that many people have been able to relate to. It seemed so obvious until Farhan Akhtar did it.

,Well worth the time it takes to watch,"Indian movies tend to have a reputation for (a) being musicals and (b) having overmodulated, distorted sound tracks, as if everyone was singing and playing through a guitar fuzzbox. Fuzz is fine in its place (heavy metal rock music, for example) but a surfeit of it can readily wear down the listener.Dil Chahta Hai is a welcome breath of fresh air in the genre. It does have musical numbers but they're very pleasant on the ear, as is the sound track in general - modern musical styles, in some cases mixed with more traditional musical instruments (even a didgeridoo, the presence of which is explained below).I have an absolute hatred of musicals so for me to find this movie likable it really has to be something special. The awards it has already won demonstrate that it IS something special.The storyline is a little convoluted (which may explain why it takes 3 hours to run its course - around twice as long as its western counterparts, although Indian audiences may prefer the much longer format) but the acting is excellent throughout and the viewer is kept interested as the multiple interwoven plots twist and turn.This movie demands concentration though, to get the whole picture. There is a good deal of spoken English mixed with Hindi, so the subtitles are a must for those who don't understand Hindi, but the English speech is not often mirrored in the subtitles, so one must both listen carefully and watch carefully in order not to miss a beat.The subtitles themselves are not perfect, using unusual punctuation at times to emphasize a point (a word bracketed by a plus or minus symbol on one side and a two thirds fraction on the other takes a little time to absorb, for example).But these are only minor niggles. This movie is richly textured and provides a visual a feast throughout, especially if, like me, you are not familiar with the sights and sounds of places like Bombay and Goa. A good part of the movie is also set in Sydney, Australia, providing plenty of material to keep the interest going (and hence the presence of the aboriginal instrument noted earlier).This is very much a westernised production, with characters and behaviours that are possibly harder for traditional Indian audiences to identify with; I had no difficulty though with identifying with the three main male characters - three guys who are firm friends and have been for some years, and who may separate but somehow always manage to come back together when circumstances demand it. This kind of theme is pretty universal - the British TV series ""Last of the Summer Wine"" operates along pretty much the same lines, albeit fifty years on.One of the themes is the conflict between traditionalist parents and modernist offspring (in particular the arranged marriage) and the author leaves the audience to make up their own mind about which is ""right"", but maybe with a slight nudge in the direction of the traditionalists.The only gripe I have is with the choice of the anglicised title ""Do Your Thing"" for the US market. I think that totally misses the point of the movie. From the subtitles, Dil Chahta Hai translates as ""The heart wants..."", which would be more accurately and pertinently translated as ""What The Heart Wants..."".In other words, the storyline is more about following your heart in love than it is about leading a self-indulgent life (which, obviously, these characters do most of the time - courtesy of being very well off and generally able to please themselves what they do; not quite the little rich kids, but verging on it).This movie is that rare beast, a guy flick that is also a chick flick. Guys will enjoy watching it for the macho moments, girls will enjoy it for the soulful scenes (and the fact that the women generally behave with more maturity than the guys) and the weepy bits.All in all a very enjoyable, watchable movie. If this is a new direction for the so-called Bollywood cinema, then it is very welcome and I would like to see more of the same.As a professional writer I'd even be interested in contributing to that new direction...",well worth time it takes watch,indian movies tend have reputation being musicals b having overmodulated distorted sound tracks as if everyone was singing playing through guitar fuzzbox fuzz is fine its place heavy metal rock music example but surfeit it can readily wear down listener dil chahta hai is welcome breath fresh air genre it does have musical numbers but theyre very pleasant ear as is sound track general modern musical styles some cases mixed with more traditional musical instruments even didgeridoo presence which is explained below i have absolute hatred musicals so me find this movie likable it really has be something special awards it has already won demonstrate that it is something special storyline is little convoluted which may explain why it takes 3 hours run its course around twice as long as its western counterparts although indian audiences may prefer much longer format but acting is excellent throughout viewer is kept interested as multiple interwoven plots twist turn this movie demands concentration though get whole picture there is good deal spoken english mixed with hindi so subtitles are must those who dont understand hindi but english speech is not often mirrored subtitles so one must both listen carefully watch carefully order not miss beat subtitles themselves are not perfect using unusual punctuation at times emphasize point word bracketed by plus or minus symbol one side two thirds fraction other takes little time absorb example but these are only minor niggles this movie is richly textured provides visual feast throughout especially if like me you are not familiar with sights sounds places like bombay goa good part movie is also set sydney australia providing plenty material keep interest going hence presence aboriginal instrument noted earlier this is very much westernised production with characters behaviours that are possibly harder traditional indian audiences identify with i had no difficulty though with identifying with three main male characters three guys who are firm friends have been some years who may separate but somehow always manage come back together when circumstances demand it this kind theme is pretty universal british tv series last summer wine operates along pretty much same lines albeit fifty years one themes is conflict between traditionalist parents modernist offspring particular arranged marriage author leaves audience make up their own mind about which is right but maybe with slight nudge direction traditionalists only gripe i have is with choice anglicised title do your thing us market i think that totally misses point movie subtitles dil chahta hai translates as heart wants which would be more accurately pertinently translated as what heart wants other words storyline is more about following your heart love than it is about leading self indulgent life which obviously these characters do most time courtesy being very well off generally able please themselves what they do not quite little rich kids but verging it this movie is that rare beast guy flick that is also chick flick guys will enjoy watching it macho moments girls will enjoy it soulful scenes fact that women generally behave with more maturity than guys weepy bits all all very enjoyable watchable movie if this is new direction so called bollywood cinema then it is very welcome i would like see more same as professional writer id even be interested contributing that new direction,0.46045800571310774,0.1827942692228407,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Beginning of a new generation of Bollywood films,"Before getting into the details, I must admit that this is certainly one of the best and most entertaining films I have ever seen!RATING: ****1/2 out of *****Plot ---- The story is about three very good friends and their relationships with each other. Aamir Khan plays a sociable and mischievous Akash, Saif Ali Khan plays a confused, often 'love-struck' Sameer and Akshaye Khanna plays a mature, confident Siddharth or Sid. Preity Zinta plays Shalini - Akash's love interest, though throughout the film Akash claims that he does not believe in love. Sonali Kulkarni plays Pooja with whom Sameer finally (really) falls in love and Dimple Kapadia is Tara Jaiswal, a divorced middle-aged alcholic. Thats all one needs to know about the film because right from the first reel the viewer is absorbed into the story and learns about each character.Review ------ Full credit must go to the director Farhan Akhtar who has broken many of the Bollywood production norms in order to make a technically perfect and enjoyable film. It would be unfair to call Aamir Khan the life of the DCH though his popularity in India and abroad would have drawn a substantial part of the film's audience. He gives a brilliant performance as usual as Akash. His scenes with Akshaye Khanna and some scenes shot in Australia (Opera, phone call to Sid, etc) are mind-blowing! SAif Ali Khan is the surprise packet of Dil Chahta Hai and there is a lot of untapped talent in him especially where comedy roles are concerned. But I felt that the best performance came from Akshaye Khanna who plays the character of Sid to perfection. His mannerisms, thinking, behaviour is very authentic and makes us all identify with his character closely. Preity Zinta looks gorgeous and is her usual chirpy self. Sonali Kulkarni could have certainly looked better without all that makeup. Dimple Kapadia shows how a good role can bring out an elegant performance from a seasoned actress.The best aspect of Dil Chahta Hai other than the actors' performances was the music. This is hopefully the start of more non-run of the mill compositions in Bollywood. Ofcourse, I hope for a lot more compositions like these from the music directors Shankar-Eshaan-Loy. The title song was the best and gels really well with this trndy film. Other good songs are 'Jaane Kyon', 'Kaise HAi yeh Rut' and 'Tanhayee'. 'Woh ladki hai kahan' - a parody of old Hindi songs is simply hillarious. The lyrics provided by the director's father, veteran Javed Akhtar are simply amazing and complement the story of the film to perfection!Overall, a very entertaining feature and I hope to see more films like these in the near future.

9.0,A very fine and realistic depiction of modern urban India and its youth,"Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai is a true example of cutting-edge cinema. It is a groundbreaking film in that it realistically portrays the life of Indian upper-class youth and shows the urban and modern India in the most precise way through the story of three close friends and their experiences. The characters are real and very easy to relate to, the dialogues are simple and genuine, the proceedings are dramatic yet realistic, and the film is extremely interesting and entertaining. The film is emotional, but it never goes over-the-top. Farhan Akhtar makes an impressive directorial debut. His excellent direction is aided by extraordinary music, brilliant cinematography, effective editing, fantastic city locations and some very impressive performances by the ensemble cast. The camaraderie between the three friends looks most real and believable. I can't recall any other Indian film I've seen before or after Dil Chahta Hai which portrayed true friendship as well as this one.Aamir Khan, though initially seems to be miscast in the role of the completely cynical womaniser Akash, demonstrates a very fine versatility in this role and successfully shows the gradual growth in his character with depth and humour. Saif Ali Khan, in his best performance up until that point, is just brilliant as the insecure and very kindhearted Sameer. He displays confusion and fear with great conviction and a fantastic pinch of comedy. Akshaye Khanna is outstanding in this wonderful dramatic role of a serious and sensitive guy who falls for a woman much ahead of his age. Preity Zinta is marvelous as Shalini and skillfully sensitises her character. She plays the part with grace and restraint, and her inner feelings are perfectly understood thanks to her expressive eyes.

9.0,An Excellent movie with real life situations!!!,"Dil Chahta Hai Starring: Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni, Dimple Kapadia and Ayub Khan Director: Farhan Akhtar Music: Shankar-Eshan-Loy Released. Debutant director Farhan Akhtar's (son of Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani) Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three friends and their respective thinking of love. It has a new, trendy and youthful look, completely different from the standards norms of the Bollywood film.Akash (Aamir Khan), Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) and Siddharth aka Sid (Akshaye Khanna), three close friends, have completed their education and are on the threshold of life. Akash does not believe in love. He is a flirt and his love affairs do not last for more than a month. Sameer believes in love. He is always carrying his heart on his palm and falling in love every time. But he still has not found that special girl. Sid, a painter, is the most sensitive and mature among the three. He knows the true meaning of love. He finds love in everything, everywhere and everytime.All three are enjoying life. Then comes the twist when Sid falls in love with older woman Tara Jaiswal (Dimple Kapadia), an interior designer, who is a divorcee. Akash is not able to understand the depth of Sid's love and hurts his sentiments for which Sid slaps Akash, thus creating a rfit between the two friends. Sameer tries to bridge the gap but is unsuccessful. Sid leaves for a painting workshop at Kaushali. Akash leaves for Australia for his dad's business. On the flight, he meets Shalini (Preity Zinta), who he had briefly known earlier. Their friendship slowly blossoms into love. Meanwhile Sameer also finds his special girl in Pooja (Sonali Kulkarni), whom he wants to marry. Time has passed. All three friends are again in the same town -- but things are different for them now.Full marks to director Farhan Akhtar for giving a completely new and fresh look to the film in his debut film. The storyline is different from the run-of-the-mill fares which we are used to seeing for such a long time. Farhan is a welcomed entry in the list of talented and young directors. He has also dared to be different. He has taken care of the minutest details in the film. Technically, the film is no way behind some of the best Hollywood movies.Now the performances -- all the three leads are fabulous. They all fit their roles to a T. Aamir Khan as expected is the best. He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father. He definitely is the best among the current lot who does his work with precision and utmost dedication. Saif Ali Khan is a wonderful surprise in this film. This is his career-best role and one cannot imagine anyone else playing Sameer's role. His sense of timing and facial expressions are very natural and makes Sameer a very adorable character in the film.The least significant role was of Sameer but Saif made it very important. Now comes the final winner -- Akshaye Khanna. An actor-par excellence and very natural in front of the camera, Akshaye has played the role of Sid to perfection. His emotions and expressive face say a lot. He has given a spell-binding performance. Preity looks great in her new look and has acted well. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted and Dimple Kapadia still looks gorgeous and plays her role well.Music and the picturisation of the songs flow with the mood of the film. The locales of Sydney and Goa have been brilliantly shot. The first half of the film has some of the light good moments. The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy. But one thing is sure -- Bollywood has got one more talented director in Farhan Akhtar.",excellent movie with real life situations,dil chahta hai starring aamir khan saif ali khan akshaye khanna preity zinta sonali kulkarni dimple kapadia ayub khan director farhan akhtar music shankar eshan loy released debutant director farhan akhtars son javed akhtar honey irani dil chahta hai is story three friends their respective thinking love it has new trendy youthful look completely different standards norms bollywood film akash aamir khan sameer saif ali khan siddharth aka sid akshaye khanna three close friends have completed their education are threshold life akash does not believe love he is flirt his love affairs do not last more than month sameer believes love he is always carrying his heart his palm falling love every time but he still has not found that special girl sid painter is most sensitive mature among three he knows true meaning love he finds love everything everywhere everytime all three are enjoying life then comes twist when sid falls love with older woman tara jaiswal dimple kapadia interior designer who is divorcee akash is not able understand depth sids love hurts his sentiments which sid slaps akash thus creating rfit between two friends sameer tries bridge gap but is unsuccessful sid leaves painting workshop at kaushali akash leaves australia his dads business flight he meets shalini preity zinta who he had briefly known earlier their friendship slowly blossoms into love meanwhile sameer also finds his special girl pooja sonali kulkarni whom he wants marry time has passed all three friends are again same town but things are different them now full marks director farhan akhtar giving completely new fresh look film his debut film storyline is different run mill fares which we are used seeing such long time farhan is welcomed entry list talented young directors he has also dared be different he has taken care minutest details film technically film is no way behind some best hollywood movies now performances all three leads are fabulous they all fit their roles t aamir khan as expected is best he is too good comic scenes is excellent emotional scenes also especially scene when he breaks down phone while talking his father he definitely is best among current lot who does his work with precision utmost dedication saif ali khan is wonderful surprise this film this is his career best role one cannot imagine anyone else playing sameers role his sense timing facial expressions are very natural makes sameer very adorable character film least significant role was sameer but saif made it very important now comes final winner akshaye khanna actor par excellence very natural front camera akshaye has played role sid perfection his emotions expressive face say lot he has given spell binding performance preity looks great her new look has acted well sonali kulkarni is wasted dimple kapadia still looks gorgeous plays her role well music picturisation songs flow with mood film locales sydney goa have been brilliantly shot first half film has some light good moments second half is filled with emotion though aamir preity affair has been stretched lot thus making film bit lengthy but one thing is sure bollywood has got one more talented director farhan akhtar,0.5405796621678973,0.3030135811900516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.22}"
7.0,A lovely episode of three lives,"Just pitifully, we have lots and lots Hindi speaking people in town and they have been here for a very long time, still the local Chinese don't really care to know their culture, let alone watch good Indian movies. Perhaps there are more viewers in Tibet, Yunnan of China.There are tons of ""come of age"" movies and this is a wonderful one, it's like a fresh air enters into a stuffy room when I was watching it. Unlike the Hollywood or Euro films, the difficulties that the three young men encounter are not presented in a realistic and sometimes brutal way but highly musical and artistic way. Besides the stunning length, this is another feature of Indian movies.The boys are from middle class families, obviously, or even higher society. They have time and money to go to Goa to spend their holiday, go to chic places to spend their past time, have nothing to worry. Just like any well-to-do Asian families, (I mean those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan....) the old man of the family would send their children to their own overseas company to receive ""wilderness training"" so that later they can take over the family business. Akash just cannot escape this and stays in Sydney.Once again, the songs, the dances, the plot and the script are all marvellously put together. Who is able to resist pretty and young faces, right? Who wants to see the real McCoy of the true India? Movie is always a dream.  Let's continue itBollywood is ushering itself into the world stage but it is still not a strong counterpart to Hollywood. There are many good Indian people people behind the scene of many big movies, directors, editors, script writers.... Yet, I am just wondering it would take how many years for the mainstream (like Hollywood) center to ""digest"" Indians after taking in Chinese like Jacky Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung. Through Hollywood, the Indians actors would be more widely known because it is a place to rocket people's name over one night.The 1994 Miss World Aishwarya Rai caused a frenzy in Cannes in 2002. I hope some male ""Khan"" would do so somewhere in Oscar or Cannes again because they do deserve it.",lovely episode three lives,just pitifully we have lots lots hindi speaking people town they have been here very long time still local chinese dont really care know their culture let alone watch good indian movies perhaps there are more viewers tibet yunnan china there are tons come age movies this is wonderful one its like fresh air enters into stuffy room when i was watching it unlike hollywood or euro films difficulties that three young men encounter are not presented realistic sometimes brutal way but highly musical artistic way besides stunning length this is another feature indian movies boys are middle class families obviously or even higher society they have time money go goa spend their holiday go chic places spend their past time have nothing worry just like any well do asian families i mean those singapore hong kong taiwan korea japan old man family would send their children their own overseas company receive wilderness training so that later they can take over family business akash just cannot escape this stays sydney once again songs dances plot script are all marvellously put together who is able resist pretty young faces right who wants see real mccoy true india movie is always dream lets continue itbollywood is ushering itself into world stage but it is still not strong counterpart hollywood there are many good indian people people behind scene many big movies directors editors script writers yet i am just wondering it would take how many years mainstream like hollywood center digest indians after taking chinese like jacky chan jet li chow yun fat tony leung through hollywood indians actors would be more widely known because it is place rocket peoples name over one night 1994 miss world aishwarya rai caused frenzy cannes 2002 i hope some male khan would do so somewhere oscar or cannes again because they do deserve it,0.44848560354374317,0.17480343300110743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
6.0,"One good story (that was not developed properly), one bad story and one no story","The Akshaye Khanna/Dimple Kapadia story was fresh, as far as I can see. I do not remember a hero falling in love with an older woman in Bollywood. (The Assamese movie, Brishti, handled this issue way back in 1974; but that was an 'Art' movie.) If properly developed, it could have been a nice 90 minute movie, based on this segment alone.However, it was ruined by the million-times recycled Amir Khan story, not to mention the non-story of Saif Ali Khan. There is absolutely nothing new about the Amir Khan segment; no, actually the Opera was new! That segment is absurd; in real life that does not happen.

6.0,Western-style modern Bollywood,"Siddharth ""Sid"" Sinha is nervously waiting at the hospital for his love with a sick liver. The movie returns back to the days when Sid was best friends with Akash Malhotra and Sameer Mulchandani. This is a story of the labyrinth of their love lives ending with them growing apart in the present day.The characters party. They fall in love. They live modern lives. I don't want to sound ignorant but this is a very Western modern Bollywood movie. I do notice the high IMDb rating but I wonder if this broke some cultural barrier back in India. I don't know anything about that but I'm going to try to review this like any other Western movie.There is some bro acting going on here. I would prefer the opening first act to be only about the three friends by themselves. They need to establish their friendship as the opener. Their chemistry is the most important aspect of the movie. It's more important than the romances. They need to show that they're the drive-to-the-airport friends and even bury-a-dead-body friends. They need to open by explaining their friendship. Sometimes, movies do this by showing their first meetings. I don't feel that connection has been established.This is a long three hour movie. There is the regular Bollywood song-and-dance. It's still long even without the songs. I like the guys. They seem like really nice fun guys. The movie kinda works by hanging out with them. It's no masterpiece by any means.",western style modern bollywood,siddharth sid sinha is nervously waiting at hospital his love with sick liver movie returns back days when sid was best friends with akash malhotra sameer mulchandani this is story labyrinth their love lives ending with them growing apart present day characters party they fall love they live modern lives i dont want sound ignorant but this is very western modern bollywood movie i do notice high imdb rating but i wonder if this broke some cultural barrier back india i dont know anything about that but im going try review this like any other western movie there is some bro acting going here i would prefer opening first act be only about three friends by themselves they need establish their friendship as opener their chemistry is most important aspect movie its more important than romances they need show that theyre drive airport friends even bury dead body friends they need open by explaining their friendship sometimes movies do this by showing their first meetings i dont feel that connection has been established this is long three hour movie there is regular bollywood song dance its still long even without songs i like guys they seem like really nice fun guys movie kinda works by hanging out with them its no masterpiece by any means,0.39458037060978235,0.17520817417876242,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.42}"
7.0,Childhood friends...,"""Dil Chahta Hai"" is a comedy - drama movie in which we watch three childhood friends who they just finished college and nothing can be between them. Although everything is going to change when they fall in love and become very different people because of the way they approach their relationships. These situations will make things difficult for all of them and they will change their friendship too.I liked this movie because it combines very well comedy with drama and from this combination we can see and observe the true meaning of love either is erotic or is between friends. I also liked this movie because it shows us how things change when people fall in love, how their personalities change and how this influence them. Once more Aamir Khan's interpretation played as Akash Malhotra was very good but equally food were the interpretations of Saif Ali Khan's who played as Sameer and Akshaye Khanna's who played as Siddharth Sinha.Finally I have to say that ""Dil Chahta Hai"" is a very good movie to watch and if you like movies that show the influence of love into relationships and what are the results of this then this is your movie. I also believe that this movie makes us understand many things about it and wants to shows us how we have to behave in difficult situations that maybe will come up in our lives.",childhood friends,dil chahta hai is comedy drama movie which we watch three childhood friends who they just finished college nothing can be between them although everything is going change when they fall love become very different people because way they approach their relationships these situations will make things difficult all them they will change their friendship too i liked this movie because it combines very well comedy with drama this combination we can see observe true meaning love either is erotic or is between friends i also liked this movie because it shows us how things change when people fall love how their personalities change how this influence them once more aamir khans interpretation played as akash malhotra was very good but equally food were interpretations saif ali khans who played as sameer akshaye khannas who played as siddharth sinha finally i have say that dil chahta hai is very good movie watch if you like movies that show influence love into relationships what are results this then this is your movie i also believe that this movie makes us understand many things about it wants shows us how we have behave difficult situations that maybe will come up our lives,0.6599999999999998,0.3405263157894737,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,you gotta see this movie!,"Dil Chahta Hai, one word: excellent. If you've never seen a Bollywood film before, this is the best place you could start.Akash (Aamir), Siddharth or Sid (Akshaye), and Sameer (Saif) are best friends. They are all different; Akash is very critical and a prankster, he believes that love doesn't last more than a couple of weeks. Sid is the most serious and mature of the three, he is a little shy and often disappears in his own world of painting. Sameer, is desperately romantic and ""falls in love"" a lot. Often this ends in heartbreak...Nevertheless, despite their differences, the trio have something in common: their love for each other. Soon, the three find their own lives dragging them forward, forced to leave the others behind, and they realize the value and seriousness of life. They discover many things along the way, like true love, and true friendship. When their lives collide again, their individual worlds are shaken up once more, leaving them with the support they really need: each other.Aamir gives a very fun-filled, suave performance, he is comical and the audience will always love him, its brilliant. Saif Ali Khan does an awesome job, it's comedy, but it's a very strong performance too. Akshaye Khanna, gets full credit for the best performance in this movie. Not only did he get the best role, but he played it to perfection, the fight scene with Akash, was brilliant. I give him my full applause. The pretty Preity Zinta, also gives a noteworthy performance. Her cute smile and charming personality light up the screen and makes the movie refreshing. Sonali Kulkarni gives a gritty performance. She is forgettable, but she does play the role well. Dimple Kapadia plays the depressed alcoholic mom easily. Ayub Khan, Rajat Kapoor, and Suhasini Mulay give small, but important roles.The music is amazing. Certainly the best part about the film. Farhan Akhtar has done a fantastic job.I'd say 8 out of 10 stars...WATCH IT!",you gotta see this movie,dil chahta hai one word excellent if youve never seen bollywood film before this is best place you could start akash aamir siddharth or sid akshaye sameer saif are best friends they are all different akash is very critical prankster he believes that love doesnt last more than couple weeks sid is most serious mature three he is little shy often disappears his own world painting sameer is desperately romantic falls love lot often this ends heartbreak nevertheless despite their differences trio have something common their love each other soon three find their own lives dragging them forward forced leave others behind they realize value seriousness life they discover many things along way like true love true friendship when their lives collide again their individual worlds are shaken up once more leaving them with support they really need each other aamir gives very fun filled suave performance he is comical audience will always love him its brilliant saif ali khan does awesome job its comedy but its very strong performance too akshaye khanna gets full credit best performance this movie not only did he get best role but he played it perfection fight scene with akash was brilliant i give him my full applause pretty preity zinta also gives noteworthy performance her cute smile charming personality light up screen makes movie refreshing sonali kulkarni gives gritty performance she is forgettable but she does play role well dimple kapadia plays depressed alcoholic mom easily ayub khan rajat kapoor suhasini mulay give small but important roles music is amazing certainly best part about film farhan akhtar has done fantastic job id say 8 out 10 stars watch it,0.6255172413793102,0.332169540229885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.34}"

8.0,"""May we never have to be without our friends...""","At present I've watched over a dozen Bollywood films, all recommended via the IMDb 'Top 250' lists over the past decade or so, and two things seem to stand out. Virtually all of them run an average of two and a half hours or more, and almost all of them feature Aamir Khan in a leading role. So I pretty much expected that with ""Dil Chatha Hai"", and on that score I wasn't surprised. Khan himself is part of a buddy trio that appears aimless during their young adulthood, living the good life with not much thought for the future. Each in their own way is confronted with the stirring pangs of love, and how they react to those feelings provides some resentment among the men, causing them to go their separate ways.The subject of arranged marriages is also broached, similar to the way it was handled in the film ""Swades"", with the modern day view of marrying for love taking precedence against a tradition of marrying to further business or extended family relationships. As typical with Hindi films, there are a fair number of musical interludes featuring song and dance led by the principal players, each in turn long enough to allow a wardrobe change as it plays out, which occurs quite vibrantly during the 'Love Brings Color Into Your Life' number. As a three part love story, the film manages to appeal to both men and women, and in a way, approaches it's goal of fulfilling the message of the movie's title, loosely translated as 'What the Heart Wants'.",may we never have be without our friends,at present ive watched over dozen bollywood films all recommended via imdb top 250 lists over past decade or so two things seem stand out virtually all them run average two half hours or more almost all them feature aamir khan leading role so i pretty much expected that with dil chatha hai that score i wasnt surprised khan himself is part buddy trio that appears aimless during their young adulthood living good life with not much thought future each their own way is confronted with stirring pangs love how they react those feelings provides some resentment among men causing them go their separate ways subject arranged marriages is also broached similar way it was handled film swades with modern day view marrying love taking precedence against tradition marrying further business or extended family relationships as typical with hindi films there are fair number musical interludes featuring song dance led by principal players each turn long enough allow wardrobe change as it plays out which occurs quite vibrantly during love brings color into your life number as three part love story film manages appeal both men women way approaches its goal fulfilling message movies title loosely translated as what heart wants,0.44591880341880347,0.1596581196581197,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"

One of the most pleasant surprises was my introduction to films from India. I don't believe they know how to make a bad film. This is another 10/10. I get so wrapped up in this movie. The lack of understanding the language is never felt. The actors do such a great job you may not understand the words but you feel the emotion and it seems like you are right there. I laughed out loud and cried like a small child. What a great story with great actors. Aamir Khan is one of my new favorite actors. The man has skills and talent that many others can't even come close to touching. The music fits. We make fun of it over here in America but once I opened up my eyes and saw how well it helps to tell the story. Man we Americans can be so judgmental. I believe it is because no American studio can pull it off so they make fun of it out of jealousy. Aamir Khan provides another unbelievable performance.

10.0,Thought-Provoking and Artistic.,"This was the second Bollywood film I saw, and it remains at the top. It is a very basic storyline, but with amazing depth. It is the story of three friends, just graduated from college. Akash does not believe in love, and seems to facy himself a player. Throughout the film, you can almost see through him... he is afraid of being hurt. Sameer wants nothing more than to love and be loved. However, he is just as foolish as Akash, as he throws himself at all the wrong girls. Siddharth is the shy one, who seems to comprehend the complexity of love. When he falls for an older woman, he brings a new aspect to the story: love is selfless and asks nothing in return. Throughout this movie, you see these three stories develop, causing the audience to wonder, 'What is love?' It has been hailed as a hip movie with modern clothes and hairstyles. While this is true, it is also a highly artistic movie that never misses a beat or an opportunity for depth. An actor once said that an actor should be a person who holds a mirror, so the audience can see themselves. I hardly think it possible to watch this movie without seeing a little bit of Akash's cynicism, Sameer's naivete, and Siddharth's willingness to fight for love in ourselves. This is a must-see not only for Bollywood fans, but for hopeless romantics and cynics alike. This one will make you think.",thought provoking artistic,this was second bollywood film i saw it remains at top it is very basic storyline but with amazing depth it is story three friends just graduated college akash does not believe love seems facy himself player throughout film you can almost see through him he is afraid being hurt sameer wants nothing more than love be loved however he is just as foolish as akash as he throws himself at all wrong girls siddharth is shy one who seems comprehend complexity love when he falls older woman he brings new aspect story love is selfless asks nothing return throughout this movie you see these three stories develop causing audience wonder what is love it has been hailed as hip movie with modern clothes hairstyles while this is true it is also highly artistic movie that never misses beat or opportunity depth actor once said that actor should be person who holds mirror so audience can see themselves i hardly think it possible watch this movie without seeing little bit akashs cynicism sameers naivete siddharths willingness fight love ourselves this is must see not only bollywood fans but hopeless romantics cynics alike this one will make you think,0.6016171328671329,0.19002039627039624,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,a roller-coaster of a movie excellence,"Ain't any run of the mill movie that keep on coming out every other Fridays.. Its a milestone, an epic of a movie which keeps you entertained even after more than 10 years of its first getting released... A cult classic, the concept & execution of which was unheard of in our film history.. Writing anything about it can never explain the greatness & artistic work, one got to see it.. I still laugh,cry & marvel at the cinematic excellence put by the débutante director .. Pepped up with one of the greatest compositions by the trio of Shankar ehsaan & loy ,so beautifully penned down by javed saab... A story about three best friends & their respective takes on life.. It winds up through their fun college days & takes us through the turmoils one faces as far as that great feeling called love is encountered.. Mind you it ain't just another romantic flick but thanks to the crisp editing & direction ,every emotion in the book is dolled out in equal proportions..though one may feel that best portrayed was one between the lead pairs... Its the camaraderie & the emotional quotient that the trio have in between them ,sharing everything & inspite of differences coming between them, coming together & reconciling.. The goa part is very aesthetically captured .. Getting some not so known actors together & giving them the roles of their lives is an uphill task & the director has so very rightfully succeeded in doing just that.. Roles that changed life for many.. All three have been able to carve out a niche for themselves , Akshay in his serious thinking man character gives a very good praiseworthy & restrained act.. Saif as a happy carefree ,a not so smart guy gives a decent performance but the star of the show is undoubtedly amir Khan who even amongst so many characters has given a spellbinding performance.. Had it not been his other outing as the patriotic hero the same year, he would have got the best actor for his meaty role... He has lived his character virtually , what with his histrionics, antics, goofups, confidence , friendship & his chemistry with the lead actress, one tends to love him.. Watch him utter his lines or proposing his girl in someone else marriage, he indeed is the captain of the ship, a link by which all are connected... Not to forget the perfect casting & works of other actors.. Preity in her subdued role torn between her allegiance to her proxy parents & her love of life gives a controlled performance & looks so adoring in those curly hair.. Even the music lost out that year , but that does not mean it ain't good.. It was & still looks n feels fresh & ruled the charts .. Especial mention should be made of extremely heart rendering composition with soulful wordings by Javed saab & sung by none other but the versatile Sonu who gives the song such melancholic feel & effectively captures the mood of the movie... Sir, I really feel privileged & grateful to you for giving us such a fine piece of work.. What I wish is more of such movies from your hands... ..",roller coaster movie excellence,aint any run mill movie that keep coming out every other fridays its milestone epic movie which keeps you entertained even after more than 10 years its first getting released cult classic concept execution which was unheard our film history writing anything about it can never explain greatness artistic work one got see it i still laugh cry marvel at cinematic excellence put by d butante director pepped up with one greatest compositions by trio shankar ehsaan loy so beautifully penned down by javed saab story about three best friends their respective takes life it winds up through their fun college days takes us through turmoils one faces as far as that great feeling called love is encountered mind you it aint just another romantic flick but thanks crisp editing direction every emotion book is dolled out equal proportions though one may feel that best portrayed was one between lead pairs its camaraderie emotional quotient that trio have between them sharing everything inspite differences coming between them coming together reconciling goa part is very aesthetically captured getting some not so known actors together giving them roles their lives is uphill task director has so very rightfully succeeded doing just that roles that changed life many all three have been able carve out niche themselves akshay his serious thinking man character gives very good praiseworthy restrained act saif as happy carefree not so smart guy gives decent performance but star show is undoubtedly amir khan who even amongst so many characters has given spellbinding performance had it not been his other outing as patriotic hero same year he would have got best actor his meaty role he has lived his character virtually what with his histrionics antics goofups confidence friendship his chemistry with lead actress one tends love him watch him utter his lines or proposing his girl someone else marriage he indeed is captain ship link by which all are connected not forget perfect casting works other actors preity her subdued role torn between her allegiance her proxy parents her love life gives controlled performance looks so adoring those curly hair even music lost out that year but that does not mean it aint good it was still looks n feels fresh ruled charts especial mention should be made extremely heart rendering composition with soulful wordings by javed saab sung by none other but versatile sonu who gives song such melancholic feel effectively captures mood movie sir i really feel privileged grateful you giving us such fine piece work what i wish is more such movies your hands,0.5286897413286302,0.3074070399764844,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"

1.0,Awfully Pretentious,"This is my first review on IMDb, and I am doing this just because this pathetic movie does not at all deserve the status it has been accorded. I was almost sure this movie would be fawned over by so-called Indian cinema fans, so I wanted to do my bit to pull this movie from its exalted state. 8.6? That's utterly ridiculous.I was amazed and bowled over by ""Lagaan"", and was expecting more fireworks on such lines from Aamir Khan. And then I got this. I can go and on, but I will just say this - this is a movie for snobs, for the newly rich and the ""affluenza"" class, because only they can relate to the movie's atrocious premise and contrived situations. Not ordinary middle-class people like me,Loud, Annoying, Pretentious. Ultimately Crap.They should make an app that lets you throw rotten tomatoes to express your revulsion. And I will be more than happy to lob more than one at that wannabe director Farhan Akhtar's mug.",awfully pretentious,this is my first review imdb i am doing this just because this pathetic movie does not at all deserve status it has been accorded i was almost sure this movie would be fawned over by so called indian cinema fans so i wanted do my bit pull this movie its exalted state 8 6 thats utterly ridiculous i was amazed bowled over by lagaan was expecting more fireworks such lines aamir khan then i got this i can go but i will just say this this is movie snobs newly rich affluenza class because only they can relate movies atrocious premise contrived situations not ordinary middle class people like me loud annoying pretentious ultimately crap they should make app that lets you throw rotten tomatoes express your revulsion i will be more than happy lob more than one at that wannabe director farhan akhtars mug,0.7061111111111111,-0.05416666666666664,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,great movie,"Dil Chahta Hai was an amazing movie for me when I first saw it...and it's still one of my favorites. It deals with the youth in India, the transitions they go through, their love lives and most of all, friendship. Farhan Akhtar is brilliant, and this will always be one of his master pieces, no matter how many movies he makes in the future. The movie starts with the present, with Dimple Kapadia being admitted in the hospital, and then a flashback sets in. Farhan Akhtar has created the characters of the three main protagonists with a lot attention to detail and thus, has created characters that the youth in India can relate to. The protagonists are not extra-ordinary heroes, nor are they spoilt brats. They are just normal young Indians with new ideas raised in affluent families. They have the right blend of traditions and modernity. The movie consists of a strong plot, good characters who are believable and yet, interesting. The songs of the movie are excellent too. The picturizations and script is great. Overall, a well done movie with good acting from all the main actors - Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni and the ever beautiful Dimple Kapadia. A must watch for anyone.",great movie,dil chahta hai was amazing movie me when i first saw it its still one my favorites it deals with youth india transitions they go through their love lives most all friendship farhan akhtar is brilliant this will always be one his master pieces no matter how many movies he makes future movie starts with present with dimple kapadia being admitted hospital then flashback sets farhan akhtar has created characters three main protagonists with lot attention detail thus has created characters that youth india can relate protagonists are not extra ordinary heroes nor are they spoilt brats they are just normal young indians with new ideas raised affluent families they have right blend traditions modernity movie consists strong plot good characters who are believable yet interesting songs movie are excellent too picturizations script is great overall well done movie with good acting all main actors aamir khan saif ali khan akshaye khanna preity zinta sonali kulkarni ever beautiful dimple kapadia must watch anyone,0.5231640383426097,0.390669449598021,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.29}"
