10,Scarlett's So High Spirited And Vivacious,"Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.Million Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently.If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection.I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her, but because of that he's on to all her ploys.Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though, he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie.It's a deceptive part, superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her's.And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.Hattie's a shrewd judge of character, she's a slave, but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says, she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.And I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now.",scarletts so high spirited vivacious,before i ever saw gone with wind i was well

10,Georgia on my mind,"This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.""Gone with the Wind"" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.",georgia my mind,this film shows best american cinema whether we like film or not one has recognize greatest achievement perhaps creative talent people working movie industry gone with wind represents monumental leap as well as departure movies as they were done prior this film vision david o selznick power behind bringing margaret mitchells massive account about south before after civil war pays handsomely with film that victor fleming directed this movie will live forever because it reminds us how this great nation came into being despite different opinions two stubborn factions war gone with wind brought together best people hollywood end result is stunning film that about four hours keep us interested story unfolding screen course credit must be due director victor fleming his vision as well as adaptation by sydney howard who gave right tone film gorgeous cinematography created by ernest haller gives us vision gentle south before war phoenix raising ashes burned atlanta music max steiner puts right touch behind all that is seen movie one cant conceive another scarlett ohara played by no one but vivien leigh her beauty her sense timing her intelligent approach this role makes this hallmark performance ms leigh was at best moment her distinguished career it shows scarlett goes riches rags back riches again process finds inner strength she didnt know she possessed her impossible love ashley will consume her will keep her away returning love man that really loves her rhett same thing applies rhett butler clark gable no one else comes mind playing him with passion he projects throughout movie this is mans man captain butler was torn between his loyalty cause south his sense decency his love scarlett woman he knows is love with dream speaks eloquently itself other two principals olivia de havilland leslie howard give performances that are amazing watch ms de havillands melanie hamilton is perfect melanie is loyal woman that does everything undermine her marriage ashley mr howards ashley gives perfect balance man love with his wife while scarlett keeps tempting him rest cast is too numerous make justice all actors one sees screen but omitting contribution hattie mcdaniel film would be sinful ms mcdaniel was such natural actress that she is excellent no matter what movie she is playing this huge talent is joy watch comments this forum express their objections way race relations play movie but being realistic this movie speaks about not too distant past where all kinds atrocities such as slavery were norm land while those things are repugnant acknowledge film they are kept at minimum after all this film is based book by one daughters that south margaret mitchell who is presenting story as she saw it her mind no doubt told her relatives that lived that period horrible page american history enjoy this monumental classic all its splendor,0.5665966386554622,0.28544690603514133,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,About as good as it gets in 1930s Hollywood,"I've done so many reviews on IMDb and despite this, I can't believe I never reviewed this super-famous film. Well, much if this is because with so many reviews, I truly doubt if anyone will ever read this! I was surprised that when I perused the reviews, there were quite a few knuckleheads that gave the film a score of one!! While I do agree that the film is rather dated in the way it deals with minorities, it is truly insane to trash a film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities. One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky! Despite this, this is a magnificent sweeping spectacle about the South--but even more about a selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos of her decent life. Magnificent, well-acted and memorable--this is one of the greatest films of all time.",about as good as it gets 1930s hollywood,ive done so many reviews imdb despite this i cant believe i never reviewed this super famous film well much if this is because with so many reviews i truly doubt if anyone will ever read this i was surprised that when i perused reviews there were quite few knuckleheads that gave film score one while i do agree that film is rather dated way it deals with minorities it is truly insane trash film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities one person even compared film plan 9 come folks this is amazing film what makes it even more amazing is that film had several different directors because producer selznick was so difficult work with this film despite this film wins among many other awards best director oscar while i do think that many oscars should have been earned giving it just one man seemed pretty cheeky despite this this is magnificent sweeping spectacle about south but even more about selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos her decent life magnificent well acted memorable this is one greatest films all time,0.6747222222222222,0.31194444444444447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,The tragedy of Scarlet the wise 2020 review,"At first you would think, the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background... Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... She has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy, while missing the point on the way to that target... Something that I realised on a 2nd viewing is that Scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. She can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. She can kill a person and not feel that bad about it,she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. The goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things, but these deeds are never done out of big heart, they are usually done in self interest. You would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted, but she does not. Scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love, the female friend that loves her is gone, she realises that all this time, she lived the illusion of love, she was hurting the people that loved her. Is scarlet a horrible person? Probably... Does she pay for her sins? She does more than anyone... Does she understand what true love is? Yes in the end she does... What makes this film so great, it's a tragedy like ""War And Peace"" with monumental character development ...Any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of Scarlet which lives in personal hell...",tragedy scarlet wise 2020 review,at first you would think main theme film is horrors war idea that both sides suffer but that is not only case gone with wind war is just background scarlet lives almost her entire life illusion love she has target she want achieve she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy while missing point way that target something that i realised 2nd viewing is that scarlet is pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour she can easily manipulate men sometimes women order achieve her goal she can kill person not feel that bad about it she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men goal is what pushes her forward sometimes makes her do good things but these deeds are never done out big heart they are usually done self interest you would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted but she does not scarlet lives personal hell which partially she created herself only when last obstacle her big love female friend that loves her is gone she realises that all this time she lived illusion love she was hurting people that loved her is scarlet horrible person probably does she pay her sins she does more than anyone does she understand what true love is yes end she does what makes this film so great its tragedy like war peace with monumental character development any scenes war racism fade compared tragedy scarlet which lives personal hell,0.55703125,0.165625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema","Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, ""You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,"" also happens to be one of all time favorite. The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential.

10,A universal masterpiece and one of the few privileged films where every scene is a classic on its own ...,"For some nostalgic dreamers, ""Gone With the Wind"" is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War, and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order, a Civilization forever ""gone with the wind"". It's the adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the 'bad guys', so common in the stories related by Southerners, as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it: a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted, wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalism.But for some idealistic spirits, ""Gone With the Wind"" resonates as one of the most heart-breaking pages of American History, when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty, Freedom and Justice, and when History, written by the victorious side, ultimately showed the Confederate as the 'ones who were wrong'. ""Gone With the Wind"" chronicles what the South used to be, a world where coexisted two cultures, the Whites and the Colored. And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simple-minded Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) who knew nothing about ""birthin' babies"" and the wisdom and authority of Mammy, Hattie McDaniel in her Oscar-winning role: two figures, two extremes, so rooted in our hearts it's impossible to dislike them, despite the obvious stereotypes.For literate minds, History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling, inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life, where the passing of time can be felt, when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness... sometimes tragic, sometimes ironic. It's a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), married to the gentle and extremely good-hearted cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable anti-heroine: selfish, greedy, jealous, but so brave, courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South. A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity, a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic ""As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again"".The fascinating aspect of Scarlett's personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters: she doesn't care for etiquette, for traditions, her spirit is free, her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable. While the South is definitely turned to the past, Scarlett thinks of the future, as she says: ""after all, tomorrow is another day"". Scarlett is a modern figure and that's what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience. And Rhett Butler, Clark Gable in his most defining role as 'the visitor from Charleston', is Scarlet's perfect match. Both don't belong to that era, they think of money, greed, prosperity, and passion. They embody all the values that America would stand for, transcending the old-fashioned setting of the South. But like the South's enthusiasm for War, the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationships.For many passionate hearts, this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen, a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strong-minded egos, two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other. As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley, the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die. A childish and immature attitude, probably shared with Butler who wouldn't have minded if Ashley could die in the War, too. The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth, a lost but so endearing cause, a fire that burnt inside, and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky, during Atlanta's big fire. Love has never been as passionate as a love-and-hate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause, mirroring the Southerners' very faith in victory. Rhett's last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the 'one night she wouldn't turn him out' is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger. As Scarlett, lost in her love for Ashley, will never realize that her man is Rhett... and when she does, Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable come-uppance ever: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" before disappearing in a foggy mist. Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life, and wouldn't have been as likable without this last slap in the face. This ""I don't give a damn"" voted #1 in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Movie quotes was Rhett's revenge, and he sure deserved it... and many wannabe-Scarlett would admit that too.But while ""Gone With the Wind"" deals with lost causes, it's more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century. Echoing the novel's status as a best- seller, it's one of the greatest films of all time, the greatest casting ever, the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives. Victor Fleming's super-production that would become a landmark in film-making, with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors, forever incarnated by Scarlett's shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree, during a beautiful sunset. Along with ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Gone With the Wind"" is probably Hollywood's Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in 1939 .",universal

While the leading man and the supporting cast are outstanding, you walk away from this with only one person holding and controlling your thoughts, just like the character she plays, just as she does through the whole of the picture - the incredible and sublimely talented, the beautiful and vivacious, the tempestuous hurricane of a tornado that is Vivien Leigh.

10,"A sweeping epic film, that in my eyes is outstanding!","Gone With the Wind is a truly remarkable epic film. True, it is four hours long, but there are several redeeming qualities that make it an unforgettable movie experience. The cinematography is gorgeous, with a wonderful contrast of beauty (love) and ugliness (war), though the war scenes could have been a tad more developed, if that is a minor offering of a criticism. The costumes are lovely, especially Scarlett O'Hara's dresses, and the music score is phenomenal, with a sweeping unforgettable title theme, that possibly everyone in the world knows. The performances were astonishing. The beautiful Vivien Leigh gives a tour de force performance as Scarlett, a performance of vulnerability, sadness and beauty. Who can't forget her passionate outbursts ""Great Balls of Fire""? Butterfly McQueen is hilarious as Prissy, with lines such as ""I don't know nothing about birthing babies"". But topping them all, in a natural if somewhat unlikeable performance as Rhett Butler, is the wonderful underrated Clark Gable, with his iconic remarks (""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""), hearty laugh and sneer.

9,All-time classic,"I was put off watching this for a long time, mainly because I mistakenly believed it to be an old-fashioned romance. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, it's a story of how two maladjusted characters come together and the volatile relationship that progresses.That's the central thrust of the tale, but there's a whole lot more to GONE WITH THE WIND than that. It's an epic reconstruction of a by-gone era, a pre-Civil War American South in which man and slave lived side by side. It's a war story featuring some hugely impressive pyrotechnic effects which must have blown cinema-goers away on first release. And it's an exploration of the darkest reaches of the human condition.The actors are fantastic. Vivian Leigh really makes something of what must have been a difficult role to play. It's especially noticeable with Olivia de Havilland starring in the traditional role of the beautiful, warm-hearted heroine, and then seeing Leigh's haunted, bitter and vengeful character appearing opposite her in contrast. I especially liked Clark Gable, who exudes charisma from every pore.The production values are immaculate, the supporting cast don't put a foot wrong, and the ultra-lengthy running time flies past thanks to the viewer's involvement in the events that unfold.

9,Love in troubled times,"Sometimes love needs to be held on and beaten, but once love has bound the wings of the lover, please let it go as soon as possible. Scarlett, do you think it's worth hurting someone who loves you for someone who has hurt you before? Vanity is a part of all human beings, but it's important to get out of it and not wait for what you really need to lose before you can appreciate it. So always ask yourself: are you doing what you really need right now? You are successful, but do you consider yourself happy? Rhett, I think you've done all you have to do. Including the dedication to the cause, the ""implicit"" loyalty to the south, the unswerving pursuit of lovers, the meticulous love of the daughter. Though you knew that the south had lost the battle before it was fought, and though you and most southerners could not appear to share in it, you fought for the south everywhere during the war. You fought with millions of southerners, and when the battle was won, you left your loved ones behind and joined the confederate army. For the love, for the daughter, changed a man, a father can change everything. You're a shrewd businessman, but you can't calculate your feelings. I think this you know, feelings sometimes need to be confused, so you rarely care about scarlett, everything for the sake of the girl. And once the daughter died, all the sustenance and hope also die. At this time you have nearly collapsed, is mei lanli, the woman you admire most, let you walk out of the bedroom again, to life. But when you know that the woman who gave everything for it has never loved you, but still loves ASHLEY, and married herself only for the poor three hundred dollars. You may be unbearable, so choose to leave, leave that only sad and tragic place, leave that will only make their own shame and pain scarlett. However, leaving will only let you get a temporary adjustment and comfort, not for a long time joy and happiness, because after all you still like, love scarlett, leaving her will only be painful, not happy. It is better to get back together and create happiness for both of us than to cause pain for both of us if one of us leaves. Scarlett has completely come to her senses, so give her another chance, and also give yourself another chance to be happy, and go back to tara and scarlett again! After all, tomorrow is another day. Mei lanli, ""exhaling such as LAN, xinfang such as hui"" so describe you again appropriate however. You have the noblest character in the human race -- kindness, the most appealing quality in a man -- tenderness. You are wise and virtuous, know how to write, gentle and kind... You possess almost all the good qualities of man, so that my clumsy pen cannot describe them. But ASHLEY doesn't really love you. But... ASHLEY, you may be a gentleman, your noble temperament attracted many obsessed with fantasy girls, including scarlett, I do not know what thing is your body captured scarlett's soul. Let's not say your marriage and mei lanli is happy, you and the feelings between mei lanli is not love. Perhaps you have only one kind of dependence and sustenance on mei LAN li. But as a man should never take life on others like you, especially on a woman (no matter how good she is), can't say you have no definite view, but you are weak, you are too too complacent, so that lose the power to change the status quo, the satisfaction of the abnormal gradually eroding your desire to do better. If you want to achieve anything, you must be independent, especially in spirit. If you want to make progress, you must have an endless stream of new goals, and work hard for them. You must be strong. Tragedy happens because of human nature. ""Gone with the wind"" is the youth of scarlett's generation, the kind of picnic and dance life; It is the ""ideal"" of the southern plantation-style aristocracy, and the arrogant, blind and ignorant southerners.

10,A great American classic,"'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great.

I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more. We were not disappointed either. When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more.

8,The brilliant Vivien Leigh made me so angry!!,"Just yesterday, I watched the entire GWTW for the first time (excellent quality DVD)and even though in comfort of my own home, I found this film way too long. I would not, could not, sit for almost four hours in a cinema to watch any movie. As a great number of reviewers have pointed out here, this is a movie of two parts, the second bordered on soap opera and partly for that reason, I am unable to give a 10 star, gushing endorsement to GWTW.The characterisation also bothered me. Of the four principal parts, Leslie Howard's (Ashley Wilkes)was the least credible performance.Here we have someone ready and eager to go off to war but someone unable or unwilling to express his genuine love for his wife Melanie when taunted by the scheming, jealous Scarlett O'Hara. And it seems so odd that Selznick would cast an Englishman as a southern gentleman, particularly when Howard's 'Englishness' was so apparent for his entire performance?! Surely there were better-looking US actors (who sounded like southerners) to play the part of a so-called dashing lead character!Despite the fact that it was apparent that everybody regarded Melanie(Olivia De Havilland) as a saintly figure who never spoke ill of anybody, it was almost beyond credibility that she appeared so blithely unaware of Scarlett's manipulative, brattish intentions and behaviour. And on learning of the possible romantic link between Ashley and Scarlett, Melanie reacts in an even more incredible fashion.It was the portrayal, the brilliant portrayal by Vivien Leigh of the story's heroine, that unnerved me more than anything else. Despite the many reasonable defences of Scarlett's character and behaviour - she shows stoicism in hardship, displays admirable strength in returning the fortunes of Tara etc etc - I found Scarlett O'Hara such a most unlikeable, indeed, almost detestable character, that I longed for the scene in which she would get her comeuppance! She was selfish (selfless when material gain beckoned), simpering, headstrong, jealous, vindictive, childish, scheming, stubborn, cruel and seemingly incapable of genuine affection for anybody save her father - most noticeably not for any of her three husbands nor for the presumed object of her unrequited love, Ashley Wilkes. She even steals her younger sister's fiancé Frank Kennedy whom she marries for financial gain. Scarlett also shows no qualms in engaging in dubious business practices and exploiting convict labour in her lumber business.How typical that shortly after marriage, Rhett insists he'll spend as much as necessary on a new mansion in Atlanta and Scarlett responds with: ""Oh Rhett, I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.""On three occasions, Scarlett uses physical force to show her anger and pride when she slaps somebody across the face - if only Ashley or Rhett or even Mammy had the gumption to give this hoyden a similar whack!From my perspective, never has there been a more apt closing line in a movie because regarding the fate of Scarlett O'Hara, I couldn't give a damn.",brilliant vivien leigh made me so angry,just yesterday i watched entire gwtw first time excellent quality dvd even though comfort my own home i found this film way too long i would not could not sit almost four hours cinema watch any movie as great number reviewers have pointed out here this is movie two parts second bordered soap opera partly that reason i am unable give 10 star gushing endorsement gwtw characterisation also bothered me four principal parts leslie howards ashley wilkes was least credible performance here we have someone ready eager go off war but someone unable or unwilling express his genuine love his wife melanie when taunted by scheming jealous scarlett ohara it seems so odd that selznick would cast englishman as southern gentleman particularly when howards englishness was so apparent his entire performance surely there were better looking us actors who sounded like southerners play part so called dashing lead character despite fact that it was apparent that everybody regarded melanie olivia de havilland as saintly figure who never spoke ill anybody it was almost beyond credibility that she appeared so blithely unaware scarletts manipulative brattish intentions behaviour learning possible romantic link between ashley scarlett melanie reacts even more incredible fashion it was portrayal brilliant portrayal by vivien leigh storys heroine that unnerved me more than anything else despite many reasonable defences scarletts character behaviour she shows stoicism hardship displays admirable strength returning fortunes tara etc etc i found scarlett ohara such most unlikeable indeed almost detestable character that i longed scene which she would get her comeuppance she was selfish selfless when material gain beckoned simpering headstrong jealous vindictive childish scheming stubborn cruel seemingly incapable genuine affection anybody save her father most noticeably not any her three husbands nor presumed object her unrequited love ashley wilkes she even steals her younger sisters fianc frank kennedy whom she marries financial gain scarlett also shows no qualms engaging dubious business practices exploiting convict labour her lumber business how typical that shortly after marriage rhett insists hell spend as much as necessary new mansion atlanta scarlett responds with oh rhett i want everybody whos been mean me be pea green with envy three occasions scarlett uses physical force show her anger pride when she slaps somebody across face if only ashley or rhett or even mammy had gumption give this hoyden similar whack my perspective never has there been more apt closing line movie because regarding fate scarlett ohara i couldnt give damn,0.5735168097010203,0.1360911749069644,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,There's never going to be a movie like this,"It was way back on New Year's day of 2014 when I got myself a copy of this movie and watched it for the first time, in total awe; that one hadn't got an overture, intermission and exit music and ran at about 3,5 hours but I didn't feel the time at all. What's 4 hours of time when the story is timeless?What can I tell you about the movie that you don't already know? That it is the highest grossing movie of all times? That it got eight Oscars including the first ever given to an African-American, Hattie McDaniel (whose Mammy was an adorable character and I'm totally in love with her performance)? Or that I love this movie to the moon and back? Yes, that's what I'm going to say.This 1939's masterpiece is a perfection of a movie and frankly my dears I don't give a damn about what you have to say about it. Excellent performances (especially by Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel) and lovable characters, impressive war and hospital scenes, plot and storylines that leave you fidgeting on the edge of the seat until the end, beautiful music, astounding cinematography, colorful set pieces, splendid direction by Victor Fleming and the list goes on and on. It's easier to say bad things about the movie because there are none.Sometimes we all feel like Scarlett: that we are living a lie, believing the things that are untrue, making other people miserable and thinking there's no one out there who truly loves us the way we are but missing it all because of the blindfold on our eyes. But once we take it off everything changes. You change. I change.

9,Winds of war,"The fact that as at my time of writing, ""Gone With The Wind"" stands only at number 152 in the best movie rankings of this site, I hope might be mainly attributable to the relative youth of the posters here. Here surely is Golden Age Hollywood's lasting monument to itself, which like another big-subject civil war movie from a previous generation (D W Griffiths' ""Birth Of A Nation"") while politically flawed in its treatment of black people, nevertheless stands as a significant and magnificent piece of movie-making.It's a film I'd dearly love to see on the big screen but all my viewings of it so far have been on TV which can't begin to do justice to the scale and colour of the achievement here. I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade. But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance. It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the ""d"" word spoken so casually if only sparingly.However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that...",winds war,fact that as at my time writing gone with wind stands only at number 152 best movie rankings this site i hope might be mainly attributable relative youth posters here here surely is golden age hollywoods lasting monument itself which like another big subject civil war movie previous generation d w griffiths birth nation while politically flawed its treatment black people nevertheless stands as significant magnificent piece movie making its film id dearly love see big screen but all my viewings it so far have been tv which cant begin do justice scale colour achievement here i know theres some contention about who directed which parts it but im going give my kudos victor fleming who i believe did lions share work behind camera sets are magnificent set pieces even more so with several jaw dropping scenes which are testament artistic imagination technical achievement equal measure course two most celebrated these i suppose are rhett butlers rescue melanie scarlett missy just ahead burning edifices atlanta rising dolly shot wounded dead confederate army as scarlett seeks out dr meade but lets not forget acting too especially two leads who are both terrific gable his greatest role is mean moody magnificent while vivien leigh her hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as wild wilful wonderful scarlett ohara while characters ashley melanie wilkes seem almost too good be true ashleys guilty feelings scarlett aside they are nonetheless beautifully played by leslie howard olivia de havilland hattie mcdaniel belies racial stereotyping her mammy character deliver unforgettable often scene stealing performance it is difficult today witness some political incorrectness treatment given black characters main shown as subservient excitable slow witted not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds film big sam saves scarlett being raped while mammy effectively acts as conscience film it is dreadful modern ears hear d word spoken so casually if only sparingly however im not going criticise movie that when theres so much good praise it could be argued too that its better up end war goes bit soap opera ish thereafter death count starts over dramatically mount up towards end but such is power film making that it sweeps viewer right along both central characters famous last words by time max steiners famous theme plays over final scene defiant scarlett framed has any film ever bettered use silhouette than this one against burnt ochre sky you realise you have watched something very special movie making has unquestionably got bigger down years especially c gen sfx fests recent times but i dont think any film will ever look or play better than this one its been many times said written that 1939 was probably year that more great movies came out hollywood than any other but this one outdoes them all most other films since come that,0.5830550044091711,0.2105131172839506,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10,"If you ever (thought you) wanted something you couldn't have, you need to watch this film","Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally ""got"" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line.

10,"Amazing Film every generation needs to see it, Can't be remade","""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy and free the slaves as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. But we've known that for years; the tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 60th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well. For the story it wanted to tell, it was the right film at the right time. Scarlett O'Hara is not a creature of the 1860s but of the 1930s: a free-spirited, willful modern woman. The way was prepared for her by the flappers of Fitzgerald's jazz age, by the bold movie actresses of the period, and by the economic reality of the Depression, which for the first time put lots of women to work outside their homes. And there is a joyous flamboyance in the visual style that is appealing in these days when so many directors have trained on the blandness of television. Consider an early shot where Scarlett and her father look out over the land, and the camera pulls back, the two figures and a tree held in black silhouette with the landscape behind them. Or the way the flames of Atlanta are framed to backdrop Scarlett's flight in the carriage. Some of the individual shots in ""GWTW"" still have the power to leave us breathless, including the burning of Atlanta, the flight to Tara and the ""street of dying men"" shot, as Scarlett wanders into the street and the camera pulls back until the whole Confederacy seems to lie broken and bleeding as far as the eye can see.",amazing film every generation needs see it cant be remade,gone with wind presents sentimental view civil war which old south takes place camelot war was fought not so much defeat confederacy free slaves as give miss scarlett ohara her comeuppance but weve known that years tainted nostalgia comes with territory yet as gwtw approaches its 60th anniversary it is still towering landmark film quite simply because it tells good story tells it wonderfully well story it wanted tell it was right film at right time scarlett ohara is not creature 1860s but 1930s free spirited willful modern woman way was prepared her by flappers fitzgeralds jazz age by bold movie actresses period by economic reality depression which first time put lots women work outside their homes there is joyous flamboyance visual style that is appealing these days when so many directors have trained blandness television consider early shot where scarlett her father look out over land camera pulls back two figures tree held black silhouette with landscape behind them or way flames atlanta are framed backdrop scarletts flight carriage some individual shots gwtw still have power leave us breathless including burning atlanta flight tara street dying men shot as scarlett wanders into street camera pulls back until whole confederacy seems lie broken bleeding as far as eye can see,0.4866174055829229,0.1944170771756978,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10,Astounding Film - GWTW is the Definition of a Classic!,"The setting is a Georgia plantation. The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.Suddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative, and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley (in his forties, rather old to be playing a man half that age), every role was perfectly assigned. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as ""Mammy"" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor). GWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this film is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.The cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time. The pragmatic may think Gone with the Wind overly dramatic; the restless may find it too long; the action-stimulated, too subtle. None of this, however, detracts from the fact that GWTW retains a lasting appeal as one of the crowning cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Those who see its ending as depressing - tragic, even - perhaps miss the point - which Scarlett O'Hara makes in her very last instant with us, tear-stained eyes uplifted in a sudden, curious burst of hope beneath all the turmoil; that .. .
