8.0,"Lovely, simple and full of life","Imtiaz Ali's Jab We Met is one of the most refreshing love stories made in recent times. It is a very simple, interesting and charming film about a heart-broken and serious guy who meets an extremely vivacious and talkative girl who gradually manages to change his perception of life and love. And then, the story turns over in a rather interesting way. The film works better in the first half, as it is more alluring and funny. It later turns into a mini-drama but still in a natural way with a lot of comedy and fun. The music is great and each song contributes to the film's mood in its own way. The film stars Shahid Kapoor in a greatly restrained and impressive act as Aditya, but it is Kareena Kapoor's film all the way. Her comic timing is top-notch, and she is charming, convincing and full of life as the unforgettable Geet. Later on she also provides some superbly acted dramatic scenes, which she plays with unusual restraint and depth. Jab We Met is a very memorable picture, extremely entertaining and uplifting, and definitely a must-see for those who enjoy pleasant, comic and romantic flicks.",lovely simple full life,imtiaz alis jab we met is one most refreshing love stories made recent times it is very simple interesting charming film about heart broken serious guy who meets extremely vivacious talkative girl who gradually manages change his perception life love then story turns over rather interesting way film works better first half as it is more alluring funny it later turns into mini drama but still natural way with lot comedy fun music is great each song contributes films mood its own way film stars shahid kapoor greatly restrained impressive act as aditya but it is kareena kapoors film all way her comic timing is top notch she is charming convincing full life as unforgettable geet later she also provides some superbly acted dramatic scenes which she plays with unusual restraint depth jab we met is very memorable picture extremely entertaining uplifting definitely must see those who enjoy pleasant comic romantic flicks,0.6262445887445888,0.34147727272727263,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.4, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,My faith has been restored !,"I love everything about Indian movies. Even if they sometimes come as unrealistic, but this movie is something different. I've had the misfortune of watching many movies that were either too unrealistic or too westernised which made them lose that special magical Indian touch.This movie had that touch. Kareena proved that she can indeed act without over-acting and the chemistry between her and Shaheed was incredible. Shaheed also proved that he can be taken as a serious actor.I loved the songs and the simplicity of the sets. there were no over-budgeted scenes of Indians living abroad. This movie was all in all Indian in its essence and that's what made it a big hit.",my faith has been restored,i love everything about indian movies even if they sometimes come as unrealistic but this movie is something different ive had misfortune watching many movies that were either too unrealistic or too westernised which made them lose that special magical indian touch this movie had that touch kareena proved that she can indeed act without over acting chemistry between her shaheed was incredible shaheed also proved that he can be taken as serious actor i loved songs simplicity sets there were no over budgeted scenes indians living abroad this movie was all all indian its essence thats what made it big hit,0.6448412698412699,0.176984126984127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,So Sweet!,"I have grown up watching so many Hindi flicks, which invariably are love stories by the way. However, there is something different about this movie which sets it apart from the usual stuff. It is fresh and young - something which is missing these days. The songs too keep playing in your head long after you've listened to them. In short, it is not a drag.Both Shahid Kapur and Kareena seem to be at their peak in this movie. I don't know how to compare their roles in this movie to ones in their previous flicks, but I must admit that they make a good pair. Kareena's excessively talkative personality matches very nicely with Shahid's reserved character. There are no villains too. It is a pity that Shahid and Kareena will not be starring together in the foreseeable future...Enjoy!

7.0,A Cute Romantic-Comedy,"Devasted by the news that his recently widowed mother has decided to remarry and that his fianc√© has chosen another man to wed, a wealthy businessman by the name of ""Aditya D. Kashyap"" (Shahid Kapoor) boards a train in Mumbai to get away from it all. He doesn't know where the train is heading and doesn't really care. He just wants to be left alone and, in his misery, even contemplates suicide while on the train. It's during this time that he happens to meet a young woman by the name of ""Geet Kaur Dhillon"" (Kareena Kapoor) who is not only extremely talkative but also radiates a positive personality as well. To that extent, she even suggests that he travels with her to her small village in order to marry her younger sister ""Roop Kaur Dhillon"" (Saumya Tandon) at the same time she elopes with her secret boyfriend ""Anshuman"" (Pawan Malhotra) so that the two of them can be related by law. Needless to say, Aditya thinks she is completely insane but when the two of them temporarily disembark from the train-and subsequently become stranded in another village--he finds himself becoming more enmeshed in her crazy scheme. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I stumbled upon this film quite by accident and I didn't know whether I would like it or not. To my surprise, I found it to be a really cute romantic-comedy which passed the time extremely well. I especially liked the performances of both Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapooro who played their parts quite well and seemed to enjoy working with one another. That being said, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.

10.0,Kareena Kapoor is incredible!,"I am new to Indian movies. But I think I have just fallen in love with Kareena Kapoor. Honestly, I think this actress is more charismatic than any of the big Hollywood or European names I know right now. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole world will soon know about her. Tell me if you know any American or European actress who can even start to level with her in terms of style and beauty - and most of all - charm. None! Because of her, this movie is one of the most endearing love stories I have ever seen. It just makes you fall in love - what better can you say about a romance? And I am not usually interested in these kinds of movies, plus this is only about the 5th bollywood movie I have ever seen.",kareena kapoor is incredible,i am new indian movies but i think i have just fallen love with kareena kapoor honestly i think this actress is more charismatic than any big hollywood or european names i know right now wouldnt be surprised if whole world will soon know about her tell me if you know any american or european actress who can even start level with her terms style beauty most all charm none because her this movie is one most endearing love stories i have ever seen it just makes you fall love what better can you say about romance i am not usually interested these kinds movies plus this is only about 5th bollywood movie i have ever seen,0.5233457019171305,0.3141465677179963,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.4, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.1}"
9.0,Jab We Met is the BEST!,"Jab We Met is definitely one of the best movies I've seen so far. Everything is very nice about this movie, totally perfect.My Reviews: Kareena Kapoor - She really impressed me with this movie. I love how the way she portrayed the lovable & talkative Geet to the sensitive & sad Geet on the second half. She is the life of the movie, no doubt.Shahid Kapoor - We all know that Shahid is a good actor, but in this movie, we saw something different. We are used to see Shahid in chocolate, college stories, but Jab We Met proved that he can do serious roles without any problems.Music: Mauja Hi Mauja would definitely my favorite. They saved the best for the last. Mauja Hi Mauja is the best song for the film. But for some reason, it reminded me of ""Macarena"" (a popular Spanglish song) and ""Simarik"" (a famous Turkish song).Story: It's really a very predictable story, but I can say it's refreshing. Why? Most Bollywood movies have heroines that are very ""damsel-in-distress"" and have no relevance in the story. Jab We Met, on the other hand, has a female for a lead. You can see a woman's pain when she's heartbroken, which I can say is very realistic and I can totally relate to it.Overall, 9/10 is my rating. Good movie, good actors, good story, good music. Very good. :)",jab we met is best,jab we met is definitely one best movies ive seen so far everything is very nice about this movie totally perfect my reviews kareena kapoor she really impressed me with this movie i love how way she portrayed lovable talkative geet sensitive sad geet second half she is life movie no doubt shahid kapoor we all know that shahid is good actor but this movie we saw something different we are used see shahid chocolate college stories but jab we met proved that he can do serious roles without any problems music mauja hi mauja would definitely my favorite they saved best last mauja hi mauja is best song film but some reason it reminded me macarena popular spanglish song simarik famous turkish song story its really very predictable story but i can say its refreshing why most bollywood movies have heroines that are very damsel distress have no relevance story jab we met other hand has female lead you can see womans pain when shes heartbroken which i can say is very realistic i can totally relate it overall 9 10 is my rating good movie good actors good story good music very good,0.5848611111111113,0.38949074074074064,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,.Imtaz Ali is Hrishikesh Mukherjee of modern times....,"Remember Hrishida's movies? We laughed with it, loved it, because he created the characters who we could relate. You look around, these characters are in one of your friends. Imtiaz Ali is in the same league. The characters, the shots, the sets, the train, the bus - we have been there! We have lived them.And he creates a gem incorporating these elements. It is humour in pure form! It will brighten you up, no matter how grumpy you may be feeling! I think this is one of the loveliest movie of the year. Pure, unadulterated fun! The strength of the movie is in its script, and in its characters, esp that of Kreena Kpoor (try saying that, you know what I mean) - yeah - Ms Kapoor is in her elements. She plays the role of sikhni convincingly! The lingo, the body language, the attitude, she is 100%! Kareena Kapoor 2.0 (that's what I call post Chameli) rocks! Every movie, she surprises with histrionics, that is very few in current Bollywood can match! And what a transformation from Omkara's Dolly? That's real actress right there! Shahid Kapoor... mmmm, could improve in the acting dept. If I were to choose, I would choose someone like Shreyas Talpade for this role. Shahid has definitely matured as an actor from his chocolate-boy image, but still leaves something to be desired.In my opinion, the comedy is one of the most difficult of the genres. To execute it well without sounding cheap, or going overboard, or cheesy, is not really easy. Imtiaz Ali, in this case does justice to two most important depts, Writing & Direction! A word about music: Pritam brings a fresh set of music, some of it grows on you after listening few times. Definitely I am not talking of the radio-friendly Mauja Hi Mauja, which is tailor-made for music video channels. Songs like Aao Milo Chalo, Tum Se Hi are real nice pop or soft-rockish tunes. Sandesh Shandilya shares the burden on Aaoge Jab Tum, and Rashid Khan does a fine job on the vocals. On Tum Se Hi, watch out for Ustad Sultan Khan's ever soulful crooning.I still give it a 8/10 because Shahid Kapoor's acting has rooms for improvement, the second half has rooms for editing and making it more compact. But the movie is worth watching just for Kareena Kapoor's acting!

6.0,A Funny Little Film,"I was at a Punjabi wedding of one of my dear friends early this week. The folks there danced away the whole 3 days like there is no tomorrow. Lot of Jab We Met brought back all that even before the week ended.There is so much life in some people we meet, they infuse faith back in it for us with their sheer presence. Geet is happy-go-lucky girl living life on her terms. Aditya is at the lowest ebb of his life. They meet and life changes for both of them.Imtiaz Ali knows how to make small, endearing films. His characters are next door, his settings are small towns or cities and his stories are simple. He did it well with Socha Na Tha and Ahista Ahista. He hits bang on again with Jab We Met.The casting is precise. I was pleasantly surprised to see Shahid mature up to his role and Kareena bring alive the lively Punjabi girl that she plays. Both of them then slipped into their role reversals with equal ease. Rest of the cast is equally good. I'd like to see more of Pawan Malhotra. He is a very talented actor but hardly seen around.The background score sets an intriguing tone within minutes of the film starting. But it does not maintain that high standard throughout and averages out. The music, otherwise, has some romantic and bhangra numbers which won't stay on charts for long.Jab We Met is an entertaining romantic comedy.

10.0,"'Jab We Watch' it , we are totally entertained","This is an interesting romantic and funny movie from Imtiaz Ali Khan once again after Socha Na Tha, and it fulfilled my long waiting desires to watch it. Imtiaz is going on in his improvement to produce every time a better movie. And it should inspire all the directors of his genre. The scenes have been mostly shot at outdoor spots like Chandigarh, Kulu, Manali and Shimla, and this entertains us as if we are experiencing ourselves a real tour. Again and again seeing daily studio scenes made the eyes wounded and fed up the mind. And thats why it's a nice pick up at nice time. Although the storyline is not that new with the old movies as a boy meets girl and slowly fall in love but the way Imtiaz presented each and every scenes are worth to watch. From the beginning to the end I personally enjoyed the whole movie, and happy to spend some amount of bucks on it. After Shikhar this is second time in which Shahid has proved that he has all the required potentialities to become a genius actor one day. But I was damn irritated by Kareena's irritating and annoying much chatty and talkative role. But still then, beside this the whole story became a sweet and funny love story. For Shahid's lovers and fans, you must have got something relaxed after watching this unique love story (just like ME!!!).",jab we watch it we are totally entertained,this is interesting romantic funny movie imtiaz ali khan once again after socha na tha it fulfilled my long waiting desires watch it imtiaz is going his improvement produce every time better movie it should inspire all directors his genre scenes have been mostly shot at outdoor spots like chandigarh kulu manali shimla this entertains us as if we are experiencing ourselves real tour again again seeing daily studio scenes made eyes wounded fed up mind thats why its nice pick up at nice time although storyline is not that new with old movies as boy meets girl slowly fall love but way imtiaz presented each every scenes are worth watch beginning end i personally enjoyed whole movie happy spend some amount bucks it after shikhar this is second time which shahid has proved that he has all required potentialities become genius actor one day but i was damn irritated by kareenas irritating annoying much chatty talkative role but still then beside this whole story became sweet funny love story shahids lovers fans you must have got something relaxed after watching this unique love story just like me,0.5673981191222571,0.22452978056426331,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,One of the best romcoms of the 2000s,"2000s, especially the later half, saw emergence of the romcom genre in Bollywood. Towards the end of 2000s, we were almost inundated with many of these to the point that most viewers were tired of it. So when I saw this one a couple of years ago, my expectations were minimal to zero. I watched it while working on computer, something in the background. I did not care to watch it until it came out on DVDs. However, it turned out to be the best romcom I have seen to date. It works primarily because of these three ingredients: - Genuine storyline, quite realistic without going too OTT - Charming and very likable character played by Kareena - Music by Pritam, the recycling king/Bhappi Lahri of the 2000sToo bad Imitiaz Ali could not follow it up with as good a movie. Love Aaj Kal, while pretty good, does not come close to this. I have watched it 3 times since my first viewing.

8.0,entertaining Indian screwball comedy powered by Kareena Kapoor,"In Jab We Met, a heartbroken guy meets a wacky, headstrong girl on a train who upends his life as she drags him into her adventures.Kareena Kapoor is hilarious as the wacky girl. Her endless monologue to the guy is long-winded prattle that is both annoying and charming. She is the equivalent of characters like Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby; a madcap who irritates and fascinates the guy she has swept into her tornado.The movie bounces along effortlessly for the first couple of hours, with scenery, chemistry, and pleasant but generally forgettable musical interludes, but gets a little messy in the final third. Kapoor's actions go a little beyond wacky, a lot of very unlikely things happen, motivations seem arbitrary and it's all a reminder of why American screwball comedies stay well under 2 hours.In spite of a shaky and somewhat peculiar (or just so Indian-specific that a westerner like me doesn't get it?) final hour, overall this is a charming, funny, and romantic movie well worth watching.",entertaining indian screwball comedy powered by kareena kapoor,jab we met heartbroken guy meets wacky headstrong girl train who upends his life as she drags him into her adventures kareena kapoor is hilarious as wacky girl her endless monologue guy is long winded prattle that is both annoying charming she is equivalent characters like katherine hepburn bringing up baby madcap who irritates fascinates guy she has swept into her tornado movie bounces along effortlessly first couple hours with scenery chemistry pleasant but generally forgettable musical interludes but gets little messy final third kapoors actions go little beyond wacky lot very unlikely things happen motivations seem arbitrary its all reminder why american screwball comedies stay well under 2 hours spite shaky somewhat peculiar or just so indian specific that westerner like me doesnt get it final hour overall this is charming funny romantic movie well worth watching,0.6008620689655174,0.07931034482758618,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.37}"

7.0,"Surprisingly good, unlike most of the love stories","None from my family were that keen about this film. I myself preferred watching a movie directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali instead of this and didn't pay much heed to this film. 'Another love story' I thought because, even though Sanjay's film too are love stories, they have a delightful charm in them which make them stupendous.I was taken aback after the critics gave this film a 4 out of 5 stars and then, my family decided to watch this movie on the big screen. I yet was ambivalent whether it would live up to my expectations, after watching preposterously bad films like Dhol, Muskaan etc.I myself admit that I am harsh as a critic and most of my reviews, whether bollywood or Hollywood, are somewhat criticizing the film in some or the other way. I never go with very high expectations, just as a 'normal person', without any feelings to review my feelings after watching the movie and after I left the theater, I was happy and that meant, that the movie was good.I am afraid that I might give away some important details of the movie deliberately; therefore, I am not going into the story details. I will first mention the points that I liked in the movie:1) The performances of both the lead characters were strong. Shahid as the 'jeevan see hara hua' man and Kareena as the 'sweet, bumbling but annoying chatterbox' are at top notch in this movie and their chemistry is clearly visible. Shahid, thank God, is portraying a much matured role in this film unlike his other movies and Kareena is just Kareena with great acting.2) The humor was good in this film. Karrena has good comedy timing while Shahid's expressions just makes anyone laugh, especially in the first half. I even liked the character who plays Kareena's boy friend as he was really funny and it was humorous to watch him get agitated by you'll know when you watch the movie.3) The first half was really good, witty and humorous as the audience didn't get bored or didn't feel to leave their seats. 4) The songs were a mixture of catchy and melodious. 'Mauja MAuja' and 'Yeh Ishq hai' were really good songs while the others too were decent.Now, in one paragraph, I will explain the flaws in this movie. I coudn't understand Dara Singh's role at all nor was he funny. The camera effects were not amazing and I felt that the editing was somewhat odd and glitchy. I suddenly realized that the characters were in another place. One or two of the scenes looked as if they were taken from another movie and pasted into this movie. Some of the jokes too were childish and a bit loud. The second part was dragging and you felt as if it was monotonous, that is, if you compare it with the first part. Overall, it was a relief to watch this movie as I was relieved from a state of shock after watching the abominable film Dhol. But I didn't feel that I could watch it for the second tome immediately after leaving the theater and even after a few days after watching the film. 7 out of 10.",surprisingly good unlike most love stories,none my family were that keen about this film i myself preferred watching movie directed by sanjay leela bhansali instead this didnt pay much heed this film another love story i thought because even though sanjays film too are love stories they have delightful charm them which make them stupendous i was taken aback after critics gave this film 4 out 5 stars then my family decided watch this movie big screen i yet was ambivalent whether it would live up my expectations after watching preposterously bad films like dhol muskaan etc i myself admit that i am harsh as critic most my reviews whether bollywood or hollywood are somewhat criticizing film some or other way i never go with very high expectations just as normal person without any feelings review my feelings after watching movie after i left theater i was happy that meant that movie was good i am afraid that i might give away some important details movie deliberately therefore i am not going into story details i will first mention points that i liked movie 1 performances both lead characters were strong shahid as jeevan see hara hua man kareena as sweet bumbling but annoying chatterbox are at top notch this movie their chemistry is clearly visible shahid thank god is portraying much matured role this film unlike his other movies kareena is just kareena with great acting 2 humor was good this film karrena has good comedy timing while shahids expressions just makes anyone laugh especially first half i even liked character who plays kareenas boy friend as he was really funny it was humorous watch him get agitated by youll know when you watch movie 3 first half was really good witty humorous as audience didnt get bored or didnt feel leave their seats 4 songs were mixture catchy melodious mauja mauja yeh ishq hai were really good songs while others too were decent now one paragraph i will explain flaws this movie i coudnt understand dara singhs role at all nor was he funny camera effects were not amazing i felt that editing was somewhat odd glitchy i suddenly realized that characters were another place one or two scenes looked as if they were taken another movie pasted into this movie some jokes too were childish bit loud second part was dragging you felt as if it was monotonous that is if you compare it with first part overall it was relief watch this movie as i was relieved state shock after watching abominable film dhol but i didnt feel that i could watch it second tome immediately after leaving theater even after few days after watching film 7 out 10,0.5586551724137934,0.21973040752351095,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"

,Perfected by Imtiaz Ali,"There are only a handful of movies which get the distinction of being cut-above-the-rest. ""Jab We Met"" is an ordinary story which is given extra-ordinary treatment by Imtiaz Ali which makes the entire proceedings an interesting watch. Every scene shines in brilliance as if they were cherry-picked and delivered on the screen. Kareena Kapoor:: The bubbling and bursting with verbal diarrhoea ""Geet"" I am sure you and I have met somebody of the likes at least once. Tailor- made for Kareena Kapoor and she delivers with utmost perfection at ease. It reminds me the Jekyll & Hyde which was earlier attempted in ""Chandni"" and that role did wonders to Sridevi's career. No wonder Kareena catapulted to the big league subsequently.Shahid Kapoor:: Easily manages to don the hats of a heart-broken lover to enthusiastic and a suave technocrat brimming with fresh ideas. The supporting cast is good namely Dara Singh, Pavan Malhotra and Kiran Juneja. You can't help but pity for Tarun Malhotra (such is the characterisation of Anshuman). There is not a single dull moment in the movie. The screenplay sails like a breeze. Every time the movie is aired on telly, I can't resist to watch it. The music had a slow-start but later on went to become a must have in the collection.

8.0,As fresh as it can be,"If a director has courage and the guts to take an outdated story line and execute it to a perfection that is altogether to a new height; new level, the director seriously has got some talent. If you ask me a good/talented director is all you need to get the best out of everything; be it a story line, situation or performers. Same situation same actors has brought such a new , absolute fresh piece of cinema, which probably would have been another needle in the hack had it been directed by any run of the mill director. The store line is the usual girl meets boy on a journey moving towards their own destinations and eventually fall in love but again the execution is so damn superb and realistic that no situation in the movie looks out of place. The dialogs are sparkling despite being mature. The funny moments are truly funny and emotions look absolute real. U immediately relate to them. Over all the chemistry Imtiaz Ali (who directed soocha na tha) manages to built between the lead characters is stunning, absolute real, natural and believable, I have not seen (and I am sure people would agree) such a sweet and heart warming chemistry in any romantic couple for a loooong time. Music is good as well with 2 absolutely amazing romantic songs........""Tum he se"" and ""Aaoge jab tum"".

8.0,Go on this journey from Mumbai to Bhatinda!!,"A good-looking and incredibly rich man (Shahid Kapor) is dumped by his girlfriend, and is down in the dumps. He leaves his Mercedes on the street and wanders about, then jumps on to the first train he sees. A good-looking fast talking Punjabi kudi (Kareena Kapoor) hops on to same train and talks non-stop, even in her sleep, driving the moping hero to brink of insanity. He hops off, she hops off to help him get back on, misses the train, and thus begins a madcap journey from Bombay to Bhatinda. Sound improbable? Hackneyed? Forget all that and go on this most enjoyable journey with Kareena and Shahid. Shahid has a long way to go before he can be an actor of any note, and his chocolate boy looks require much more than a pair of glasses to be toned down, but by the end of it you feel that it was not a bad effort. Kareena has finally come into her own as an actress, first as the very serious Dolly of Omkara, and now as the most frivolous and most convincingly garrulous Geet. She demonstrates her acting skills to the fullest and looks very good in the process.The movie is a modern day Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge with chance meetings, missed trains, shared hotel rooms, partings, families, elopements and is bubbling with a youthful fun feel. Someone told me that in this film one misses the Shahrukh of the 90s! This was a role inspired by the quintessential lover-boy of our times and 10 years ago he would have run with it and turned Jab We Met into an outstanding film! But even so, the film still works ¬ñ has fun music, great chemistry between the lead pair and above all has a most real feel to it. And it is funny, ""Akeli Ladki to Khuli Hui Tijori Hoti Hai""; the boyfriend telling Shahid ¬ñ ""Now her brothers want to take me to the sugarcane fields. Why should I go to the sugarcane fields with them? I won't go!' Next shot shows him holding some sugar cane! The settings, the locales, the songs, the trains, automobiles, everything is imparted a never before seen ambiance by sophomore director Imtiaz Ali. The story is not new but the treatment is super fresh like a fresh glass of Nimbupani in baking heat! Jab We Met is one fine entertainer and worth a repeat watch. The film is ruled by Kareena; a new female star emerges, and is able to carry the film on her shoulders.",go this journey mumbai bhatinda,good looking incredibly rich man shahid kapor is dumped by his girlfriend is down dumps he leaves his mercedes street wanders about then jumps first train he sees good looking fast talking punjabi kudi kareena kapoor hops same train talks non stop even her sleep driving moping hero brink insanity he hops off she hops off help him get back misses train thus begins madcap journey bombay bhatinda sound improbable hackneyed forget all that go this most enjoyable journey with kareena shahid shahid has long way go before he can be actor any note his chocolate boy looks require much more than pair glasses be toned down but by end it you feel that it was not bad effort kareena has finally come into her own as actress first as very serious dolly omkara now as most frivolous most convincingly garrulous geet she demonstrates her acting skills fullest looks very good process movie is modern day dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge with chance meetings missed trains shared hotel rooms partings families elopements is bubbling with youthful fun feel someone told me that this film one misses shahrukh 90s this was role inspired by quintessential lover boy our times 10 years ago he would have run with it turned jab we met into outstanding film but even so film still works has fun music great chemistry between lead pair above all has most real feel it it is funny akeli ladki khuli hui tijori hoti hai boyfriend telling shahid now her brothers want take me sugarcane fields why should i go sugarcane fields with them i wont go next shot shows him holding some sugar cane settings locales songs trains automobiles everything is imparted never before seen ambiance by sophomore director imtiaz ali story is not new but treatment is super fresh like fresh glass nimbupani baking heat jab we met is one fine entertainer worth repeat watch film is ruled by kareena new female star emerges is able carry film her shoulders,0.4843070237256284,0.2839241249706367,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"

It only means, somewhere in those 2.5 hours, Jab We Met metamorphoses into something far more substantial than just a movie. On the surface, its a simple story of a guy and a girl but if u dive deep enough, it is a heartwarming assortment of stories, about losing and finding love, about internal and external journeys, about forgetting and rediscovering oneself, about letting go with a smile and above all about finding hope in despair.
