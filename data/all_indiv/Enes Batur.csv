1.0,Not garbage but almost garbage,"To be honest, it doesn't deserve either 1 or 10. He is the most popular youtuber in Turkey and he has lots of fan in Turkey. I rated ""1"" because 6 is too much for this movie and i think all of his fans rated 10 so this movie's average puan is so high for that movie. In addition, this movie's scene transition is so bad.. it is like a YouTube video or smth.. not professional and i think we can not categorize that like it is real movie. It has a lot of imperfect scene, casts (except 2-3 of them) was not acting very well. I don't suggest that movie unless you want to lose your times.",not garbage but almost garbage,be honest it doesnt deserve either 1 or 10 he is most popular youtuber turkey he has lots fan turkey i rated 1 because 6 is too much this movie i think all his fans rated 10 so this movies average puan is so high that movie addition this movies scene transition is so bad it is like youtube video or smth not professional i think we can not categorize that like it is real movie it has lot imperfect scene casts except 2 3 them was not acting very well i dont suggest that movie unless you want lose your times,0.4369696969696969,0.14181818181818184,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.45, 'Fear': 0.27}"

,Trash,"I'm going to say that I didn't understand whether the film was really a dream or a real one, but it's definitely a dream. Real people can only describe a human life in such a cliché fiction using characters. Actors were awful in the movie, so I didn't expect acting. I watched the film without prejudice, but I became a cringe. The film didn't have much comedy. It has been edited with fiction that has similar films everywhere and it has been really distant. It would be better for everyone to tell the truth. The film has nowhere to be commended. Failed and cliché.",trash,im going say that i didnt understand whether film was really dream or real one but its definitely dream real people can only describe human life such clich fiction using characters actors were awful movie so i didnt expect acting i watched film without prejudice but i became cringe film didnt have much comedy it has been edited with fiction that has similar films everywhere it has been really distant it would be better everyone tell truth film has nowhere be commended failed clich,0.4035714285714285,-0.021428571428571425,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1.0,Here is a movie long youtube video,"While reviewing this movie the first thing to consider is ""Should this movie be considered as a long enough youtube video while reviewing it or should i review it as it is a movie?"". If it is first option, it is a profitable and enjoyable youtube content. But since this is a review on IMDb we shall consider it as a movie so it sucks. First thing to mention is cast which is full of famous or almost-famous 'youtubers'. Those guys or girls are not actresses or actors they should just continue to produce entertaining and enjoyable content for youtube. This situation that they have put themselves into is something like ""I can ride a bike well , so why not i ride a motorbike ?"". This is a logic that nobody should believe or follow. I won't even mention the actings of those i have been talking about. Maybe story can be somehow inspiring, but it can only inspire under 10 years old kids who can be inspired by almost anything at that age.",here is movie long youtube video,while reviewing this movie first thing consider is should this movie be considered as long enough youtube video while reviewing it or should i review it as it is movie if it is first option it is profitable enjoyable youtube content but since this is review imdb we shall consider it as movie so it sucks first thing mention is cast which is full famous or almost famous youtubers those guys or girls are not actresses or actors they should just continue produce entertaining enjoyable content youtube this situation that they have put themselves into is something like i can ride bike well so why not i ride motorbike this is logic that nobody should believe or follow i wont even mention actings those i have been talking about maybe story can be somehow inspiring but it can only inspire under 10 years old kids who can be inspired by almost anything at that age,0.578125,0.23750000000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.23}"

1.0,This is definiton of Vanity Project,"Enes Batur Hayal mi Gerçek mi? just a turkish youtuber's vanity project which inspired by the ego of its creator and this movie's only purpose to capitalise on his popularity among the kids. The script is atrocious and it written by a 19 years old high school graduate youtuber. Enes Batur is no actor and having a starring role magnifies those deficiencies in his acting ability. I'm sure Enes Batur's little kid fans loved this thing but the problem with the film is that is incredibly boring and silly for adults. There really isn't any artistic integrity within the film and this is probably one of the worst Turkish movie ever made. The film was so bad in fact it spawned one of my favourite Roger Ebert quotes.
