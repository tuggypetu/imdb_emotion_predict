8.0,Khosla Ka Ghosla is an appetizing pure vegetarian thali in the age of non-veg junkies. Go relish it!,"How many times have you come across a film that makes you smile while you have a lump in your throat at the same time? Such are the dwellers of this nest that you feel sorry for them for the trouble they land themselves into but such is the treatment of the film that rather than being a compulsive tearjerker it has that feel good effect on you (without being overtly mushy either).Never since the times of Sai Paranjpe or Basu Chatterjee has one come across as authentic portrayal of the middle-class in films as you get to see here. Khosla Ka Ghosla talks about a family in Delhi headed by Mr. Khosla (Anupam Kher) who invests all his life's savings to buy a plot on which he dreams of building his own bungalow. But after buying the plot he finds the land being encroached by a builder Khurana (Boman Irani). He uses paisa, pehalwan and politics to get his land back but is too diminutive in front of the mammoth Khurana. Finally the straightforward family attempts devious ways to get back their land.Despite the film being delayed for long, the narrative still comes out as fresh and original. An average audience can so much relate to the characters of the film since none of them play the conventional larger-than-life Bollywood hero but a common man. Where else can you find the male lead of the film (Parvin Dabas) with a name that goes as Chiraunjilal? Kiran Juneja playing Khosla's wife, in her minuscule bit, is such a refreshing change from the sugar sweet Farida Jalal or the melodramatic Reema Lagoo kind of on screen mothers. Or for that matter Ranvir Shorey as the elder brother isn't the usual dominating or over-protective type clichéd character.The scenes that unfold come out so much out of real life situations. The only inspiration that the film derives is from real life. The semi-autobiographical script by Jaideep Sahni is original, amazing and entertaining. Debutante director Dibakar Bannerjee extracts fine performances from every member of the cast and never lets anybody go overboard or under-act. The comic timing of the characters is simply flawless. The theme of the film might be a serious issue but the treatment is very light-hearted. Songs are restricted just to the background and Kailash Kher's 'Chak De Phatte' gels perfect with the proceedings. The background score attributed to Boman Irani's character, every time he enters the scene, needs a special mention.Post Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara, this is Anupam Kher's best performance. He has performed such common man characters before and plays his part effortlessly even here. From Munnabhai MBBS, Being Cyrus to Khosla Ka Ghosla, Boman Irani perhaps is the only villain who can successfully add a natural comic effect to negative characters. Parvin Dabbas, Vinay Pathak, Navin Nischol and Kiran Juneja are apt in their roles. Ranvir Shorey plays the most hilarious comic characters to have come out in recent times without being goofy at any time. The actor is simply amazing.Khosla Ka Ghosla is an appetizing pure vegetarian thali in the age of non-veg junkies. Go relish it!",khosla ka ghosla is appetizing pure vegetarian thali age non veg junkies go relish it,how many times have you come across film that makes you smile while you have lump your throat at same time such are dwellers this nest that you feel sorry them trouble they land themselves into but such is treatment film that rather than being compulsive tearjerker it has that feel good effect you without being overtly mushy either never since times sai paranjpe or basu chatterjee has one come across as authentic portrayal middle class films as you get see here khosla ka ghosla talks about family delhi headed by mr khosla anupam kher who invests all his lifes savings buy plot which he dreams building his own bungalow but after buying plot he finds land being encroached by builder khurana boman irani he uses paisa pehalwan politics get his land back but is too diminutive front mammoth khurana finally straightforward family attempts devious ways get back their land despite film being delayed long narrative still comes out as fresh original average audience can so much relate characters film since none them play conventional larger than life bollywood hero but common man where else can you find male lead film parvin dabas with name that goes as chiraunjilal kiran juneja playing khoslas wife her minuscule bit is such refreshing change sugar sweet farida jalal or melodramatic reema lagoo kind screen mothers or that matter ranvir shorey as elder brother isnt usual dominating or over protective type clich d character scenes that unfold come out so much out real life situations only inspiration that film derives is real life semi autobiographical script by jaideep sahni is original amazing entertaining debutante director dibakar bannerjee extracts fine performances every member cast never lets anybody go overboard or under act comic timing characters is simply flawless theme film might be serious issue but treatment is very light hearted songs are restricted just background kailash khers chak de phatte gels perfect with proceedings background score attributed boman iranis character every time he enters scene needs special mention post maine gandhi ko nahi maara this is anupam khers best performance he has performed such common man characters before plays his part effortlessly even here munnabhai mbbs being cyrus khosla ka ghosla boman irani perhaps is only villain who can successfully add natural comic effect negative characters parvin dabbas vinay pathak navin nischol kiran juneja are apt their roles ranvir shorey plays most hilarious comic characters have come out recent times without being goofy at any time actor is simply amazing khosla ka ghosla is appetizing pure vegetarian thali age non veg junkies go relish it,0.5397656840513982,0.2225585789871504,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.48}"
8.0,Realistic Entertainer,"Last night I woke up at 8.30 in the night after sleeping for like 6 years at a stretch after the overnight stay me and my friends had. 9 PM. On air is ""Khosla Ka Ghosla"". Now I really wanted to watch that movie when it was released but just didn't had the time to and right now, I wasn't in the mood for it but since nothing else on TV was worth a watch, I decided to see the film.After a while I realized that 40 minutes had gone by and not for one moment did I feel that KKG had a scene so far which was boring or unnecessary. KKG is truly gripping. It sucks you into it and you'll start getting concerned about Kamal Kishore Khosla (Anupam Kher). Khosla is a very innocent middle-class service man who gets a plot of land from Kishan Khurana (Boman Irani) out of his life-savings, a lump amount of 30 lacs but things get terrible when Khurana doesn't exactly let Khosla get the land until Khosla would pay Khurana another 10-15 lacs.As much as I would love to say that Khosla Ka Ghosla was a movie which belonged to Anupam Kher and Boman Irani, I cannot deny that it belonged to the other artists as well. What I like so much about Khosla Ka Ghosla is that it does not star big mainstream artists in it except Boman Irani & Anupam Kher and if it did, maybe it would have lost its simplicity. Anupam Kher has been doing really lesser number of roles as compared to what he used to in the 90s but after Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara, Kya Kool Hain Hum and Rang De Basanti, Kher almost steals the show again. Khosla Ka Ghosla is very very realistic and that is its USP. Of course there are a few little flaws in the script but that does not stop KKG from becoming an entertaining ride without moving away from the realistic world. The brand of humour used in the movie is simple and enjoyable and one thing which I liked very much about this film is its characterization, I cannot deny that I liked every character present in the movie and it felt that they were straight out of someone's lives. Although Khurana and his assistant reminded me of Lucky Singh & Kuku in Lage Raho Munnabhai bit, basically because of the role they played.Boman and Anupam of course do play the parts beautifully but one performance which I liked a lot was that was Bappu's (Navin Nischol). Now what Bappu is doing in the film, I cannot say because I feel that would give out a part of the story. Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Pathak come together again after they did once in Jism. Ranvir as Anupam's elder son and Vinay as the guy whom Boman had betrayed play their parts with ease and rock it. Tara Sharma's accent is weird but I liked her here and the director gets credit for that. Parween Dabas too... actually its not the actors that are there but the characters. Such is the magic of débutante director Dibakar Banerjee and writer Jaideep Sahani. Full marks to the director who's earned my respect.The music by composers Bapi, Tutul and Dhruv too is great. ""Chakk De Phadde"" sung by Kailesh Kher which is also the OST of the movie is nice and totally in mood of the film. The other tracks too offer great help in carrying the story forward.When Anupam Kher had said that this is a tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's film-making style, I'm sure he truly meant it. Khosla Ka Ghosla is simple, innocent, realistic and entertaining. Go watch it if you want to see a quality film. Much better than the Karan Johar or Rakesh Roshan flicks which are recognised by Filmfare, not for their creativity but commercial success. Khosla Ka Ghosla made my mood. Three cheers to the movie! 7.5/10 from http://muviegeek.blogspot.com",realistic entertainer,last night i woke up at 8 30 night after sleeping like 6 years at stretch after overnight stay me my friends had 9 pm air is khosla ka ghosla now i really wanted watch that movie when it was released but just didnt had time right now i wasnt mood it but since nothing else tv was worth watch i decided see film after while i realized that 40 minutes had gone by not one moment did i feel that kkg had scene so far which was boring or unnecessary kkg is truly gripping it sucks you into it youll start getting concerned about kamal kishore khosla anupam kher khosla is very innocent middle class service man who gets plot land kishan khurana boman irani out his life savings lump amount 30 lacs but things get terrible when khurana doesnt exactly let khosla get land until khosla would pay khurana another 10 15 lacs as much as i would love say that khosla ka ghosla was movie which belonged anupam kher boman irani i cannot deny that it belonged other artists as well what i like so much about khosla ka ghosla is that it does not star big mainstream artists it except boman irani anupam kher if it did maybe it would have lost its simplicity anupam kher has been doing really lesser number roles as compared what he used 90s but after maine gandhi ko nahin maara kya kool hain hum rang de basanti kher almost steals show again khosla ka ghosla is very very realistic that is its usp course there are few little flaws script but that does not stop kkg becoming entertaining ride without moving away realistic world brand humour used movie is simple enjoyable one thing which i liked very much about this film is its characterization i cannot deny that i liked every character present movie it felt that they were straight out someones lives although khurana his assistant reminded me lucky singh kuku lage raho munnabhai bit basically because role they played boman anupam course do play parts beautifully but one performance which i liked lot was that was bappus navin nischol now what bappu is doing film i cannot say because i feel that would give out part story ranvir shorey vinay pathak come together again after they did once jism ranvir as anupams elder son vinay as guy whom boman had betrayed play their parts with ease rock it tara sharmas accent is weird but i liked her here director gets credit that parween dabas too actually its not actors that are there but characters such is magic d butante director dibakar banerjee writer jaideep sahani full marks director whos earned my respect music by composers bapi tutul dhruv too is great chakk de phadde sung by kailesh kher which is also ost movie is nice totally mood film other tracks too offer great help carrying story forward when anupam kher had said that this is tribute hrishikesh mukherjees film making style im sure he truly meant it khosla ka ghosla is simple innocent realistic entertaining go watch it if you want see quality film much better than karan johar or rakesh roshan flicks which are recognised by filmfare not their creativity but commercial success khosla ka ghosla made my mood three cheers movie 7 5 10,0.5344040404040404,0.19833116883116883,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Outstanding!!!,"Khosla ka Ghosla is one of the best films in 2006. But because of its simple cast, it has been underrated and has not got the recognition it deserves. In fact, before I went for the movie, I myself thought that this was a bore. It is a beautiful and realistic film. There is simple humour, which just helps in 'digesting' the plot. The good thing is that all the actors, (even the ones speaking just one or two dialogues) give a superb performance. Anupak Kher acts really well. I have no words to describe Boman Irani's acting. He is amazing. he just does not act the same in any movie. I also liked Navin Nischol's acting a lot. Apart from that, Parvin Dabas, Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey give terrific performances. Dibakar Banerjee has directed the film beautifully. It is beautifully paced. Every scene is an important scene in the film. It is not dragged. As far as music is concerned, music is not really needed. But I think Bapi-Tutul and Dhruv Dhalla gave superb background score. KKG just reinforces the fact that there is no dearth of acting talent in India, just that one must not go for a film just because it has a star cast. A star would have taken the simplicity of the film. In short, KKG is an awesome film, and one which everybody will relish.",outstanding,khosla ka ghosla is one best films 2006 but because its simple cast it has been underrated has not got recognition it deserves fact before i went movie i myself thought that this was bore it is beautiful realistic film there is simple humour which just helps digesting plot good thing is that all actors even ones speaking just one or two dialogues give superb performance anupak kher acts really well i have no words describe boman iranis acting he is amazing he just does not act same any movie i also liked navin nischols acting lot apart that parvin dabas vinay pathak ranvir shorey give terrific performances dibakar banerjee has directed film beautifully it is beautifully paced every scene is important scene film it is not dragged as far as music is concerned music is not really needed but i think bapi tutul dhruv dhalla gave superb background score kkg just reinforces fact that there is no dearth acting talent india just that one must not go film just because it has star cast star would have taken simplicity film short kkg is awesome film one which everybody will relish,0.5803312629399586,0.3855072463768116,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,A surefire benchmark,"Indian film industry is the most prolific in the world and yet very few of our movies make their mark on the global scale and I am not talking about the financial aspect of this industry but the lack of imagination and finesse. Hence the Indian masses cannot be blamed for their taste in cinema simply because they have rarely been exposed to truly magnificent cinema.This is partly because most of the commercial movies are profit-centric as they ought to be but these movies revolve around a nucleus of a few 'stars' and the producers bank on these 'brand-ambassadors' to make the movie click; plus the profit from the sales from the movie soundtrack is a very crucial part in the success of a movie and this incumbency on songs is unparalleled which leads to so many abrupt speed breakers in the narration of a story so that these songs can be accommodated. And it works sometimes but the calamity is that every movie is focused around the same philosophy.This movie stands apart because it does not fall prey to any of the above. There is no 'brand ambassador' for this movie. The forte of this movie lies in its simplicity, sincerity and substance and much of that credit goes to the director Divakar Banerjee.At the crust of the movie are two of the finest actors in the country today; Anupam Kher as the ordinary middle class fifty six year old man (Khosla)in Delhi whose only drive in life is to build a new house for his family that has his wife (Kiran Juneja), his elder son Balwant(Ranveer Shourie), his second son Chirounjilal aka Cherry (Parvin Dabas) and his daughter. Balwant is a jobless waster and Cherry works for an MNC but wants to leave the country for a better job in America.Navin Nishcol (Bapu) and Vinay Pathak (Asif Iqbal) are also assets to this movie.Boman Irani(Khurana) is a very wealthy and sly business man who captures the plot of land that Khosla had bought for building his dream house. Now if Khosla wants the plot of land that belongs to him he must buy it from Khurana, the problem though is that he doesn't have the money as he spent his life's savings to buy that plot of land. This movie is about how an ordinary middle class old man tries to reclaim his stolen (robbed) dream back from the powerful clasps of this crooked property dealer.The film looks real. Actors don't wear designer costumes, there are no exquisite locations but what it does have is ingenuity and a sense of realm. The movie does not focus on a couple of 'brand ambassadors' but does justice to characters and all the actors have done a commendable job in keeping it real. The characterization is superb. The dialogues are witty and have a subtle Indian flavour in them. It also has a hint of dark sense of humour. The opening scene is funny but is inconspicuously and heavily sarcastic which is excellent dark comedy material. You will see many of those in the movie. I would agree that Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron is an excellent reference point.The movie does not exaggerate and neither does it take itself lightly. There are many scenes in the movie that manifest the problems of the common man who lives a mundane life and is helpless. Those who watch movies are these common men and they would love to see something that they can relate to.The best Hindi movie that I've seen since Lagaan. Will remember it for is originality, sarcasm and its intrinsic common man appeal.",surefire benchmark,indian film industry is most prolific world yet very few our movies make their mark global scale i am not talking about financial aspect this industry but lack imagination finesse hence indian masses cannot be blamed their taste cinema simply because they have rarely been exposed truly magnificent cinema this is partly because most commercial movies are profit centric as they ought be but these movies revolve around nucleus few stars producers bank these brand ambassadors make movie click plus profit sales movie soundtrack is very crucial part success movie this incumbency songs is unparalleled which leads so many abrupt speed breakers narration story so that these songs can be accommodated it works sometimes but calamity is that every movie is focused around same philosophy this movie stands apart because it does not fall prey any above there is no brand ambassador this movie forte this movie lies its simplicity sincerity substance much that credit goes director divakar banerjee at crust movie are two finest actors country today anupam kher as ordinary middle class fifty six year old man khosla delhi whose only drive life is build new house his family that has his wife kiran juneja his elder son balwant ranveer shourie his second son chirounjilal aka cherry parvin dabas his daughter balwant is jobless waster cherry works mnc but wants leave country better job america navin nishcol bapu vinay pathak asif iqbal are also assets this movie boman irani khurana is very wealthy sly business man who captures plot land that khosla had bought building his dream house now if khosla wants plot land that belongs him he must buy it khurana problem though is that he doesnt have money as he spent his lifes savings buy that plot land this movie is about how ordinary middle class old man tries reclaim his stolen robbed dream back powerful clasps this crooked property dealer film looks real actors dont wear designer costumes there are no exquisite locations but what it does have is ingenuity sense realm movie does not focus couple brand ambassadors but does justice characters all actors have done commendable job keeping it real characterization is superb dialogues are witty have subtle indian flavour them it also has hint dark sense humour opening scene is funny but is inconspicuously heavily sarcastic which is excellent dark comedy material you will see many those movie i would agree that jaane bhi do yaaron is excellent reference point movie does not exaggerate neither does it take itself lightly there are many scenes movie that manifest problems common man who lives mundane life is helpless those who watch movies are these common men they would love see something that they can relate best hindi movie that ive seen since lagaan will remember it is originality sarcasm its intrinsic common man appeal,0.44970798207640317,0.16055023923444978,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,Awesome......a must watch after Hera Pheri,"This is the best comedy movie I have seen after Hera Pheri. Very few comedy movies make it to my list of all time favorite which include stellar classic comedy movies like Jane Bhi Do Yaroon, Andaz Apna Apna, and Hera Pheri. And this movie deserve to be on the list. Pure clean comedy movie. Not a single dull boring moment. Such a movie which every Dilliwala (Delhi-ite) can relate to one way or the other.And the best part is authentic Dilli ki (Delhi's) language and amazing comic timing of each and every character. As always Ranveer Shori and Vinay Pathak are at their best. From that Haryanvi jaat to locales of Dilli to the wearing off paint of houses to police's attitude. Every thing is so real.

8.0,Swindling a swindler...,"I am often surprised that the idea of police and government corruption is so ubiquitous in Indian films. While corruption is, unfortunately, found everywhere, the fact that the movies from India talk about it so much is a surprise to a westerner.When the film begins, Kamal (Anupam Kher) has a horrible dream that he's died and no one in particular is sad. In fact, in the dream his wife and kids are much more concerned about more mundane things such as how to feed all the guests and not wanting to miss a day's pay by staying home!! So when he awakens, Kamal is worried all about his legacy...thank Heaven he has bought some land on which he can build his retirement home. However, when he takes his family to see the place, they find that some rich jerk has simply stolen the property and put a wall around it...and a nasty bodyguard to keep this family off their own land!! Naturally, his children are angry but Kamal tells them to relax...they can work it out with Mr. Khurana who is claiming the property. Well, they can't! The crook demands they pay him for their land...and the local police are bought and paid for by this rich crook.So what do you do when you can't find satisfaction any other way? Yep, they decide to rob Khurana...and to do it, they'll get the money needed to buy back their own property from Khurana himself! To do it, they decide to offer to sell Khurana some amazing property and allow his greed to get the better of him...and, of course, the property will not be real. So how, exactly, will they pull this off? See the film.This film is a bit unusual because it has no song or dance numbers. Now not all Indian films have these lavish dance numbers...but so many of the ones they export here to the States usually do. And, fortunately, while the film is a comedy, it's much more restrained and subtle than many of the other Indian comedies I've seen. I'm no expert on their films, but I liked this one. It had an interesting story and nice acting. Heck, I always like Anupam Kher in films!

9.0,Very close to reality,"When I first heard about the movie ""Khosla Ka Ghosla"", I thought it is yet another nonsensical comedy. But now after seeing the movie I feel that the makers of the movie could have done even better had they not used the current title. I don't say that the title is not apt for the movie but at first instance it gives a totally different impression of what the movie is going to be like than it actually is.Kamal Kishore Khosla (Anupam Kher) is just another head of a middle-class family who spends his entire life's earning to buy a plot in Delhi. He wants to build a new house for his family that has his wife (Kiran Juneja), his elder son Balwant(Ranveer Shourie), his second son Chirounjilal (Parvin Dabas) and his daughter. Chirounjilal works for an MNC and is trying hard to get out of the country and his elder brother Balwant is just another unemployed big-on-plans self-proclaimed genius.Boman Irani(Khurana) is a rich businessman who illegally takes possession of the plot of land that Khosla had bought for building his dream house. The estate agent who sold the plot to Khosla is a member of Khurana's team. The offer the agent makes on behalf of Khurana to Khosla is buying the plot at half the market value (the amount Khosla had already paid).The movie is very close to reality. Many such incidents take place in Delhi NCR. I myself have heard about many such cases which were common when Gurgaon was not as developed as it is now.Getting back to the movie, the rest of it shows how The Khoslas try to get back possession of their plot leaving no stone unturned and turn out to be successful too.All the actors starting from Anupam Kher and Boman Irani to Navin Nishchol and Parvin Dabas have performed very well. And not to forget the quick-witted one-liners by Ranveer Shourie that compel you to giggle even in a movie like this.",very close reality,when i first heard about movie khosla ka ghosla i thought it is yet another nonsensical comedy but now after seeing movie i feel that makers movie could have done even better had they not used current title i dont say that title is not apt movie but at first instance it gives totally different impression what movie is going be like than it actually is kamal kishore khosla anupam kher is just another head middle class family who spends his entire lifes earning buy plot delhi he wants build new house his family that has his wife kiran juneja his elder son balwant ranveer shourie his second son chirounjilal parvin dabas his daughter chirounjilal works mnc is trying hard get out country his elder brother balwant is just another unemployed big plans self proclaimed genius boman irani khurana is rich businessman who illegally takes possession plot land that khosla had bought building his dream house estate agent who sold plot khosla is member khuranas team offer agent makes behalf khurana khosla is buying plot at half market value amount khosla had already paid movie is very close reality many such incidents take place delhi ncr i myself have heard about many such cases which were common when gurgaon was not as developed as it is now getting back movie rest it shows how khoslas try get back possession their plot leaving no stone unturned turn out be successful too all actors starting anupam kher boman irani navin nishchol parvin dabas have performed very well not forget quick witted one liners by ranveer shourie that compel you giggle even movie like this,0.3791788856304985,0.09472140762463345,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,Bollywood at its BEST!!,"After Lageraho Munnabhai...Bollywood could not have got any better than...THIS. All along these years, we've been watching films that crawl without any story or soul...only effort going into them being a good make up in terms of ostentatious song and dance routines only to make it more sale-able. and all these years, even I've been watching all this. Appreciating some...sulking at others, craving for the movies as they were in times of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Sai Paranjape. Khosla Ka Ghosla comes straight out of that genre and sweeps you like gust of fresh air. Since most of you must be knowing the story, and for those who don't, they must be going and watching this at all cost, Khosla Ka Ghosla is one of the finest examples of storytelling in recent times. Every character is sketched out so immaculately that for even a second you can't say that you don't know this person in real life.An absolutely brilliant background score makes this movie a thorough joyride with the highs and troughs dealt with extreme intelligence.As for the performances, we know what Anupam Kher is capable of and Boman Irani is definitely a class apart. Navin Nischol, in spite of his personal troubles, makes a very impressive comeback. Kiron Juneja is very good.

It was a bit slow in the beginning but later on it turned out to be a nice informative flick. Had a pinch of romance also. The movie tells us how some people help you in your bad times and how some are the other way. Khosla's role (played by Anupem Kher) was finely played and he was entertaining as ever. As the title suggests, the movie revolves around how khosla's try to get back their home from a bad guy. They try all means from being straight and then finally how they manage with other means to get back their plot. You can compare the title even with 'Lage Raho Munnabhai'. The movie is also very inspiring. Khosla had two sons, both tried their ways of getting back the plot and how the one ( computer engineer from IITD ( i saw him wearing IIT-DELHI T-shirt) ) makes a plan along with one of his Visa granting chap to get their plot back. Earlier they tried police, social groups and also wrestlers but all in vain. Police and even social workers were also up for money.

8.0,Horrifying reality blended with fiction,"Khosla ka Ghonsla is a low-budget and simple yet admirable movie which is a realistic picture of the horrifying reality in Indian metros being faced by the middle class Indian people.Indian cities (and villages too) are the victims of many kinds of mafias, viz. the transport mafia, the tourism mafia, the extortion mafia, the kidnapping mafia and so on and so forth. Khosla Ka Ghonsla (Khosla's nest) is a movie which deals with the activities of land mafia which is neck-deep involved in usurping the land of middle and lower class, helpless people not able to resist their unlawful activities and save their land bought with their hard-earned money. It's a deservingly much acclaimed movie directed by Dibakar Banerjee.The story belongs to a salaried person, Mr. Khosla (Anupam Kher) who buys a plot with his life-long savings to build his own house, spacious enough to accommodate his whole family involving his wife, daughter and sons. But he is taken aback to find that his plot has been grabbed by a land-mafioso Khurana (Boman Irani) by muscle power. Now he is asked to pay a hefty sum to get his own plot vacated. And the more painful thing for him is that the law-enforcing agencies are also like the handmaids of the baddie; strengthening the hands of the wrongdoer, instead of ensuring justice to the victim. Thus poor Mr. Khosla, the victim of the unlawful deed, is further victimized by the law-enforcers who have sold their souls to the culprits. As Mr. Khosla's elder son is planning to migrate to US, leaving his family-members behind in India, Mr. Khosla is further depressed. However the son, Cherry (Parveen Dabaas), finally realizes the pain of his father and fortunately comes across Asif (Vinay Pathak) who is the ex-accomplice of Khurana. Asif shows him the way to con the conman. How the Khosla family, with the help of some actors (Navin Nischal and Nitish Pandey) and Cherry's girlfriend, Meghna (Tara Sharma) are able to swindle Khurana for a hefty sum and get its plot released from him by paying him his own money, forms the remaining part of the story.The story is very impressive and except the final sequences of the Khoslas' swindling Khurana, is utterly realistic. The emotions of a middle-class straightforward man, his simplicity and naiveness in dealing with the shrewd ones, his pain upon seeing his dreams shattered, the family bonds, the indifference of the young professional towards the feelings of his parents, everything is touchingly realistic and contributes in making this simple movie a winner all the way.Cinematic liberties have been taken for the sequences in the later part of the story. Conmen cannot be conned so easily as shown in the movie. Hence though the message of fighting the devil with fire, is exemplary; it makes the movie unreal on this count. I personally believe that rascals deserve to be dealt with by rascality only and while dealing with them, the good people should leave their goodness at least temporarily. However the way, it is shown is not realistic. It appears to be something told in the lighter vein and imposed on the narrative to lead the story to the desired climax. All the same, the efforts of the writer (Jaideep Sahni) and the director deserve high accolades. The narrative flows smoothly without any undue digression and keeps the audience tied to their seats. The title of the movie is also apt because own house is as dear and as coveted a thing to a middle class Indian as nest is to a bird.The performances are just excellent. The front-runner is definitely Anupam Kher who has given the performance of his lifetime, second only to Saaransh. Boman Irani is able to make the audience laugh even though he is in a negative role. All others including Parveen Dabaas, Tara Sharma, Ranvir Shourey, Kiran Juneja, Rupan Bajwa, Vinay Pathak, Naveen Nischal and Nitish Pandey have also done quite well.Music is according to the mood of the movie. Editing is good. Technically the movie is perfect. Dialogues are also impressive.Khosla Ka Ghonsla is not a comedy. In fact, it is a serious movie of the genre of the movies made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee in the seventies and the early eighties, providing light moments amidst the portrayal of the dark reality prevailing in the lives of the Indian middle class people. The middle class people in the Indian cities, managing through moderate salaries, can perceive this movie as a mirror of their lives.",horrifying reality blended with fiction,khosla ka ghonsla is low budget simple yet admirable movie which is realistic picture horrifying reality indian metros being faced by middle class indian people indian cities villages too are victims many kinds mafias viz transport mafia tourism mafia extortion mafia kidnapping mafia so so forth khosla ka ghonsla khoslas nest is movie which deals with activities land mafia which is neck deep involved usurping land middle lower class helpless people not able resist their unlawful activities save their land bought with their hard earned money its deservingly much acclaimed movie directed by dibakar banerjee story belongs salaried person mr khosla anupam kher who buys plot with his life long savings build his own house spacious enough accommodate his whole family involving his wife daughter sons but he is taken aback find that his plot has been grabbed by land mafioso khurana boman irani by muscle power now he is asked pay hefty sum get his own plot vacated more painful thing him is that law enforcing agencies are also like handmaids baddie strengthening hands wrongdoer instead ensuring justice victim thus poor mr khosla victim unlawful deed is further victimized by law enforcers who have sold their souls culprits as mr khoslas elder son is planning migrate us leaving his family members behind india mr khosla is further depressed however son cherry parveen dabaas finally realizes pain his father fortunately comes across asif vinay pathak who is ex accomplice khurana asif shows him way con conman how khosla family with help some actors navin nischal nitish pandey cherrys girlfriend meghna tara sharma are able swindle khurana hefty sum get its plot released him by paying him his own money forms remaining part story story is very impressive except final sequences khoslas swindling khurana is utterly realistic emotions middle class straightforward man his simplicity naiveness dealing with shrewd ones his pain upon seeing his dreams shattered family bonds indifference young professional towards feelings his parents everything is touchingly realistic contributes making this simple movie winner all way cinematic liberties have been taken sequences later part story conmen cannot be conned so easily as shown movie hence though message fighting devil with fire is exemplary it makes movie unreal this count i personally believe that rascals deserve be dealt with by rascality only while dealing with them good people should leave their goodness at least temporarily however way it is shown is not realistic it appears be something told lighter vein imposed narrative lead story desired climax all same efforts writer jaideep sahni director deserve high accolades narrative flows smoothly without any undue digression keeps audience tied their seats title movie is also apt because own house is as dear as coveted thing middle class indian as nest is bird performances are just excellent front runner is definitely anupam kher who has given performance his lifetime second only saaransh boman irani is able make audience laugh even though he is negative role all others including parveen dabaas tara sharma ranvir shourey kiran juneja rupan bajwa vinay pathak naveen nischal nitish pandey have also done quite well music is according mood movie editing is good technically movie is perfect dialogues are also impressive khosla ka ghonsla is not comedy fact it is serious movie genre movies made by hrishikesh mukherjee basu chatterjee seventies early eighties providing light moments amidst portrayal dark reality prevailing lives indian middle class people middle class people indian cities managing through moderate salaries can perceive this movie as mirror their lives,0.5072040816326531,0.12657142857142856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

A family as muddled and comic as most of our families are.The movie has awesome performances by two of the most versatile actors of the industry - Anupam Kher and Boman Irani, who lead the show. Equally good is Ranveer Shourey whose slightly haryanvi accent and matter-of-fact dialogue delivery sets him apart. Navin Nischol is a veteran who was a really good choice for the role. Tara Sharma is also quite well cast, though Koel Purie could have been a better choice.The things that strike you in the movie are the typical characters, the sarcastic humor, the realism and the wonderful Delhi feel that is hard to miss.

Khosla Ka Ghosla is one movie you could watch over and over again, in good times, in bad times, and in times which can't be categorized under either. This is just a movie for all seasons!Now, why would i dare appreciate a movie without giving a single reason? That's because this movie doesn't need a reason to be liked! And even if the critic in you strives to find a prominent reason, you'd be in riches! A near-flawless depiction of an urban Indian middle-class family leaves you amazed, and very much in splits. The mortals who've had a fortune to spend their childhoods in the lanes of our own Delhi will undoubtedly understand the otherwise some lost-in-translation jokes. But, do not be repelled by this statement, this movie is for all of us. The theme is extremely topical but dealt in a humorous manner by a debut director Dibakar Bannerjee. And by gollies! Does he deliver!The movie covers the chronicles of an average Indian family struggling to come in terms with a fact that their hard-earned land has been captured by a land-shark, and how they react in such a situation. The characters look so real and endearing that you could confuse them as one of your own distant uncles! Anupam Kher has played the typical 55-yr- old-man character before in ""Saaransh"" with utter perfection, and he does it again here with élan. Boman Irani has to be given a special mention for a mere fact that it's a tough job looking like an ostentatious Punjabi builder when you've been brought up as a Parsi all your life. And believe me, he could pass on as a Punjabi any given day of his life. All the other actors, namely, Ranvir Shorey, Kiran Juneja, Vinay Pathak, Parveen Dabbas, Naveen Nischol, Tara Sharma, etc. are wonderfully sketched out and believable. ""Believable"" being the key word here. The attention to detail is so strong that such a seemingly light comedy makes you observe novel mannerisms every time you watch it.

,"An Indian 'Indie'- A Brave, Smart Satire On The Hydra Of Indian Corruption","Mr. Khosla is an old-fashioned middle class paterfamilias. He lives in Delhi with his wife, daughter, his elder son, the disappointing Bunty, and his younger son and favourite, Cherry. Bunty is diffident, effete, and Cherry, though the apple in his father's eye, keeps a secret girlfriend, an actress, and is struggling to live up to his father's old-fashioned hopes.Mr. Khosla wants to build a new house where they can all live one day with their smaller families as a traditional extended family. He finds the capital in his life savings and buys the plot on which the new house will be built. Proud of his purchase, he takes his family to the plot only to find it has been taken over by the henchmen of a shady businessman, Mr. Khurana.This is the start of a nightmare journey for the old-fashioned Mr. Khosla, as he is kicked into the Twenty First Century and grey, but influential, areas of modern Indian society as he attempts, along with his family, to regain his rightful land against the hydra of Indian corruption. Along the way, Mr. Khosla must modernise, for good or bad, not only with regard to the problem with his property but also with regard to his family, in a riotous plot involving a strange mix of corrupt businessmen and policemen, lawyers, actors and even wrestlers.Khosla Ka Ghosla is a brave and smart satire, an Indian 'Indie', clearly inspired by American Independent Cinema, charming but cutting socio-political satires involving dysfunctional families, as evinced in the films of Alexander Payne, David O'Russell and Wes Anderson. However, what makes Khosla Ka Ghosla refreshing is its distinctly Indian feel, as it is rooted in a very Indian sense of reality. At the heart of satire is tragedy. And Khosla Ka Ghosla contains a pained indictment of India's tragically high levels of corruption practised by many insidious and dishonest, but powerful, con men who cloak themselves in the garbs of legitimate businessmen and adherents of Hinduism. The important message of Khosla Ka Ghosla is that these parasites denude Indian society of its essential, productive middle class, undermine galvanising middle class values and ethics, and thus hold back India's development.Khosla Ka Ghosla features energetic yet thoughtful performances all round, but special mention must be given to a wonderfully multi-layered central performance by veteran actor Anupam Kher. Kher exhibits with ease his wide range in drama and comedy. The film is directed with an assured verve by first-time director, Dibaker Bannerjee. The script shines with uproarious dialogue and vibrant, but also well-developed, characterisation. My only criticism is that the film's third act risks uprooting the hard sense of reality established in the first two acts. Still, the film's momentum is such that the sinuous plot is pulled off engagingly.Khosla Ka Ghosla is an Indian 'Indie'- a brave and smart satire on the Hydra of Indian corruption, and evidences the growing maturity of mainstream Indian cinema.",indian indie brave smart satire hydra indian corruption,mr khosla is old fashioned middle class paterfamilias he lives delhi with his wife daughter his elder son disappointing bunty his younger son favourite cherry bunty is diffident effete cherry though apple his fathers eye keeps secret girlfriend actress is struggling live up his fathers old fashioned hopes mr khosla wants build new house where they can all live one day with their smaller families as traditional extended family he finds capital his life savings buys plot which new house will be built proud his purchase he takes his family plot only find it has been taken over by henchmen shady businessman mr khurana this is start nightmare journey old fashioned mr khosla as he is kicked into twenty first century grey but influential areas modern indian society as he attempts along with his family regain his rightful land against hydra indian corruption along way mr khosla must modernise good or bad not only with regard problem with his property but also with regard his family riotous plot involving strange mix corrupt businessmen policemen lawyers actors even wrestlers khosla ka ghosla is brave smart satire indian indie clearly inspired by american independent cinema charming but cutting socio political satires involving dysfunctional families as evinced films alexander payne david orussell wes anderson however what makes khosla ka ghosla refreshing is its distinctly indian feel as it is rooted very indian sense reality at heart satire is tragedy khosla ka ghosla contains pained indictment indias tragically high levels corruption practised by many insidious dishonest but powerful con men who cloak themselves garbs legitimate businessmen adherents hinduism important message khosla ka ghosla is that these parasites denude indian society its essential productive middle class undermine galvanising middle class values ethics thus hold back indias development khosla ka ghosla features energetic yet thoughtful performances all round but special mention must be given wonderfully multi layered central performance by veteran actor anupam kher kher exhibits with ease his wide range drama comedy film is directed with assured verve by first time director dibaker bannerjee script shines with uproarious dialogue vibrant but also well developed characterisation my only criticism is that films third act risks uprooting hard sense reality established first two acts still films momentum is such that sinuous plot is pulled off engagingly khosla ka ghosla is indian indie brave smart satire hydra indian corruption evidences growing maturity mainstream indian cinema,0.4767727272727273,0.11972077922077923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,one of the year's best!,"Everyone dreams of owning their dream home, but for a middle class family in Delhi the dream is almost at the point of achieving when it is rudely shattered. Mr. Khosla (Anupam Kher) sinks all his life savings into buying a plot of land in South Delhi. Then the nightmare starts, the plot is occupied by an unscrupulous wheeler dealer (Boman Irani) and the Kholsas are left to either re-buy the land or abandon all thoughts of owning it. Throw into this mix the Khosla children, the 'healthy' daughter Nikki (Rupam Bajwa), the serious computer engineer son Cherry (Pravin Dabas), and the no good son Bunty (Ranbir Shorey), the engineer's girlfriend Meghna (Tara Sharma), and a theatrical troupe (led by Navin Nischol as Bapu and Nitish Pandey as his secretary), and several others. The mixture is stirred and a fabulous concoction emerges! The Khoslas' attempts to win back their land begin with the surreal ""Jai Bajrang Bali"" wrestler gang and end with a crafty scheme the execution of which is worth the cost of your ticket money.The movie begins as a sort of comedy but turns into a scathing commentary on the law and order and socio-political situation in the capital. As the Khoslas run from pillar to post to get justice, the seamy side of the politicians and the public servants is slowly revealed. The movie shows us that not all con men (and women) live in lavish farmhouses and wear slick clothes and dark glasses! The acting is superb - Anupam Kher and Boman Irani vie for top acting honors with excellent performances, every one else is very good but I particularly liked Navin Nischol as Bapu - the superb actor but naive man. The setting is authentic, Delhi and its surroundings are chaotic and very real. The ending is not particularly authentic, but it does give you a sense of hope in this movie that otherwise is best thought of as a sad commentary on the situation in the homeland.It deserves top marks - for me only two things jarred a bit. Anupam Kher's morning ablutions were sort of 'railway station third class waiting room' like but the rest of his persona was that of a semi-sophisticate. Meghna had a strange accent that one would associate with a non-native Hindi speaker, but I did like her acting and character otherwise.All in all this is excellent fare - and it is a must watch!",one years best,everyone dreams owning their dream home but middle class family delhi dream is almost at point achieving when it is rudely shattered mr khosla anupam kher sinks all his life savings into buying plot land south delhi then nightmare starts plot is occupied by unscrupulous wheeler dealer boman irani kholsas are left either re buy land or abandon all thoughts owning it throw into this mix khosla children healthy daughter nikki rupam bajwa serious computer engineer son cherry pravin dabas no good son bunty ranbir shorey engineers girlfriend meghna tara sharma theatrical troupe led by navin nischol as bapu nitish pandey as his secretary several others mixture is stirred fabulous concoction emerges khoslas attempts win back their land begin with surreal jai bajrang bali wrestler gang end with crafty scheme execution which is worth cost your ticket money movie begins as sort comedy but turns into scathing commentary law order socio political situation capital as khoslas run pillar post get justice seamy side politicians public servants is slowly revealed movie shows us that not all con men women live lavish farmhouses wear slick clothes dark glasses acting is superb anupam kher boman irani vie top acting honors with excellent performances every one else is very good but i particularly liked navin nischol as bapu superb actor but naive man setting is authentic delhi its surroundings are chaotic very real ending is not particularly authentic but it does give you sense hope this movie that otherwise is best thought as sad commentary situation homeland it deserves top marks me only two things jarred bit anupam khers morning ablutions were sort railway station third class waiting room like but rest his persona was that semi sophisticate meghna had strange accent that one would associate with non native hindi speaker but i did like her acting character otherwise all all this is excellent fare it is must watch,0.4843798449612403,0.1993727977448908,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.39}"

7.0,Strikingly heartfelt......Wonderfully enacted,"This film belongs to Anupam Kher. Such is his performance, that one feels anger, pity, sorrow and hatred alongside him. He creates sheer magic with his character (a meek, hardworking 50-something father of three) and nurtures it to what is befittingly a happy end.Khosla ka Ghosla is a quick witted, light hearted comedy/drama that has kept up to the potential of its star cast. Boman Irani (fresh of the success of Munnabhai) delivers yet another masterpiece. You try not to hate his character, but fail on every count. The surprise package of the film has to be Ranvir Shorey.

Parvin Dabbas and Tara Sharma have quick sharp performances. As I mentioned, you really can't fault the star cast.If there is a downside to the film, it has to be in its appeal to the masses.

8.0,A Superb Comic Thriller,"According to me, there are two genres of comedy... One is artificially injected with crazy jokes that intend to make you smile, and the other is simple everyday dialogues and sequences which have no such intention, but... you end up laughing like hell! Khosla Ka Ghosla (literally Khosla's Nest!) is one such pure entertainment that can liven up even the dull-est of the souls. From frame one, the ""action"" begins and next two hours you just wont let anything disturb you watching it.Khosla (Anupam Kher) has saved every penny he earned in his life for building a dream home on a newly purchase plot at South Delhi. Just as everything seems set for a ground breaking ceremony, a powerful builder, Khurana (Boman Irani) encroaches the plot and shatters all his dreams.How the motley crew of his family and their friends help Khosla finally realize his dreams, forms the rest of the story. The ""plot"" develops in such a thrilling manner that there are moments you would actually pray for Khosla's mission team.Casting is perfect. Apart from great performances by veterans like Anupam Kher, Boman Irani and Navin Nischol, you will enjoy even the characters played by off-beat actors like Ranvir Shorey (Frankly I didn't knew he can act so well), Parvin Dabas, Nitish Pandey and Vinay Pathak.I would call it ""A Superb Comic Thriller"".

7.0,Watch it if you love Delhi,"This movie showcases middle-class Delhi beautifully, with all its good and bad points shown with a bucketful of humour. The great thing about the humour is that it is situational / dialogue driven with no slapstick comedy for easy laughs.Also, there is a sense of realism in the movie, nothing shown is beyond the realms of possibility. Especially in the first half, there are moments when you squirm in your seat, wondering 'Shit, this could be happening to me!' I really wonder though, how someone who has not lived in delhi would relate to the movie ? having said that, i'm sure most people will leave the cinema hall with a smile on their faces ! for more of my reviews read apurvbollywood, available on blogspot",watch it if you love delhi,this movie showcases middle class delhi beautifully with all its good bad points shown with bucketful humour great thing about humour is that it is situational dialogue driven with no slapstick comedy easy laughs also there is sense realism movie nothing shown is beyond realms possibility especially first half there are moments when you squirm your seat wondering shit this could be happening me i really wonder though how someone who has not lived delhi would relate movie having said that im sure most people will leave cinema hall with smile their faces more my reviews read apurvbollywood available blogspot,0.5420138888888889,0.31979166666666675,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,Brilliantly enacted,"'Khosla Ka Ghosla' should be undoubtedly one of the best bollywood movies made in recent times. The movie revolves around a very realistic plot and depicts the dreams, anxieties and helplessness of the common man. I truly believe, these are the kind of films that ought to be made more often in bollywood. The kind which reflect on everyday life and make you think while having a good laugh. Running around trees and the alps does nobody no good. The biggest plus for the movie was that all the actors could actually act ( no irritating star kids in this one ), each and every character in the movie can be related to very easily. Kudos to the director and all the actors. Ranbir Shourie in particular was hilarious. I always liked his sense of humor when he was a DJ but, he has taken it up a notch with this one. This one is a must watch.",brilliantly enacted,khosla ka ghosla should be undoubtedly one best bollywood movies made recent times movie revolves around very realistic plot depicts dreams anxieties helplessness common man i truly believe these are kind films that ought be made more often bollywood kind which reflect everyday life make you think while having good laugh running around trees alps does nobody no good biggest plus movie was that all actors could actually act no irritating star kids this one each every character movie can be related very easily kudos director all actors ranbir shourie particular was hilarious i always liked his sense humor when he was dj but he has taken it up notch with this one this one is must watch,0.5850877192982455,0.3156140350877193,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.21}"

5.0,Can't get over the hype.,"The director tried to make a comedy which looks realistic, but has elements of drama as well. I would call it a good attempt, but It didn't appeal to me. First problem with this is that it's not funny. Secondly, giving realistic touch to an old storyline doesn't make it new. It is the same old drama with a new look. Somewhat better, but how it got an 8.3 is a mystery.",cant get over hype,director tried make comedy which looks realistic but has elements drama as well i would call it good attempt but it didnt appeal me first problem with this is that its not funny secondly giving realistic touch old storyline doesnt make it new it is same old drama with new look somewhat better but how it got 8 3 is mystery,0.3778409090909091,0.17758838383838385,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8.0,good non-vulgar comedy,"Its a good, clean movie, which can be watched with family. In recent days there are very few such non-vulgar comedy movies in Hindi. Because of which the success of this movie is really appreciable. Story line is very simple. Mr. Khosla (Anupam Kher) bought some land with his retirement money and found that he has been cheated by Khurana (Boman Irani) a powerful and rich builder. He tried to get his land back with all the legal efforts but found that he is not going to get any help from corrupt system. He gave up the fight after police captured him. Finally his oldest son who was about to settle in New York comes to his rescue. He and his girlfriend, who is working in acting school makes a plan to cheat and get money from Khurana. What happens then is what you have to see by yourself. The movie puts a very good light on the corrupt system, as well as, the position of youth of India. The eldest son Chirotilal is a good symbol of all those software developers, who wants to leave India for better career, but are still held here, due to their duties towards parents. The movie as other Bollywood movies, also feature love, family drama. But the main theme comedy is there till end. All the actors have done their best. Songs though not much are good to listen, and did not make us bore. Overall, its a good movie, which can be watched in family.",good non vulgar comedy,its good clean movie which can be watched with family recent days there are very few such non vulgar comedy movies hindi because which success this movie is really appreciable story line is very simple mr khosla anupam kher bought some land with his retirement money found that he has been cheated by khurana boman irani powerful rich builder he tried get his land back with all legal efforts but found that he is not going get any help corrupt system he gave up fight after police captured him finally his oldest son who was about settle new york comes his rescue he his girlfriend who is working acting school makes plan cheat get money khurana what happens then is what you have see by yourself movie puts very good light corrupt system as well as position youth india eldest son chirotilal is good symbol all those software developers who wants leave india better career but are still held here due their duties towards parents movie as other bollywood movies also feature love family drama but main theme comedy is there till end all actors have done their best songs though not much are good listen did not make us bore overall its good movie which can be watched family,0.48565189712248535,0.17778520499108735,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,It can't get better than this...,"Recently watched this movie and was totally blown away by the simplicity of it. Is it so difficult to make a movie with a tight script, good character building and great acting. After watching KKG, it seems so easy. There is nothing which gives out that this is a Bollywood product. No great locations (Yashraj style), no designer clothes (Johar style), no melodrama (Barjatya style), but still more than managed to hold the viewer's attention.But then what else do you expect from a movie with real 'actors' like Anupam Kher, Boman Irani and not to forget, Navin Nischol. I won't go into the script, but it suffices to say that only once in a while do we get to see movie with a middle class man at its center. And then again, he is not a young, college going kid, who falls in love with a girl, but (gasp) a retired employee, who dreams to build his own house. How frequently do we get to see films with characters we can relate to? KKG breaks the typical Bollywood mould in many ways. Just watch it to believe that there are still some good thinkers and creators left in the industry.",it cant get better than this,recently watched this movie was totally blown away by simplicity it is it so difficult make movie with tight script good character building great acting after watching kkg it seems so easy there is nothing which gives out that this is bollywood product no great locations yashraj style no designer clothes johar style no melodrama barjatya style but still more than managed hold viewers attention but then what else do you expect movie with real actors like anupam kher boman irani not forget navin nischol i wont go into script but it suffices say that only once while do we get see movie with middle class man at its center then again he is not young college going kid who falls love with girl but gasp retired employee who dreams build his own house how frequently do we get see films with characters we can relate kkg breaks typical bollywood mould many ways just watch it believe that there are still some good thinkers creators left industry,0.4882936507936508,0.17867063492063495,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.28}"
