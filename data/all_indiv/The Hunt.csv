9.0,The scary thing is that this could happen to almost anyone...,"One of my favorite foreign language films it Thomas Vinterberg's ""The Celebration"" (""Festen""). It's an absorbing tale about sexual abuse--abuse that comes out during a birthday party for a beloved family patriarch. Now, with ""The Hunt"" (""Jagten""), Vinterberg directs a film where quite the opposite happens--a man is accused of sexual abuse but who is 100% innocent. Had the director always done films denying sexual abuse, folks might have thought him strange but here the brave director allows himself to go in a completely different direction with his movie.In his film, Mads Mikkelsen plays Lucas, a divorced father who works at a kindergarten. He seems like a genuinely nice man and is trying to get his life together. He has a new girlfriend, his son wants to come live with him and he has no reason to expect what happens. A very young girl is shown some pornographic material by some older boys and later in passing she tells another teacher that she has seen Lucas' penis when she actually didn't. Some folks investigate and ask leading questions--and suddenly there is a bit of hysteria as the community assumes Lucas is guilty--even his so-called friends. And, no matter what he does, he cannot PROVE he never did anything.So is the film any good? Well, based on it now being on IMDb's Top 250 list (at number 133), it's obvious a lot of folks loved the film. With a current score of 8.3, it's not at all surprising it would be nominated for the Oscar. As for me, I thought the film was terrific and thought-provoking. It made its point very well by using VERY vivid scenes involving the community literally tormenting Lucas. You can't help but feel affected by the drama--thanks to the script by Tobias Lindholm and Thomas Vinterberg himself.I did have one problem with the film--and this is why I didn't score it a 10. Although I think such a theme is great stuff for older kids and teens to watch with their folks, there are a few graphic scenes that were unnecessary for the film and which would probably make many of these parents not show the movie to their families. I think the kids need to see the violence against Lucas but the sex scene and photo weren't really needed in the film. A very light trimming would have made this a great film for ages 12 and older. Now, because it's rated R in the US, it's unlikely these younger viewers would get to see it. This film needs to be seen by a wide audience as it's very, very well made and worth seeing.By the way, in many ways, this film is like a dramatization of what occurred in the very famous McMartin Pre-School case here in America. Apparently, some very unqualified interviewers screwed up a case and soon had half the school accused of sexual abuse. Some of the stories they reported were downright insane (such as their victimizers being able to fly). Many folks were prosecuted and only later did folks realize what had occurred--a serious rush to judgment. And, as there was no real proof, the accused were all acquitted--but only after years and years of investigations and trials. And, in one case, one of the accused spent five years in jail despite no ultimate conviction.Also, if you are curious about me, I used to work with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators as a therapist. I am NOT minimizing sexual abuse claims in my review of the film. Too many women are ignored or treated like dirt when they are victims--I've seen this myself. It's just the unqualified and irresponsible interviews with very small children that bothers me. I've worked with many folks in the field and saw that most interviewers (at least back in the 1980s and 90s) were woefully untrained and potentially dangerous because of this.",scary thing is that this could happen almost anyone,one my favorite foreign language films it thomas vinterbergs celebration festen its absorbing tale about sexual abuse abuse that comes out during birthday party beloved family patriarch now with hunt jagten vinterberg directs film where quite opposite happens man is accused sexual abuse but who is 100 innocent had director always done films denying sexual abuse folks might have thought him strange but here brave director allows himself go completely different direction with his movie his film mads mikkelsen plays lucas divorced father who works at kindergarten he seems like genuinely nice man is trying get his life together he has new girlfriend his son wants come live with him he has no reason expect what happens very young girl is shown some pornographic material by some older boys later passing she tells another teacher that she has seen lucas penis when she actually didnt some folks investigate ask leading questions suddenly there is bit hysteria as community assumes lucas is guilty even his so called friends no matter what he does he cannot prove he never did anything so is film any good well based it now being imdbs top 250 list at number 133 its obvious lot folks loved film with current score 8 3 its not at all surprising it would be nominated oscar as me i thought film was terrific thought provoking it made its point very well by using very vivid scenes involving community literally tormenting lucas you cant help but feel affected by drama thanks script by tobias lindholm thomas vinterberg himself i did have one problem with film this is why i didnt score it 10 although i think such theme is great stuff older kids teens watch with their folks there are few graphic scenes that were unnecessary film which would probably make many these parents not show movie their families i think kids need see violence against lucas but sex scene photo werent really needed film very light trimming would have made this great film ages 12 older now because its rated r us its unlikely these younger viewers would get see it this film needs be seen by wide audience as its very very well made worth seeing by way many ways this film is like dramatization what occurred very famous mcmartin pre school case here america apparently some very unqualified interviewers screwed up case soon had half school accused sexual abuse some stories they reported were downright insane such as their victimizers being able fly many folks were prosecuted only later did folks realize what had occurred serious rush judgment as there was no real proof accused were all acquitted but only after years years investigations trials one case one accused spent five years jail despite no ultimate conviction also if you are curious about me i used work with sexual abuse victims perpetrators as therapist i am not minimizing sexual abuse claims my review film too many women are ignored or treated like dirt when they are victims ive seen this myself its just unqualified irresponsible interviews with very small children that bothers me ive worked with many folks field saw that most interviewers at least back 1980s 90s were woefully untrained potentially dangerous because this,0.55260101010101,0.16852855477855483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,"Emotionally draining but truly moving ""ripped from the headlines"" story","""The Hunt"" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.To delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I'll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I'll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.This is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen's delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won't be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp's portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she's in.The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children's emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.This is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund's score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer's imagination, which chill to the bone.Hollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn't matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.""The Hunt"" was easily the saddest film I've seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It's a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that's both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.It was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but ""The Hunt"" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I've ever seen and one of the best of 2012.",emotionally draining but truly moving ripped headlines story,hunt is latest unflinching drama danish auteur thomas vinterberg co written with tobias lindholm this is ambitious star vehicle legendary actor mads mikkelsen icon denmark familiar face around world as well he plays lucas small town kindergarten teacher at its heart story is ultimately powerful comment prejudice based true incidents that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved delve into plot here would reveal too much so ill just say that film is quite dark deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard watch at times ill leave it you decide if you want be more aware details by looking up basic synopsis this is essentially one man show while supporting cast members are all up challenge lucas is screen virtually every moment movie its overall success rises or falls his believability mikkelsens delicately underplayed characterization man under fire likely wont be appreciated or understood by all viewers his restrained performance is remarkable does much make hunt haunting memorable experience among children annika wedderkopps portrayal klara is frighteningly brilliant she steals every scene shes physical beauty production belies ugliness beneath natural lighting is used match heights depths kindergarten childrens emotions their innocence is reflected its intensity when surrounded by love they are glowing color palette is warm inviting as fear rises they appear shadow tableau turns increasingly darker as narrative does this is very quiet thoughtful experience many ways nikolaj egelunds score is sparse editors janus billeskov jansen anne sterud keep pace measured deliberate focus is story long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said eyes faces lucas kids townsfolk cinematographer charlotte bruus christensen allows lush landscape danish countryside lull viewer into sense peace contrast with turmoil just under surface ready jump out like demon horror film but these are real life nightmares not product genre writers imagination which chill bone hollywood could never touch this subject have anywhere near impact backed independently by swedish danish production companies director vinterberg actually intended set shoot picture canada but better tax incentives financing led him back his native country denmark it doesnt matter though this is kind isolated little village that can be found anywhere world hunt was easily saddest film ive seen all year but cathartic way that only great work art can accomplish its gritty hard hitting statement our judgmental society that pulls no punches its recounting controversial ripped headlines story repeated all too often recent history thats both poignant polarizing its authenticity it was difficult me hold back tears during screening i broke down several times many will be touched by certain scenes more than others but hunt is one most affecting emotional films ive ever seen one best 2012,0.523657119852772,0.16196227283183806,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,A film for those who stupidly believe there's no smoke without fire.,"Sometimes children lie. Sometimes good people give in to hysteria, and lose all sense of reason. Sometimes they destroy innocent lives. The Hunt (aka Jagten) is the latest offering from Denmark that will knock you sideways. Forget the thrill of TV dramas The Killing, Borgen and The Bridge, Thomas Vinterberg's film is a shocking, harrowing experience that will affect you profoundly and will live in your mind for a very long time. The Hunt is for those who don't need to 'enjoy' a film to regard it as valid and who are not afraid to step into the darkness of the injustice and judgment of which we are all capable. More than that, it is a film for those who stupidly believe there is no smoke without fire. Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a lonely teacher, divorced from his wife, kept apart from his son and devoted to the young children in his care at the nursery and within the community. He is a genuinely good man who has earned the respect of his peers, the love of a new girlfriend and the trust of the children who leap out of hedges to wrestle him and be chased around the playground by him. Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) has an innocent, childish crush on Lucas when two situations occur in quick succession. Firstly she is exposed to an explicit pornographic image and, secondly, Lucas gently chastises her for inappropriate behavior towards him. With a fertile imagination, childish indignation and no comprehension of the consequences, Klara makes an accusation against Lucas and his world implodes. For only the fifth time so far this year, I believe I have witnessed a near-perfect film. The Hunt is complete due to the tight screenplay, the sensitivity of Vinterberg's direction and the performances from principal and peripheral actors alike that are always absorbing and frequently astounding. Mikkelsen must certainly be the focal point of any review. His performance as Lucas causes the stomach to tighten and the back tingle as we wonder How would I react? In much the same way that Colin Firth's George crumpled when receiving the news of his partner's death in A Single Man, so Mikkelsen's Lucas is silently crushed as he is told that accusations have been made. Lucas suffers the physical and emotional wounds of slander and revenge for an act he cannot conceive and of which he has less knowledge than those who condemn and attack him. Equally, both Larsen and Anne Louise Hassing as Klara's parents carefully unwrap the turmoil any parent would suffer upon hearing their young child has suffered sexual abuse. It is a challenge not to yell at the screen ""Don't be so stupid,"" or to scream expletives at Grethe (Susse Wold) the head teacher who loses her grip on both duty and reason and germinates the hatred and judgment that follow. As Lucas' son, Marcus, Lasse Fogelstrøm gives a heartfelt performance segueing seamlessly from courage to hurt to desperation and anger and his distress is a warning to those given over to rumours. The surprise, no, the absolute shock, with the casting is Wedderkopp. In an adult with twenty years experience on the big screen it would be a breathtaking performance; that this is the debut of a young child is staggering. She is entirely believable as the girl with the vivid imagination and understandable lack of foresight who is lead by over-enthusiastic adults and suffers her own punishment of confusion alone. The tragedy within The Hunt is explicit and unavoidable. The external tragedy is that it will probably not feature on most To See lists because it is both foreign and that the explosions are emotional rather than physical. Although it is Denmark's entry for Best Film in a Foreign Language for the Oscars, I suspect both Mikkelsen and Vinterbeg will be completely overlooked in their own right as with the principals of Beasts of the Southern Wild. Thank goodness for the BAFTAS and Mark Kermode! The events depicted in The Hunt are utterly horrific. Don't sit in front of the screen expecting a light, easy, thought provoking flick. I emerged numb, angry, helpless and terrified. But for one careless or cruel comment, it could happen to me.

8.0,Once Again: The Children's Hour,"Having worked as a teacher for some forty years, I knew deep down inside that a vindictive lie from one student (out of thousands that I had) could take me down in a minute. People are so protective of their children (as they should be) that sometimes they fail to see that they are children with an underdeveloped moral code and a tendency toward impulsiveness and peer pressure. They are sometimes motivated by their own interests and by temper. Unfortunately, parents tend to give them credence when they tell outlandish things. I even felt that tug with my own children, but learned to investigate the story before reacting. Often a simple comment meant a teacher ""hated"" them, or some series events was made to seem much more than it was. Of course, I believe we must be very careful to keep our children's trust and support them when necessary. The people in this movie don't do this and send a man to hell and back. A dear friend of mine spent six months in jail, accused by his daughter of molestation. She finally admitted that she got made because he wouldn't allow her to go out on a school night with her boyfriend. This movie is gut wrenching and real and it happens all the time.

,Classy and disturbing tale of small town injustice.,"In Thomas Vinterberg's superb psychological thriller, The Hunt, a town turns on its kindergarten teacher, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), from the erroneous testimony of a little girl, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), who accuses him of molesting her. She's also the daughter of his best friend, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), who believes along with the town that Lucas is guilty because children, especially his daughter, don't lie. Although Klara claims throughout she said a stupid thing and Lucas did nothing, his parents are convinced she is just reacting to the gravity and changing her story. Tragic blindness is not just the province of Oedipus.The film's title, with bookending male hunting rituals, is obviously figurative for the hunt by the town's people for Lucas's well being. Only too swift is their condemnation, their righteous indignation, blinded by Salem-witch like certainty that he is guilty. The town's vigilante-like attitude is reminiscent of Frankenstein's townsfolk, hounding the monster without even trying to understand.Beyond the figurative display of crowd wrong-headed mentality is the disturbing suggestion that at any time a life can be turned upside down without even being responsible. It also suggests that the only antidote is to keep believing in yourself.Maybe more powerful is a sense of humor, which occurs occasionally in the film and is best exemplified when a friend, upon Lucas's return from police headquarters, shouts as Lucas embraces his son, ""Hey! If you fondle your kid, you'll go back to jail."" It's gallows humor, but it is effective. Just as effective as the ironic humor is the low-key, natural lighting, consistent close-ups, and ubiquitous hand-held camera work. It is an intimate business that closes in on everyone in the town, not just the innocent victim.Having witnessed through this intense work of art the vulnerability all have in the face of a crowd mentality, we should remember the Chorus's final warning in Oedipus Rex: ""Therefore wait to see life's ending ere thou count one mortal blest; Wait till free from pain and sorrow he has gained his final rest.""",classy disturbing tale small town injustice,thomas vinterbergs superb psychological thriller hunt town turns its kindergarten teacher lucas mads mikkelsen erroneous testimony little girl klara annika wedderkopp who accuses him molesting her shes also daughter his best friend theo thomas bo larsen who believes along with town that lucas is guilty because children especially his daughter dont lie although klara claims throughout she said stupid thing lucas did nothing his parents are convinced she is just reacting gravity changing her story tragic blindness is not just province oedipus films title with bookending male hunting rituals is obviously figurative hunt by towns people lucass well being only too swift is their condemnation their righteous indignation blinded by salem witch like certainty that he is guilty towns vigilante like attitude is reminiscent frankensteins townsfolk hounding monster without even trying understand beyond figurative display crowd wrong headed mentality is disturbing suggestion that at any time life can be turned upside down without even being responsible it also suggests that only antidote is keep believing yourself maybe more powerful is sense humor which occurs occasionally film is best exemplified when friend upon lucass return police headquarters shouts as lucas embraces his son hey if you fondle your kid youll go back jail its gallows humor but it is effective just as effective as ironic humor is low key natural lighting consistent close ups ubiquitous hand held camera work it is intimate business that closes everyone town not just innocent victim having witnessed through this intense work art vulnerability all have face crowd mentality we should remember choruss final warning oedipus rex therefore wait see lifes ending ere thou count one mortal blest wait till free pain sorrow he has gained his final rest,0.631283068783069,0.04361772486772487,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,excellent drama that is tough to watch,"The thing about Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt that you should know is that there's no ""twist"" or big revelation. There's no real ambiguity about whether or not Lucas touched or 'showed' himself to little Klara, the daughter of Lucas' best friend. If there were, this might be a very different movie - perhaps even one that leaned on being dishonest with the audience about the 'did he or didn't he' intentions. It's clear enough early on that Klara isn't telling the whole truth when she mentions to one of the other Kindergarten workers about the ""rod"" that stands up (meaning the penis), but it doesn't mean she's exactly lying either, just confused in that way that little kids who don't know anything about sex might be if, say, shown a very brief image of a ""rod"". So there's that. But what The Hunt is really about is perception and how quickly people can turn on someone with a target on them - guilt or no guilt, but especially in the case of not guilty - like with Lucas.Vinterberg expertly sets up this problem by first showing life as (relatively) normal - Lucas is a father in the process of a divorce, has a great group of guy friends (the kind of Denmark/Sweden/etc who come together, sometimes swim naked in the cold, and drink a lot and sing), and is a teacher at a Kindergarten school. Nothing is shown with any heightened drama, all the cuts to someone in a moment are to show the progression of a moment or a scene - closer to documentary than anything, at least at first - and this helps make the mood past any melodrama for what's to come. Or, if there may be melodrama ahead, it won't be circumspect for the audience: real families in a small town, really close-knit, Church-going, loving, pleasant... and underneath is a whole lot of fear, which can switch to anger, resentment, and horror.Mikkelson is great in the role, and he may be surprising for those who haven't seen him as a villain in other films (he was a Bond villain once, or if he wasn't he will be someday), as well as the title role of Hannibal Lector on the recent TV series. I haven't seen that show yet, but even if I had it wouldn't change how he works in this film. Could there be any hint in his performance of any evil or misdeeds capable of him? Not far as we can see, though there is that scene where Lucas is first brought in to his superior's office and told of the accusation made. Watch his body language, how his face looks and reacts to this. It could look either way - for the person looking for it, he smacks his lips, he quivers just slightly, he doesn't come out and say 'I didn't do it', but we should know that he didn't. But does the other character know? With something like child molestation? The topic is so hot-button, whether it's more in the United States or over in Denmark I can't tell, but the safety (and reliability) of a child is such a crucial thing in daily life that it makes for such powerful, potent stuff for The Hunt, as the accusation spirals out - are there other kids(!) just by nightmares and headaches who can tell - and ruins his life, whether he's found guilty or (especially) not. The last act especially is tough to watch as morality is questioned and the mob mentality of a town takes over (not to extreme heights, this isn't Fritz Lang or something, but close enough, realistically enough, just with all those faces).Quiet scenes punctuate a lot of this film, as much as the brutal ones where rage and bewilderment overflow, like shots of someone having to do something tragic in the rain, and it all builds up to something that is hard to watch. I mean that as a compliment, though it should be said that this is the kind of film I'm not sure I can watch very soon again: it strikes such resonant chords and presents its characters so honestly, the ones looking for grace and those who just cannot, that it's hard not to feel shaken up after it.",excellent drama that is tough watch,thing about thomas vinterbergs hunt that you should know is that theres no twist or big revelation theres no real ambiguity about whether or not lucas touched or showed himself little klara daughter lucas best friend if there were this might be very different movie perhaps even one that leaned being dishonest with audience about did he or didnt he intentions its clear enough early that klara isnt telling whole truth when she mentions one other kindergarten workers about rod that stands up meaning penis but it doesnt mean shes exactly lying either just confused that way that little kids who dont know anything about sex might be if say shown very brief image rod so theres that but what hunt is really about is perception how quickly people can turn someone with target them guilt or no guilt but especially case not guilty like with lucas vinterberg expertly sets up this problem by first showing life as relatively normal lucas is father process divorce has great group guy friends kind denmark sweden etc who come together sometimes swim naked cold drink lot sing is teacher at kindergarten school nothing is shown with any heightened drama all cuts someone moment are show progression moment or scene closer documentary than anything at least at first this helps make mood past any melodrama whats come or if there may be melodrama ahead it wont be circumspect audience real families small town really close knit church going loving pleasant underneath is whole lot fear which can switch anger resentment horror mikkelson is great role he may be surprising those who havent seen him as villain other films he was bond villain once or if he wasnt he will be someday as well as title role hannibal lector recent tv series i havent seen that show yet but even if i had it wouldnt change how he works this film could there be any hint his performance any evil or misdeeds capable him not far as we can see though there is that scene where lucas is first brought his superiors office told accusation made watch his body language how his face looks reacts this it could look either way person looking it he smacks his lips he quivers just slightly he doesnt come out say i didnt do it but we should know that he didnt but does other character know with something like child molestation topic is so hot button whether its more united states or over denmark i cant tell but safety reliability child is such crucial thing daily life that it makes such powerful potent stuff hunt as accusation spirals out are there other kids just by nightmares headaches who can tell ruins his life whether hes found guilty or especially not last act especially is tough watch as morality is questioned mob mentality town takes over not extreme heights this isnt fritz lang or something but close enough realistically enough just with all those faces quiet scenes punctuate lot this film as much as brutal ones where rage bewilderment overflow like shots someone having do something tragic rain it all builds up something that is hard watch i mean that as compliment though it should be said that this is kind film im not sure i can watch very soon again it strikes such resonant chords presents its characters so honestly ones looking grace those who just cannot that its hard not feel shaken up after it,0.5439387464387462,0.02419871794871796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,"""He hasn't done anything. I just said something stupid.""","Stories like this are frightening, especially when it turns out that the accused child abuser is innocent and winds up with his life utterly destroyed. This one turns out to be a classic case of someone being guilty until proved innocent, and by then, the damage has already been done. And in today's world, the type of scenario presented in the film treads on a slippery slope. After young Klara makes her thoughtless statement to the teacher Grethe (Susse Wold), one can't find fault in the actions taken by her and other persons in a position of authority.I did have a problem with the gentleman called in by Grethe for the initial questioning of Klara, he presented what sounded like a series of leading questions that presumed Lucas's (Mads Mikkelsen) guilt in the matter at hand. What follows is a damning indictment of someone who up till then had been a model citizen confronting his own personal life situation which wasn't altogether a happy one. One tends to lose sight of the title of this picture while watching. ""The Hunt"" sounds like it might have some application to Lucas's plight, in that he's being pursued or 'hunted' for something he didn't do. However the film ends with an actual deer hunt as the occasion of Lucas's son coming of age and getting his own hunting license and a rifle passed down through the family. That potshot taken at Lucas at the very end was delivered as a reminder that Lucas was not entirely exonerated in the eyes of someone or some faction in the community, and that he would have to keep a constant watch over his shoulder. It's a maddening way to live as the result of an immature indiscretion.",he hasnt done anything i just said something stupid,stories like this are frightening especially when it turns out that accused child abuser is innocent winds up with his life utterly destroyed this one turns out be classic case someone being guilty until proved innocent by then damage has already been done todays world type scenario presented film treads slippery slope after young klara makes her thoughtless statement teacher grethe susse wold one cant find fault actions taken by her other persons position authority i did have problem with gentleman called by grethe initial questioning klara he presented what sounded like series leading questions that presumed lucass mads mikkelsen guilt matter at hand what follows is damning indictment someone who up till then had been model citizen confronting his own personal life situation which wasnt altogether happy one one tends lose sight title this picture while watching hunt sounds like it might have some application lucass plight that hes being pursued or hunted something he didnt do however film ends with actual deer hunt as occasion lucass son coming age getting his own hunting license rifle passed down through family that potshot taken at lucas at very end was delivered as reminder that lucas was not entirely exonerated eyes someone or some faction community that he would have keep constant watch over his shoulder its maddening way live as result immature indiscretion,0.6089947089947092,0.0724987974987975,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,The narrative's genius embeds observer-effect with great accuracy — unforgettable masterpiece.,"Consider first the setting. It may be quiet and idyllic, but merry laughter and droll humour open the scene. A group of middle-aged manboys are clowning around by the lake. They are long-time friends of The Hunt's central character, Lucas — bespectacled 42 year old ex-professor, recently divorced and too old to be waddling in the water like a toddler at playtime.But the time is November in this unknown Danish village and everyone is having a good time in yet another get-together. Friends have known each other for years, people know people on a first name basis, many have lived here for generations and Lucas, is just another face in this jolly, close-knit community — nondescript and mellow, respected and well-liked.We are told that Lucas (played with artful and refined precision by Mads Mikkelsen) is not without the woes that come with modern adult life. Living alone and seeking custody of teenage son Marcus (newcomer Lasse Fogelstrøm), he is an ordinary man trying to rebuild from ground up as a kindergarten teacher. Immediately you can see that he is kind and friendly because Lucas walks young Klara home, and chats with her father, also his best friend, Theo. The two men share lasagne while fussing over pet dogs and hunting rifles. You acknowledge that Lucas has earned his place in this neighbourhood and relationships are in complete accord. Then the maiming of his middle-class existence begins.Klara develops a schoolgirl crush and puerile gestures are sensibly rebuffed. Nothing unpredictable or startling at this point. You've heard of such awkward incidents before. But Lucas is then accused of something he did not commit because Klara said something to avenge an earlier rejection.This is where The Hunt succeeds with penetrating insights into social phenomenon — soon after she causes harm, Klara attempts to recant the accusation without success. Here, writer-director Thomas Vinterberg absolves Klara from absolute blame and sets the stage for unreasonable and sinister conclusions. Watching the film from here on out is an unforgettable and riveting experience.It is natural to assume The Hunt simply alludes to the concept of ""Witch Hunt"", and contents itself with being dramatized fiction about falsely accusing the innocent. But if that were so, the brilliant scene where Klara was interviewed would not have alarmed with its disturbing methodology. The narrative's genius embeds observer-effect with great accuracy and insight into expectations of Klara, and her subsequent reaction. Vinterberg denies us simple solutions in which adults are perceptive enough to decipher the truth. For example, Ole the counsellor, ushered in from an unknown organization is scruffy and slightly unkempt. Characteristically unlikeable, he wears an implicit stereotype on his face and contaminates Klara's testimony by coaxing with a few hints, ""Do you remember, if something white came out?""She stares blankly, yet revulsion grows and collective hysteria spreads — allowing The Hunt to unveil itself as a carefully executed masterpiece. The clues match only because suggestive prompts are pushing the limits of disturbing reality.The canvas is visually precise; casting is pitch-perfect (especially that of Annika Wedderkopp in her excellent portrayal of Klara) and the script is cautiously penned.Based on transcripts of police interrogations conducted on suspected paedophiles in Denmark, the US and several European countries; Vinterberg investigates cause-effect with chilling authenticity. There is no doubt that The Hunt is antithesis to ""Festen"", an earlier work depicting the same subject matter but don't be mistaken — this film does not involve itself with controversial material for the sake of obligatory endorsements. Relentless and intense plot is enriched by characters reacting with protective instincts that come naturally simply because they care for one another. We see the internal worlds of Lucas, Theo, Marcus and Klara, and observe the impact of rotten dynamic unfolding before our very eyes. This forces us, spectators with an omniscient view to sit-up and question judgement using rational exactitude.Short analysis of the ending >>> The Hunt is a superb, penetrating study of human agency and in the end, some mysteries remain unknowable. There are several narratives attempting to interpret the final scene, and who the shooter really is. This person may very well be the same culprit who killed Fanny. Is it Klara's older brother, who has demonstrated protectiveness over her? Perhaps a disgruntled retail assistant from the grocery store? Maybe a figment of Lucas's anxious imagination from knowing life can easily cast him from the status of a hunter to that of a prey?These questions continue to linger because The Hunt's technical finish is open-form and resists finite closure. The image of an unknown rifleman, indistinct and in hiding is a conveyor of figurative conclusions. By doing such, Vinterberg employs artistic device to suggest that attitudes may be outwardly placid, but remain violent and embittered covertly. Just as it is with real life, some hostility can't be neutralized and a malevolent presence continues to loom over the horizon, willing to perpetuate an abyss of moral panic.https://cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",narratives genius embeds observer effect with great accuracy unforgettable masterpiece,consider first setting it may be quiet idyllic but merry laughter droll humour open scene group middle aged manboys are clowning around by lake they are long time friends hunts central character lucas bespectacled 42 year old ex professor recently divorced too old be waddling water like toddler at playtime but time is november this unknown danish village everyone is having good time yet another get together friends have known each other years people know people first name basis many have lived here generations lucas is just another face this jolly close knit community nondescript mellow respected well liked we are told that lucas played with artful refined precision by mads mikkelsen is not without woes that come with modern adult life living alone seeking custody teenage son marcus newcomer lasse fogelstr m he is ordinary man trying rebuild ground up as kindergarten teacher immediately you can see that he is kind friendly because lucas walks young klara home chats with her father also his best friend theo two men share lasagne while fussing over pet dogs hunting rifles you acknowledge that lucas has earned his place this neighbourhood relationships are complete accord then maiming his middle class existence begins klara develops schoolgirl crush puerile gestures are sensibly rebuffed nothing unpredictable or startling at this point youve heard such awkward incidents before but lucas is then accused something he did not commit because klara said something avenge earlier rejection this is where hunt succeeds with penetrating insights into social phenomenon soon after she causes harm klara attempts recant accusation without success here writer director thomas vinterberg absolves klara absolute blame sets stage unreasonable sinister conclusions watching film here out is unforgettable riveting experience it is natural assume hunt simply alludes concept witch hunt contents itself with being dramatized fiction about falsely accusing innocent but if that were so brilliant scene where klara was interviewed would not have alarmed with its disturbing methodology narratives genius embeds observer effect with great accuracy insight into expectations klara her subsequent reaction vinterberg denies us simple solutions which adults are perceptive enough decipher truth example ole counsellor ushered unknown organization is scruffy slightly unkempt characteristically unlikeable he wears implicit stereotype his face contaminates klaras testimony by coaxing with few hints do you remember if something white came out she stares blankly yet revulsion grows collective hysteria spreads allowing hunt unveil itself as carefully executed masterpiece clues match only because suggestive prompts are pushing limits disturbing reality canvas is visually precise casting is pitch perfect especially that annika wedderkopp her excellent portrayal klara script is cautiously penned based transcripts police interrogations conducted suspected paedophiles denmark us several european countries vinterberg investigates cause effect with chilling authenticity there is no doubt that hunt is antithesis festen earlier work depicting same subject matter but dont be mistaken this film does not involve itself with controversial material sake obligatory endorsements relentless intense plot is enriched by characters reacting with protective instincts that come naturally simply because they care one another we see internal worlds lucas theo marcus klara observe impact rotten dynamic unfolding before our very eyes this forces us spectators with omniscient view sit up question judgement using rational exactitude short analysis ending hunt is superb penetrating study human agency end some mysteries remain unknowable there are several narratives attempting interpret final scene who shooter really is this person may very well be same culprit who killed fanny is it klaras older brother who has demonstrated protectiveness over her perhaps disgruntled retail assistant grocery store maybe figment lucass anxious imagination knowing life can easily cast him status hunter that prey these questions continue linger because hunts technical finish is open form resists finite closure image unknown rifleman indistinct hiding is conveyor figurative conclusions by doing such vinterberg employs artistic device suggest that attitudes may be outwardly placid but remain violent embittered covertly just as it is with real life some hostility cant be neutralized malevolent presence continues loom over horizon willing perpetuate abyss moral panic,0.49996318114874827,0.1037800687285223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,Who would have thought a Danish Art House film could be so thoroughly gripping?,"'The Hunt' is a truly accomplished film, its simple premise and themes are executed perfectly. The film is hugely engrossing and completely and utterly infuriating, which is a testament to the merits of its acting, direction, script and hyper-realism.The film follows Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a lonely primary school teacher who relishes his job and is popular with both the children and the local community. Just as he meets Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport) and begins a relationship with her, his relationship with another woman, 5-year-old Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), lands him in immeasurable trouble. What happens is a completely innocuous misunderstanding, but the community, the 'adults' who are supposed to be rational and fair, turn into a lynch mob.The film is about the danger of mass-hysteria, ignorance and subsequently the frightening power of numbers. It teaches the importance of measure and consideration; it's a much needed anecdote to the sensational vilification, general ignorance and trashy media that permeates our lives.It's the scare-mongering, amoral tabloids that help in empowering the dangerously ignorant lynch-mobs that arise whenever someone screams 'paedophile!' or 'woman beater!' These lynch-mobs normally consist of pugnacious, dreadful people who enjoy drama and violence rather than actually care about their cause. The film is intelligently and thoughtfully written. The girl is by no means vindictive; as much as you want to vent your anger, she's clearly far too young to understand what is happening. It's the 'adults' who display their stupidity, their total lack of reasoning and fairness left me indignant for the entirety of the running time and subsequently the whole evening – the film really works.There is a palpable sense of danger throughout the film, you genuinely fear for Lucas' life; seldom have I empathised with a character so dearly.

8.0,Dissection of human nature,"Just like he did 14 years ago in Festen, Thomas Vinterberg once again shows us how a closely-knit community reacts to a shocking revelation. In Festen, a family party was spoiled by the revelation of a secret scandal. In Jagten, a group of friends and neighbours turn hostile when one of them is falsely accused of sexually abusing a young child, the daughter of his best friend. With microscopic precision, Vinterberg dissects the human nature. The accused, Lucas, baffled by the absurdity of the accusation, doesn't even bother to deny clearly. He rejects everyone who shows even the least bit of doubt, including his new girlfriend. His best friend Theo, the father of the young girl, clearly has doubts about Lucas's guilt, but sticks with his wife and daughter. Theo's wife is thoroughly convinced of Lucas's guilt, even when the child indicates he is innocent. The whole situation evolves into a nightmare for Lucas. He is not prosecuted after a police investigation fails to find any evidence, but the villagers have already made up their minds: he is a child molester. He loses his job, is being rejected by the village community and becomes the victim of violence himself. The movie is full of extremely intense scenes that make you shift uneasily on your chair. The various confrontations between Lucas and the villagers are very powerful, but so is the subplot about Lucas's son. A smart decision is that Vinterberg doesn't show anything about the investigation or the prosecution. It isn't important for the story, because the audience knows Lucas is innocent. Instead, the director only shows the way Lucas's friends react and cope with the situation. Jagten is filmed in a realistic style, without many cinematographic effects. The emotionality of the story and the strong acting are enough to carry the movie. The approach is reminiscent of the Dogma-style from Festen, but the strict Dogma-rules are a thing of the past. In some Christmas scenes, Vinterberg clearly makes use of special lighting techniques to create a cozy atmosphere. The whole film is a very strong watching experience. The shocking and unexpected ending, which is open for interpretation, is the cherry on the cake.",dissection human nature,just like he did 14 years ago festen thomas vinterberg once again shows us how closely knit community reacts shocking revelation festen family party was spoiled by revelation secret scandal jagten group friends neighbours turn hostile when one them is falsely accused sexually abusing young child daughter his best friend with microscopic precision vinterberg dissects human nature accused lucas baffled by absurdity accusation doesnt even bother deny clearly he rejects everyone who shows even least bit doubt including his new girlfriend his best friend theo father young girl clearly has doubts about lucass guilt but sticks with his wife daughter theos wife is thoroughly convinced lucass guilt even when child indicates he is innocent whole situation evolves into nightmare lucas he is not prosecuted after police investigation fails find any evidence but villagers have already made up their minds he is child molester he loses his job is being rejected by village community becomes victim violence himself movie is full extremely intense scenes that make you shift uneasily your chair various confrontations between lucas villagers are very powerful but so is subplot about lucass son smart decision is that vinterberg doesnt show anything about investigation or prosecution it isnt important story because audience knows lucas is innocent instead director only shows way lucass friends react cope with situation jagten is filmed realistic style without many cinematographic effects emotionality story strong acting are enough carry movie approach is reminiscent dogma style festen but strict dogma rules are thing past some christmas scenes vinterberg clearly makes use special lighting techniques create cozy atmosphere whole film is very strong watching experience shocking unexpected ending which is open interpretation is cherry cake,0.5398134405277262,0.09014584621727477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"

THE HUNT certainly did that for me. The story is a simple one, a man, a teacher, is wrongly accused of sexually misconduct with a young child and his community, filled with old friends and acquaintances, turn on him and make his life a living hell.Vinterberg's film brings to mind many of the same topics and is loaded with the same visceral feelings that his first film THE CELEBRATION touches upon, sexual deviancy, alienation, the mob mentality of the righteous, mixing innocence with brutality in many of its most heartbreaking scenes. Mikkelsen handles the main character Lucas both with restraint, and a little explosiveness when warranted.

10.0,It hurts...,"This is the most powerful drama I had the fortune to experience this past year. It's up there with Michael Haneke's AMOUR, but this definitely made me *feel* more. When, near the ending of THE HUNT, we have some hope for the protagonist, a kindergarten teacher who has been unjustly accused of child molestation, I actually thought something like ""I hope the movie ends right now!"" This because Thomas Vinterberg (director of movies like FESTEN and DEAR WENDY) makes us feel each and every moment of the great injustice that is shown in the screen. Yes, we feel for the protagonist Lucas (top-notch performance by Mads Mikkelsen) but also for his family and friends, especially for his teenage son. Obviously the, really wished, ""happy ending"" is highly unlikely as this is a realistic portrait of human nature. In the beginning of the film we have a group of Danish hunters (Lucas included) sharing good times, drinking, talking, just having fun. Apparently they're a real ""family"" of friends. The little daughter of Lucas' best friend is the one who begins the sexual abuse rumor, by telling the kindergarten director that Lucas showed her his penis. The parents of this girl didn't give her the enough attention; finding more important to be arguing than taking her to school, for instance. And Lucas was there to help the girl – it's a really ironic film. The way the families of the supposedly victims react; how the behavior of a family affects their infants; the general thought we have about children; and also those subjects of violence and friendship. Everything is shown here in a very credible way. The violence really ""hurts"" you; and I think if a film like THE HUNT doesn't provokes you *rage*, well, none will. Highly recommended, and for sure one of my favorites of 2012. *Watched it on 26 December, 2012",it hurts,this is most powerful drama i had fortune experience this past year its up there with michael hanekes amour but this definitely made me feel more when near ending hunt we have some hope protagonist kindergarten teacher who has been unjustly accused child molestation i actually thought something like i hope movie ends right now this because thomas vinterberg director movies like festen dear wendy makes us feel each every moment great injustice that is shown screen yes we feel protagonist lucas top notch performance by mads mikkelsen but also his family friends especially his teenage son obviously really wished happy ending is highly unlikely as this is realistic portrait human nature beginning film we have group danish hunters lucas included sharing good times drinking talking just having fun apparently theyre real family friends little daughter lucas best friend is one who begins sexual abuse rumor by telling kindergarten director that lucas showed her his penis parents this girl didnt give her enough attention finding more important be arguing than taking her school instance lucas was there help girl its really ironic film way families supposedly victims react how behavior family affects their infants general thought we have about children also those subjects violence friendship everything is shown here very credible way violence really hurts you i think if film like hunt doesnt provokes you rage well none will highly recommended sure one my favorites 2012 watched it 26 december 2012,0.520947570947571,0.25742063492063494,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,A shocking picture of injustice and paranoia,"According to English Professor Jack Lynch, ""Lies, once they are accepted as true, take on a life of their own, one that lasts long after the original falsehoods have been exposed."" The power of the continued acceptance of lies is reflected in Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt, the disturbing story of the false accusation of a kindergarten teacher of sexual abuse. It is an accusation that reveals the sordid underbelly of a small town, hidden beneath the veneer of middle-class civility. Written by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, The Hunt is a thought-provoking drama that makes us aware both of the vigilance needed to protect our children from predators, and of the crucial importance of following the precept that an individual is innocent until proved guilty in a court of law.Mads Mikkelsen is Lucas, is a caring kindergarten teacher who has been recently divorced and shares custody of his teenage son, Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrom). He has a good relationship with his students, especially six-year-old Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) and his wife Agnes (Anne Louise Hassing). Lucas walks her home from school when her parents are late in picking her up and she obviously likes him very much. In class one day, Klara kisses Lucas on the lips but is admonished by him that kissing on the lips is only for mum and dad. Sparked by seeing images on her bother's iPod, she tells kindergarten head Grethe (Susse Wold) that she doesn't like Lucas anymore because he has a ""weenie."" When Grethe tells her that this is normal because every man has one, Klara tells her that his was ""straight and pointed."" The incident is forgotten about for a few days until Grethe realizes that ""children never lie"", and begins questioning the little girl again, coming to the decision that sexual abuse has occurred and that some action must be taken. Though Klara now says that she cannot remember, her parents attribute her loss of memory to trying to forget what is uncomfortable. Calling a group of parents together, Grethe accuses Lucas before the parents, telling them the signs to watch out for in their own children. Slowly, the word gets around of widespread abuse at the school, though Lucas remains in the dark because Grethe refuses to give him any details about the accusations.Word spreads by hearsay, gossip, and innuendo as a child psychologist, teachers, parents, and eventually the police are brought in, but no through investigation is ever conducted. Klara is questioned again (questions taken directly from the transcripts of actual police cases) and it is obvious she is a confused little girl who tells the adults what they want to hear. Vinterberg ratchets up the tension and we sense the world closing in on the embattled teacher. Though Lucas' male friends in the community have a long-lasting bond, they break the ties of their close-knit group and turn against one of their own.Lucas and Marcus are denied the right to shop in the local market even to the point of threats and violence, his best friend Theo rejects him, and even his girlfriend Nadja (Alkexandra Rapaport) asks him if he's insane or sick. Lucas' only friend is Marcus' godfather, Bruun (Lars Ranthe), who soothes his friend's psyche with black humor. After Lucas is arrested, a preliminary hearing rules that there is not enough evidence to hold him and he is released, but this does not stop the violence. A rock is tossed through his window and neighborhood thugs take out their aggression on his dog Fanny.The Hunt is a harrowing experience that is not an easy film to watch, especially if the viewer has had past experience with the subject. The exceptional performances, however, make it easier to appreciate. They are not only from Mikkelson who won Best Actor at Cannes, but also from Fogelstrom as Lucas' loving and supportive son, Ranthe who keeps Lucas afloat, and especially that of seven-year-old actress Annika Wedderkopp who is so angelic that we never turn against her even though we know she is lying. While some critics bemoan the fact that this kind of story has been told before, it has never been told like this, building with inexorable power from the warmth of small-town conviviality to a shocking picture of injustice and paranoia that hits us right in the solar plexus.",shocking picture injustice paranoia,according english professor jack lynch lies once they are accepted as true take life their own one that lasts long after original falsehoods have been exposed power continued acceptance lies is reflected thomas vinterbergs hunt disturbing story false accusation kindergarten teacher sexual abuse it is accusation that reveals sordid underbelly small town hidden beneath veneer middle class civility written by vinterberg tobias lindholm hunt is thought provoking drama that makes us aware both vigilance needed protect our children predators crucial importance following precept that individual is innocent until proved guilty court law mads mikkelsen is lucas is caring kindergarten teacher who has been recently divorced shares custody his teenage son marcus lasse fogelstrom he has good relationship with his students especially six year old klara annika wedderkopp daughter his best friend theo thomas bo larsen his wife agnes anne louise hassing lucas walks her home school when her parents are late picking her up she obviously likes him very much class one day klara kisses lucas lips but is admonished by him that kissing lips is only mum dad sparked by seeing images her bothers ipod she tells kindergarten head grethe susse wold that she doesnt like lucas anymore because he has weenie when grethe tells her that this is normal because every man has one klara tells her that his was straight pointed incident is forgotten about few days until grethe realizes that children never lie begins questioning little girl again coming decision that sexual abuse has occurred that some action must be taken though klara now says that she cannot remember her parents attribute her loss memory trying forget what is uncomfortable calling group parents together grethe accuses lucas before parents telling them signs watch out their own children slowly word gets around widespread abuse at school though lucas remains dark because grethe refuses give him any details about accusations word spreads by hearsay gossip innuendo as child psychologist teachers parents eventually police are brought but no through investigation is ever conducted klara is questioned again questions taken directly transcripts actual police cases it is obvious she is confused little girl who tells adults what they want hear vinterberg ratchets up tension we sense world closing embattled teacher though lucas male friends community have long lasting bond they break ties their close knit group turn against one their own lucas marcus are denied right shop local market even point threats violence his best friend theo rejects him even his girlfriend nadja alkexandra rapaport asks him if hes insane or sick lucas only friend is marcus godfather bruun lars ranthe who soothes his friends psyche with black humor after lucas is arrested preliminary hearing rules that there is not enough evidence hold him he is released but this does not stop violence rock is tossed through his window neighborhood thugs take out their aggression his dog fanny hunt is harrowing experience that is not easy film watch especially if viewer has had past experience with subject exceptional performances however make it easier appreciate they are not only mikkelson who won best actor at cannes but also fogelstrom as lucas loving supportive son ranthe who keeps lucas afloat especially that seven year old actress annika wedderkopp who is so angelic that we never turn against her even though we know she is lying while some critics bemoan fact that this kind story has been told before it has never been told like this building with inexorable power warmth small town conviviality shocking picture injustice paranoia that hits us right solar plexus,0.5554728370221327,0.04249496981891348,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Finding His Way In The Forest,"Here in the small town where I reside, our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation, but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as ""I really can't tolerate judgemental people"".Recently I saw another Danish movie ""The Hijacking"" and was so impressed with it, that I sought out this movie as it was also a highly regarded project. I'm glad I did. The movie reflected the idea of a rush to judgement and all the implications of how society reacts when information is inaccurately reinforced.The title of the movie, ""The Hunt"" is symbolic of Lucas's hunt for justice, but also feeling like the hunted. It begins with friends at a hunting camp drinking & celebrating but this hunt is all a metaphor for Lucas's life. Perhaps it was best expressed when his son got a family heirloom hunting rifle and it was said that now he was old enough to find his way in the forest. ""The Hunt"" is really about such a journey and the forest was thick with assumptions, accusations, hatred, betrayal, and a host of other thorns, briars, branches and such things to trip up the journey. Having felt like he was being hunted through a community's narrow rifle scope of understanding, Lucas's idea of hunting is ultimately altered....and believably so.Vinterberg does a masterful job of story telling and in such a way that we hear a morality tale. Yes, many times the information we are told in the news is correct. But what if it isn't? What price is paid by the victim and his/her family? If you want to watch a movie that is different from the typical Hollywood variety and gives you reason to search more deeply before believing what you see and hear, watch ""The Hunt"" and see if you would find your way through the same forest that Lucas traveled. Few of us would be able to do so....",finding his way forest,here small town where i reside our local newspaper had recent headline that beloved teacher was suspected improper contact with student article was complete along with his picture i felt that this teachers life was over as he knew it whether information was accurate or false i felt that i would withhold judgement pending accurate detailed investigation but i know that others would not give teacher this courtesy human nature is interesting thing observe we often get trapped our own snares with comments such as i really cant tolerate judgemental people recently i saw another danish movie hijacking was so impressed with it that i sought out this movie as it was also highly regarded project im glad i did movie reflected idea rush judgement all implications how society reacts when information is inaccurately reinforced title movie hunt is symbolic lucass hunt justice but also feeling like hunted it begins with friends at hunting camp drinking celebrating but this hunt is all metaphor lucass life perhaps it was best expressed when his son got family heirloom hunting rifle it was said that now he was old enough find his way forest hunt is really about such journey forest was thick with assumptions accusations hatred betrayal host other thorns briars branches such things trip up journey having felt like he was being hunted through communitys narrow rifle scope understanding lucass idea hunting is ultimately altered believably so vinterberg does masterful job story telling such way that we hear morality tale yes many times information we are told news is correct but what if it isnt what price is paid by victim his her family if you want watch movie that is different typical hollywood variety gives you reason search more deeply before believing what you see hear watch hunt see if you would find your way through same forest that lucas traveled few us would be able do so,0.47821138211382114,0.17910569105691054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Mads makes this better,"Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a much liked person in the community. He is getting divorced while having limited time with teenage son Marcus. He's working at the kindergarten after his school closed down. Little Klara is the daughter of his best friend Theo and she really likes him. She tries to give him a present which Lucas tries to gently turn back. She tells a fib to head teacher Grethe that explodes out of control.We've seen this movie before. In fact, the movie is laid out openly after we see Lucas and Klara together. The story is set and it's a matter of waiting for it to unfold. Mads is one of the most compelling actors to come out of Denmark. He makes every one of his movies better. He makes this movie better. The other unusual thing about this movie is that it has a compelling young actress in the lead. Young Annika Wedderkopp is fascinating. I doubt she has any idea of what's going on in the movie. That's the sense that is so important in the movie. The only problem is with the ending or last 10 minutes. I don't think that many of those people would show up even a full year later. It seems wrong and too abrupt. Also I saw the alternate ending. I never advocate for killing the lead at the end because that seems to be an easy move.

10.0,Fantastic and compelling,"I went to see this as part of the London Film Festival on Monday. I have to say that two days later it still resonates in my mind. Yes, it's a common tale that has been told in cinema before(man is wrongly accused and ostracised), but never so well, in my eyes. The acting is first class with no exception and the cinematography is perfect, creating a tense mood throughout the film. It's not for the faint hearted, but I think it's an important subject matter and very current. I've often wondered what it must be like for someone wrongly accused of such a crime and the hysteria that surrounds it. I have read reviews that say this is unrealistic but I don't agree, I only have to look on my own front doorstep in England to see exactly the same sort of behaviour, often far far more intense.I highly recommend it.",fantastic compelling,i went see this as part london film festival monday i have say that two days later it still resonates my mind yes its common tale that has been told cinema before man is wrongly accused ostracised but never so well my eyes acting is first class with no exception cinematography is perfect creating tense mood throughout film its not faint hearted but i think its important subject matter very current ive often wondered what it must be like someone wrongly accused such crime hysteria that surrounds it i have read reviews that say this is unrealistic but i dont agree i only have look my own front doorstep england see exactly same sort behaviour often far far more intense i highly recommend it,0.6729861111111112,0.08166666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"

9.0,"Excellent, moving film","I saw this movie yesterday. I agree with previous reviewers, this is an excellent, moving, wonderfully acted movie. It is impossible I think to go through it without being brought to tears at one point or another. You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - ""what are you doing? Open your eyes! Listen!"" But the great thing is you always understand where each character is coming from- you might not agree with their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic. Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before, and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It's a tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but at the same time it is not vulgar or ""in your face"", it's tactful.

10.0,Incredibly disheartening...,"There are very few movies that have been able to make me this emotionally drained by the end of it. The Hunt is one of those few.The Hunt tells the story of Lucas, a kindergarten teacher whose life gets ruined by an innocent little lie.This film broke me. It deals with a subject matter that is very dark and the way director Thomas Vinterberg executes this subject is extremely realistic. Majority of this film is very quiet. The background score is kept minimal which I felt made the movie all the more intense. The premise is handled with immense care. All the characters shown feel like real people and it's scary to think how everything shown in this movie can happen in real life.Lucas is by far the most sympathetic character I've ever seen. I really cared about him and felt really disheartened by the way he was treated despite not doing anything wrong. A huge amount of credit goes to Mads Mikkelsen who gives his best performance here. He is on-screen for majority of the film and conveys a lot of emotion just through his eyes alone. He is simply outstanding here. It's also really hard to blame the other characters for their reactions because of the situation. It goes to show how lies, big or small, can essentially ruin one's livelihood. It shows the general ignorance and mass hysteria prevalent in our society and the tendency to believe anything someone says without going deeper into it.The Hunt is one of the most depressing films I've seen and can be difficult to sit through.
