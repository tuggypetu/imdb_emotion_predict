4.0,"How many of you went ""BOOOOOOOO!!!"" at that finish","I watched a Netflix original film a while back called, ""The Ritual"" and it was pretty good. Not perfect, mind you, but it had me and my fiance's full attention and though I would have done some things differently, it worked. So I was looking for a horror movie in the woods and though this one was not totally in the woods the description made it sound interesting and it also made it sound like a supernatural horror...IT ISN'T!!! It is a very stupid and lazy home invasion movie that seems to promise some revelation at the end, but doesn't! The story has a father being killed leaving the mother and son in a tough situation. The mother's sister offers the use of her house in the woods since she is not using it and trying to sell it. Why the sister who is obviously loaded doesn't just help the mother with her bills is beyond me, but hell, I can deal with that. The catch with the house is that every Sunday there is an open house and the mother and son must leave during the time it is happening. After the first open house, strange things seem to happen as you guessed it...someone is now in the house. I was hoping something sinister was going on during the time on Sunday like demonic events, but no, the dude in the black boots is terrorizing mother and son while they throw red herrings all over the place and you get to watch him kill both of them and get away with it. Great ending...So my guess is, if the writers of this film made The Sixth Sense, the twist would have been Bruce Willis' character cures the kid because there were no ghosts. The revelation would have been nothing! People theorize the killer is a serial killer and that his MO is hiding in houses during open house events, but that is unlikely. For one, the house was not being lived in, like a good deal of open houses. What, he is just going to hide out until he decides there is not anyone there? No, I am guessing he took offense to the mother almost hitting him so he went there to get even and decided he liked it so he was going to try again. Still sucks. I imagine the writers of this film with their man bun and puffing on their vapes thinking this was a totally clever ending and the only people who like this thing being hipsters themselves. What it really is, is lazy ass screenwriting. The film was not all bad, as I did think the actors all did a great job and they did a good job making me wonder what was going to be going on; however, once I figured it was just a home intruder and not anything supernaturally sinister going on I began to lose interest. The ending made me want to punch the writers of this in the face. By the way, turning off the pilot light of a water heater will not cause the water to go ice cold immediately!",how many you went boooooooo at that finish,i watched netflix original film while back called ritual it was pretty good not perfect mind you but it had me my fiances full attention though i would have done some things differently it worked so i was looking horror movie woods though this one was not totally woods description made it sound interesting it also made it sound like supernatural horror it isnt it is very stupid lazy home invasion movie that seems promise some revelation at end but doesnt story has father being killed leaving mother son tough situation mothers sister offers use her house woods since she is not using it trying sell it why sister who is obviously loaded doesnt just help mother with her bills is beyond me but hell i can deal with that catch with house is that every sunday there is open house mother son must leave during time it is happening after first open house strange things seem happen as you guessed it someone is now house i was hoping something sinister was going during time sunday like demonic events but no dude black boots is terrorizing mother son while they throw red herrings all over place you get watch him kill both them get away with it great ending so my guess is if writers this film made sixth sense twist would have been bruce willis character cures kid because there were no ghosts revelation would have been nothing people theorize killer is serial killer that his mo is hiding houses during open house events but that is unlikely one house was not being lived like good deal open houses what he is just going hide out until he decides there is not anyone there no i am guessing he took offense mother almost hitting him so he went there get even decided he liked it so he was going try again still sucks i imagine writers this film with their man bun puffing their vapes thinking this was totally clever ending only people who like this thing being hipsters themselves what it really is is lazy ass screenwriting film was not all bad as i did think actors all did great job they did good job making me wonder what was going be going however once i figured it was just home intruder not anything supernaturally sinister going i began lose interest ending made me want punch writers this face by way turning off pilot light water heater will not cause water go ice cold immediately,0.603968253968254,0.05363756613756613,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,Never been so angry or disappointed in a film...EVER,"I completely jinxed this movie by saying how good it was halfway through.I've seen some pretty horrendous horror films in my lifetime, but you expect them to be horrendous because they are what they say on the tin. Cheap and easy.This film is the opposite, it's deceptive and not in a ""ahhh wasn't expecting that"" sort of way. More a feeling of being completely ripped off and dissatisfied kinda way. We honestly really enjoyed a good majority of this film, so many things that look like they're building up to a really good twist at the end. Mysterious characters, red herrings, things that could be linked together in a really cool way.How naive and utterly wrong we were.There is no point to this film. Literally, why was this film made? It's like they employed a really good writer for the first half of the film who put together a brilliant structure and then some idiot decided to take over and realised he/she was in over their head. By the last shot I was honestly screaming ""DO NOT ROLL CREDITS"" and my sister had to restrain me when the goddam screen went black.This review may seem extra, but I have never been so angry, frustrated and disappointed by a potentially great film.I urge you not to waste your time.

2.0,The Open House: Just when I think Netflix is redeeming itself it releases something like this.....,"The Open House is a Netflix original movie and presently sits at no.55 on the IMDB bottom 100. So the IMDB community deems this to be the 55th worst movie ever made. I have to disagree, but there is no denying just how atrocious it is.It tells the story of a mother and son who move into an open house after a tragedy befalls their family. As per the usual trope weird things begin to happen in the property.The trouble is, well.................there are a lot of troubles but first of all the movie is..........wait, honestly I don't even know where to start here.Awfully paced, dreadful characters you simply can't care about, a billion unanswered questions, the film ultimately goes nowhere at all! Basically the only redeeming features the film has are marginally decent cinematograpgy and a beautiful setting.The Open House is fully deserving of all the poor ratings, it's the absolute pits.The Good:Beautiful locationThe Bad:Cliched to incredible levelsUnlikeable charactersServes no purposeThings I Learnt From This Movie:Nothing, in fact I'm pretty sure it caused brain leakage so I've probably forgot some stuff",open house just when i think netflix is redeeming itself it releases something like this,open house is netflix original movie presently sits at no 55 imdb bottom 100 so imdb community deems this be 55th worst movie ever made i have disagree but there is no denying just how atrocious it is it tells story mother son who move into open house after tragedy befalls their family as per usual trope weird things begin happen property trouble is well there are lot troubles but first all movie is wait honestly i dont even know where start here awfully paced dreadful characters you simply cant care about billion unanswered questions film ultimately goes nowhere at all basically only redeeming features film has are marginally decent cinematograpgy beautiful setting open house is fully deserving all poor ratings its absolute pits good beautiful locationthe bad cliched incredible levelsunlikeable charactersserves no purposethings i learnt this movie nothing fact im pretty sure it caused brain leakage so ive probably forgot some stuff,0.6878968253968254,0.04348958333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,Waste of Time,"I really don't know what happened here. It started off well, but then it just kind of fizzled. The acting wasn't bad, but the writing was. Certainly nothing original about the plot. I was really expecting more from this movie. Overall its just 90 minutes of my life that I can never get back.It almost seems like they just ran out of money and decided to just go ahead and end it.It will leave you unsatisfied and with a bunch of questions that will likely never get answered.

3.0,Ends up being a frustrating watch,"There are some good Netflix exclusive movies out there, but there are also a number of poor efforts, and ""The Open House"" is one of those stumbles. While it is definitely a bad movie, I didn't find it quite as bad as most IMDb users here have found it. The production values were good for what had to be a non blockbuster budget. Also, the first half of the movie does have a little mood and eeriness. But otherwise, the movie pretty much screws things up. I could live with the setup being somewhat familiar, but the execution of the setup is quite badly done. Most of the movie (especially in the first half) unfolds at a REALLY slow pace, with no real strong thrills or plot turns to keep the viewer actively engaged. The lead characters also seem very dim-witted, not seeing that something is seriously wrong before things turn very serious. Also, while the movie seems to be setting up for some surprise plot twists and turns, NOTHING about this setup pays off in the end. There is no real explanation as to what is happening and why, and what we have seen before the ending seems just to have been padding before the very unsatisfying conclusion. While I will admit that the movie could have been a lot worse, I really can't see it entertaining any particular viewer.",ends up being frustrating watch,there are some good netflix exclusive movies out there but there are also number poor efforts open house is one those stumbles while it is definitely bad movie i didnt find it quite as bad as most imdb users here have found it production values were good what had be non blockbuster budget also first half movie does have little mood eeriness but otherwise movie pretty much screws things up i could live with setup being somewhat familiar but execution setup is quite badly done most movie especially first half unfolds at really slow pace with no real strong thrills or plot turns keep viewer actively engaged lead characters also seem very dim witted not seeing that something is seriously wrong before things turn very serious also while movie seems be setting up some surprise plot twists turns nothing about this setup pays off end there is no real explanation as what is happening why what we have seen before ending seems just have been padding before very unsatisfying conclusion while i will admit that movie could have been lot worse i really cant see it entertaining any particular viewer,0.5345878136200717,-0.003997230368198097,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.21}"

4.0,"Average Film Thats Been Done A Million Times, With No Resolution","You've seen this before, family suffers a terrible tragedy and moves into a new neighborhood. The town has several creepy and odd individuals that talk about the house the family is moving into. After settling into the house thats up for sale, they begin to experience odd things that terrorize them, and there is nothing the cops can do, just some kids trying to scare the newcomers they say. Unfortunately the film is just that, thin and has been done over and over. And with a sub-par ending that left me disappointing and unfulfilled. Who or what is it? And why is this happening? You'll never know. The only redeeming qualities is the beautiful scenery, but to be fair nature doesn't need good directing to be beautiful. The sound score is also ok, adding some tensions to the predictable scare scenes. The characters are very one dimensional and only a few actors do a respectable job with their character. Don't get me wrong, some actors do an ok job, but most of the acting is very averagely performed. The scare scenes, while averagely done, will be scary to some light weights, but for horror veterans, you will not be tense and see it coming because the film is a regurgitation of countless other films.Over all I wouldn't recommend it, I know you can find a better film to watch.",average film thats been done million times with no resolution,youve seen this before family suffers terrible tragedy moves into new neighborhood town has several creepy odd individuals that talk about house family is moving into after settling into house thats up sale they begin experience odd things that terrorize them there is nothing cops can do just some kids trying scare newcomers they say unfortunately film is just that thin has been done over over with sub par ending that left me disappointing unfulfilled who or what is it why is this happening youll never know only redeeming qualities is beautiful scenery but be fair nature doesnt need good directing be beautiful sound score is also ok adding some tensions predictable scare scenes characters are very one dimensional only few actors do respectable job with their character dont get me wrong some actors do ok job but most acting is very averagely performed scare scenes while averagely done will be scary some light weights but horror veterans you will not be tense see it coming because film is regurgitation countless other films over all i wouldnt recommend it i know you can find better film watch,0.5756633906633906,0.025667485667485675,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"

2.0,One house not worth opening,"Saw 'The Open House' on Netflix a while ago, being fond of horror/thriller regardless of budget (even if not my favourite genre) and being intrigued somewhat by the idea. Being behind on my film watching and reviewing, with a long to watch and review list that keeps getting longer, it took me a while to get round to reviewing it.Unfortunately, despite not reading any reviews purposefully before watching, am going to have to agree with all the reviewers who hated 'The Open House'. A film that started off pretty good, but ran out of steam very quickly and rapidly got worse by a second half that makes one not want to keep watching. Never judge a film without seeing the whole thing and wanted to give 'The Open House', so gave it a fair chance.As said, 'The Open House' started off pretty promising. Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton give surprisingly good performances considering the material, especially Minnette. The soundtrack has some nice moments (i.e. ""Silent Night""), when it isn't being intrusive and annoying.However, so much brings 'The Open House' down. The rest of the cast struggle to do much with so little to do and the direction is so phoned in and pedestrian, one gets the sense that the director showed no interest in the film at all. Too much of the soundtrack is intrusive and annoying, made worse by the excessive and obvious sound effects that just cheapens the mood. The film looks drab generally and like it was made in haste.Where 'The Open House' most underwhelms is the writing and story. The writing is incredibly lazy, it's awkward in dialogue, very confused as a result of not tying things up or going into full detail and doesn't feel complete. The story suffers from a very limp pace, apparent early on and gets slower and slower until an interminably dragged out second half. It further suffers from feeling too much like a short film stretched out with a lot of useless padding. A few of the characters are reasonably likeable but the inconsistent and illogical motivations bring them down. For a film billed as a horror, though it's more a thriller with horror elements, there is very little interesting and nothing remotely scary. They are too few and are far too predictable, anaemic and weakly timed to make impact, with the dull pacing and obvious sound effects cheapening them significantly. In terms of the thriller elements, 'The Open House' doesn't engage let alone thrill, the start intrigued by feels wasted by how quickly everything runs out of steam. Worst of all is the ending, which is so abrupt, unresolved and incomplete that one struggles to even consider it an ending, the film just ends and leaves one scratching their heads in confusion and feeling cheated.Overall, the potential was there but the execution far from was. Really bad, unless you're curious about seeing it it's best to keep this house closed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",one house not worth opening,saw open house netflix while ago being fond horror thriller regardless budget even if not my favourite genre being intrigued somewhat by idea being behind my film watching reviewing with long watch review list that keeps getting longer it took me while get round reviewing it unfortunately despite not reading any reviews purposefully before watching am going have agree with all reviewers who hated open house film that started off pretty good but ran out steam very quickly rapidly got worse by second half that makes one not want keep watching never judge film without seeing whole thing wanted give open house so gave it fair chance as said open house started off pretty promising dylan minnette piercey dalton give surprisingly good performances considering material especially minnette soundtrack has some nice moments i e silent night when it isnt being intrusive annoying however so much brings open house down rest cast struggle do much with so little do direction is so phoned pedestrian one gets sense that director showed no interest film at all too much soundtrack is intrusive annoying made worse by excessive obvious sound effects that just cheapens mood film looks drab generally like it was made haste where open house most underwhelms is writing story writing is incredibly lazy its awkward dialogue very confused as result not tying things up or going into full detail doesnt feel complete story suffers very limp pace apparent early gets slower slower until interminably dragged out second half it further suffers feeling too much like short film stretched out with lot useless padding few characters are reasonably likeable but inconsistent illogical motivations bring them down film billed as horror though its more thriller with horror elements there is very little interesting nothing remotely scary they are too few are far too predictable anaemic weakly timed make impact with dull pacing obvious sound effects cheapening them significantly terms thriller elements open house doesnt engage let alone thrill start intrigued by feels wasted by how quickly everything runs out steam worst all is ending which is so abrupt unresolved incomplete that one struggles even consider it ending film just ends leaves one scratching their heads confusion feeling cheated overall potential was there but execution far was really bad unless youre curious about seeing it its best keep this house closed 2 10 bethany cox,0.5378045515394912,-0.04103246318607765,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,If I could get a refund I would!,I didn't expect much and that is exactly what I got. This is one of those movies that should never have been made. I can only assume the producers were looking to launder some dollars because there is absolutely NO reason at all to let this excuse for a movie anywhere near the paying public.No where in the movie do any of the main characters do anything any sensible person would do. They don't question things that are obviously questionable and they do things you simply would never do under the circumstances.

2.0,"Terrible, Sad use of such good actors","In The Open House, Logan (Dylan Minnette) is an aspiring runner hoping to attain glory on his high school's track team. But his life takes a tragic turn when he witnesses his father getting hit and killed by a driver having a heart attack in a parking lot. Unable to afford the rent of their home, Logan and his mother, Naomi, are able to relocate to Naomi's sister's mountain retreat until they figure out their next move, provided they leave when the realtors who are trying to sell it have their open house days. Almost immediately, eerie events start happening inside the house. Objects are moved seemingly by themselves from one room to the next. The pilot light keeps getting turned off. And the realtors who are trying to sell this mountain house are strange, and so is their new neighbor, Martha, and the repairman sent to fix the furnace. It gets really bad when Logan and Naomi return home to find the dining room table candlelit; the police dismiss this as the behavior of bored teenagers. With only their new friend, a local named Chris, offering to stay with them and help try to make sense of the increasingly creepy happenings, Logan and Naomi must find a way to catch the mystery person lurking in the house, or die trying. Perhaps the only good thing about this horror movie is the music. While the acting isn't bad and there's some initial hope that The Open House could be a satisfying scary movie, viewers are ultimately left with nothing but the feeling that 94 minutes of their life was wasted. There are some nods to The Shining and Psycho that suggest perhaps the filmmakers are savvy enough to make horror movie magic with a small budget, but it doesn't take long to see that the overuse of genre clichés -- such as the sudden burst of music and the jolting camera shot that merely reveals another character appearing seemingly out of nowhere -- reveals an amateurish ineptitude that might lead the viewer to wonder if they're being ironic. Is the movie a spoof of horror movies? It's unclear. Viewers may be frustrated with the ending, or lack of an ending. Basically, it's like a whodunit without telling you whodunit. Teen horror fans are better off sticking with the classics.",terrible sad use such good actors,open house logan dylan minnette is aspiring runner hoping attain glory his high schools track team but his life takes tragic turn when he witnesses his father getting hit killed by driver having heart attack parking lot unable afford rent their home logan his mother naomi are able relocate naomis sisters mountain retreat until they figure out their next move provided they leave when realtors who are trying sell it have their open house days almost immediately eerie events start happening inside house objects are moved seemingly by themselves one room next pilot light keeps getting turned off realtors who are trying sell this mountain house are strange so is their new neighbor martha repairman sent fix furnace it gets really bad when logan naomi return home find dining room table candlelit police dismiss this as behavior bored teenagers with only their new friend local named chris offering stay with them help try make sense increasingly creepy happenings logan naomi must find way catch mystery person lurking house or die trying perhaps only good thing about this horror movie is music while acting isnt bad theres some initial hope that open house could be satisfying scary movie viewers are ultimately left with nothing but feeling that 94 minutes their life was wasted there are some nods shining psycho that suggest perhaps filmmakers are savvy enough make horror movie magic with small budget but it doesnt take long see that overuse genre clich s such as sudden burst music jolting camera shot that merely reveals another character appearing seemingly out nowhere reveals amateurish ineptitude that might lead viewer wonder if theyre being ironic is movie spoof horror movies its unclear viewers may be frustrated with ending or lack ending basically its like whodunit without telling you whodunit teen horror fans are better off sticking with classics,0.5240744400527008,-0.09059288537549405,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,"Netflix, why? Don't waste your time","I've watched some really bad movies on Netflix like No Mercy but The Open House is the worst movie I've watched. At least No Mercy had a beginning middle and end but The Open House has a beginning and middle but no end. It just leads you to nothing and you are left feeling ""What the F?!"" The movie starts like out any C movie on Netflix, some tragedy and then the main characters have to make a decision they don't really want to but being financially strapped have to. Then creepy things start to happen and there is violence but then it just abruptly stops there. It makes no sense and is very frustrating. The viewer becomes invested in the characters. The actors actually do the best the can and the acting is not bad. But the characters are one dimensional. We don't ever really get to the know the wife and son. The movie feels like it was edited with a guillotine. There are scenes put together that don't make sense. For instance the son complains they moved away from his friends and he didn't want to go but there are no scenes prior to that of him feeling this way. We straight up have a conversation between the wife and her sister about moving to the mountain home and then voila they are driving to the mountain home. Does Netflix think because it is spending loads of money on several movies like Bright that it can just have really bad movies to fill the line up of movies? Don't waste your time.",netflix why dont waste your time,ive watched some really bad movies netflix like no mercy but open house is worst movie ive watched at least no mercy had beginning middle end but open house has beginning middle but no end it just leads you nothing you are left feeling what f movie starts like out any c movie netflix some tragedy then main characters have make decision they dont really want but being financially strapped have then creepy things start happen there is violence but then it just abruptly stops there it makes no sense is very frustrating viewer becomes invested characters actors actually do best can acting is not bad but characters are one dimensional we dont ever really get know wife son movie feels like it was edited with guillotine there are scenes put together that dont make sense instance son complains they moved away his friends he didnt want go but there are no scenes prior that him feeling this way we straight up have conversation between wife her sister about moving mountain home then voila they are driving mountain home does netflix think because it is spending loads money several movies like bright that it can just have really bad movies fill line up movies dont waste your time,0.3853333333333333,-0.05713333333333332,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
2.0,Vicious.,"""The Open House"" is a film released by Netflix that has managed to find its way onto IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. After seeing it, I can see why folks were offended by it...though I am not sure it's Bottom 100 worthy.The story is very simple. A father dies and after his wife and son temporarily move into her sister's house. All sorts of weird stuff happens. You think it's all supernatural but it just turns out to be a guy who likes torturing and murdering people. And, he then tortures and murders the pair....end of story.If you like seeing people being brutally tortured, then this is the film for you. But for folks who don't delight in seeing pain being inflicted on others, don't watch the movie. In fact, either way, don't watch the movie....not just because of this but because it's not interesting nor compelling...just mean-spirited.",vicious,open house is film released by netflix that has managed find its way onto imdbs infamous bottom 100 list after seeing it i can see why folks were offended by it though i am not sure its bottom 100 worthy story is very simple father dies after his wife son temporarily move into her sisters house all sorts weird stuff happens you think its all supernatural but it just turns out be guy who likes torturing murdering people he then tortures murders pair end story if you like seeing people being brutally tortured then this is film you but folks who dont delight seeing pain being inflicted others dont watch movie fact either way dont watch movie not just because this but because its not interesting nor compelling just mean spirited,0.7851800976800978,-0.18365384615384617,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"

In other words they don't need to write; they just string some vents together, add some creepy locations and a few cookie cutter characters and ... bingo ... you've got a movie.It starts off well enough as a creepy psychological thriller that actually holds the attention quite well, but then the last twenty minutes head off into tedious raving psycho stalker killer territory and some quite unnecessary violence.
