1,Son of the Mask: O....M....G!,"Son of the Mask is one of those sequels that simply shouldn't have happened and now after watching I can claim it's a contender for the worst one of the bunch.But no wait there is more, this isn't just bad it's THAT bad.It currently sits as the 10th worst movie ever made on IMDB which is an impressive feat. Ontop of that it's the winner of such prestigious awards as Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor, Most Intrusive Musical Score, Foulest Family Film, Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Least ""Special"" Special Effects. Starring Jamie Kennedy, Traylor Howard, Alan Cumming and a small role for Kal Penn it tells another story of the infamous Mask and it is beyond belief.Full of dire cgi, painfully unfunny ""comedy"", purile writing and legitimately no redeeming features I can't believe that such a brilliant classic comedy like The Mask (1994) could be insulted to this degree with a sequel.It's just SO cringe inducing! The jokes are too immature even for Saturday morning cartoons. The cartoon violence doesn't translate very well at all and some of it seems distasteful especially for a family film. And for 84 million dollars it looks like warmed up dog poop.Seriously, everything people say about this film is true. I'm not one to jump aboard bandwagons and hate things because its ""Trendy"" to, nor do I give 1/10's out often but this is awful!The Good:Traylor Howard The Bad:Poor cgiBeyond dumbThings I Learnt From This Movie:In movies reducing women down to their bras is funny and comedic, I do it and I get arrested!?How could a plot including repeated attempts on a babies life not be considered funny?

1,p-a-r-t-y. Why? no seriously....why was this movie made?,"Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie ""Son of the Mask."" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds ""Cuz I gotta!"" Unfortunately, that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking, ""Good Lord, Why?"" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous, insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home, mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search for his mask at the orders of his father, Odin.First off, ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while, obviously computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question ""WHY?"" The son of the Mask gets one star, although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask.",p r t y why no seriously why was this movie made,eleven years ago stanley ipkiss released his true inner self became hero edge city by finding wearing norse god mischief lokis mask mask helped bring jim carrey forefront comedy reached very popular status its originality just pure fun everyone knew how spell party p r t y why cuz i gotta now eleven years later it seems me that same philosophy has been applied new movie son mask someone asked director lawrence guterman why are you making this he responds cuz i gotta unfortunately that answer doesnt cover it because after seeing son mask i still left theatre thinking good lord why guterman rest people involved blasphemous film need realize that response given why are you making this film should not be as simple as answer debate whether or not party son mask begins with otis dog finding infamous mask bringing it back his owner tim avery clear homage legendary loony toons creator tex avery tim played by jamie kennedy is struggling animator who is stuck working as turtle tour guide animation company he aspires one day draw night company halloween party tim puts mask transforms into mischievous insane character that we all expect after party tim goes home mask still conceives child with his wife nine months later mayhem ensues as baby born mask has remarkable cartoonish powers otis dog jealous babys attention puts mask partakes tom jerry type mayhem out baby meanwhile loki played by alan cumming is search his mask at orders his father odin first off ill admit that i do respect fact that this film pays so much homage classic cartoons such as tom jerry loony toons with its wile e coyote type contraptions infamous dancing frog type plot however this reverence cannot save film makes it less respectful more waste time premise movie becomes increasingly silly silly is not always bad thing but this movie silliness gets point just plain annoying characters are not fun watch whats worse theyre not funny dullness characters can also be attributed fact that so much cgi was used one greatest things about original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied jim carrey his exuberant style just being jim carrey we were convinced was actual cartoon jamie kennedy just doesnt have that kind ability fact that is clear when you watch him wear mask his facial features rarely shift baby dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout movie side story loki searching mask just became more more stupefying son mask is sad sad state affairs what i suggest is you go rent or buy original mask thank norse gods or whoever bringing it us will consider seeing sequel my sacrifice as i continue ask infamous question why son mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between classic creators loony toons jim carrey who will always be my book mask,0.5428742310321257,0.04078415736310472,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.48, 'Fear': 0.25}"

1,Why isn't this direct-to-DVD???,"IS there any reason to revive characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was due to the actors playing them.Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz -- or better yet, who can replace them at cut-rate prices since most studios know that sequels don't bring in the same amount of revenue as the originals so they cut corners from the get-go.Where are the good movies going to play if powerful Hollywood studios can clog up 3,000 theaters opening weekend with whatever turds they feel like the general public can be suckered into.Enough's enough people, this sequel-itis has got to stop and the Hollywood people need to start getting their act together or start distributing the much-better foreign product that's floating in limbo.Wake up Hollywood, cause the people HAVE woken up and they aren't buying it just cause it's new and shiny.

1,The negative criticisms are right- this movie is BAD!,"The original film with Jim Carrey was a clever and hilarious film, with a very sophisticated and dynamic visual style. What a way to ruin such a fantastic film, with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit, it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen, Disaster Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse, but judging by how really poor the film is, that is not saying much.Let me start by saying the script was quite terrible, very clichéd and stale, with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman, who also directed Cats and Dogs, which is much more decent, was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.The special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination, but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV, despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma, and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role, which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.All in all, I can see why people say this movie is bad, it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox",negative criticisms are right this movie is bad,original film with jim carrey was clever hilarious film with very sophisticated dynamic visual style what way ruin such fantastic film with such poor sequel it does make me sad i will give some credit it isnt quite worst movie i have ever seen disaster movie superbabies baby geniuses 2 home alone 4 were worse but judging by how really poor film is that is not saying much let me start by saying script was quite terrible very clich d stale with nothing new expand its predecessor direction laurence guterman who also directed cats dogs which is much more decent was close incompetent story about magical mask falling into hands cartoonist who fathers son is rather substandard takes while get going special effects animation attempts spark some imagination but it completely lacks visual style that made original so endearing look at intead whole film looks cheap comparison looks like it was made tv despite valiant attempts animators make it look good casting is uninspired say least jamie kennedy as cartoonist lacks charisma i will say i found baby really creepy alan cumming is very talented actor has been some great films namely wonderful 1994 version black beauty where his voice over beloved horse was note perfect here he cant do anything with his villainous role which is so badly underwritten its not hard see why how bob hoskins got dragged into this i shall never know all all i can see why people say this movie is bad it is not just because it is not true sequel but also it is substandard comparison its much superior predecessor terms sophistication quality not quite worst movie i have ever seen but it is bad 1 10 bethany cox,0.6527337662337662,0.033534415584415604,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1,If you loved the original film than do not watch this one,"The Mask was in my opinion one of the most funniest Jim Carrey films in Carrey's career.It was over the top and downright hilarious. Rumors were going around that he was set to return and do another sequel opposite Cameron Diaz,but of course it wasn't meant to be. So fast forward to 2005 and we finally got a sequel to this film but is it as good as the 1994 version? Lets find out.Jamie Kennedy plays Ted Avery a cartoonist who finds a mask near a river(as in the opening we see Loki at a museum where the mask was kept)and one night Ted decides to put it on for his work party. Of course he and his wife get it on while Ted has the mask on him and his wife is pregnant with a beautiful baby boy. But when the baby is born he of course acts odd since Ted had the mask on him and so his different compare to other kids as his all looney and quirky since his half normal and half mask. So will Loki(Alan Cunnings) find Ted and get the mask back off him.Bottom line this film was so so stupid and awful. The CGI effects were rubbish,the CGI on the baby was just plain stupid,the acting was appalling. I just wanted to give up as I couldn't deal with it anymore.Do yourselves a favour and go find Jim Carrey's version better at least that has better CGI effects and Carrey is miles better than Jamie Kennedy(from Ghost Whisper)who was just terrible.0/10 Piece of crap.Alan Cunnings from The Smurfs and X Men 2 co stars as Loki and the late Bob Hospkins is in it too as Loki's father.And yes folks the guy that voices the tortoise in The Swan Princess Steve Wright is also in this film.",if you loved original film than do not watch this one,mask was my opinion one most funniest jim carrey films carreys career it was over top downright hilarious rumors were going around that he was set return do another sequel opposite cameron diaz but course it wasnt meant be so fast forward 2005 we finally got sequel this film but is it as good as 1994 version lets find out jamie kennedy plays ted avery cartoonist who finds mask near river as opening we see loki at museum where mask was kept one night ted decides put it his work party course he his wife get it while ted has mask him his wife is pregnant with beautiful baby boy but when baby is born he course acts odd since ted had mask him so his different compare other kids as his all looney quirky since his half normal half mask so will loki alan cunnings find ted get mask back off him bottom line this film was so so stupid awful cgi effects were rubbish cgi baby was just plain stupid acting was appalling i just wanted give up as i couldnt deal with it anymore do yourselves favour go find jim carreys version better at least that has better cgi effects carrey is miles better than jamie kennedy ghost whisper who was just terrible 0 10 piece crap alan cunnings smurfs x men 2 co stars as loki late bob hospkins is it too as lokis father yes folks guy that voices tortoise swan princess steve wright is also this film,0.5883477633477634,0.006637806637806629,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6,Not Without it's Moments,"Son of the Mask wasn't a completely terrible film, it was just geared at a younger audience than The Mask with Jim Carrey. It wasn't as dark as it's precedecessor, which made it more family friendly. But even as a family oriented movie, it was still corny. And it had it's funny moments with zaniness, but compared to the original film, it'll never be great.The cast was pretty great actually, albeit Jamie Kennedy, still flying high from his hidden camera show, wasn't a good fit. But Bob Hoskins as Odin and Alan Cumming as Loki we're perfectly cast. Of course, both of them are great actors. Ben Stein makes a cameo as Dr. Neuman, the only link between the original film and this sequel besides the mask itself.",not without its moments,son mask wasnt completely terrible film it was just geared at younger audience than mask with jim carrey it wasnt as dark as its precedecessor which made it more family friendly but even as family oriented movie it was still corny it had its funny moments with zaniness but compared original film itll never be great cast was pretty great actually albeit jamie kennedy still flying high his hidden camera show wasnt good fit but bob hoskins as odin alan cumming as loki were perfectly cast course both them are great actors ben stein makes cameo as dr neuman only link between original film this sequel besides mask itself,0.6380701754385965,0.2878070175438596,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.18}"
1,An absolute disgrace,"First of all, like a bunch of other people, I loved the original Mask film with Jim Carrey. It was funny, it was cheeky, it was risqué, and it was entertaining overall.An then over a decade later, this trainwreck comes to our screens. Literally the only returning cast member from the film is Ben Stein (the therapist from the last film; the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Apart from him, there's no Jim Carrey, no Cameron Diaz, no Richard Jeni (.....oh wait), so most of the appeal of the first film was immediately thrown out the window.Instead we're introduced to Jamie Kennedy, who is a whiny manchild who works in an animation studio, who comes across the mask picked up by his dog (presumably a different Jack Russell Terrier, RIP Milo) He wears the mask and impregnates his girlfriend/wife, apparently giving his child mask powers? It's ridiculous.So Odin and Loki get involved (nope, not from the MCU because that would be awesome) and try to eliminate the child.The child is eventually born, the dog gets jealous and tries to kill it, and Loki goes around creepily as well. OK, apart from some of these scenes having the most horrific and poorly handled CGI I've ever seen, this film really has a problem with which audience it's catering to. The characters are too exaggerated, the visuals are legitimately traumatizing, so the kids won't enjoy it. And the same thing will apply for adults because the acting is horrendous, Jamie Kennedy is a horrible replacement for Jim Carrey, and the script may as well have been written by a six-year-old. Plot holes and red herrings dominate the story, with there literally being no rhyme or reason for this film for existing.This film is desperate to extract any reaction from its audience, and this includes reactions of trauma, horror, anger, boredom and frustration. Avoid this film like the plague.",absolute disgrace,first all like bunch other people i loved original mask film with jim carrey it was funny it was cheeky it was risqu it was entertaining overall then over decade later this trainwreck comes our screens literally only returning cast member film is ben stein therapist last film teacher ferris buellers day off apart him theres no jim carrey no cameron diaz no richard jeni oh wait so most appeal first film was immediately thrown out window instead were introduced jamie kennedy who is whiny manchild who works animation studio who comes across mask picked up by his dog presumably different jack russell terrier rip milo he wears mask impregnates his girlfriend wife apparently giving his child mask powers its ridiculous so odin loki get involved nope not mcu because that would be awesome try eliminate child child is eventually born dog gets jealous tries kill it loki goes around creepily as well ok apart some these scenes having most horrific poorly handled cgi ive ever seen this film really has problem with which audience its catering characters are too exaggerated visuals are legitimately traumatizing so kids wont enjoy it same thing will apply adults because acting is horrendous jamie kennedy is horrible replacement jim carrey script may as well have been written by six year old plot holes red herrings dominate story with there literally being no rhyme or reason this film existing this film is desperate extract any reaction its audience this includes reactions trauma horror anger boredom frustration avoid this film like plague,0.5434343434343434,0.015656565656565636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1,Wow.,"Jim Carrey is resistant to sequels. We've known this for years. Back when Son of the Mask first came out, Jim had only done one sequel (Ace Ventura) that soured his entire outlook on sequels. Not that he was asked to take part in this in the first place, anyway. What's really interesting about this movie is the fact that The Mask is a totally different character depending on who wears it... and yet everyone who wears the mask in this movie (including the dog) are just absolutely wrong in their portrayals. The comedy is flat, the acting is laughable, the attempt to redo a Cuban Pete-style musical number was cringe-inducing at the absolute best, and the movie drones on and on and on. In terms of sequels, this is among the worst.",wow,jim carrey is resistant sequels weve known this years back when son mask first came out jim had only done one sequel ace ventura that soured his entire outlook sequels not that he was asked take part this first place anyway whats really interesting about this movie is fact that mask is totally different character depending who wears it yet everyone who wears mask this movie including dog are just absolutely wrong their portrayals comedy is flat acting is laughable attempt redo cuban pete style musical number was cringe inducing at absolute best movie drones terms sequels this is among worst,0.5127450980392156,-0.0014705882352941124,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1,What were they thinking?,"""The Mask"" took a gory and violent comic book and turned it into a funny and PG-13 comedy. It starred rubber faced Jim Carrey as an introverted bank employee that becomes a wild man with fantastic powers when he puts on the titular mask. He gets the girl, shows that he doesn't need the mask to be successful and roll credits. The movie was very popular, it did what it set out to do like bring a Tex Avery cartoon to life and made a lot of money. To this day it's still considered some of Jim Carrey's best work. So obviously there was a call to make a sequel to this. It bounced around a lot in Hollywood and Jim even turned down a $10 million paycheck because he didn't want to do a sequel to his work.So a couple years later they announced that they were making a sequel starring nobody that was in the original movie. This time instead of the wild and crazy Jim Carrey they instead cast the relatively unfunny Jamie Kennedy. And it's like they took all the likability out of the movie and replaced it with really creepy CGI and jokes that didn't land properly.The story goes that the mask has floated downstream from Edge City to Fringe City and has been found by a dog that looked remarkably like the dog from the original. His owner is played by Jamie Kennedy who's an aspiring cartoonist and a total manchild. Where Jim Carrey was eccentric and charming, this guy is just annoying. Well he puts on the mask, becomes a green faced wild man and wows everybody at the company Halloween party. They even rip off the musical numbers from the original but where they were funny and showed off Jim's abilities this one singular one really doesn't work. Like the dog the makers seem to think that if it worked in the original it will work here. Sadly it doesn't.Up until now there could have been some decent movie to be pulled from this mess but it's called ""Son of the Mask"" for a reason. While wearing said mask he goes home to his wife and she winds up pregnant. The baby somehow has inherited the powers of the mask and shenanigans ensue.The mother has morning sickness but instead of vomit what comes out is bubbles. I guess that's supposed to be funny. And she gets weird cravings. Like for silly string because the baby is silly I guess. Again I guess it's supposed to be funny.The baby is born and now the movie takes a hard left turn into nightmare fuel.

He's beyond frightening but I guess he was supposed to be cute and adorable.There's a side quest as Loki, the owner of the mask, is trying to find his mask and it erupts into chaos as he finds the child, the father and mother try to save him, there's a shtick-off where Loki and Jamie fight using wacky tricks and the baby finally chooses his father because he loves him now instead of literally wanting to send him to the insane asylum.Cue the happy ending and the CGI baby winking to the camera as if to say, ""this isn't over"".Thankfully this movie bombed at the box office and a third movie wasn't made and we never saw Jamie Kennedy in movies again.Do not see this.

2,"Yes, it's bad....but not bad enough to deserve to be in IMDb's Bottom 100--maybe the Bottom 500 (if there was one)","This is one of those Hollywood projects that makes you wonder why they even made the film in the first place. After all, to anyone hearing the plot, they'd know that the film was destined to bomb--yet some lunkheads approved the picture. And, while they saved a huge amount of money by not getting Jim Carey for this sequel, it's obvious that the budget was NOT small when you look at the amazing sets and see the excellent special effects. Yet, oddly, despite all this money being spent, the fundamental story idea was so stupid and the writing so amateurish that it couldn't help but bomb...and thankfully it did...otherwise they might have made more sequels!!! This is a bad film--there is no doubt about this. However, I object to it being on the IMDb Bottom 100 list as it's not THAT bad. Only the very worst of the worst deserve to be on the list--yet I notice such horrendous films as those of Ed Wood, Arch Hall, Al Adamson or William Grefe are not on the list! I guess it's because not as many people have seen these films and many DID see ""Son of the Mask"" due to its huge publicity campaign and massive DVD saturation.In addition, you can't help but admire the special effects as well as the sets. In particular, I loved the sets--which were very surreal and cartoon-like. I can't see giving such a beautiful looking film a 1---it deserves at least another point or two for effects and sets.As for the story, it's just plain stupid and wastes the talents of Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins. Plus, odd for a comedy, the film hasn't got a single laugh--not even one. In fact, some of the 'jokes' are downright repellent--such as the baby peeing copiously on the father as well as the snot joke--which both managed to be unfunny AND gross.While I could go on to discuss the plot, I won't...as simply put, no one could possibly care. It's dumb and not worth your trouble. An incredibly limp, unfunny and stupid film...with nice sets. Even smaller children will find all this very tedious and boring.

9,Am I from a different planet? Maybe I should conjure Odin,"Series note: As this is not a direct, chapter-like continuation of The Mask (1994), one can easily watch either film first.If I ever needed proof that I'm looking for something different in a film than most folks, here it is. While I don't think Son of the Mask is flawless, the only flaw I can really see is that the flow of the story doesn't quite make it as enrapturing or emotionally impactful as, say, Schindler's List (1993) or The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Two factors mitigate that lack. One, Son of the Mask isn't shooting for the same compelling emotional intensity as a film like Schindler's List. Two, Son of the Mask's other outstanding artistic qualities enable it to largely transcend any problems it has with achieving a spellbinding plot.Of course, related to point one above, it's not that every film needs to have a paradigm-shattering plot to succeed. The Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass trilogy of Koyaanisqatsi (1983), Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002) all receive scores of 9 or 10 from me, and debatably they have no plots, even if they make many cogent, often philosophical, ""arguments"" about culture.But it's not that Son of the Mask's story isn't good. The plot is set in the same location--the fictional Edge City--as the first Mask (as well as John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke's comic books, upon which both films are based). The story could take place either before or after the beloved Jim Carrey film. Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) lives in the bucolic countryside that's ironically only two miles outside of Edge City (it seems almost like a northeastern New Jersey, Westchester County or southwestern Connecticut joke). The mask of Loki, the ""God of mischief"" in Norse mythology, comes floating down a stream, to be found by Tim's dog, Otis (in an alliterative reference to Odin, Loki's father, and a pun on Milo and Otis). Tim puts it on just in time for a Halloween party, which enables him to get in the good graces of both his boss, played by comedian Steven Wright, and his wife, Tonya (Traylor Howard). Prior to this, Tim was having trouble at work as a struggling animator relegated to giving studio tours dressed up as a giant tortoise, and his wife was nagging him about having a baby.Meanwhile, we get to meet Loki himself (played by Alan Cumming) in a fabulous prologue set in a museum. It seems that he's lost his mask (of course) and Odin (an almost unrecognizable Bob Hoskins) is nagging him to find it. Tim's masked persona enables him to get a promotion and procreate, but the baby just may metaphysically be the son of Loki, and Loki exploits this fact to try to find his mask.Although it sounds complex, perhaps, that's a more than attractive story to me. It actually trumps the first Mask film in a way by bringing the source of the mask into the proceedings. It's highly fantastical and surreal, and it enables a great number of deeper themes and subtexts. To a large extent, Son of the Mask is a film about fatherhood. It explores the fears and foibles that many fathers and fathers-to-be experience. The resolution to the film's dilemmas--and director Lawrence Guterman adeptly maintains two primary dilemmas throughout--hinge on learning how to be a better father. But there are other important themes and subtexts, including the importance of personal assertiveness (carried over from the themes of the first film), the quandaries of dual career families, ""sibling"" rivalry, child development issues, and maybe even the beginnings of an Oedipal complex.Not that this is primarily a serious film, but it's not meant to be only or primarily a laugh-out-loud comedy, either. Guterman is much more concerned with achieving a thoroughgoing surrealism than he is with trying to make you laugh. I love surrealism, so I'm a prime candidate to love this film. In fact, I can't imagine anyone with a taste for surrealism not appreciating the film, at least to an extent.The production design--including things like the sets, matte paintings, costumes, and the ubiquitous cgi--is simply amazing. The surreal action sequences are even better. Perhaps even more than the first film, Son of the Mask realizes a ""live action"" cartoon.Tex Avery is again a strong reference (made obvious by Kennedy's character being named ""Tim Avery"" and working as an animator), as is classic Warner Brothers animation in general. A long section in the middle is a clever spoof on Chuck Jones' One Froggy Evening (1955), and there is another long section that is straight out of the Roadrunner cartoons (involving Otis first drawing up blueprints then trying to execute an elaborate, almost Rube Goldbergian ""elimination contraption"").The funniest aspect of the movie for me, perhaps, was a kind of ""suspended absurdity"", made most clear when Tonya returns from her business trip and finds her home (which was subtly modeled after cartoon homes circa the 1940s and 1950s) still in shambles from the cartoonish events that preceded--the piano is still hanging from the top of the stairs, the giant boxing glove is still engaged, and so on.But the performers have many funny moments, too. Although Kennedy has a couple moments of Jim Carrey-like mannerisms when Tim is The Mask, and these underscore that Kennedy can't do Carrey like Carrey can (of course), these are few and far between. Kennedy is Tim as Tim for most of the film, and funny at that. Alan Cumming was hilarious in his different disguises when he's searching for his mask, and entertaining otherwise--he's impressed me in all of his films I've seen. I also found the baby frequently funny, especially when more surreal.Giving Son of the Mask a 1 or 2 seems simply ridiculous to me, even if there are elements of the film you strongly dislike. Technically, at least, this is an exemplary work of art. It deserves to be reconsidered.",am i different planet maybe i should conjure odin,series note as this is not direct chapter like continuation mask 1994 one can easily watch either film first if i

2,Inept direction and poor choice of leads sinks this film,"For the record this is the story of the mask which was created by Loki, who after many centuries tries to find it again, only to have it fall into the hands of an animator and his infant son.This film raises several interesting questions, first and foremost is why is Jaime Kennedy a star when he has no talent what so ever? Based on this film he is talentless ""actor"" with no charisma. It maybe the film, but he's so uninteresting as to make watching this a chore. I'm certain that Alan Cumming, Bob Hoskins and Steven Wright were doing this for a pay check, but at least they turned in something approximating a performance. Kennedy walks through this film like a slacker...Then again considering the way the film turned out I'm convinced that most of the production staff were slackers.The special effects aren't special. For a ""big budget"" Hollywood film the effects feel unfinished and video game like. They do not approximate real, even cartoon real. Its as if the producers decided that they had reached the level of the dancing baby and to them that was fine. Its awful.The direction is poor. It has no comic sense. The wacky mask sequences fall flat. Whats worse is that they can't even approximate the classic Looney Tunes/MGM cartoons they copy.What annoys me is that this isn't so bad its good, its just bad.While this is certainly to be on my list of worst films of 2005, I can't give it the one out of ten it deserves, watching this I had the feeling that had this been better cast and directed this film might have actually worked.

1,Son of the Mask,"Whoever thought that a sequel to the smash Jim Carrey film The Mask was a good idea should be shot, this was the failed attempt to do it, from Razzie nominated Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs). Basically, ten years after previous events, the Mask has floated down river from the sea of Edge City, and found its way in the hands of aspiring cartoon animator Tim Avery (Razzie nominated Jamie Kennedy). Tim finds out the special powers of the Mask, and goes for a wild Halloween night out with his company, and next morning, Tim's wife Tonya (Traylor Howard), desperate for a baby, finds out she is pregnant. Meanwhile Loki (Razzie nominated Alan Cumming), the God of mischief, has been sent to Earth by his infuriated father Odin (Razzie nominated Bob Hoskins) to retrieve the Mask. When Tim's baby Alvey (twins Liam and Ryan Falconer) is born, he slowly realises that he didn't technically father his child, he did it while wearing the Mask, which explains the baby's extraordinary powers. Dog Otis feels unloved by his owners, and when he puts the Mask on he really gets to express how much he wants the baby out the way, but Alvey is getting the better of him. When Loki eventually finds Tim and the Mask, through Alvey, he makes a deal to give the baby back when he meets him at a certain place, and he becomes attached. In the end, Tim, with the Mask on again, and Loki ask Alvey choose who he really wants to be with, and it is when Tim takes the Mask off that the baby makes the right decision, and Loki and father Odin make up. Also starring The Mask's Ben Stein as Dr. Neuman, Steven Wright as Daniel Moss and Peter Flett as Mr. Kemperbee. The special effects I suppose are alright, but the casting is atrocious, the story played out is ridiculous, and it has nowhere near the same inventiveness and humour as the original. It is filled with just too many gross and over-the-top wild moments, and it just looks and feels really cheap, an absolutely awful fantasy comedy sequel.

1,Disgraceful to its predecessor,"As someone who's been dying to see a sequel to the 1994 cult classic ""The Mask"", I originally had no idea what to expect with this film. What I wasn't expecting was just how abysmal it would turn out to be, as it manages to take every step back humanly possible all while trying way too hard. I'm not saying ""The Mask"" is an untouchable masterpiece or anything (though compared to this slop, it might as well be), but everything that made the 1994 film so fun and enjoyable is either gone or done in such a desperate way, that the charm is gone. The writing, as well, somehow manages to be painful. Any film of this nature without Jim Carrey is destined to not be successful as the 1994 film, but Jamie Kennedy was a terrible choice for this film. That's not to say he's a bad actor or anything, but the writing and the performance mix is just dreadful. His character, ""Tim Avery"", is a bumbling moron that's more annoying than he is funny. To be fair, that could be more to the bad writing than anything, but still. What doesn't help is the lazy writing as a whole. When it's not mindlessly taking elements from the previous film and making them worse, it's mainly a bunch of annoying filler. Whether it be Tim having horrifically weird foresights of being a father, Tim in the mask putting on some heinous musical performance that lasts way too long, the dog and the baby wanting to kill each other for some reason, Loki looking for the baby with the Mask when it would be instantaneously faster if Odin did it, etc., none of these plot devices really amount to anything when there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the film. What also doesn't help is the lackluster visual effects. For a film made 11 years after the 1994 original, this film basically looks no better, as the CGI is very similar with no real improvement. What's worse, however, is the main character in the mask. Jamie Kennedy in the mask just doesn't work, as the make up looks uncomfortable, since he can barely move his face, and the added plastic hair makes no sense whatsoever, since Jim Carrey also had hair in the original, but he was bald in the mask. Add in the fact that the writing for the character lacks any charm, and it's just basically worse in every way. Overall, this film just made me angry. It wants to be like the original so bad, but it constantly forgets what really made the original so awesome to begin with by focusing on either copying or dumb ideas that make no sense in the grand scheme of things. There was no sense of focus or cohesion to be seen here whatsoever, and the fact that this calls itself a follow-up is downright insulting. Do yourself a favor, and let this one be forgotten in the realms of obscurity, as it is not only disgraceful to its predecessor, but it also has literally nothing going for it.",disgraceful its predecessor,as someone whos been dying see sequel 1994 cult classic mask i originally had no idea what expect with this film what i wasnt expecting was just how abysmal it would turn out be as it manages take every step back humanly possible all while trying way too hard im not saying mask is untouchable masterpiece or anything though compared this slop it might as well be but everything that made 1994 film so fun enjoyable is either gone or done such desperate way that charm is gone writing as well somehow manages be painful any film this nature without jim carrey is destined not be successful as 1994 film but jamie kennedy was terrible choice this film thats not say hes bad actor or anything but writing performance mix is just dreadful his character tim avery is bumbling moron thats more annoying than he is funny be fair that could be more bad writing than anything but still what doesnt help is lazy writing as whole when its not mindlessly taking elements previous film making them worse its mainly bunch annoying filler whether it be tim having horrifically weird foresights being father tim mask putting some heinous musical performance that lasts way too long dog baby wanting kill each other some reason loki looking baby with mask when it would be instantaneously faster if odin did it etc none these plot devices really amount anything when there are so many plot holes inconsistencies throughout film what also doesnt help is lackluster visual effects film made 11 years after 1994 original this film basically looks no better as cgi is very similar with no real improvement whats worse however is main character mask jamie kennedy mask just doesnt work as make up looks uncomfortable since he can barely move his face added plastic hair makes no sense whatsoever since jim carrey also had hair original but he was bald mask add fact that writing character lacks any charm its just basically worse every way overall this film just made me angry it wants be like original so bad but it constantly forgets what really made original so awesome begin with by focusing either copying or dumb ideas that make no sense grand scheme things there was no sense focus or cohesion be seen here whatsoever fact that this calls itself follow up is downright insulting do yourself favor let this one be forgotten realms obscurity as it is not only disgraceful its predecessor but it also has literally nothing going it,0.5977966101694915,-0.07429378531073445,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.26}"

Nine months later, little Alvey is born and has the powers of the mask. Loki, the god of mischief is looking for the mask and the baby.

1,Who green lighted this?,"I can just picture how this movie came to be:""So how else can we screw up our careers?"" ""I know! Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!""Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!"" ""Brilliant! Let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!"" And really, that's what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic.Nevertheless, if the movie didn't contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. For all it's massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. It's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out ""like me!"" but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.Jamie Kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. He clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It's too bad the character is wasted on this film, I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.The plot is so much by the books, I won't bother to mention it here. It's all so clearly obvious that even a Disney exec would be green with envy.Save your money, this one is heading to DVD in three months from the looks of it. Shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel.

1,Even Odin's magic couldn't save them,"It's so ridiculous and bland that I would not know where to start. This boring film is more directed to kids than the original from 1994, and the proof is that the magic of Jim Carrey movie here has completely disappeared. The director of the 1994 film, Chuck Russell, is conspicuously absent, and his position is usurped here by Lawrence Guterman, the same man over the helm in the intolerable ""Cats & Dogs"". The script was original, could be polished a lot, the concept of keeping in mind the very Loki was striking. But the role of the Mask is greatly ridiculed. The abuse of digital effects is CRIMINAL, it apparently beat Star Wars I, or go there I think. The main character is so stupid that I do not fall that ends well, one ends up preferring Loki and that he is the bad guy. Loki have good costumes, good makeup, good actor, perfect in appearance and look, but the rest of the story is a mess. The role of Odin rests with a veteran, who shows only pure rage and no expression. The baby and the dog play a supposed humor role:1. The dog's jealousy towards the baby; Is so original that it is a shame that it was ruined by the type of movie that turned out to be.2. The baby is the product of an error, and his computer image is as false as the charisma of the film.But some scenes of these two entities are memorable, it's a shame that they have been utterly overshadowed by this failed commercial sequel attempt. One of the worst movies of 2005.P.D. For all the reviewers that said that this movie is good because is targeted to kids, or praise Mr. Guterman because he directed a comedy with cats; go watch the animated TV series ""Kid vs. Kat"" (no pun intended) instead. This cartoon show is more funny than SotM, and also beats this monstrosity.",even odins magic couldnt save them,its so ridiculous bland that i would not know where start this boring film is more directed kids than original 1994 proof is that magic jim carrey movie here has completely disappeared director 1994 film chuck russell is conspicuously absent his position is usurped here by lawrence guterman same man over helm intolerable cats dogs script was original could be polished lot concept keeping mind very loki was striking but role mask is greatly ridiculed abuse digital effects is criminal it apparently beat star wars i or go there i think main character is so stupid that i do not fall that ends well one ends up preferring loki that he is bad guy loki have good costumes good makeup good actor perfect appearance look but rest story is mess role odin rests with veteran who shows only pure rage no expression baby dog play supposed humor role 1 dogs jealousy towards baby is so original that it is shame that it was ruined by type movie that turned out be 2 baby is product error his computer image is as false as charisma film but some scenes these two entities are memorable its shame that they have been utterly overshadowed by this failed commercial sequel attempt one worst movies 2005 p d all reviewers that said that this movie is good because is targeted kids or praise mr guterman because he directed comedy with cats go watch animated tv series kid vs kat no pun intended instead this cartoon show is more funny than sotm also beats this monstrosity,0.6360360360360362,0.11435006435006438,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"
