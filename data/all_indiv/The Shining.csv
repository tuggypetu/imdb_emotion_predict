10.0,One of my favorite films,"The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's ""Here's Johnny!""? Who could forget ""All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy""? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny, and Jack's wife, Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication ""shining."" Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain ""shine"" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word ""redrum"" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own ""imaginary friend."" Jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" formatted in various ways. Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written ""REDRUM"" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is ""Murder"" spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. ""Here's Johnny!"", and Jack's legendary image is born.The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack's rant All WorkÂ… is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection, it's been on The Simpsons, it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it, trust me.10/10",one my favorite films,shining you know whats weird about this movie this is movie that everyone people who claim not like horror films will always say that shining is terrific film this is stanley kubricks classic vision stephen kings horror tale madness blood this is just incredible film wither you have seen it or not you have heard it know few lines it know some classic images who could forget jacks heres johnny who could forget all work no play make jack dull boy who could forget that chilling ending this is film that is unforgettable honestly my opinion is kubricks best work i know there is lot argument that department lot people say its 2001 space odyssey or clockwork orange or even dr strangelove but if those film pioneered film making then shining perfected it this is tale isolation madness terrifying images ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin jack torrance jacks son danny jacks wife wendy arrive at overlook hotel closing day elderly african american chef dick hallorann surprises danny by speaking him telepathically offering him some ice cream he explains danny that he his grandmother shared gift they called communication shining danny asks if there is anything be afraid hotel particularly room 237 dick tells danny that hotel has certain shine it many memories not all them good advises him stay out room 237 under all circumstances dannys curiosity about room 237 finally gets better him when he sees room has been opened danny shows up injured visibly traumatized after jack tells wendy that he loves his family seeing this wendy thinks jack has been abusing danny jack wanders into hotels gold room where he meets ghostly bartender named lloyd danny starts calling out word redrum frantically scribbling it walls he goes into trance withdraws he now says that he is tony his own imaginary friend jack sabotages hotel radio cutting off communication outside world but hallorann has received dannys telepathic cry help is his way wendy discovers that jack has been typing endless pages manuscript repeating all work no play makes jack dull boy formatted various ways horrified jack threatens her she knocks him unconscious with baseball bat locking him storage locker kitchen jack converses with grady through door locker which then unlocks releasing him danny has written redrum lipstick door wendys bedroom when she looks mirror she sees that it is murder spelled backwards jack picks up axe begins chop through door leading his familys living quarters heres johnny jacks legendary image is born shining is one those films that you seriously have make time see this is incredible film still gives me nightmares jack nicholsons performance is timeless unforgettable but one i also feel is extremely overlooked is shelley duvall her scene finding jacks rant all work is incredible thats look horror you can see that fear her face after realizing her husband is mad also another incredible scene is when jack sees ghost woman bathtub its honestly one most terrifying scenes horror cinema reason this film is so well known is because its film perfection its been simpsons its been shown other films its film that will forever stay with you when you see it trust me 10 10,0.6873112659698024,0.14872241579558654,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,A classic horror from a master director,"When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.",classic horror master director,when jack torrance nicholson is offered job as winter caretaker overlook hotel he accepts it as opportunity work his novel isolated environment he is told stories last caretaker going mad butchering his family but isnt deterred he arrives at overlook hotel with his wife duvall child danny lloyd is shown around hotel by cook scatman crothers who has gift perception cook warns danny that hotel can be particular danger those with gift its only matter time before jack begins act increasingly erratic this is one jack nicholsons finest roles his increasingly unhinged character is amusing terrifying almost equal measures duvall plays role terrorised wife quite well she does look like shes genuinely filled with fear but doesnt have much else do lloyd is excellent as boy although he doesnt have too much emotion express however no doubt that this is jacks show story doesnt stick kings novel is better it this is kubricks shining film has plenty genuinely scary moments but manages keep creepy atmosphere all through especially as ghosts come out jack begins move between his reality reality that is gradually claiming him kubrick is excellent here his cold direction adds overall creep factor film its one best examples his masterful touch overall this is excellent horror movie because focus is horror fear rather than gore alone as with modern horrors jack is excellent one his best roles ever whole package is delivered cold creepy manner by sadly lost director,0.663888888888889,0.1602777777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,The best creepy horror movie involving isolation n eeriness. Also it captured the fear of the unseen in one of the best way.,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs, then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own.

,Eeriness surpassed by class,"Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad.",eeriness surpassed by class,sometimes all good horror needs is good idea but sometimes rarely indeed horror masterpiece will reach us by hand kubrick with adept elusive touch great artist guide vision we know what separates it all else okay story has enough promise that even hired gun would have try fail heck even stephen king himself didnt fare so bad its how kubrick perceives kings universe however how he fills frame with it that renders shining feast senses horror that will reach us through mind body alike assault as it were tending eventually its pitch crescendo yet curiously not without delicate lull kubricks cinema is as usually sight behold we get adventurous camera that prowls through lavish corridors overlook hotel like it is some kind mystic labyrinth rife exploration linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors symmetric grandeur geometrical approach how kubrick perceives space reminds me very much japanese directors some 10 years before that what is depicted frame elements narrative is borderline inconsequential how they all balance harmonize together certain images stand out this first shot jacks typewriter ominously accompanied by off screen thumps ball drums doom that seem emanate very walls or typewriter itself instrument doom itself as is later shown red river flowing through hotels elevators poetry slow motions jack hitting door with axe camera moving along with him tracking action as it happens as though its camera piercing through door not axe ultra fast zoom kids face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see two dead girls his pov course epochal bathroom scene much has been said jack nicholsons obtrusive overacting his mad is not entirely successful because well hes jack nicholson guy looks half mad anyway playing mad turns him into exaggerated caricature himself shelley duvall other hand is one most inspired casting choices kubrick ever made coming streak fantastic performances robert altman seventies 3 women thieves like us nashville she brings her character right amounts swanlike fragility emotional distress delicate detached thing thrown with mad,0.607470238095238,0.020833333333333343,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10.0,The greatest horror movie of all time.,"Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says. I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls. One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.'). The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.",greatest horror movie all time,okay okay maybe not greatest i mean exorcist psycho few others are hard pass up but shining is way up there it is however by far best stephen king story that has been made into movie its better than stand better than pet sematary if not quite as scary better than cujo better than green mile better dolores claiborne better than stand by me just barely though yes its better than shawshank redemption shut up its better i dont care what imdb top 250 says i read that couple decades ago stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying find one that might make good movie other room his wife would hear pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against wall frustration finally she didnt hear any noise almost two hours when she went check see if he had died his chair or something i tell this with all due respect course she found him concentrating book that he had his hand book was shining thank god too because he went convert that book into one best horror films ever stephen king can be thanked complexity story about man who takes his wife son up remote hotel oversee it during extremely isolated winter as he works his writing jack nicholson can be thanked his dead performance as jack torrance how many movies has jack been where he plays character named jack as well as his flawless delivery several now famous lines heeeeeeres johnny shelley duvall can be thanked giving performance that allows audience relate jacks desires kill her stanley kubrick can be thanked giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch whoever casting director was can be thanked scrounging up creepiest twins planet play part murdered girls one most significant aspects this movie necessary story as whole have its most significant effect is isolation its presents flawlessly film starts off with lengthy scene following jack as he drives up old hotel his interview job caretaker winter this is soon followed by same thing following jack his family as they drive up windy mountain road hotel this time scene is intermixed with shots jack wendy danny talking car which kubrick managed sneak quick suggestion about evils tv as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism front danny who says that its okay because hes already seen it tv see its okay he saw it television hotel itself is perfect setting story like this take place its bloody past is made much more frightening by huge echoing rooms long hallways these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize emptiness hotel but it is hallways that really created most scariness this movie kubricks traditional tracking shots give hallways creepy three dimensional feel early film there is famous tracking shot that follows danny large circle as he rides around halls his big wheel is that what those are called his relative speed as well as clunking made by wheels as he goes back forth hardwood floors throw rugs gives feeling not knowing what is around corner being stephen king story you expect something jump out at you i think that best scene halls as well as one scariest film is when danny is playing floor ball rolls slowly up him he looks up sees long empty hallway because ball is something childs toy you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it him anyway you get point shining is damn scary movie besides having rare quality being horror film that doesnt suck shining has very depth story that really keeps you guessing leaves you with feeling that there was something that you missed had jack always been there like mr grady told him mens room was he really at that ball 1921 or is that just someone who looks exactly like him if he has always been caretaker as mr grady also said does that mean that it was him that went crazy killed his wife twin daughters not mr grady after all its one thing film leave loose ends that should have been tied thats just mediocre filmmaking example amityville horror which obviously copied much shining as far as its subject matter did this but it is entirely different when film is presented way that really makes you think as mostly all kubricks movies are one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick we should thank him is not throwing this book against wall that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy,0.5252451849226043,0.17065264484619314,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,A masterpiece of psychological horror,"Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast.",masterpiece psychological horror,stephen king may have said master director knew nothing about horror but that simply is not true that is too biased opinion anyone go given that he wrote book which kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely at any rate faithful or not kubricks shining best crafted genre film 80s performs its duty as fright flick then some there are appropriately no words strong enough convey haunting beauty visuals showcased throughout movie drive overlook final chase hedgemaze movie is feast eyes as it is mind it is feast mind as shining is as psychological as horror gets toying relentlessly expertly with your emotions expectations some could even say sadistically throwing something thats completely out left field never ever letting you catch your breath between now classic shocks as movie speeds toward its memorable conclusion last half hour kudos are order kubrick director old school style who builds eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over filmic environment manipulating everything down tiniest detail suit needs picture yet filming with coldly detatched objective eye as though kubrick were making documentary about these events this would account dialouge which thankfully is not typical phoney balloney hollywood banter kubrick detractors king purists usually bitch about this most having been weaned phony nature hollywood talk which is usually nothing at all like real talk many us speak nose do not try convey subtext through use carefully chosen words that articulate our state being without being direct this light shelley duvall must be commended her performance which is very naturalistic it does not seem like acting at all she is not concerned with glamour nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops but rather she is solely focussed hitting emotional highpoints her character as wendy gradually comes realize that her husband is madman lets face it folks how many us would like million bucks when placed situation like that who does not look like blubbering idiot when they are hysterical thats what i thought so what did you expect she was great say nothing rest cast,0.47979153637690225,0.05884198457369188,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Fact: Kubrick is better than King,"It's well know that Stephen King doesn't like Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining (so much so that he scripted an abysmal TV movie version). According to him, Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well, I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions, cheap tricks and tired clichÃ©s. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words, it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot Â– as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well, can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bug-eyed, bucktoothed Olive Oil look-a-like.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel, he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked - he's got to spend months alone with these people; one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there. It merely brings everything to the surface Â– Jack's resentment as regards his wife, his frustration as regards his lack of writing talent and his annoyance at having a troubled son. It's kind of like he's testing his family. Are they strong enough as a unit to survive being cooped up together?One of the underlying themes in the film seems to be television. What happens in The Shining is what happens when someone stops watching the idiot box. With it, a person can find solace in mindless programming and retreat from the strictures of family life. Without it they're faced with all their problems and all the failings of their loved ones. Even the strongest family can be brought to its knees when there's no escape from each other's company. Therefore it's quite telling, when Jack loses the plot completely, that he spouts lines from TV: ""Honey, I'm home"" and ""Here's Johnny."" Just watch some television, Jack.But it's also the pain of writing that contributes to Jack's insanity. There's nothing quite as harrowing as an empty page. Plus there's nothing more annoying than being interrupted mid-flow. One of the best scenes in the film is when Jack tells his wife to get lost when she interrupts him. It's extremely violent in how cold Jack is towards Wendy. And because it's grounded in a reality, it's all the more effective.Also rather unsettling is the scene where Jack talks to his son. He makes Danny sit on his lap and he proceeds to tell him how much he loves him and how he'd never hurt him. It works so well because it's so cold and because there's such an obvious lack of affection. The words are just empty platitudes. They mean absolutely nothing.Jack's true feelings are only revealed when he gets to talk to Lloyd. It's in this scene that you realise the marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be Â– Wendy has never forgiven him for accidentally hurting his son. And it's also in this scene that you realise (as if you hadn't noticed earlier) that Jack is absolutely crackers. He's talking to ghosts. But they could also be figments of his imagination, for there are mirrors behind most of the ghosts he talks to. Effectively he's talking to himself. And I love this matter of fact way of dealing with the supernatural. There are no fancy tricks. Everything just seems unnaturally natural.In fact, everything to do with the ghosts is superbly handled. The twins are spooky, Lloyd is amiable and Grady is out of his mind. And it's Grady who's probably the most chilling presence in the film. He starts off as a bumbling waiter but then quickly becomes a stone cold killer. Just the way he says 'corrected' conveys more terror than a million slasher films. And Philip Stone's performance is a million times more subtle than Nicholson's. I mean, as much as I like Jack in the film, he does chew the scenery. But Kubrick likes his over the top performances, so that's the way he wanted it.And undoubtedly it's Kubrick's movie. He's the real star. And I love everything he brings to the film. I love his command of lighting Â– just look at The Gold Room scenes. I love his use of music. I love the way that he turns the Room 237 scene, one that could have been a standard 'jump' scene, into a comment on Jack's marriage Â– his willingness to be unfaithful. I love the way that he leaves lots of unanswered questions. I love the shots of the blood coming out of the lift. I love the helicopter shots at the start. I love the way that pages and pages of typed words are the most frightening visual in the film. I love the maze. I love the fact that you see a ghost getting a blow-job from a ghost in a bear suitÂ… Man, I love absolutely everything about this film.

It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie!

,Best Horror Film I've Ever Seen,"When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since.

10.0,"Better than the novel, by far","Probably the most popular and easily accessible Kubrick film in existence, THE SHINING is a film I've seen plenty of times over the years and yet it's a movie that never gets old. Part of the reason for that is the professionalism of the director; his cinematography is exceptional, really bringing the Overlook Hotel to life so that it becomes a character in itself.As well as being superb-looking, THE SHINING is both a creepy and exceptionally entertaining movie. It's far more effective than the Stephen King novel on which it was based, purely because it takes a more realistic approach to the material: you can argue perfectly correctly that this is a psychological tale of terror in which all of the events take place in the minds of the protagonists. Gone are the living hedges of the King novels, elements which Kubrick rightly realised wouldn't translate to the screen very well (check out the '90s THE SHINING TV miniseries to see how they did).Kubrick's main beef with the film is that the Jack Nicholson character seems psychotic from the outset, a contrast to his rational character in the book. But Nicholson is what makes this film a real delight to watch; he's a fantastic psycho and probably the most entertaining cinematic psychopath, better even than Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates. Duvall and Lloyd are fine, of course, but it's Nicholson who makes this such a compelling production. Finally, Kubrick throws in plenty of creepy stylistic techniques, like the subliminal images and some truly grotesque imagery, which makes this a chilly, frightening classic and one of the best 'haunted house' flicks in existence.",better than novel by far,probably most popular easily accessible kubrick film existence shining is film ive seen plenty times over years yet its movie that never gets old part reason that is professionalism director his cinematography is exceptional really bringing overlook hotel life so that it becomes character itself as well as being superb looking shining is both creepy exceptionally entertaining movie its far more effective than stephen king novel which it was based purely because it takes more realistic approach material you can argue perfectly correctly that this is psychological tale terror which all events take place minds protagonists gone are living hedges king novels elements which kubrick rightly realised wouldnt translate screen very well check out 90s shining tv miniseries see how they did kubricks main beef with film is that jack nicholson character seems psychotic outset contrast his rational character book but nicholson is what makes this film real delight watch hes fantastic psycho probably most entertaining cinematic psychopath better even than anthony perkinss norman bates duvall lloyd are fine course but its nicholson who makes this such compelling production finally kubrick throws plenty creepy stylistic techniques like subliminal images some truly grotesque imagery which makes this chilly frightening classic one best haunted house flicks existence,0.6242063492063493,0.23354700854700852,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.5}"
8.0,One of the scariest movies ever---8/10,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project.

5.0,Equivocation,"This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?Ah well. ""What if""s never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery.

,A truly brilliant and scary film from Stanley Kubrick.,"I can't praise this film long enough!The Shining is, without doubt, one of Stanley Kubrick's undisputed masterpieces and a true classic in horror cinema. It is a film that, over the course of the years, has managed to scare the living hell out of its audiences (and still does). The film is an adaptation of Stepehen King's original novel, written in the late '70s, and although the film is not very loyal to the book, it still stands as a thing of its own.Right from the beginning, as we contemplate the car going to the hotel from those stunning aerial shots, deeply inside us we know that something in the film, somehow, sometime is going to go wrong. As we obtain that severe warning, an almost inaudible voice gently whispers to us 'sit tight', a sense of unexpectedness invades us all, and it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand on end throughout out the entire movie. The plot is simple: Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in up in the secluded mountains of Colorado. Jack, being a family man, takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel to keep him company throughout the long, isolated nights. During their stay, strange things occur when Jack's son Danny sees gruesome images powered by a force called 'the shining' and Jack is heavily affected by this. Along with writer's block and the demons of the hotel haunting him, Jack has a complete mental breakdown and the situation takes a sinister turn for the worse.The film, unlike many horror-oriented films nowadays, doesn't only rely on stomach-churning and gory images (which it does contain, anyway) but on the incredibly scary music based on the works of BÃ©la BartÃ³k and on the excellent cinematography (the Steadicam is superbly used, giving us a sense of ever-following evil), as well. The terrifying mood and atmosphere of the film is carefully and masterfully woven by Kubrick, who clearly knows how to really make a horror movie.Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as the mad father and husband is as over the top as it is brilliant. Shelley Duvall, who plays the worrying wife who tries to help her son, is also a stand out; she shows a kind of trembling fear in many scenes and is able to display weakness and vulnerability in a very convincing way. Undoubtedly, The Shining is full of memorable moments (the elevator scene or the 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' one-liner for instance) and, simply put, it's flawlessly brilliant.Stanley Kubrick's direction is pure excellence, giving the whole film a cold and atmospheric look, thus creating an unbearable sense of paranoia and terror. There are moments of sheer brilliance and exquisite perfection in this film; the horrifying maze chase is a perfect example. Every single shot is masterfully created and there are some genuinely scary scenes which will make you sit on the edge of your seat.The Shining is, in my opinion, a special landmark in horror cinema which will always be regarded as one of the scariest movies in film history. Since I saw it last year, when I was 13, I have rarely been able to have a bath in my bathtub.Just in case, ya know. Overall, The Shining is incomparably the scariest film I've ever seen in my whole life (and I can tell you I've seen a great deal of horror films).It is an unforgettable, chilling, majestic and truly, profoundly scary film crafted by an eccentric genius who wants to show that the impossible can be done. The Shining is a sublime, hauntingly intriguing and endlessly watchable film that shows Kubrick at his best.",truly brilliant scary film stanley kubrick,i cant praise this film long enough shining is without doubt one stanley kubricks undisputed masterpieces true classic horror cinema it is film that over course years has managed scare living hell out its audiences still does film is adaptation stepehen kings original novel written late 70s although film is not very loyal book it still stands as thing its own right beginning as we contemplate car going hotel those stunning aerial shots deeply inside us we know that something film somehow sometime is going go wrong as we obtain that severe warning almost inaudible voice gently whispers us sit tight sense unexpectedness invades us all it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand end throughout out entire movie plot is simple jack torrance jack nicholson becomes caretaker overlook hotel up secluded mountains colorado jack being family man takes his wife shelley duvall son danny lloyd hotel keep him company throughout long isolated nights during their stay strange things occur when jacks son danny sees gruesome images powered by force called shining jack is heavily affected by this along with writers block demons hotel haunting him jack has complete mental breakdown situation takes sinister turn worse film unlike many horror oriented films nowadays doesnt only rely stomach churning gory images which it does contain anyway but incredibly scary music based works b la bart k excellent cinematography steadicam is superbly used giving us sense ever following evil as well terrifying mood atmosphere film is carefully masterfully woven by kubrick who clearly knows how really make horror movie jack nicholsons powerful performance as mad father husband is as over top as it is brilliant shelley duvall who plays worrying wife who tries help her son is also stand out she shows kind trembling fear many scenes is able display weakness vulnerability very convincing way undoubtedly shining is full memorable moments elevator scene or heeeeeeres johnny one liner instance simply put its flawlessly brilliant stanley kubricks direction is pure excellence giving whole film cold atmospheric look thus creating unbearable sense paranoia terror there are moments sheer brilliance exquisite perfection this film horrifying maze chase is perfect example every single shot is masterfully created there are some genuinely scary scenes which will make you sit edge your seat shining is my opinion special landmark horror cinema which will always be regarded as one scariest movies film history since i saw it last year when i was 13 i have rarely been able have bath my bathtub just case ya know overall shining is incomparably scariest film ive ever seen my whole life i can tell you ive seen great deal horror films it is unforgettable chilling majestic truly profoundly scary film crafted by eccentric genius who wants show that impossible can be done shining is sublime hauntingly intriguing endlessly watchable film that shows kubrick at his best,0.662550875050875,0.1136288608510831,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Music and psychology,"A frustrated writer takes a job as caretaker at a deserted hotel, undisturbed at the news of the location's murderous past, and seals himself up through the bleak winter with his wife and son. But the past never leaves the present ...Plenty of comprehensive reviews for this masterpiece, so I'll make just two points.Music makes up about half the effect of a horror movie, but this baby goes even further. Apart from a couple of quiet scenes near the beginning, it never lets up yet never overwhelms. The opening drive through the mountains is full of ominous synth, and the first act is all atonal and unsettling. We switch in preparation for going through the looking glass - Room 237 - when the music becomes orchestral and structured, with multiplying tritones struck in ghastly sequence as Danny first notices the key in the lock. The music returns to atonal, but orchestral this time, as the evil worms its way into the characters. At the climax, we're hit with a satanic choir, and finish off with eerie dance music from the '20s. Add in the sound design, with the wheels on carpet and board, Tony's mutterings, the chilling rhythm of the dialogue in the red toilet and the stairway scenes, and it all works brilliantly.Second, many say this is a psychological horror, but I disagree. It's clear from the off that Jack Torrance is a man with no centre - a pleaser and a conniver and a bully - so it's a question of when, not if, he loses control, and there's no pyschological progression. I imagine Kubrick would have considered that trite, and preferred instead to use the characters as one of many frames to create the effect of evil, so it becomes a total cinematic horror. Essential that we go through the looking glass, and this is where we get the progression, from the music at the moment Danny passes the room, through the sound effect at Jack's falling into a nightmare, to Wendy's close up on discovering the typed pages, and to the point where she herself experiences the visions, not just Danny and Jack.

9.0,Not so scary incredible film,"Horror films are not my cup of tea. But The Shining has gotten me to reconsider this preference. With an incredible performance by Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, I might even say it is one of the best I've ever seen. Meanwhile, considering this movie is a horror film, it always keeps you on your toes. While also being a compact story and with few actors making the film more intriguing and heart wrenching.The Shining is a disturbing film from the 80s. It's not so much scary for the audience, but there's always a creepy feeling luring over you. With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, performing one of the best roles I've seen. Playing a so convincing role It's almost frightening. With so many memorable scenes it's impressive how well the actors performed.Meanwhile, the storyline during the entire film is disturbing and alluring, it also manages to be beautiful. Director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a masterpiece. With beautiful angels, use of lightning and scenes. I can tell you that there is no error in the creation of this masterpiece.I highly recommend you watch The Shining. Truly one of the best horror films ever made.

9.0,Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10",amazing achievement filmmaking art terror,chilling majestic piece cinematic fright this film combines all great elements intellectual thriller with grand vision director who has instinctual capacity pace moody horror flick within realm his filmmaking genius that includes eye original shot ice cold soundtrack overall sense dehumanization this movie cuts through all typical horror movies like red poker through human eye as it allows viewer not only feel violence psychosis its protagonist but appreciate seed which derangement stems one scariest things people face is unknown this film presents its plotting with just that thought mind setting is perfect desolate winter hideaway quietness moment is character itself as fermenting aggressor jack torrances mind wallows this idle time breeds devils new playground i always felt like presence evil was dormant all our minds with only circumstances moment reasons given therein needed wake its violent ass pounce over its unsuspecting victims this film is perfect example this very thought it is within this films subtle touches canvas clackity clacks young boys big wheel riding along empty hallways hotel labyrinthian garden representing minds fine line between sane insane kubricks purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors set mis arrangements that we discover world guided by righteous tangible but coaxed away by powerful unknown i have never read book upon which film is based but without that as comparison point i am proud say that this is one most terrifying films that i have ever seen i thought that runtime film couldve been cut by little bit but then again i am not one most acclaimed directors history film so maybe i should keep my two cent criticisms over superb film myself all all this movie captures your attention with its grand form vision ropes you with some terror eccentric direction ties you down stabs you heart with its cold eyed view mans mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere loss humanity rating 9 10,0.6522788864252279,0.04353596945060359,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.22}"

10.0,Kubrick's Masterpiece of Horror Lives On!,"*!!- SPOILERS - !!*Before I begin this, let me say that I have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the ""Authorized Version"" of this movie, remade by Stephen King, himself, in 1997.Both advantages made me appreciate this version of ""The Shining,"" all the more.Also, let me say that I've read Mr. King's book, ""The Shining"" on many occasions over the years, and while I love the book and am a huge fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling ... and SCARY.Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film. In the direction of the movie AND the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title ""Magus"" beyond question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more.The Torrences (Jack, Wendy his wife and Danny, their son) are living in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been hired as the caretaker. It is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the Overlook reopens its doors. It seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the Colorado Mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time ""welcoming"" atmosphere, itself. The furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach to the Overlook, it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world.The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of their past, Danny's ""imaginary friend,"" Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene. There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning.Closing Day. Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the Hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.The initial tour through the Overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the ""staff"" is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. ""They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors."" (Wendy Torrence) Even the ""staff wing"" is well designed and beautifully built.The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting. ""I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out."" (The Hotel Manager)Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with Wendy and ""Doc."" His explanation of ""the shining"" to Danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel. It was believable and sincere.The cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie. It also marks the ""half-way-to-hell"" point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful. (So WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?! It just shows her marvelous diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said,"" What? Olive Oyl? *lol* (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took that back as soon as the movie started. She's brilliant.  In this Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date! (Although I did love her in Steve Martin's ""Roxanne,"" 1987.)Once Kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession: the Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony; the history of the Hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not ""mental,"" but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the Hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.The two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times to Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time. They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father. He was...""the little boy who lives in my mouth."" He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny. NOT like in the book, I realize, where Tony was intended by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when Tony ""took ... Danny ... over."" The idea of Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.The ""Woman in the Shower"" scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting. It was dramatic, and frightening. Abhorrent and scary. When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.Jack quickly embarks on his trek from the ""jonesing"" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person. The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ...""hair of the dog that bit me."" (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack. ""Orders from the house."" (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice play on words.When Wendy find's Jack's ""screenplay"" is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, ""How do you like it?"" and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant. It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence. That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly THE strongest scene of the movie.The ""REDRUM"" scene. Wow. What do I say? What mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming ""REDRUM"" over and over? Even if it HAD no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL. It was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed). Speaking of memorable scenes...Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history. His ad-libbed line, ""Heeeeere's Johnny!"" was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It also goes down in horror movie history.The ending..? Kubrick's ending was perfection. I felt it ended beautifully. No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie. Just epitomized perfection. That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending.Who cares what was taken out?! Look what Kubrick put IN. Rent it, watch it, BUY IT. It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. IT RAWKS!!*Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 ""Authorized"" version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section. That's where it belongs. .: This movie rates a 9.98 from the Fiend :.",kubricks masterpiece horror lives,spoilers before i begin this let me say that i have had both advantages seeing this movie big

9.0,Very Good; But Could Have Been Great,"I always try hard not to compare media. Unfortunately, I had read the King novel just before seeing the movie. There are plot elements that could have been included that would have made this a much better movie. One of the things is ""the shining"" itself, the supernatural abilities of the young boy. The character of Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is used up with virtually no effect on the plot. I don't know why King allowed that to happen, because it weakens so badly the chance of the victims to escape. The topiary could have been used to a better advantage as well. The way things are, it is too one sided. That being said, I think the Nicholson role is awesome. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It has enough shadows and manipulation of the supernatural to really be frightening. I loved when Jack was telling the man who hires him what a great opportunity this was for him to work. He's about as wolfy and sly as he can be. Of course, when he finally gets there, the hotel takes over and he begins to become that wolf. One of the most terrifying moments in all of film is when Shelly Duvall , the wife, picks up all the pages he has typed and they are just gibberish. Kubrick plays with us in grand style. I saw the movie a few years after my first viewing, and because the book was behind me, I enjoyed it a great deal more, even though I knew the events unfolding.

10.0,"Whether you want black comedy or horror, Kubrick delivers it all with this one.","... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing (""five months of peace is just what I want... "") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic.
