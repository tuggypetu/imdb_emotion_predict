9.0,'Crime does pay' so does this movie...,"Wow... finally a breakthrough . For us Tamilians the time has come to bid adieu to Hollywood movies from directors like Guy Ritchie for we've got one here. Definitely a world class characterization filled with black comedy with no words to describe. Vijay Sethupathy does it again selecting an excellent script. Everyone in the movie has a definite role. The Indian political 'Thamasha' is dealt superbly with a couple of scenes near the climax. There are a number of favorite scenes in this movie but the best was at the CM's office talking to his minister and the son (I avoid spoiler by not saying more).I paid 150 bucks to watch this movie at a local theater. This movie paid well and even more, for a movie fan like me. Waiting eagerly for more movies of this sort from the team.",crime does pay so does this movie,wow finally breakthrough us tamilians time has come bid adieu hollywood movies directors like guy ritchie weve got one here definitely world class characterization filled with black comedy with no words describe vijay sethupathy does it again selecting excellent script everyone movie has definite role indian political thamasha is dealt superbly with couple scenes near climax there are number favorite scenes this movie but best was at cms office talking his minister son i avoid spoiler by not saying more i paid 150 bucks watch this movie at local theater this movie paid well even more movie fan like me waiting eagerly more movies this sort team,0.6020833333333333,0.33958333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.47, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,"A dark comedy that never forgets its basic rule to entertain. It's darker themes are ingeniously conveyed, but never does Soodhu Kuvoom lose its ability to Make Us Laugh!","Soodhu Kuvoom is a dark comedy built on themes of unemployment, kidnapping, blackmailing, police brutality, fake encounter and corruption but not even for a split second does it forget that it is first and foremost a dark comedy, and never it its manic energy lost or its comedy sacrificed while handling its heavyweight themes. The film never breaks its basic rules, and even when you feel at moments that it may go off-course, the story ingeniously swerves to its original course. Take for instance a scene from the movie when the four lead characters are arrested on charges of kidnapping and taken to court; that's when you go ""Oh no, now they're going to spend the rest of the hour turning the film into a silly courtroom drama"" but no, that's when Soodhu Kuvoom hilariously reminds us that it won't break its fundaments, and that is to be a rip-roaring dark comedy. So, in a humorous twist, the 'victim' (who's actually the mastermind' who fakes his kidnapping, is actually kidnapped, connives with his kidnappers, then gives them a slip) denies that the four kidnapped him and the case is dismissed immediately. The tone of the film is both consistent and cautious, never forgetting how it should be presented yet driving its message home superbly. Bollywood films usually have a tendency to forget very easily the original tone of their projects – a film that's extremely funny till interval will abruptly turn into a cloying melodrama post-interval to cater to sentimental audiences, and sensible audiences are left thinking ""Hey wait, wasn't I watching a comedy before I headed to the restroom during the intermission? Did the filmmakers flush it down the toilet to fart out a silly melodrama suddenly?"". Maybe Bollywood could take a few lessons from Tamil films like Soodhu Kuvoom and get it's sh*t together. It's safe to say that none of the men in Soodhu Kuvoom is a saint, and everybody explores shows their dark side and plays dirty to get their share of cake. But there's angst and a desperation which drives them to taking the shortcut to wealth and success. Our leading man Das, is an amateur kidnapper who's more afraid of offending his victim and the victim's relatives while demanding the ransom money. He assures the victim's relatives that they do not need to worry about the victim's well-being and the victim is safe and comfortable under his care. His ransom demands are petty and the funniest part is that he tips each victim from the ransom money after setting them free. These absurdities are nothing when we come to the part of Das' invisible friend Shalu, who's only visible to Das and is the accomplice to his crimes. The three other men, Kesavan, Sekhar and Paglavan are buddies who are unemployed, one being fired for defending himself against allegations of misbehaving with a female coworker, the other being jobless bum and the third driven away from hometown. Fate (a drunken brawl) brings these four men together and then their journey of kidnapping begins. This is shown in a flat-out hilarious sequence, where we see people of all ages and personalities being kidnapped and let go soon; there's one lady who shows no signs of panic and coolly continues chattering on her cell- phone even after being kidnapped. In one of their crimes, the victim's parent, calls them and requests them to kidnap the son of Minister Gnanodhayam. The parent happens to be the brother of a contractor who was arrested under Gnanodhayam's orders on charges of bribery, and he wants to extract revenge upon the Minister. So, all he wants our four heroes to do is to kidnap Gnanodhayan's son, Arumai and ask for two crores as ransom. The heroes agree and pursue Arumai one day but are left baffled when another group of men kidnap him in front of their eyes before they can make their move. Later, dressed as policemen, they try to rescue-kidnap Arumai and realize on finding him that the guy had staged his own kidnapping. Later the five (six if the invisible girl's to be included) try to bilk Arumai's father and share the money amongst themselves. Their plan is successful until Arumai, the clever fox gives the others a slip and an unforgiving, rule-bending cop is deployed to root out the culprits. The thing that made me happiest while watching this film was that it brought me closer to my true roots, my South Indian blood. This is the first time I'm watching a Tamil film and I have lived nineteen whole years in India, and this film made me understand what a crowd-pleasing entertaining truly is. Mainstream Bollywood films are too obsessed with fair looks and toned bodies, so much that its six-pack or size-zero which decides who the biggest stars are. The actors in Soodhu Kuvoom would barely last in Bollywood because they neither have the looks nor the figure to make it in a mainstream Bollywood blockbuster, but the natural, earthy and indigenous charisma which these actors possess is something the Bollywood bandwagon (with exceptions, of course) can only dream of. No one here mugs for the camera, and we know these actors are acting to entertain their audience. Even the eye-candy Shalu, played by a gorgeous Sanchita Shetty, has a worthy role in the film, which is rare in Bollywood. Everyone in this world has a dark side, says Soodhu Kavoom, and most are driven under desperation to play dirty, and in this bad bad world, dishonesty is the road to success. And what happens to rules? Well, weren't they always meant to be broken?More on sashankkini.wordpress.com/‎",dark comedy that never forgets its basic rule entertain its darker themes are ingeniously conveyed but never does

8.0,Excellent Movie for all those who were bored of the regulars,"Firstly the movie isn't usual. Though many movies are there with having the protagonist as negative or socially immoral have received good response, this movie has multiple protagonist in it. It looks like Vijay Sethupathi(Das) is the lead character. But there is a lot of turns that are steered by the Kesavan's character who is not negative in the initially. Keeping the female character as imaginary was sheer brilliance. The BGM looks to have some reference from the Oceans Eleven in some places. But its supports the movie completely. There is justification bought in the end of the movie with the fact that no act by anyone has a complete good/bad and the acts of Das bought only minimal bad :)",excellent movie all those who were bored regulars,firstly movie isnt usual though many movies are there with having protagonist as negative or socially immoral have received good response this movie has multiple protagonist it it looks like vijay sethupathi das is lead character but there is lot turns that are steered by kesavans character who is not negative initially keeping female character as imaginary was sheer brilliance bgm looks have some reference oceans eleven some places but its supports movie completely there is justification bought end movie with fact that no act by anyone has complete good bad acts das bought only minimal bad,0.49000000000000005,0.049166666666666685,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8.0,Strange story and characters with hilarious results,"The characters are strange. A kidnapper who hallucinates the female lead's character, Shalu. He loves his Hallucination so much that he stopped taking the medicines his doctor prescribed. Then there is the valet who got fired for taking his customer's vehicle for a joy ride.

The fourth guy was sexually harassed at the workplace but when he tried speaking up the woman claims that it was he who harassed her instead. Unable to take it as the manager was siding with her, he scolds him and gets blacklisted in the process. These three jobless guys meet the kidnapper during a brawl at a pub. The kidnapper trusting these three for aiding him reveals his amazing and hilarious rules of kidnapping without getting caught.Kednapping (was misspelt in the film for comedic reasons) 1.stay clear of people with power 2.no unwanted threats 3.Small affordable amounts 4.no arms 5.

The most solid of the new breed actors Vijay Sethupathy as the 40 plus anti-hero and all new actors in supporting cast are apt and they make the film crackle Vijay Sethupathy steals the show with his shaggy salt and pepper beard and a paunch. His body language and dialogue delivery makes the character come alive Sanchita Shetty as his girlfriend is smashing and delivers some one- liners with perfect lip sync. It is one of the best films to have emerged out of Kollywood in a long, long time ' Soodhu Kavvum' marks a hat-trick of successes for Vijay Sethupathy after the thriller 'Pizza' and the situational comedy 'Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom'. His knack of choosing good roles and working with new directors brimming with ideas will stand him in good stead, as also the work he puts in to portray each character. He put on weight and grew a beard to play Das, and the look fits him to a 'T'.

9.0,Excellent produce of Indian cinema,"Saw this movie today and I cannot remember when was the last time a movie made me laugh so much. The movie is a dark comedy with a brilliant script which meanders through the various realms of life that make of a typical Indian. The joblessness of youth, the dreams of a bright future, the authoritarian dad, the protective sentimental mom, the prodigal son, the loyal friends, the bullying rule-keepers, the ingenious cousins, the mythical sensual flame, fate's impeccable sense of humour, the Indian polity...it has all these stereotypes brilliantly inter-woven into a brilliant dark comedy. In many ways it reminds one of Guy Ritchie movies, and in many ways it reminds one of ""Ek Chaalis ki last local"" and again in many ways of ""Jaane bhi do yaaron"". In a way, this movie is an amalgamation of these and perhaps much more, but yet stays unerringly true to its own Chennaisque character. Very clever movie, and a salute to the director, scriptwriter and the actors (Vijay Sethupathy in particular) for pulling off a wonderful job and making a clever and entertaining movie.

7.0,"Finally a Super-Duper Hit Crime Comedy with terrific use of dark humour after a long wait. Perhaps, the best in the decade.","Soodhu Kavvum (2013) : Brief Review -Finally a Super-Duper Hit Crime Comedy with terrific use of dark humour after a long wait. Perhaps, the best in the decade. Have been thinking about crime comedies made in India and the last Classic i remember in this genre was Hera Pheri (2000) if you term it as a crime comedy and if not then it's a way back in 80s Jane Bhi Do Yaaro which literally makes the only Classic in this genre. When it comes to dark or black comedies people try to handle political references very carefully, but I don't understand why? Why does it matter when you are making a Comedy or a Satire? In black comedy or satire you can troll anything you wish with the only condition that it should relate to the reality and make sense with the dark humour. That's all there is to it but hardly few filmmakers understood it and those who didn't understand this basic thing, went on to make regular comedies and not a memorable one. With Soodhu Kavvum, Tamil cinema has cracked the code of a whole new equation altogether. This isn't just a crime comedy or a black comedy or a satire or a humourous comedy but it is a never seen before combo of everything mentioned here. Now because it come from Regional cinema, it was expected to have some unintelligent cinematic sequences but that's not a big issue i guess. Many classic comedies have had the same bluffs but we all overlook them for the sake of brilliant show in rest of the narrative. The film is about a kidnapping which goes wrong and then it has plenty of crispy elements and twists to follow. All the actors are fine in their roles, the screenplay is engaging, half the dialogues are humourous and rest half are typically funny, the humour is genuinely satirical and Nalan Kumarasamy's direction is very much gripping. Overall, a great dark comedy after a while and a much needed break from cheap & regular comedy flicks.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",finally super duper hit crime comedy with terrific use dark humour after long wait perhaps best decade,soodhu kavvum 2013 brief review finally super duper hit crime comedy with terrific use dark humour after long wait perhaps best decade have been thinking about crime comedies made india last classic i remember this genre was hera pheri 2000 if you term it as crime comedy if not then its way back 80s jane bhi do yaaro which literally makes only classic this genre when it comes dark or black comedies people try handle political references very carefully but i dont understand why why does it matter when you are making comedy or satire black comedy or satire you can troll anything you wish with only condition that it should relate reality make sense with dark humour thats all there is it but hardly few filmmakers understood it those who didnt understand this basic thing went make regular comedies not memorable one with soodhu kavvum tamil cinema has cracked code whole new equation altogether this isnt just crime comedy or black comedy or satire or humourous comedy but it is never seen before combo everything mentioned here now because it come regional cinema it was expected have some unintelligent cinematic sequences but thats not big issue i guess many classic comedies have had same bluffs but we all overlook them sake brilliant show rest narrative film is about kidnapping which goes wrong then it has plenty crispy elements twists follow all actors are fine their roles screenplay is engaging half dialogues are humourous rest half are typically funny humour is genuinely satirical nalan kumarasamys direction is very much gripping overall great dark comedy after while much needed break cheap regular comedy flicks rating 7 5 10 by,0.46394342836650526,0.09146853146853148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.22}"

,Kednaping in 'that' room,"One of the most hilarious movies made in recent times, this one showcases how some minimalist-yet-efficient can elevate even a simple, plot supported by some excellent writing, direction, editing and performances.Set in today's urban India, without dwelling on the way unemployment is all-pervasive, along with lackadaisical attitudes to work itself, and the way life has become cheap in the face of blatant flouting of the rule of law and everything society needs to keep the criminal element in their limits, or behind bars.In another mainstream flick, this could have been the typical honest cop and politician taking their time and attitude to clean up the dregs of society, but in débutantes Kumarasamy and Kavineyam's deft hands, turning the typical trope around, and narrating it without making it heavy-handed from the typical heroic perspective, elevates the material into something that has to be experienced in order to gain the full extent to which one can be entertained.To be circumspect, I was not impressed with the way it all began, but once I got past the first 15/20 minutes, and the montage of what the main crew was up to commenced in earnest, I was hooked.This movie has surprises galore, with the way the quirks of the gang-leader have been presented - it allows us to poke fun at those elements, but always treats him with respect in spite of those, and Vijay Sethupathy, like in all of the other works he's done, never drops character. His sequences with his girlfriend, in the midst of all the planning and all the action, are a treat to behold, for a movie that never loses focus from the 5 tenets of, ehrm, kednaping. Evoked 'Neram', while also reminding how much better realized this was than the former, with both of them having various elements in common:An almost doc-level appreciation of today's urban milieu, treated with utmost sincerity and respect.Real characters uttering realistic lines, and not getting away with anything they do. Actions have consequences, and no (ehrm, good?) deed goes unpunished. None.Almost treading into creepy area, with the subject matter, but keeping the tone light nevertheless.Cinematography, prod design, art and sound design, along with the score in service only to content, that is ultimately controlled by the maker.1 excellent teenmaar song, in this case being 'Kaasu Pannam Duddu Money Money'. Where 'Neram' failed, IMO, was in taking a few artistic liberties that would not have seemed out-of-place in a mainstream flick, but did stand out there like sore thumbs, to use an oft-repeated cliché time and again. This one, on the other hand, embraced its Indie roots, and stayed true to that. It was nice to see Ashok Selvan (Thegidi) joining hands with both Simha (Jigarthanda, Neram) and RJ Ramesh Thilak (Neram) and the whole thing, to me, worked as an Indie ensemble. I will look forward to seeing anything this team works on in the future as well, while remaining surprised that the writer and the director have not made anything since this one. Joined as they are by veterans Radha Ravi (have not seen him in many, but he has been slumming too) and MS Bhaskar (also in character throughout - nice little feat). It was also nice to see Karunakaran and Yog Japee (he looked familiar) for the first time, and I am curious to see other works they're in. As I mentioned earlier, in a different genre of movie, Japee would've been the main lead. And that, would've been one hell of a boring yarn.And oh, Santhosh Narayanan (Cuckoo, Jigarthanda) did the score. Not to be missed. Not in cinemas, but do purchase the DVD. I'm super-glad I bought mine, and look forward to introduce this to like-minded enthusiasts.",kednaping that room,one most hilarious movies made recent times this one showcases how some minimalist yet efficient can elevate even simple plot supported by some excellent writing direction editing performances set todays urban india without dwelling way unemployment is all pervasive along with lackadaisical attitudes work itself way life has become cheap face blatant flouting rule law everything society needs keep criminal element their limits or behind bars another mainstream flick this could have been typical honest cop politician taking their time attitude clean up dregs society but d butantes kumarasamy kavineyams deft hands turning typical trope around narrating it without making it heavy handed typical heroic perspective elevates material into something that has be experienced order gain full extent which one can be entertained be circumspect i was not impressed with way it all began but once i got past first 15 20 minutes montage what main crew was up commenced earnest i was hooked this movie has surprises galore with way quirks gang leader have been presented it allows us poke fun at those elements but always treats him with respect spite those vijay sethupathy like all other works hes done never drops character his sequences with his girlfriend midst all planning all action are treat behold movie that never loses focus 5 tenets ehrm kednaping evoked neram while also reminding how much better realized this was than former with both them having various elements common almost doc level appreciation todays urban milieu treated with utmost sincerity respect real characters uttering realistic lines not getting away with anything they do actions have consequences no ehrm good deed goes unpunished none almost treading into creepy area with subject matter but keeping tone light nevertheless cinematography prod design art sound design along with score service only content that is ultimately controlled by maker 1 excellent teenmaar song this case being kaasu pannam duddu money money where neram failed imo was taking few artistic liberties that would not have seemed out place mainstream flick but did stand out there like sore thumbs use oft repeated clich time again this one other hand embraced its indie roots stayed true that it was nice see ashok selvan thegidi joining hands with both simha jigarthanda neram rj ramesh thilak neram whole thing me worked as indie ensemble i will look forward seeing anything this team works future as well while remaining surprised that writer director have not made anything since this one joined as they are by veterans radha ravi have not seen him many but he has been slumming too ms bhaskar also character throughout nice little feat it was also nice see karunakaran yog japee he looked familiar first time i am curious see other works theyre as i mentioned earlier different genre movie japee wouldve been main lead that wouldve been one hell boring yarn oh santhosh narayanan cuckoo jigarthanda did score not be missed not cinemas but do purchase dvd im super glad i bought mine look forward introduce this like minded enthusiasts,0.5452726017943409,0.12868357487922705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

What was the rationale of putting invisible girlfriend in the movie ? I thought, Vijay might be deranged or psycho ? 3. Bobby Simha is such a talented actor. Why was he being portrayed as a dumb person ? He deserve netter than that. 4. When Arumai double-crossed the gang by causing accident then how come the gang did not retaliated ?
