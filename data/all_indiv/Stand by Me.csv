10.0,It's not a GUY'S film only,"Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.Stand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.These are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.The acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.10/10",its not guys film only,without doubt this movie is probably best coming age flick around it has terrific acting incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout whole film i think reason i love this film so much is because everyone some way could relate it when youre pre teen have close group friends face something so intense together theres that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other one day you just think them that one incident stand by me is about 4 pre teen boys whose summer is about end they are about start junior high theyve obviously grown up together are nervous world they are about face where they are no longer kids but just about become adults when their friend vern tells them about kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening his brother where kids body is boys think it would be so cool find body become local town heroes they have one problem though there are these big tough guys who want find body first its matter who will reach it first but course its bonding boys that really gets you into film these are some best characters i have seen film we start with gordy gordy is intelligent writer who lost his big brother his idol car crash recently cant get any love or respect his father its obvious that he gets it his friends thats what keeps him going chris is leader gang gordys best friend he comes very bad family is dubbed bad seed everywhere hes kid who you knew school just knew hed turn out bad but theres deeper side him speech that river phoenix turned out chris was so beautifully dilvered as child whos been disappointed so many times by adult teddy is another bad kid sort speak he has bad home life where his father is crazy nearly killed him few times he has quick temper but you can tell that his friends keep him down earth help him through worst times then theres vern funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred everything some ways is 4th wheel still vern you can tell is great friend others appreciate him despite how he can hold them back acting is just phenomenal now directing rob reiner is without doubt one best directors all time he took these young boys pushed them their limits he was so smart about it as well he said interview that he had get pre teen boys who were close personality character film so it would come natural pre teen actors you could tell that this film was his baby he put so much thought love into this film thats what makes this film so special nothing could ever compete with coming age film like stand by me 10 10,0.44987567106614734,0.10342122604027364,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever.,"Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris's cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.'Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie's vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories, `Survivor Type,' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? `The Body,' which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that `The Body' was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King's other famous stories  `Apt Pupil' and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film  `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.Stand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story  things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all.",one best adaptations stephen king story ever,stand by me is yet another one stories made into movie author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author history stephen king clearly central character here is gordie lachance whose point view story is told who obviously symbolizes king himself given many his characteristics as well as some content film this movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees success over years such as jerry oconnell who played vern river phoenix who could have been bigger than leonardo dicaprio if he hadnt died corey feldman who has grown into unenviable but visible existence kiefer sutherland who has become excellent very well known actor john cusack can be seen small role as gordies late brother course richard dreyfuss who played narrator gordie as adult has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than decade before stand by me was filmed or original story was even written stand by me takes place summer 1959 general time period that stephen king is most skilled at presenting four friends set out find body kid who was killed by train hoping find what they predicted would be astronomical fame unfortunately towns bullies are also out find body same reason which leads films ultimate final climax even though this is very clever story with which tell fall innocence story it is brilliant characterization incredible acting that really make this classic film it is extremely rare that film comes along that stars young kids is so moving powerful also every one those kids is made three dimensional creative smooth ways making you feel like you really knew them by end film vern is fat kid who always gets picked teddy chris both have abusive or deranged fathers not mention chriss cruel brother gordie is young boy who lost his brother three months earlier violent accident who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since one memorable scene gordie wonders how teddy can be so enthusiastic about his fathers alleged military achievements when man once held his head stove nearly burning his ear off gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father who hadnt laid hand him since he was three years old got caught eating bleach under sink stephen king pokes fun at his own craft many times film such as gordies vehement line f ck writing i dont want be writer its stupid waste time not only that but there are also obvious references his other works such as when boys first realize that no one brought food teddy says this is great what are we supposed do eat our feet people who actually read instead just lazily watching movies will recognize this as major part plot another kings short stories survivor type which cast away borrowed heavily why dont you people read these books body which stand by me was based is only 148 pages long you could read that couple hours experience is totally different movie its even more disturbing that body was published same book different seasons as couple kings other famous stories apt pupil course rita hayworth shawshank redemption stand by me is story how one event can unexpectedly change lives it seems be story about friends how important they are but this possible theme is clearly dispelled line narration spoken at end film as time went we saw less less teddy vern until eventually they became just two more faces halls it happens sometimes friends come out your life like busboys at restaurant instead film is about learning life changing experience actually making changes or modifying your life some way because it this is heavily emphasized at end film stand by me is timeless film stephen kings story is skillfully brought screen under direction rob reiner 1950s are brought back life just as successfully as king so often does his stories novels with slicked back hair hot rods film excellent 50s soundtrack there is so much more this film than just superficial story things about characters story but also about tremendously talented man who wrote it all,0.5598621553884712,0.16089598997493737,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,A small masterpiece.,"Growing up isn't easy for anyone. There are times when you feel no one understands you at all. Although growing up is tough, the friends you have at a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life. Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable. Rob Reiner has directed a film about four young boys who discover life is quick, sometimes merciless, and magical. I've seen this film numerous times and it always seems better than the time before. This is a perfect little film.",small masterpiece,growing up isnt easy anyone there are times when you feel no one understands you at all although growing up is tough friends you have at young age are friends youll remember rest your life stand by me is very wonderful film masterpiece small scale film is full great insights into minds group four boys who decide they want see what dead body looks like it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person young boys mind is full many things they feel lost sometimes strong at others but mostly they feel invinceable rob reiner has directed film about four young boys who discover life is quick sometimes merciless magical ive seen this film numerous times it always seems better than time before this is perfect little film,0.586,0.21294444444444444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,Unforgettable,"I saw Stand By Me yesterday for the first time in one and a half years, (I'm 17) and I absolutely loved it, and it is definitely one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.Stand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10.

10.0,Biggest one in four counties,"Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.There were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Gary, Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever have friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it.",biggest one four counties,perhaps this is personal bias because i had friends like this when i was 12 but having said that this is one best films i have ever seen it hits every chord perfectly there were four us that were friends we were known as stand by me crew mike gary andy myself were inseparable as this film prophesizes correctly group has since split up now i am only good friends with one them this movie makes you remember what it was like have friends when you were 12 it makes you glad that they were there when they were story involves these four kids going weekend hike find dead kid that apparently got hit by train now if that is all movie was about it would probably be pretty boring but this film explores fears anxieties what it was like be 12 again twelve year olds deal with plethora issues it is not often that adults listen what kids have say or see what they deal with but this film is honest about its assessment how they feel four boys are played brilliantly by wil wheaton jerry oconnellcoosh jerry maguire corey feldman river phoenix story moves along hits nerve because life that these four actors brings their characters there is real sense comrarderie between four them but ultimately it is phoenix that brings most life his character i would say that milk money scene with him gordie wheaton is one more touching poignant scenes ever filmed what stand by me does is brings you back time when friendship was more pure innocent meant more you cant help but get caught up nostalgia perhaps this film means more me personal reasons as ive already stated but it is wonderful film it should be enjoyed by everyone last line movie is so true do we really ever have friends as good as ones when we were twelve i doubt it,0.5924731182795699,0.3375576036866359,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Superb film making,"Interesting that in Stand By Me the four kids who were our protagonists in the film all went on to have successful careers. One of them, River Phoenix has passed on to legend as a result of his early demise.This was quite a novel film in the sense that it had no box office names at the time it was released. That probably aided director Rob Reiner because all of these future celebrities come off as real kids.Reiner got all kinds of good results with his location shooting finding some of the woodsiest areas he could for effect. This film is shot 95% out doors and real out doors at that.Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, and Corey Feldman are our 12 somethings who hear of a rumor that a kid they knew was hit by a train and his body is some miles away in the woods. It's summer and they decide to mount an expedition to find the body. The film is their odyssey into the woods.Stand By Me got one Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay. The writing is superb with the dialog that is given with these 12 year olds with hormones kicking in. The story takes place in the 50s. Richard Dreyfuss plays the adult Wil Wheaton and narrates the film and also makes an appearance at the end.Kiefer Sutherland who is a bit older gets his first notice as the town bully in the small Oregon town this all takes place in.This film is a legend because it is an eternally true story and will be popular centuries from now.

9.0,When it comes to coming of age films it is the best,"""It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of our lives, like busboys in a restaurant.""Stand By Me is Rob Reiner's love letter to friendship and nostalgic memories. It's ironic that Reiner's film looks at the past with such high regards because we can do the same with his filmography. His best films were all made in the 80's (and we can squeeze Misery and A Few Good Men into that list as well although they came out in 1990 and 1992 respectively), and despite not having directed many great films over the past few decades we can still look back at his early films and appreciate his classics. Stand By Me reminds us all of our early childhood and the friendships we made. It doesn't matter what decade we grew up in, we all cherish special memories of adventures we shared with our friends and how they helped shape us. That is what is so universal and appealing about Reiner's film; even though we may never have grown up in a small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back to a time where we were discovering new things about the world and standing up for our friends when they were in trouble or running with them when we got caught playing in our neighbor's yards. Stand By Me focuses on these memories and it's not just about the adventure in itself but the bond these friends shared together. It's probably the go to movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming of age films, and in my opinion one of the best ever made considering how much I appreciate the genre. I'm sure the film itself was a life changing experience for many who grew up watching it and dreaming of having similar adventures with their friends.Based on Stephen King's short story, ""The Body,"" the screenplay for the film was adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans. It takes place in 1959 and centers on four 12 year old friends from Castelrock, Oregon who overhear a conversation about the location of the body of a dead boy who had been missing for several days. The news about the disappearance of this boy had spread all over town, so these kids decide to embark on an adventure through the woods and bring back the missing body so they can be received as heroes. Since the journey would take more than a full day, they plan to tell their parents that they are staying at each other's home. Gordie (Will Wheaton) had recently lost his older brother (played by John Cusack in the flashback scenes) a few months prior to this in a car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldn't even mind him being gone for a few days. His best friend, Chris (River Phoenix), came from a troublesome family and despite knowing he'd get into trouble if they'd discover his lie he didn't think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father. Teddy (Corey Feldman) still has the scars from the abuse he suffered from his mentally unstable father, and currently lives with his mother. Vern (Jerry O'Connell), the clown of the group who isn't taken very seriously is the one who came up with the idea of looking for the body, but he also is the first to back down when it comes to it. The four finally decide to go ahead with their plan and begin their adventure, which will eventually shape who they are. The story is narrated by the grown up version of Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss) somewhere around 1985.The strong performances in this film are one of the reasons why it continues to work today. River Phoenix was such a natural and is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in. The chemistry he shares with Wheaton's character is strong and it reminds us all of that best friend we had in our childhood. Corey Feldman must have had the best agent because he starred in some of the best films that were released in the 80's (Gremlins, The Goonies, The Burbs, and The Lost Boys). Jerry O'Connell is probably the one that has undergone the greatest physical transformation, but he was perfect for the role of Vern and he reminded us of that friend who always seemed to be the butt of every joke. These four young actors carry the film and despite not having the most exciting of adventures, the way the story is told is what makes it such a fascinating one. There are small moments like the one where they gather around the camp fire to listen to Gordie's story, or when they are crossing the pond and discover its full of leeches, that stand out. The film is told through Gordie's recollection of these events and each scene feels like an authentic memory someone would have of such a life changing experience. The 50's soundtrack also plays a key role in the film since it adds to the overall sense of nostalgia. Reiner's film reminds me how much I actually have enjoyed Stephen King's non-horror stories (this along with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are my favorite film adaptations of his work). Since its 1986 release, all the coming of age films that have followed it seem to heavily borrow from it. Stand By Me is the measuring stick for films in this genre.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",when it comes coming age films it is best,it happens sometimes friends come out our lives like busboys restaurant stand by me is rob reiners love letter friendship nostalgic memories its ironic that reiners film looks at past with such high regards because we can do same with his filmography his best films were all made 80s we can squeeze misery few good men into that list as well although they came out 1990 1992 respectively despite not having directed many great films over past few decades we can still look back at his early films appreciate his classics stand by me reminds us all our early childhood friendships we made it doesnt matter what decade we grew up we all cherish special memories adventures we shared with our friends how they helped shape us that is what is so universal appealing about reiners film even though we may never have grown up small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back time where we were discovering new things about world standing up our friends when they were trouble or running with them when we got caught playing our neighbors yards stand by me focuses these memories its not just about adventure itself but bond these friends shared together its probably go movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming age films my opinion one best ever made considering how much i appreciate genre im sure film itself was life changing experience many who grew up watching it dreaming having similar adventures with their friends based stephen kings short story body screenplay film was adapted by raynold gideon bruce evans it takes place 1959 centers four 12 year old friends castelrock oregon who overhear conversation about location body dead boy who had been missing several days news about disappearance this boy had spread all over town so these kids decide embark adventure through woods bring back missing body so they can be received as heroes since journey would take more than full day they plan tell their parents that they are staying at each others home gordie will wheaton had recently lost his older brother played by john cusack flashback scenes few months prior this car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldnt even mind him being gone few days his best friend chris river phoenix came troublesome family despite knowing hed get into trouble if theyd discover his lie he didnt think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father teddy corey feldman still has scars abuse he suffered his mentally unstable father currently lives with his mother vern jerry oconnell clown group who isnt taken very seriously is one who came up with idea looking body but he also is first back down when it comes it four finally decide go ahead with their plan begin their adventure which will eventually shape who they are story is narrated by grown up version gordie played by richard dreyfuss somewhere around 1985 strong performances this film are one reasons why it continues work today river phoenix was such natural is so charismatic that he steals every scene hes chemistry he shares with wheatons character is strong it reminds us all that best friend we had our childhood corey feldman must have had best agent because he starred some best films that were released 80s gremlins goonies burbs lost boys jerry oconnell is probably one that has undergone greatest physical transformation but he was perfect role vern he reminded us that friend who always seemed be butt every joke these four young actors carry film despite not having most exciting adventures way story is told is what makes it such fascinating one there are small moments like one where they gather around camp fire listen gordies story or when they are crossing pond discover its full leeches that stand out film is told through gordies recollection these events each scene feels like authentic memory someone would have such life changing experience 50s soundtrack also plays key role film since it adds overall sense nostalgia reiners film reminds me how much i actually have enjoyed stephen kings non horror stories this along with shawshank redemption green mile are my favorite film adaptations his work since its 1986 release all coming age films that have followed it seem heavily borrow it stand by me is measuring stick films this genre,0.42337186996010523,0.18262295221118752,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Masterful Storytelling,"This movie has such a punch. A group of boys (culled from some of the best child actors of the time) make a gruesome discovery. How they handle it will affect them their whole lives. But the story is as much about their pasts and their connection to one another. I just wrote comments on ""The Breakfast Club."" I felt that movie lacked chemistry. While every type was represented, it just didn't cook the way this one does. Part of it is that these boys, while in some ways disenfranchised, are not open books. As they interact, their dreams and hopes are drawn from them. Some seem quite settled, but when push comes to shove, they have vulnerabilities. The stories they tell give us insight into their souls. From what has happened to some of the actors, it makes one wonder if some of that suffering came from within them. There are intense scenes. There is bragging and one- upsmanship along the way. And nothing is simple or trite. On of the best movies of our time.",masterful storytelling,this movie has such punch group boys culled some best child actors time make gruesome discovery how they handle it will affect them their whole lives but story is as much about their pasts their connection one another i just wrote comments breakfast club i felt that movie lacked chemistry while every type was represented it just didnt cook way this one does part it is that these boys while some ways disenfranchised are not open books as they interact their dreams hopes are drawn them some seem quite settled but when push comes shove they have vulnerabilities stories they tell give us insight into their souls what has happened some actors it makes one wonder if some that suffering came within them there are intense scenes there is bragging one upsmanship along way nothing is simple or trite best movies our time,0.5557142857142857,0.25999999999999995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,I remember.....,"I find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. It's not that I can't think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you'll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, ""a great time""I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue.""I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?""",i remember,i find it hard comment this film without simply repeating what has already been said its not that i cant think anything original but that others seem have felt exact same emotions as i did when watching this film i saw this movie when i was about 12 13 maybe 14 years old so it didnt have same nostalgic sense it had so many but what it did was make me ache those memories i wanted words another reviewer be 12 that cool i wished i had been like that that i had had friends like that laughed like that had adventures like that milk money scene was probably one my all time favourite scenes movie history up until i saw this movie i had never held much regard river phoenix but poignancy sincerity which river added role chris chambers touched me point tears i read yet another review that this scene river was asked think time when he had been hurt by adult that even after cameras stopped rolling river sat there still sobbing hurting i felt every tear heard every word as though i were there with chris this movie made me laugh cry rejoice fear with chris gordie teddy vern i loved campfire scenes today i look back my own childhood remember with laugh amazingly similar things i used laugh wonder about with my friends i remember dreaming about being writer actress i remember standing up bullies i remember walking or riding with my friends i remember being afraid crying onto friends shoulder i guess what this movie does everyone is take them back time even though situations may have been different chances are youll find similarities remember with smile that yes your life was once that cool words vern great time i especially loved ending that they found out who was strong who just talked tough i loved last scene with chris gordie closing monologue i never had any friends later like ones i had when i was twelve jesus does anyone,0.4464285714285714,0.19326599326599325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,Inspiration,"As a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, ""The Body"" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.First of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. ""Stand By Me"" fits what the characters in the story are facing. I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to. All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a ""bad kid."" And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.To me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.This film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.",inspiration,as lover stephen kings writing style rob reiners directing techniques this movie leaves me speechless every time it is almost forgotten film about time youth nearly forgotten as well i will say as writer novella that this film was based upon body has always will be inspiration my style writing first all i enjoy title that was chosen film stand by me fits what characters story are facing i think that all who have seen this film will agree that problems are all things that we can relate all us know someone like these characters most us have met boy down road who had brother with bad name father with alcohol problem automatically being labeled as bad kid boy with military father abusive little whacko fat kid picked ridiculed his weight me gordy represents all us i found myself seeing little me gordy as i watched film i dont know if any one else shares this but it was true gordy was not very strong at first was not sure what he wanted except be with his friends still coping with loss his brother fact that his father was disrespectful him gordy still stood up what he believed end he surprised characters viewers by standing up bullies that had plagued them all this film is certainly one my top favorites fact it lies my top three probably at or i feel that it is film that everyone should see at some point their life due fact it changes your look at youth their trials few films are able do that i think that this one was inspiration others that will do same future,0.4657960397090832,0.038785369220151834,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.36}"

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered.

8.0,The death of childhood.,"Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. (The Green Mile sucks, by the way.) The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies, other trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.This is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors. Who would have thunk that Jerry O'Connell would turn out to be the most successful of them? At times they laugh, other times they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting, but when challenged by the older gang of bullies, they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the adult writer, narrates the action as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.Stand By Me is not quite a classic in my book, but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school, and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself. There is also a complete lack of positive supporting characters during the scenes set back when they were kids. Only John Cusack, in a cameo role, is shown as a positive older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them were jerks! The script uses more swear words than are actually necessary to convey the anger these kids sometimes feel. And you'd think any dead body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they find out in the woods. Wouldn't this kid have heard the train coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself, then you'd think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. I know these may seem like petty beefs, but they are enough to knock the review down a star or two.It seems like the film is trying to portray the dead Brower boy as the death of these kids' innocence or something to that effect. As someone who's been their age, I can understand some of what they were feeling. And I totally agree that some of the people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later.Despite it's faults, this is a powerful film you aren't likely to forget. It's one of Reiner's best, and the outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",death childhood,stand by me is probably best film ever come stephen king story green mile sucks by way story is told adult writers point view as he recounts adventure he shared with his three best friends waning moments summer before junior high school began we see four boys head out into wilderness see dead body boy who was apparently hit by train boys encounter bullies other trains leeches vicious dogs many other things their trip they have some pretty deep emotional conversations along way this is very awkward age life young man you can tell by listening their conversation topics which range boobs whether or not mighty mouse can beat up superman youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors who would have thunk that jerry oconnell would turn out be most successful them at times they laugh other times they pick each other sometimes they seem verge fighting but when challenged by older gang bullies they stick together richard dreyfuss who plays adult writer narrates action as things move along their trip is full surprises emotional insight stand by me is not quite classic my book but it is very memorable script is little too pessimistic my liking right down when river phoenix describes incident where hes caught stealing milk money school his teacher ends up keeping it herself there is also complete lack positive supporting characters during scenes set back when they were kids only john cusack cameo role is shown as positive older character no wonder these kids felt so unwanted all adults around them were jerks script uses more swear words than are actually necessary convey anger these kids sometimes feel youd think any dead body that had been hit by train would be more damaged than one they find out woods wouldnt this kid have heard train coming time jumped well out way if he was trying kill himself then youd think he would have stood way been completely pulverized i know these may seem like petty beefs but they are enough knock review down star or two it seems like film is trying portray dead brower boy as death these kids innocence or something that effect as someone whos been their age i can understand some what they were feeling i totally agree that some people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out be faces crowd at school few years later despite its faults this is powerful film you arent likely forget its one reiners best outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves 8 10 stars hound,0.509880893241549,0.13969915785489553,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Four boys go on a quest to find not only a dead body the true meaning of friendship and reality.,"Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in second place). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the ""real world"". They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy.

7.0,Coming-of-age drama from the pen of Stephen King,"There's a certain irony that one of the most mature films to come from the pen of Stephen King is the one based on a group of kids in the 1950s. Yet this is far from a children's film, instead it's a thoroughly dark coming-of-age drama that explores what it means to be growing up in a realistically downbeat world, as childhood innocence is abandoned in favour of harsh adult reality.It's also a cracking ""gang of kids"" drama, stylistically similar to the likes of THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD and even sharing some of the same cast members, albeit with a much more realistic theme. The film is set in 1950s Maine on a hot summer day, where a gang of lads decide to track down the body of a boy hit by a train in return for a reward.In reality it's an excuse for lots of adventures with trains, leeches, and junkyard owners, as well as a nasty antagonist played with gleeful relish by Kiefer Sutherland. There's plenty of crudity here alongside that infamous gross-out pie eating contest, but it's surprisingly mature too with deep characters and genuine performances. River Phoenix is the one who really shines (RIP), but Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell really nail it too. Perhaps the wraparound scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are a little too sentimental, but it's not enough to detract from STAND BY ME being a minor classic of the decade.

10.0,One of the best movies ever made...,"Stand By Me is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of film ever made in the history of humanity. A truly excellent movie that really strikes and affects you with all its glory. It leaves no one untouched whether you're 12 or 112 years old. Simply because it deals with life and friendship, and all that comes with it. Both the good and the bad.Everyone can relate to it and feel what the characters feel. Because we've all been there. We have all done similar things to what they are doing, we have all been dealing with the same issues in life as they are faced with and we all still are.Few films are able do depict the theme of life and friendship as successfully as Stand By Me. In my opinion there are practically no flaws in this production, everything from the plot and the screenplay to the characters and the actors are top notch. Also the music is great.Watching the movie one feel everything from happiness and laughter to fear and grief. Laughter because we remember how fun it was being a child. With everything being new and exciting in life. And facing it all together with our friends. Fear and grief because of how hard it can be having to grow up and let go of the past. Let go of our old friends and our old life. One can't help but to feel nostalgic. At least I do. It makes me think about life in a larger sense. Thinking about my childhood I realize how long ago it was or at least seems to be. The movie frees a lot of emotions and thoughts regarding both my own life and life in general.This movie also has one of the best opening scenes in film history. I almost burst into tears every time I see it. It's as close to perfection as it gets. It's so beautiful and sad. Simply the perfect way to launch the rest of the movie. How the beautiful soft music first almost reaches out and touch you, while seeing the landscape. Then a close up on the car and the main character reading the chocking news of his dear old friend's death. Thereafter such a smooth passage back to his childhood with focus on the kids passing by on their bikes and the music still in the background. Excellent!To conclude I have also one little flaw, or at least I think of it that way. It's regarding the whole ""Lardass-scence"". When I was little I could never figure out why it was in the film. I couldn't see the connection to the rest of the film. Being older and hopefully a little wiser :D I now see that it's a way of showing Gordies talent for making up stories, the talent that have him becoming a writer one day. However I feel this could have been illustrated in a better way. I've always felt that scene is just a little bit over the top and I still do. Otherwise Stand By Me is close to a masterpiece.

10.0,This wonderful movie opens the place where your secret heart is buried,"In ancient Greece people watched the great tragedies in the amphi-theatres, and eyewitnesses tell us that audiences of 20'000 sat crying when the main character on the stage became aware of his fatal guilt and had to face death. They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.So what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?First of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production, but about the people who make it.And it's about a unique and humble (I hope you understand what I mean) director: Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is, leering at the Oscar-jury:the story is told without any visual effects, the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular, but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoney-scene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally, he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold: it doesn't show professional acting, it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is: the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. ""I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess."" In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending: In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event: grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be: serving the film's dramaturgy.Well, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29): `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'10 out of 10, no doubt about it!",this wonderful movie opens place where your secret heart is buried,ancient greece people watched great tragedies amphi theatres eyewitnesses tell us that audiences 20000 sat crying when main character stage became aware his fatal guilt had face death they called it catharsis best translated by cleaning souls well measured by tremendous effect all us writing reviews film stand by me has power qualities ancient tragedy this jewel film touches shakes best sides us i have watched it over over again even if i watch it several times week i still sit laugh cry it leaves me sad confused grateful feelings that can last hours sometimes days so what is mystery behind this masterpiece first all it teaches us that good filmmaking isnt about dollars spent production but about people who make it its about unique humble i hope you understand what i mean director rob reiner doesnt try show how good he is leering at oscar jury story is told without any visual effects pace is slow cinematography is unspectacular but he succeeds inspiring his young actors perform honest feelings letting story develop by its own terms example is milkmoney scene it is told that reiner wasnt satisfied with performance river phoenix they tried again again finally he told river remember situation his own life where grownup had let him down guess if he succeeded with it river phoenix started crying he couldnt stop crying long time after shot was taken thats why this film is pure gold it doesnt show professional acting it shows young boys who open their hearts front camera they can do it because they can relate similar experiences because message is important universal we all can relate similar situations these scenes make me remember events my own youth that i had inhibited long time because i didnt like remember them thats pain but its not only director actors who should earn all credits i read novel after watching film since that time stephen king is one great contemporary writers my book i just dont understand why he doesnt write more body kind me this book is pure poetry including all those four letter words that maltin e dont like because they dont understand why they are necessary but most amazing thing is script doesnt only catch quintessence novel its partly even better this perfect balance between humor seriousness it doesnt manipulate audience book grownup gordon sits his car when he had read about his friends death i drove out town parked cried him cried damn near half hour i guess film gordon doesnt cry he doesnt need everyone audience feels like crying because they understand tragedy there are only 13 pages dialogue narration there really is not one line too much its so good i almost know whole it by heart take ending book famous writer gordon lachance tells about how he met ace merrill again some twenty years after ray brower event grown fat only one alive his old friends enemies how much better is films ending this important line about friends we had when we were twelve years old is only line kings book commending good time boys have at milo pressmans junkyard if there had been oscar impressive film endings this film had deserved first thank you jack nitzsche intense score its gordies theme when hes not with his friends group gordie is smart boy with sharp quick fresh replies without friends at home or store he barely speaks word then we can hear that fragile jack nitzsche variation stand by me its like gordie crying where are you chris come stand by me thats brilliant exactly what great filmmusic should be serving films dramaturgy well i dont know how many hours it took me express my love this film language that isnt my own it seems impossible it is exactly as stephen king expressed it himself end chapter 29 even if id known right thing say i probably couldnt have said it speech destroys functions love i think thats hell thing writer say i guess but i believe it be true if you speak tell deer you mean it no harm it glides away with single flip its tail word is harm love isnt what these asshole poets like mckuen want you think it is love has teeth they bite wounds never close no word no combination words can close those lovebites its other way around thats joke if those wounds dry up words die with them take it me ive made my life words i know that is so 10 out 10 no doubt about it,0.5750654954538451,0.22477269224842036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.28}"
5.0,Sadly just can't agree...,"I am as many are, a huge fan of Stephen's King Works. I have also been a fan of many of the films made from his books. Some I am not a fan of. I have not read as of yet and I'm sure I will, The Body. I have seen Stand By Me several times and I am conflicted in many of the great portions of this film and the ideas behind the movie vs the fact that it just doesn't sit with me as entertaining.Stand By Me is considered perhaps one of the forefront coming of age films and for good reason. It's the story of four best friends set in the fifties/sixties told through the eyes of the Gordie Lachance who has lost his role model best friend older brother to an accident. Haunted by the loss of his brother and the fact that everyone seems to have only cared about his older brother including his parents, he is compelled to encourage his group of friends to go on a trek across the county to find the dead body of a missing boy. Unfortunately the ""bad kids"" and ""bullies"" in town also discover that this body is nearby and they race to find it first. During their trek they discover more about each other, and they stand together to overcome their fears about their own lives.I do whole heartedly agree in the pure heart of this film, the coming of age, the different personalities of each boy in the film. It does aim to find a little something of everyone in each boy and it accomplishes that. The cast, especially for young actors is very good. Wil Wheaton as the lead character appears to be weaker than his best friend played by the late River Phoenix but in the end he is really who holds them altogether and overcomes the most of all of them. River Phoenix ironically plays the ""bad boy"" best friend who seems to have very little future but has taken Wheaton's character under his wing and encourages him to make something of himself. Corey Feldman fills in his usual role adequately. Jerry O'Connell as the made fun of ""fat kid"" also plays his role well. Keifer Sutherland who can't help but look like a jerk and an evil fiend also plays well. The cast is basically The Brat Pack and yet for an eighties film it's quite darker than most Brat Pack films. Wholely realistic is the kids' views on life, their fascination with death, cigarettes, adult things, and their adult language. Their trying to be as grown up as possible without any real adult role models.My issue is that the film just doesn't hit me. It never satisfies me or entertains me. I find it entirely too short, very, very, predictable and without any real depth of plot. I know everyone sees this film as a classic and certainly it has it's strong points as I outlined but overall it just falls short for me. The soundtrack, and I absolutely love these songs feels forced like Reiner is trying to force the feeling of the era on us rather than create it all around them. In this case I don't expect anyone to believe my opinion because I am sorely outnumbered but I don't care for this film much at all.5/10",sadly just cant agree,i am as many are huge fan stephens king works i have also been fan many films made his books some i am not fan i have not read as yet im sure i will body i have seen stand by me several times i am conflicted many great portions this film ideas behind movie vs fact that it just doesnt sit with me as entertaining stand by me is considered perhaps one forefront coming age films good reason its story four best friends set fifties sixties told through eyes gordie lachance who has lost his role model best friend older brother accident haunted by loss his brother fact that everyone seems have only cared about his older brother including his parents he is compelled encourage his group friends go trek across county find dead body missing boy unfortunately bad kids bullies town also discover that this body is nearby they race find it first during their trek they discover more about each other they stand together overcome their fears about their own lives i do whole heartedly agree pure heart this film coming age different personalities each boy film it does aim find little something everyone each boy it accomplishes that cast especially young actors is very good wil wheaton as lead character appears be weaker than his best friend played by late river phoenix but end he is really who holds them altogether overcomes most all them river phoenix ironically plays bad boy best friend who seems have very little future but has taken wheatons character under his wing encourages him make something himself corey feldman fills his usual role adequately jerry oconnell as made fun fat kid also plays his role well keifer sutherland who cant help but look like jerk evil fiend also plays well cast is basically brat pack yet eighties film its quite darker than most brat pack films wholely realistic is kids views life their fascination with death cigarettes adult things their adult language their trying be as grown up as possible without any real adult role models my issue is that film just doesnt hit me it never satisfies me or entertains me i find it entirely too short very very predictable without any real depth plot i know everyone sees this film as classic certainly it has its strong points as i outlined but overall it just falls short me soundtrack i absolutely love these songs feels forced like reiner is trying force feeling era us rather than create it all around them this case i dont expect anyone believe my opinion because i am sorely outnumbered but i dont care this film much at all 5 10,0.48924266881894013,0.17467211460855525,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,"HELLO? if you've never seen this movie, man you're missin OUT!","I am 14 years old, and I absolutely love this movie. But don't let my age fool you. I'm not just going to sit here and talk about how hott River Pheonix was.This movie is well rounded in my perspective. Everyone can relate to at least one of the boys in it at one time in their life. The actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays.Corey Feldman's character Teddy is the boy who's sensitive about his dad, but tries to hide it, Jerry O' Connell's character Vern is the chubby, wussy kid, but still part of the club, Wil Wheaton's character Gordie is the sweet, intelligent friend who tells stories to the other boys and is ignored by his parents, and River Phoenix's character Chris is the boy in the neighborhood that's been labeled a bad kid and feels he'll never get out of their town, the peacemaker, and Gordie's best friend. This movie just sucks you in as soon as you start watching it. It's not overly mushy and sad, but it's not so tough that only a sixteen year old boy could stand it. You feel for each character, no matter how mean or nice they are. My personal favorite is Chris Chambers, which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too, but River Phoenix is just so touching. The campfire scene is great, the milk money seen is great, and one of my favorites is the train scene. You can definitely see the terror in their faces. It's funny that they all act so tough, except maybe Vern, although he tries, and they still like talking about goofy and dancing and singing along to Lollipop. You also just want to be there with them. Feel that kind of friendship that so many people long for. It's such a feel good movie, but not in the sense of a 10 year old's feel good movie. It makes you feel complete when you watch it. It's not jam packed with action sequences or it doesn't have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around in it either. It's just one of a kind. Definitely worth my time and yours.The newest DVD of Stand By Me (Special Edition) has Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me where all the main actors,except River, and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and obviously Ben E. King. Not to mention an extra CD with some awesome oldie's songs like Everyday, Lollipop, Stand By Me, and Mr. Lee.",hello if youve never seen this movie man youre missin out,i am 14 years old i absolutely love this movie but dont let my age fool you im not just going sit here talk about how hott river pheonix was this movie is well rounded my perspective everyone can relate at least one boys it at one time their life actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays corey feldmans character teddy is boy whos sensitive about his dad but tries hide it jerry o connells character vern is chubby wussy kid but still part club wil wheatons character gordie is sweet intelligent friend who tells stories other boys is ignored by his parents river phoenixs character chris is boy neighborhood thats been labeled bad kid feels hell never get out their town peacemaker gordies best friend this movie just sucks you as soon as you start watching it its not overly mushy sad but its not so tough that only sixteen year old boy could stand it you feel each character no matter how mean or nice they are my personal favorite is chris chambers which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too but river phoenix is just so touching campfire scene is great milk money seen is great one my favorites is train scene you can definitely see terror their faces its funny that they all act so tough except maybe vern although he tries they still like talking about goofy dancing singing along lollipop you also just want be there with them feel that kind friendship that so many people long its such feel good movie but not sense 10 year olds feel good movie it makes you feel complete when you watch it its not jam packed with action sequences or it doesnt have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around it either its just one kind definitely worth my time yours newest dvd stand by me special edition has walking tracks summer stand by me where all main actors except river rob reiner are interviewed they also talk about working with river phoenix theres also stand by me music video with river phoenix wil wheaton obviously ben e king not mention extra cd with some awesome oldies songs like everyday lollipop stand by me mr lee,0.5877786220871327,0.1943304626815265,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.48}"

9.0,Great childhood memories,"Gordie recalls his childhood as he reads about Chris Chambers' death in the newspapers. It's 1959 Castlerock Oregon. Childhood friends Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and chubby Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) goes on a quest to see a dead body.Based on a Stephen King story, the Richard Dreyfuss narrations give it that old timey feel. The best thing in the movie are the four kids leads. Wil Wheaton has the geeky role. River Phoenix has the leading man persona. Corey Feldman is the screw up. And Jerry O'Connell was fat. I remember watching this with a friend in the theater. As the eating contest begins, he said 'Are they going to show THAT?' I had no idea what he meant, but he read the book. Let's just say that it's a great scene. This movie continues to be one of the best Stephen King adapted films.

9.0,"""But kids lose everything unless there's someone there to look out for them"".","I was already well beyond my formative pre-teen years when I first saw this film, but there's no denying that if you grew up in small town America, this is about as close as you get to capturing the essence of childhood friendships that remain with you forever, even after time and distance take their eventual toll. Director Rob Reiner skillfully crafts a compelling tale from a Stephen King short story, layering it with various sub-texts that run the gamut from dealing with the town bully to confronting the loss of family. What's probably most remarkable about the picture are the performances that Reiner obtains from his young starring cast, most notably River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and Wil Wheaton as his best friend Gordie Lachance. Told through the perspective of Wheaton's character, the film conjures up memories of the many trials and tribulations one faces while growing up, often unsure of oneself and even worse, feeling alone and disoriented when personal tragedy strikes and threatens to overwhelm one's very being. Yet the story never gets maudlin or depressing, there's enough youthful camaraderie and mischief on hand to keep the adventurous foursome going strong. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell round out the group, and together they manage to grow and mature in a way that none of them could have imagined prior to starting their quest. Scored with a soundtrack that memorializes some of the great song hits from a half century ago, ""Stand By Me"" is a strange and wonderful journey, in it's own way reminding us of what might have been the best time of our lives. Sincerely.",but kids lose everything unless theres someone there look out them,i was already well beyond my formative pre teen years when i first saw this film but theres no denying that if you grew up small town america this is about as close as you get capturing essence childhood friendships that remain with you forever even after time distance take their eventual toll director rob reiner skillfully crafts compelling tale stephen king short story layering it with various sub texts that run gamut dealing with town bully confronting loss family whats probably most remarkable about picture are performances that reiner obtains his young starring cast most notably river phoenix as chris chambers wil wheaton as his best friend gordie lachance told through perspective wheatons character film conjures up memories many trials tribulations one faces while growing up often unsure oneself even worse feeling alone disoriented when personal tragedy strikes threatens overwhelm ones very being yet story never gets maudlin or depressing theres enough youthful camaraderie mischief hand keep adventurous foursome going strong corey feldman jerry oconnell round out group together they manage grow mature way that none them could have imagined prior starting their quest scored with soundtrack that memorializes some great song hits half century ago stand by me is strange wonderful journey its own way reminding us what might have been best time our lives sincerely,0.460752688172043,0.253763440860215,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Masterpiece,"Stand by Me (1986) **** (out of 4) Coming of age film about four friends (Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell) who set out to find the body of a missing teen. For my money this is the best coming of age film ever made because of how real it comes off. Perhaps I see myself and my friends in the role of these characters when we were their age but the movie has always struck me as being as true to teenage years as a film can possibly get. The bad language, the stuff the boys talk about and their looking for adventure is something any guy can connect with and I think this film delivers all the laughs, tears and drama of growing up.Each of the four boys are given great character development over the course of the 88-minute running time, which is pretty remarkable since the film doesn't run too long. We get to know each of the characters from their fears to their hopes for the future even though it's obvious that some won't ever reach their goals, which again, just falls back on how real the movie comes off. This is certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and director Reiner handles all of it with great care and his visual style and song selections all hit the right mark. Another thing that keeps the film great are the performances by the four leads. Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell all have some very tough scenes for such young actors but all pull them off without any trouble. The film belongs to Phoenix however as he clearly sticks out from the rest of the cast, which is saying a whole lot. The maturity he shows here is rather amazing to watch because there are actors twice his age that wouldn't be able to pull off the material here. The way the four boys work together makes their characters very memorable. The supporting players include future stars Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack who also turn in great performances. Richard Dreyfuss appears in a few scenes and narrates the film and he does a great job. I think narration quite often ruins films but that's not the case here because Dreyfuss really puts his heart and soul into the narration and it really comes off as he's telling a story from his own childhood.",masterpiece,stand by me 1986 out 4 coming age film about four friends wil wheaton river phoenix corey feldman jerry oconnell who set out find body missing teen my money this is best coming age film ever made because how real it comes off perhaps i see myself my friends role these characters when we were their age but movie has always struck me as being as true teenage years as film can possibly get bad language stuff boys talk about their looking adventure is something any guy can connect with i think this film delivers all laughs tears drama growing up each four boys are given great character development over course 88 minute running time which is pretty remarkable since film doesnt run too long we get know each characters their fears their hopes future even though its obvious that some wont ever reach their goals which again just falls back how real movie comes off this is certainly one best adaptations stephen king story director reiner handles all it with great care his visual style song selections all hit right mark another thing that keeps film great are performances by four leads wheaton feldman oconnell all have some very tough scenes such young actors but all pull them off without any trouble film belongs phoenix however as he clearly sticks out rest cast which is saying whole lot maturity he shows here is rather amazing watch because there are actors twice his age that wouldnt be able pull off material here way four boys work together makes their characters very memorable supporting players include future stars kiefer sutherland john cusack who also turn great performances richard dreyfuss appears few scenes narrates film he does great job i think narration quite often ruins films but thats not case here because dreyfuss really puts his heart soul into narration it really comes off as hes telling story his own childhood,0.4670535714285714,0.24111111111111105,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.22}"
