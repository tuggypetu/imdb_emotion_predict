6.0,The End of an Era... for Christopher Reeve,"In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man! Many people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.Random thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see below.The idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again? What happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives? Does anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else? Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect to Gene Hackman).There's a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?But anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and if you've spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest 90 more minutes in this series finale.",end era christopher reeve,this 4th final chritopher reeve superman film superman tries rid world nuclear weapons only find that lex luthor is back ready supply world with these dangerous weapons oh he has new sidekick nuclear man many people have given this lower rating understandably but 3 or 4 out 10 it really is not that bad film is fun fast paced very watchable some consider it worst but i did not find it any better or worse than part 3 granted parts 1 2 are superior thanks richard donner but ive seen many worse films than superman 4 random thoughts double date scene was clever but really annoying completely pointless if superman would just reveal himself lois lane he wouldnt have find other girls side although see below idea getting rid nuclear weapons was very nice great social political commentary i agree getting rid nuclear weapons would be good move but film made this very unrealistic world cheers him when reality countries would protest he invades variety countries steals their secret hidden weapons not sure legality or logistics that what is stop someone building these weapons all over again what happened lana lang at end part 3 it looked like superman finally realized that lois lane is loser hooked up with lana but she is never seen or mentioned part 4 despite working daily planet at least as last film what gives does anyone else think lex luthor is getting little tired did we really need 3 films with luthor one with luthor knockoff what about brainiac or bizarro or eradicator or just about anyone else heck general zod is so much cooler than luthor with all due respect gene hackman theres scene where he rebuilds great wall china just by looking at it what power did he use tractor beams his nipples but anyway this film is not as bad as many would have you believe if youve spent six hours first three you might as well invest 90 more minutes this series finale,0.516864725688255,0.003180332739156276,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.29}"
6.0,Not A Very Memorable Ending To The Reeve-Superman Series,"Superman Turns ""Peacenik"" could be another title to this film. Christopher Reeve remarked several times that this was his most ""important"" Superman movie. Being somewhat of a Liberal ""peacenik,"" he was the kind you'd see out with a big ""peace sign"" at rallies against nuclear weapons.This movie had the kind of message that was dear to his heart.Superman goes about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons here, especially, of course when they get into the hands of villain ""Dr. Luthor"" (Gene Hackman). It was a nice message and, overall, a nice film. Unlike the other Superman films of the era, they didn't overdo the sappy romance with ""Lois Lane"" (Margot Kidder). They concentrated more on the story. Unfortunately, that story - even with good intentions - just wasn't all that memorable. Ask anyone: people remember the first two Reeve Superman films a lot more than the last two. This one, and the third one with Richard Pryor, pretty much ""bombed"" at the box office, at least compared to the others.It did not help that the producers of this movie were Golan-Globus films, guys that were known for their cheap and usually-sleazy exploitation films. ""Superman"" deserved better.",not very memorable ending reeve superman series,superman turns peacenik could be another title this film christopher reeve remarked several times that this was his most important superman movie being somewhat liberal peacenik he was kind youd see out with big peace sign at rallies against nuclear weapons this movie had kind message that was dear his heart superman goes about trying rid world nuclear weapons here especially course when they get into hands villain dr luthor gene hackman it was nice message overall nice film unlike other superman films era they didnt overdo sappy romance with lois lane margot kidder they concentrated more story unfortunately that story even with good intentions just wasnt all that memorable ask anyone people remember first two reeve superman films lot more than last two this one third one with richard pryor pretty much bombed at box office at least compared others it did not help that producers this movie were golan globus films guys that were known their cheap usually sleazy exploitation films superman deserved better,0.5613165680473372,0.22048816568047339,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"
5.0,Such a shame!,"SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACEOK... so everyone knows that this is the worst Superman movie ever made... but if you have not seen it in a while, you should watch it.It is still pretty rubbish, but it is not as bad as I remember.The story is not that bad... Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.The movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... ""The less said about Superman IV the better.""Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.The effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.There are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really? I know Superman was never meant to be realistic, but that is too much!When I was a kid I was a big fan of the Superman movies... but I think my parents protected me from this disappointment, because I don't remember this film at all... I didn't see this film until I was an adult. Haha. Thanks Mum.I will give this film 5 out of 10.It's a shame about this film... it was a very disappointing ending to Christopher Reeves Superman career.

6.0,Not As Bad As You Might Think...,"Despite its reputation as the worst of the Superman movies, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is not. Despite the horrendous special effects and rushed ending, the film manages to still present itself with some respect.Christopher Reeves had proved in the three previous films his ability to convincingly play the role of Superman. With this film, he not only proves his abilities but this is, in many respects, his best performance in the role. His speeches during the film are a sign of this and his chemistry with all the other actors helps also. Reeves also does his best to sell the special effects sequences it is a shame he couldn't. Reeves is the films biggest saving grace and it's a shame this would be his last time in the role.Gene Hackman also returns in the role of Lex Luthor and with brings him that character's with, charm, and silent menace. But somehow he seems to be out of place most of the time and serves as a drawback in many of his scenes. Mark McClure, Jackie Cooper and Margot Kidder all return in their roles. But unfortunately they are all under used and their appearances might as well be cameos.The rest of the cast does a decent job. Mark Pillow does excellent in the role of Nuclear Man, Luthor's super powered creation. Pillow does the role so well that one wonders how much better eh might have been in the special effects had been better. Mariel Hemingway is a welcomed addition to the cast as a heiress who serves as an additional love interest for Clark Kent. The only major addition that doesn't fit is Jon Cryer who could easily be the single most annoying character to ever appear in a Superman movie.The film's real drawback is its low budget values. While this doesn't affect the majority of sets, the Fortress of Solitude set in particular looks cheap when compared to the one found in previous films. The same can also be said of the Daily Planet set. The low budget would also hurt the film in the area a budget was needed most: special effects.The previous films, for all their flaws, at least had decent special effects and mostly convincing flying sequences and this film has neither. The special effects are sub-par by virtually any standard and despite being made nearly a decade after the first movie the effects from the first movie are still more convincing. The truly horrific nature of this films effect sequences can be seen during the climactic battles between Superman and Nuclear Man. The added addition of new powers with bad special effects doesn't help either.The other major problem is the pacing of the film. The first 50 minutes or so is sheer entertainment that's the set up the story of both Superman riding the world of nukes and Luthor's evil plan. The set up, however, is better then the execution of the ending, which is both rushed and disjointed. The subplots of Mariel Hemingway's character and the boy who inspired Superman's quest are both left unfinished for example. Whole scenes feel incomplete and the final battle is over far too quickly to be effective.But the film does have a saving grace in its concept. The idea of taking Superman, the ultimate hero of America, and placing him into the timely situation of Cold War disarmament is a stroke of utter brilliance. The concept of Luthor and Nuclear Man added to it also serve as an interesting addition to the story and it makes for good entertainment when viewed in this context. But this concept is ruined by the rushed feeling of the ending. But one still has to give high marks to Christopher Reeves and the screenwriters for their concept.The films does have another saving grace: its musical score. Like the Ken Thorne scores for II and III, Alexander Courage's score makes heavy use of the John Williams themes composed for the first film and is highly effective. The Courage adaptation never fails to use the Williams music to maximum effect and it's a shame that, at Courage's own request, it has yet to see release.Despite its flaws in special effects and editing, Superman IV has saving graces in Christopher Reeves, the rest of the cast, the music, and the timely nature of the story. While nowhere near as good as Superman The Movie or Superman II and while not as bad as Superman III, the film still serves its purpose and is your average Superman adventure.",not as bad as you might think,despite its reputation as worst superman movies superman iv quest peace is not despite horrendous special effects rushed ending film manages still present itself with some respect christopher reeves had proved three previous films his ability convincingly play role superman with this film he not only proves his abilities but this is many respects his best performance role his speeches during film are sign this his chemistry with all other actors helps also reeves also does his best sell special effects sequences it is shame he couldnt reeves is films biggest saving grace its shame this would be his last time role gene hackman also returns role lex luthor with brings him that characters with charm silent menace but somehow he seems be out place most time serves as drawback many his scenes mark mcclure jackie cooper margot kidder all return their roles but unfortunately they are all under used their appearances might as well be cameos rest cast does decent job mark pillow does excellent role nuclear man luthors super powered creation pillow does role so well that one wonders how much better eh might have been special effects had been better mariel hemingway is welcomed addition cast as heiress who serves as additional love interest clark kent only major addition that doesnt fit is jon cryer who could easily be single most annoying character ever appear superman movie films real drawback is its low budget values while this doesnt affect majority sets fortress solitude set particular looks cheap when compared one found previous films same can also be said daily planet set low budget would also hurt film area budget was needed most special effects previous films all their flaws at least had decent special effects mostly convincing flying sequences this film has neither special effects are sub par by virtually any standard despite being made nearly decade after first movie effects first movie are still more convincing truly horrific nature this films effect sequences can be seen during climactic battles between superman nuclear man added addition new powers with bad special effects doesnt help either other major problem is pacing film first 50 minutes or so is sheer entertainment thats set up story both superman riding world nukes luthors evil plan set up however is better then execution ending which is both rushed disjointed subplots mariel hemingways character boy who inspired supermans quest are both left unfinished example whole scenes feel incomplete final battle is over far too quickly be effective but film does have saving grace its concept idea taking superman ultimate hero america placing him into timely situation cold war disarmament is stroke utter brilliance concept luthor nuclear man added it also serve as interesting addition story it makes good entertainment when viewed this context but this concept is ruined by rushed feeling ending but one still has give high marks christopher reeves screenwriters their concept films does have another saving grace its musical score like ken thorne scores ii iii alexander courages score makes heavy use john williams themes composed first film is highly effective courage adaptation never fails use williams music maximum effect its shame that at courages own request it has yet see release despite its flaws special effects editing superman iv has saving graces christopher reeves rest cast music timely nature story while nowhere near as good as superman movie or superman ii while not as bad as superman iii film still serves its purpose is your average superman adventure,0.5345716832187419,0.1398871912401324,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
5.0,Worth a few laughs,"I recently watched ""Superman IV"" for the first time since...well, 1987, I guess. How time flies.I thought the first half-hour was actually pretty good - not luminous, but fine. The hostile takeover of the Daily Planet is interesting, and I enjoyed Superman's moral dilemma about the nuclear missile situation (some reviews suggest that Superman is all gung-ho about disarming the world; in fact, he's initially quite reluctant to do so).But after that decent first half hour, the movie pretty much falls apart. The Daily Planet storyline is resolved abruptly and unconvincingly - I simply can't accept that Muriel Hemingway's character undergoes a total conversion from yellow journalist to an editor with integrity. What exactly inspires this change of heart, besides the fact that she's hot for stumbling, stupid Clark Kent? The nuclear missile plot is also glossed over. I'm not exactly sure why Superman decides to abandon his disarmament mission; just because Lex Luthor's given him some trouble, suddenly he's not in favor of world peace? The movie simply doesn't explore his decision-making processes thoroughly enough.Another strangely underdeveloped plot line is the sale of the Kent farm. In an early scene, we find out that a ""big developer"" is interested in buying the farm, but Clark would prefer to sell it to a small-time farmer. This is actually a pretty nice segment, pleasingly reminiscent of the first film, but it comes to absolutely nothing, as the sale of the farm is never mentioned again. Huh? Some of these plotting problems doubtless arise from the fact that about 40 minutes were chopped out of the film before its release. However, I've heard that a lot of the missing footage is devoted to action, so it probably plugs relatively few of the aforementioned plot gaps. Anyway, what really matters is that the theatrical release is semi-incomprehensible.The special effects are another big minus for the film. For example, the same terrible ""green screen"" shot of Superman flying toward the audience is reused about eight times, and it's so bad that you didn't even want to see it once. I know this film had a limited $17 million budget, but for goodness' sake, I've seen better special effects done on much smaller TV budgets.And yet...and yet...I can't bring myself to hate this movie. At a mere 90 minutes, it's much pacier (and more sincere) than the plodding, dreadful ""Superman III."" Also, it's nice to see Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman back in substantial roles after they were basically ignored in the previous film. Hackman's performance as Lex Luthor is always pretty funny, even if he's playing it on auto-pilot; I particularly enjoy the moment when he lights his cigar using Nuclear Man's radioactive aura.I don't even object to the presence of Mariel Hemingway, who is strangely sexy in this movie - though somehow I feel obliged to point out that an actress with a one-scene cameo as a teacher is actually the prettiest woman in the whole thing.Even the much-maligned special effects have a certain campy charm. And, you know, Nuclear Man is cool in certain dumb ways; he gives Superman a tough fight, which makes him at least somewhat interesting. He looks ridiculous, of course, but I don't really sweat his mullet as much as everyone else does. (When are we going to get over this whole childish mullet obsession, anyway?) Despite this praise, I should note that, toward the ending of the movie, Nuclear Man flies into space carrying Hemingway...and she survives, despite the fact that she's not wearing a space suit. That complete lack of realism, attention to detail, whatever you want to call it - I guess that's typical of the whole movie. But I still get a laugh out of it.",worth few laughs,i recently watched superman iv first time since well 1987 i guess how time flies i thought first half hour was actually pretty good not luminous but fine hostile takeover daily planet is interesting i enjoyed supermans moral dilemma about nuclear missile situation some reviews suggest that superman is all gung ho about disarming world fact hes initially quite reluctant do so but after that decent first half hour movie pretty much falls apart daily planet storyline is resolved abruptly unconvincingly i simply cant accept that muriel hemingways character undergoes total conversion yellow journalist editor with integrity what exactly inspires this change heart besides fact that shes hot stumbling stupid clark kent nuclear missile plot is also glossed over im not exactly sure why superman decides abandon his disarmament mission just because lex luthors given him some trouble suddenly hes not favor world peace movie simply doesnt explore his decision making processes thoroughly enough another strangely underdeveloped plot line is sale kent farm early scene we find out that big developer is interested buying farm but clark would prefer sell it small time farmer this is actually pretty nice segment pleasingly reminiscent first film but it comes absolutely nothing as sale farm is never mentioned again huh some these plotting problems doubtless arise fact that about 40 minutes were chopped out film before its release however ive heard that lot missing footage is devoted action so it probably plugs relatively few aforementioned plot gaps anyway what really matters is that theatrical release is semi incomprehensible special effects are another big minus film example same terrible green screen shot superman flying toward audience is reused about eight times its so bad that you didnt even want see it once i know this film had limited 17 million budget but goodness sake ive seen better special effects done much smaller tv budgets yet yet i cant bring myself hate this movie at mere 90 minutes its much pacier more sincere than plodding dreadful superman iii also its nice see margot kidder gene hackman back substantial roles after they were basically ignored previous film hackmans performance as lex luthor is always pretty funny even if hes playing it auto pilot i particularly enjoy moment when he lights his cigar using nuclear mans radioactive aura i dont even object presence mariel hemingway who is strangely sexy this movie though somehow i feel obliged point out that actress with one scene cameo as teacher is actually prettiest woman whole thing even much maligned special effects have certain campy charm you know nuclear man is cool certain dumb ways he gives superman tough fight which makes him at least somewhat interesting he looks ridiculous course but i dont really sweat his mullet as much as everyone else does when are we going get over this whole childish mullet obsession anyway despite this praise i should note that toward ending movie nuclear man flies into space carrying hemingway she survives despite fact that shes not wearing space suit that complete lack realism attention detail whatever you want call it i guess thats typical whole movie but i still get laugh out it,0.45406639358252265,0.05293565454855779,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,Crap...but good if you want to laugh at the ineptitude of the film.,"""Superman IV: Quest for Peace"" should have been renamed ""Superman IV: Quest for a Plot"" as the film's script is pure garbage...full of schmaltz, preachiness and so many things that simply are dumb and make little sense. It's also a film that clearly shows the limits of special effects, as even with 1980s technology the film should have looked so much better--especially since it's about the most effects-laden Superman film up to that time.The story is full of saccharine when the entire planet stops to take notice of some little boy who writes to Superman to request that he bring about world peace! Superman, never wanting to disappoint any child, responds by destroying the world's nuclear stockpile. However, Lex Luthor disguises one of the nuclear missiles as just a garden variety nuclear bomb when really it's infused with some Superman DNA. So, when the missile is tossed into the sun, it naturally produces an evil Krytonian who is bent on killing Superman and working for Luthor. Can our incredibly plastic hero destroy this evil menace AND balance two women...one who is beautiful and loves Clark and another who's an idiot who STILL can't understand that Clark and Superman are the same freaking guy!!While the story is saccharine and stupid and the special effects quite bad, the film team do manage to also make the acting terrible- -even by Superman standards. The standout in this department is Jon Cryer-- who really can act. But given the bilge the writers (a room full of baboons, I think), he comes off as simply annoying and hateful. The rest, by the way, aren't much better.So do I recommend this film? Yes and no. No if you want to see a decent film. Yes if you are either using it to torture someone or if you are a glutton for punishment, like me, and occasionally enjoy laughing at Hollywood stars destroying themselves.

5.0,"Actors try hard, but movie fails","Superman IV is not nearly as bad as the reviews suggest. The actors try really hard, particularly Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Margot Kidder, to make it work. The movie is watchable and the musical score is good. The movie is an improvement over the disappointing Superman III. However, Superman IV has major problems. The movie has obviously been cut from its original length make it incoherent at times. The special effects are below the standards set in the first two movies (even the third movie had decent effects). Maybe if the movie were restored to its original length, it would be better.

6.0,"So bad, yet so watchable !","Superman 1 was such a classic movie, and 2 was almost as great - Superman 3 is not a great Superman movie, but as a piece of '80s American comedy / spoof it succeeds and has some very memorable scenes (notably Chris Reeve as the evil Superman). But Part 4 is just an awful film overall with few redeeming qualities. Reeve's admirable storyline works well, and the double date scene with Superman & Clark is very entertaining (similar to the style of Superman III). But it's when Superman IV tries to get serious and exciting in its action sequences that it fails miserably and becomes a cheesey, ridiculous farce that only succeeds in showing how pointless it was to make the film on such a small budget. The story's not bad and if Donner was directing and you had 100 million dollars you could do it now and create a great adventure movie with some classic comedy scenes and some exciting action sequences.

8.0,"""The film that killed Superman""? Give me a break","I cannot stand public opinion about the fourth and final Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" outing. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"", while not the best of the entire series, is better than ""Superman III"" and better than Richard Lester's cartoonish ""Superman II"" (in which Lois Lane actually says, ""I'm going to change into something more comfortable"").First of all, people have claimed that ""IV"" is the most physically ridiculous of all four. This is not true. Yes, for a human to fly in space, they would have to survive being burned up leaving Earth's atmosphere, then survive the vacuum of space (in other words, two people would have been dead by the end of the movie). However, let's revisit the 1978 original, in which the Man of Steel flies around the world, making it spin backwards, which also makes time reverse. If that really happened, every living thing and object on the planet's face would be flung off into the cold depths of space.I won't linger on this anymore. Yes, ""The Quest for Peace"" has unbearable dialogue (in places), but it's classic Superman-- the cheese, the cheap effects, and the general cartoon feel. Plus, it does have Jon Cryer, in what is oddly his best performance of all time (you'd better believe it), and a solid message people still need to think about. In other words, come to believe a man can fly, stay for the inherent message of the movie: we would have to be very stupid to nuke our own planet.",film that killed superman give me break,i cannot stand public opinion about fourth final christopher reeve superman outing superman iv quest peace while not best entire series is better than superman iii better than richard lesters cartoonish superman ii which lois lane actually says im going change into something more comfortable first all people have claimed that iv is most physically ridiculous all four this is not true yes human fly space they would have survive being burned up leaving earths atmosphere then survive vacuum space other words two people would have been dead by end movie however lets revisit 1978 original which man steel flies around world making it spin backwards which also makes time reverse if that really happened every living thing object planets face would be flung off into cold depths space i wont linger this anymore yes quest peace has unbearable dialogue places but its classic superman cheese cheap effects general cartoon feel plus it does have jon cryer what is oddly his best performance all time youd better believe it solid message people still need think about other words come believe man can fly stay inherent message movie we would have be very stupid nuke our own planet,0.48210784313725485,0.12083333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.28}"

,Crashing down to Earth,"* (1 out of 5) Superman IV: The Quest For Peace Directed by: Sidney J. Furie, 1987 Perversely bad. With major budget cuts (from $28 to $16m) and story problems, the moviemakers suddenly found themselves cutting corners in all areas. And it shows. Completely lacking in awe, fun and excitement, Superman IV most of all feels like a bad joke. The fact that it comes across more cartoonish than the previous three is hardly intentional, as everything - from effects to dialogue - just seems oddly rushed and second-rate.The only highlight is Gene Hackman - who returns in high spirits as Lex Luthor. Christopher Reeve co-scripted this time and he again personifies the Man of Steel. But most of his co-stars are either wasted (Mariel Hemingway) or hysterical (John Cryer). The new villian, Nuclear Man (as played by Mark Pillow), looks like a Swedish showwrestler in a home-made Halloween suit, complete with mullet hair and horrendous over-acting mannerisms. Director Sidney J. Furie (the man behind the otherwise taut thriller The Entity) seems unable to create any sparks and Superman IV falls completely flat, head first. Game over.Note: Certain scenes had to be borrowed from the previous movies, most notably Superman and Lois on their romantic evening flight above the Manhattan skyline. How they even managed to make this scene look worse than in the original is really mind-boggling.",crashing down earth,1 out 5 superman iv quest peace directed by sidney j furie 1987 perversely bad with major budget cuts 28 16m story problems moviemakers suddenly found themselves cutting corners all areas it shows completely lacking awe fun excitement superman iv most all feels like bad joke fact that it comes across more cartoonish than previous three is hardly intentional as everything effects dialogue just seems oddly rushed second rate only highlight is gene hackman who returns high spirits as lex luthor christopher reeve co scripted this time he again personifies man steel but most his co stars are either wasted mariel hemingway or hysterical john cryer new villian nuclear man as played by mark pillow looks like swedish showwrestler home made halloween suit complete with mullet hair horrendous over acting mannerisms director sidney j furie man behind otherwise taut thriller entity seems unable create any sparks superman iv falls completely flat head first game over note certain scenes had be borrowed previous movies most notably superman lois their romantic evening flight above manhattan skyline how they even managed make this scene look worse than original is really mind boggling,0.44226471059804395,-0.04094646865480196,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.27}"

,INTERESTING AND ENJOYABLE FILM,"If you've read my reviews of the previous Superman films you'll know that I have nothing but praise for them. Well, I have praise for this film as well.Firstly, Nuclear Man is an awesome villain and probably the scariest supervillain I've ever seen. And it was good to see Gene Hackman back as the evil but likeable Lex Luthor.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) This is a movie with an interesting theme. A young boy asks Superman to rid the world of nuclear weapons which Superman does. However, at the end of the film Superman attends a press conference and tells the press that world peace is not a gift that he can give-humanity will have to work for it. He also pinches a quote from an American president (I don't know which one) by telling the world that, ""There will be world peace one day because the people of the world are going to want it so badly that their governments are going to have no choice but to give it to them."" True words eh? Anyway, I thought Superman's speech at the press conference was a nice touch to the film and it gave out a strong message-that peace must be worked for.Back to the film now-the battles between Superman and Nuclear Man were great. Does Superman beat Nuclear Man with his fists? No he doesn't. Once again he uses his brain to defeat Nuclear Man.This was a great movie which I had the pleasure of seeing at the cinema in 1987 and I really can't understand why it has been criticized so badly over the years. It was a great movie. I wish there would have been a Superman V and there probably would have been if the excellant Christopher Reeve hadn't suffered his awful accident in 1995.Chris Reeve is the definitive Superman",interesting enjoyable film,if youve read my reviews previous superman films youll know that i have nothing but praise them well i have praise this film as well firstly nuclear man is awesome villain probably scariest supervillain ive ever seen it was good see gene hackman back as evil but likeable lex luthor possible spoilers ahead this is movie with interesting theme young boy asks superman rid world nuclear weapons which superman does however at end film superman attends press conference tells press that world peace is not gift that he can give humanity will have work it he also pinches quote american president i dont know which one by telling world that there will be world peace one day because people world are going want it so badly that their governments are going have no choice but give it them true words eh anyway i thought supermans speech at press conference was nice touch film it gave out strong message that peace must be worked back film now battles between superman nuclear man were great does superman beat nuclear man with his fists no he doesnt once again he uses his brain defeat nuclear man this was great movie which i had pleasure seeing at cinema 1987 i really cant understand why it has been criticized so badly over years it was great movie i wish there would have been superman v there probably would have been if excellant christopher reeve hadnt suffered his awful accident 1995 chris reeve is definitive superman,0.5768115942028985,0.17246376811594202,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"

2.0,"A ""Super"" disaster","After an absence of four years, along with Christopher Reeve's initial determination he was done with the blue and red tights after Superman III, the Superman franchise was brought back to life for one more entry, but after the release of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, it's unfortunate that everyone involved hadn't just decided to let things alone. Superman IV is a complete disaster on almost every level, a silly, cheesy and downright cheap looking poor excuse for a film that manages to rank among the worst comic book adaptation films of all time, bested only by such ""winners"" as The Return of Swamp Thing and the direct-to-video Captain America.Superman IV finds our hero, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve), selling off his family farm after his mother has died between performing his normal super duties. He returns to Metropolis to discover that the Daily Planet has been taken over by tabloid king David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemmingway) and are turning it into a salacious rag sheet. Shortly after the takeover, a young boy writes Superman a letter, via the Daily Planet, and asks him for assistance in solving the arms crisis by removing all nuclear weapons from the Earth. Superman initially refuses, taking the stance that he cannot interfere in human affairs (although how this relates to his other helping of humanity is a puzzler). Eventually, Superman changes his mind and begins ridding the world of all nuclear weapons by tossing them into the sun.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has escaped from prison with the assistance of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer), and hatched a devious scheme: to create a new super villain to defeat Superman by taking a sample of Superman's DNA recovered from a museum exhibit featuring a single hair from Superman's head and attaching it and a computer to the side of one of the missiles that are hurled into the sun by Superman and thus creating Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow, voiced by Gene Hackman), a being with the power of Superman, the voice of Lex Luthor, plus more abilities, powered by the sun. The two match off, but has Superman finally met his rival? It's not really surprising that Superman IV is terrible movie, considering it was produced by The Canon Group, who may never have released what you could label a ""good"" movie when they existed in the '80s. And Superman IV is not a good movie. It has an intriguing concept at it's heart, Superman ridding the world of nuclear devices, but everything around that central idea is just a complete mess. The script by Laurence Konner and Mark Rosenthal is borderline insipid, featuring some extreme gaps in logic that cause the audience to have to accept some absolutely ridiculous contrivances and just asinine ideas. Superman tosses a missile containing Nuclear Man's basic building blocks into the sun. And how is that not all fried by the sun? Okay, maybe the Superman genetic material may not be (although I don't know if it was ever stated he is able to withstand even the sun), but the computer that will supposedly give Nuclear Man form, along with the barest shreds of material that suddenly grow into clothes to cover his body? Please. And how does he get Lex's voice? Late in the film, a human character is carried into space by Nuclear Man with no oxygen or protective suit, and survives. The complete contempt for the audience the script shows is inexcusable.With Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) still pulling a mostly supporting role, the writers attempt to inject Lacy as a new love interest, with her eye on Clark instead of Superman. They also try to generate a triangle between them, but none of it works. There is no chemistry between Lacy and Clark, and much of what was there between Superman and Lois seems to be gone or on life support. Yeah, Lex Luthor is back, but he is nowhere near as engaging as he was in Superman and Superman II. Hackman does the best he can with his questionable material, but there is no saving it.Many of the outstanding aspects of the previous films are just shoddy this time around. The special effects are abysmal, with many generic elements of Superman flying reused over and over again and almost none of it is believable. The action sequences, what few there are, are unspectacular and barely raise your pulse. The film, on the whole, has a rushed and half-complete feeling to it, and you get the impression you are watching a movie made on the cheap, not the latest sequel to a successful, multi-million dollar grossing franchise.So, after close to ten years and three sequels, Supeman IV is able to do what Lex Luthor could never accomplish: it brought the Man of Steel down, and left him tattered. It would take almost two decades for Superman to fly again, and we can only hope that the next entry is worth your time, because this one wasn't.",super disaster,after absence four years along with christopher reeves initial determination he was done with blue red tights after superman iii superman franchise was brought back life one more entry but after release superman iv quest peace its unfortunate that everyone involved hadnt just decided let things alone superman iv is complete disaster almost every level silly cheesy downright cheap looking poor excuse film that manages rank among worst comic book adaptation films all time bested only by such winners as return swamp thing direct video captain america superman iv finds our hero clark kent christopher reeve selling off his family farm after his mother has died between performing his normal super duties he returns metropolis discover that daily planet has been taken over by tabloid king david warfield sam wanamaker his daughter lacy mariel hemmingway are turning it into salacious rag sheet shortly after takeover young boy writes superman letter via daily planet asks him assistance solving arms crisis by removing all nuclear weapons earth superman initially refuses taking stance that he cannot interfere human affairs although how this relates his other helping humanity is puzzler eventually superman changes his mind begins ridding world all nuclear weapons by tossing them into sun meanwhile lex luthor gene hackman has escaped prison with assistance his nephew lenny jon cryer hatched devious scheme create new super villain defeat superman by taking sample supermans dna recovered museum exhibit featuring single hair supermans head attaching it computer side one missiles that are hurled into sun by superman thus creating nuclear man mark pillow voiced by gene hackman being with power superman voice lex luthor plus more abilities powered by sun two match off but has superman finally met his rival its not really surprising that superman iv is terrible movie considering it was produced by canon group who may never have released what you could label good movie when they existed 80s superman iv is not good movie it has intriguing concept at its heart superman ridding world nuclear devices but everything around that central idea is just complete mess script by laurence konner mark rosenthal is borderline insipid featuring some extreme gaps logic that cause audience have accept some absolutely ridiculous contrivances just asinine ideas superman tosses missile containing nuclear mans basic building blocks into sun how is that not all fried by sun okay maybe superman genetic material may not be although i dont know if it was ever stated he is able withstand even sun but computer that will supposedly give nuclear man form along with barest shreds material that suddenly grow into clothes cover his body please how does he get lexs voice late film human character is carried into space by nuclear man with no oxygen or protective suit survives complete contempt audience script shows is inexcusable with lois lane margot kidder still pulling mostly supporting role writers attempt inject lacy as new love interest with her eye clark instead superman they also try generate triangle between them but none it works there is no chemistry between lacy clark much what was there between superman lois seems be gone or life support yeah lex luthor is back but he is nowhere near as engaging as he was superman superman ii hackman does best he can with his questionable material but there is no saving it many outstanding aspects previous films are just shoddy this time around special effects are abysmal with many generic elements superman flying reused over over again almost none it is believable action sequences what few there are are unspectacular barely raise your pulse film whole has rushed half complete feeling it you get impression you are watching movie made cheap not latest sequel successful multi million dollar grossing franchise so after close ten years three sequels supeman iv is able do what lex luthor could never accomplish it brought man steel down left him tattered it would take almost two decades superman fly again we can only hope that next entry is worth your time because this one wasnt,0.4534356166709109,0.06174963924963924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"

5.0,"Not As Bad As It's Rap...But Not Too Great, Either","After the abysmal effort from Richard Lester that was Superman III, the fourth film in the franchise rebounded a bit, but still dragged in a few crucial categories.The Good:-The acting is back to the quality of the first two films. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is back to his nefariously hilarious ways, Christopher Reeve (Clark/Superman) is again the stoic, righteous hero he is meant to be, and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) is back in her enthusiastic mode. -Also, the storyline is, in all actuality, probably the closest in form to the old Superman comics than any of the other films. In trying to rid the world of nuclear warfare, Superman takes the type of moral and ethical stand he is known for in his legacy. A very moving politically-charged plot along the lines of Rocky IV and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.The Bad:-The special effects in this film were terrible. The flights, although I didn't notice any stray wires, were not as majestic as the first two films, while it was often much too easy to distinguish the matte background (like in space with no stars!). Plus, instead of really cool effects, the FX crew instead goes hokey, epitomized by Superman's ""visual rebuilding"" of the Great Wall of China that is just plain stupid. -However, the pacing of the film is really what bogs the movie down. Many scenes were cut from the film in post-production, making the plot a bit herky-jerky and confusing. Halfway through the film, the plot is steadily progressing. Then, suddenly, Superman begins his fight with Nuclear Man, which essentially lasts the entire second half of the movie.So, despite a more inspiring plot and much better acting, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is dragged down by cop-out special effects and directorial issues that never really allowed the film to inspire awe or hold the viewers' interest. Thus, this second straight sub-par Superman film effectively killed the Superman franchise for nearly two decades.",not as bad as its rap but not too great either,after abysmal effort richard lester that was superman iii fourth film franchise rebounded bit but still dragged few crucial categories good acting is back quality first two films gene hackmans lex luthor is back his nefariously hilarious ways christopher reeve clark superman is again stoic righteous hero he is meant be margot kidder lois lane is back her enthusiastic mode also storyline is all actuality probably closest form old superman comics than any other films trying rid world nuclear warfare superman takes type moral ethical stand he is known his legacy very moving politically charged plot along lines rocky iv star trek vi undiscovered country bad special effects this film were terrible flights although i didnt notice any stray wires were not as majestic as first two films while it was often much too easy distinguish matte background like space with no stars plus instead really cool effects fx crew instead goes hokey epitomized by supermans visual rebuilding great wall china that is just plain stupid however pacing film is really what bogs movie down many scenes were cut film post production making plot bit herky jerky confusing halfway through film plot is steadily progressing then suddenly superman begins his fight with nuclear man which essentially lasts entire second half movie so despite more inspiring plot much better acting superman iv quest peace is dragged down by cop out special effects directorial issues that never really allowed film inspire awe or hold viewers interest thus this second straight sub par superman film effectively killed superman franchise nearly two decades,0.40936819172113287,0.07739651416122008,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.29}"

There are a lot of problems with the ridiculous nature of this movie. Nephew Lenny is annoyingly silly. The premise of the world politics is stupid. The idea that Superman would reveal his identity and kiss it away just to ease his mind seems wrong. The effects may have actually gotten worst. However the biggest mistake is the idea that Superman would get rid of all the nuclear weapons.During WWII, Superman never really battle the Nazis or the Japanese directly. It was a matter of Superman not be a God like figure to direct and interfere with mankind's wars.

Basically Clark Kent aka Superman (Christopher Reeve) returns home to Smallville, and to the space capsule that brought him to Earth, and instructed by the voice of his mother Lara (Susannah York) he removes the luminescent green Kryptonian energy module, its power can only be used once, and refusing to sell his farm he returns to Metropolis. At the Daily Planet the newspaper has been taken over by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Razzie nominated Mariel Hemingway) is the new editor, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) is fired, and Clark realises nuclear threat increasing between the United States and the Soviet Union he knows as Superman he must intervene, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) gives him support and advice. At the United Nations a meeting is called by Superman, he promises that he will collect and get rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, he manages to collect them in a gigantic net in space, and with his super strength he hurls it into the sun to explode. Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has been broken out of prison by his slow- witted teenage Lenny (Two and a Half Men's Jon Cryer), and returning to the city he has a plan to steal a strand of Superman's strong hair from a museum and with DNA genetics technology on a missile fire it into the sun and create a develop a new super-human. This plan works, and from the explosion of the weapon flies out Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow, voiced by Hackman), a super-human with all the powers of Superman, as well as electrical solar charges, but he is only active in sunlight, and eventually he fights with his rival. Scratched by Nuclear Man's radioactive claws Superman is infected with radiation sickness, and this is when he is forced the use the Kryptonian energy module to cure himself, and meanwhile the solar charged villain has a crush on Lacy and wants to be introduced, or he will hurt people. Superman manages to trap him in an elevator when the sunlight disappears, but Nuclear Man breaks out again when the light returns, forces the hero into the surface of the moon and kidnaps Lacy, but the superhero returns and the two rivals fight in space, Nuclear Man is defeated when Superman forces an eclipse, deactivating him, and he is destroyed in a nuclear plant core. Perry White returns as chief at the Daily Planet and Warfield is lessened in position, Luthor and his nephew are returned to prison, and Superman knows that nuclear weapons cannot be stopped entirely, but in a speech to the nations he assures them that one day governments will come together and make peace, and he flies away to continue to save people and have other adventures. Also starring Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen, Damian McLawhorn as Jeremy, William Hootkins as Harry Howler, Jim Broadbent as Jean Pierre Dubois, Stanley Lebor as General Romoff and Robert Beatty as U.S. President. Reeve is alright in his blue tights saving the world and in spectacles being awkward, Hackman looks to be having fun as a bit more pantomime villain, and Pillow is silly with the dubbed voice of Hackman as the anti-superhero in gold and black tights. The story is filled with ridiculous ideas and terrible moral or whatever messages, the acting is lame, the special effects for the flying and fighting sequences, even explosions and city destruction, look like hardly any money went into them, and overall it is clunky, and ultimately killed off the series, thank goodness things have improved somewhat in recent incarnations, a crap and worthless fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Visual Effects.

6.0,Nowhere near as bad as people seem to think,"I have watched this recently (early 2011) on the Deluxe DVD – picked up very cheaply to complete my set – I think for the first time since it came out. As a teenager, I am sure I enjoyed it as a piece of typical escapism, but I have come back to it now – screening a season for myself of all five Superman films – aware that people seem to think it's an all-time turkey. Well I am here to say that this really isn't fair.As with so many things, it's all a matter of context – yes, alongside a modern equivalent superhero sequel, e.g. The Dark Knight or any of the X-Men follow-ups, it's pretty dire. But then alongside a contemporary equivalent – say, Highlander II: The Quickening or Ghostbusters 2 – it's almost sublime! (But then compared to Highlander II, nuclear war sounds like a pleasant diversion.)Anyway, I am prepared to say that this is not even the worst Superman film! It's worthy of re-evaluation and it's genuinely worth seeing as part of the series.Firstly, it's VERY 1980s when you watch it now. Big-hair-tastic and shoulder-pad-mungous. But this is comparable to any other film from that era, such as Robocop or Working Girl. And yes, infamously there are some extremely dodgy effects in the mix – but some of them are actually very good. This odd contrast is not so different from the previous films in the series, especially the first from 1978. And remember that Ghostbusters – released the previous year and winning an Oscar for its effects, no less – has some risible shots when you look at it now.The real problem with Superman IV is that it's clearly been compromised in the making, ultimately put together without all the footage the director had planned to shoot. The infamous budget slashing by the studio is obvious in various scenes. While, jarringly, elsewhere you can see the money up on screen – the result being an uneven whole that's sadly less than the sum of its parts.I shall have to check out the deleted scenes some time to see what potential was there. But as it is, there are so many plus points trying to save this film:Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor again, with lots of good lines and villainous charm. he was shamefully wasted in Superman II, as was Kevin Spacey in this role in the turgid and unengaging Superman Returns. Hijacking the airwaves to lure Superman, Luthor signs off with V-for-victory signs and an ironic ""Peace!"" and I love the subsequent scene where he has his say/exercises his ego before our endlessly patient hero, constantly on the move and fixing himself a drink of champagne to toast the demise of his arch-enemy. (It's clear, too, that the film-makers decided to try to top his wonderful subterranean lair from the original film by having his new hideout a big Art Deco set for the top of Metropolis' equivalent of the Empire State Building.)The rest of the returning cast all do a solid job and, of course, Christopher Reeve is excellent. As the clutzy Clark Kent, he mistimes his aerobics (so 80s again!) but slyly gets back at a bully, bumbles around the capable Margot Kidder's Lois Lane and compliments his new love interest on her dress – badly and only at Lois' prompting. And then, as the earnest Superman, wrestling with his conscience and making then-oh-so-valid points about the Cold War arms race and human frailties, he gives the film a weighty centre. A scene at the now deserted Kent farm is touching and there is even the revelation that, without his parents, he now seems to be in the habit of revealing his identity to Lois for some love and advice, then mind-wiping her (again) with a super-snog! She is not, it is strongly suggested, entirely unaware of this arrangement...Lastly, Sidney J Furie is a very capable director and his work shines in certain scenes... while elsewhere you are left musing sadly on what might (should) have been. The double date is superbly handled – for example, there's a lovely shot where Clark quick-changes into Superman through a car parked outside revolving doors. And dare I say that the sequences where the 'Nuclear Man' goes on the rampage, around the world and then on the streets of Metropolis, are actually better handled, with more sense of scale and jeopardy than the three Kryptonian villains' not dissimilar activities in Superman II. Then there is the careful way Superman's famed all-American persona is, in this film (only, out of the five), balanced against a sense of him actually being an international figure, fluent in all languages and looking at the planet and the human race as one whole. In the opening scene we are presented with some Soviet cosmonauts who are shown to be 'just like you and me', neatly setting up the film's entire premise – which is eventually tied up with even the defeated Luthor asking an Eisenhower-quoting Superman if the Earth will be vapourised in WWIII and being told that, as always, the planet is ""on the brink with good fighting evil"".So in conclusion: It's nowhere near as good as the original, epic Superman, nor does it work with anything like the brio of Superman III, which is pure entertainment in my book. But it scores over Superman II, which for me feels like it was too old-fashioned even upon its initial release and seems even more compromised in its mix of what works and what jars. While in last place I am afraid I must put the disappointingly wet and unimaginative Superman Returns.",nowhere near as bad as people seem think,i have watched this recently early 2011 deluxe dvd picked up very cheaply complete my set i think first time since it came out as teenager i am sure i enjoyed it as piece typical escapism but i have come back it now screening season myself all five superman films aware that people seem think its all time turkey well i am here say that this really isnt fair as with so many things its all matter context yes alongside modern equivalent superhero sequel e g dark knight or any x men follow ups its pretty dire but then alongside contemporary equivalent say highlander ii quickening or ghostbusters 2 its almost sublime but then compared highlander ii nuclear war sounds like pleasant diversion anyway i am prepared say that this is not even worst superman film its worthy re evaluation its genuinely worth seeing as part series firstly its very 1980s when you watch it now big hair tastic shoulder pad mungous but this is comparable any other film that era such as robocop or working girl yes infamously there are some extremely dodgy effects mix but some them are actually very good this odd contrast is not so different previous films series especially first 1978 remember that ghostbusters released previous year winning oscar its effects no less has some risible shots when you look at it now real problem with superman iv is that its clearly been compromised making ultimately put together without all footage director had planned shoot infamous budget slashing by studio is obvious various scenes while jarringly elsewhere you can see money up screen result being uneven whole thats sadly less than sum its parts i shall have check out deleted scenes some time see what potential was there but as it is there are so many plus points trying save this film gene hackman is great as lex luthor again with lots good lines villainous charm he was shamefully wasted superman ii as was kevin spacey this role turgid unengaging superman returns hijacking airwaves lure superman luthor signs off with v victory signs ironic peace i love subsequent scene where he has his say exercises his ego before our endlessly patient hero constantly move fixing himself drink champagne toast demise his arch enemy its clear too that film makers decided try top his wonderful subterranean lair original film by having his new hideout big art deco set top metropolis equivalent empire state building rest returning cast all do solid job course christopher reeve is excellent as clutzy clark kent he mistimes his aerobics so 80s again but slyly gets back at bully bumbles around capable margot kidders lois lane compliments his new love interest her dress badly only at lois prompting then as earnest superman wrestling with his conscience making then oh so valid points about cold war arms race human frailties he gives film weighty centre scene at now deserted kent farm is touching there is even revelation that without his parents he now seems be habit revealing his identity lois some love advice then mind wiping her again with super snog she is not it is strongly suggested entirely unaware this arrangement lastly sidney j furie is very capable director his work shines certain scenes while elsewhere you are left musing sadly what might should have been double date is superbly handled example theres lovely shot where clark quick changes into superman through car parked outside revolving doors dare i say that sequences where nuclear man goes rampage around world then streets metropolis are actually better handled with more sense scale jeopardy than three kryptonian villains not dissimilar activities superman ii then there is careful way supermans famed all american persona is this film only out five balanced against sense him actually being international figure fluent all languages looking at planet human race as one whole opening scene we are presented with some soviet cosmonauts who are shown be just like you me neatly setting up films entire premise which is eventually tied up with even defeated luthor asking eisenhower quoting superman if earth will be vapourised wwiii being told that as always planet is brink with good fighting evil so conclusion its nowhere near as good as original epic superman nor does it work with anything like brio superman iii which is pure entertainment my book but it scores over superman ii which me feels like it was too old fashioned even upon its initial release seems even more compromised its mix what works what jars while last place i am afraid i must put disappointingly wet unimaginative superman returns,0.49822289822289834,0.14756425256425254,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4.0,The movie takes itself far too serious.,"The whole story and concept are just as ridiculous as the ones for Superman II & III but difference with those movies was that it was obvious that they didn't took themselves too seriously with as a result some entertaining B-movie fun. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" however takes itself far too serious, which makes the ridicules story and concept seem even more ridicules. The movie could had certainly used some more humor and comical situations and characters.The movie had still quite some potential to be honest but the weak directing and storytelling makes this a movie filled with holes and loose ends. Some moments are just completely unbelievable and there are more than a few obvious goofs in the movie and the story.It's surprising to see that Gene Hackman actually agreed to return in this movie after his absence in ""Superman III"". Not even he can give the movie a fun and light feeling. His character is terribly underused in the movie and the real main villain of the movie (Nuclear Man) is only introduced towards the ending of the movie. Nuclear Man is a pretty decent villain but he is simply introduced too late in the movie to leave a lasting impression.Not even Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder seem to feel at ease in this movie. They were both great in the previous 3 Superman movies but they really don't seem to feel comfortable with this movie its script and dialog.The special effects look absolutely horrible and are by far the worst of any of the Superman movies.Yes, the movie does still have some entertainment value and it still has some good superhero elements in the movie but overall it's a movie not really worth watching. The directing and the script are weak and not even the normally fine actors can make the movie fun or believable enough. All that is left now is a silly, horrible mess.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",movie takes itself far too serious,whole story concept are just as ridiculous as ones superman ii iii but difference with those movies was that it was obvious that they didnt took themselves too seriously with as result some entertaining b movie fun superman iv quest peace however takes itself far too serious which makes ridicules story concept seem even more ridicules movie could had certainly used some more humor comical situations characters movie had still quite some potential be honest but weak directing storytelling makes this movie filled with holes loose ends some moments are just completely unbelievable there are more than few obvious goofs movie story its surprising see that gene hackman actually agreed return this movie after his absence superman iii not even he can give movie fun light feeling his character is terribly underused movie real main villain movie nuclear man is only introduced towards ending movie nuclear man is pretty decent villain but he is simply introduced too late movie leave lasting impression not even christopher reeve margot kidder seem feel at ease this movie they were both great previous 3 superman movies but they really dont seem feel comfortable with this movie its script dialog special effects look absolutely horrible are by far worst any superman movies yes movie does still have some entertainment value it still has some good superhero elements movie but overall its movie not really worth watching directing script are weak not even normally fine actors can make movie fun or believable enough all that is left now is silly horrible mess 4 10,0.5777243589743591,0.041791764782836194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
