8,Brave and beautiful.,"The majority of the first 20 or 30 minutes of the movie are of household chores. You might find it frustrating. But that's the point. If watching a few scenes of cooking and cleaning makes you frustrated, imagine how the ones who does those things feel. You might also feel some scenes were exaggerated. Yes, things have changed a lot in most places. But trust me, there are still some people who follow those ridiculous rituals. Some idiots might say this is against Hinduism and all. But it's not. These same people would've said people like Ayyankali and Sree Narayana Guru were anti-Hindu. Nimisha Sajayan and Suraj delivers awesome performances as usual. But I'd love to see something different from Nimisha. The actors who played Suraj's parents were good. The movie mocks the hypocrisy of so called ""believers"".",brave beautiful,majority first 20 or 30 minutes movie are household chores you might find it frustrating but thats point if watching few scenes cooking cleaning makes you frustrated imagine how ones who does those things feel you might also feel some scenes were exaggerated yes things have changed lot most places but trust me there are still some people who follow those ridiculous rituals some idiots might say this is against hinduism all but its not these same people wouldve said people like ayyankali sree narayana guru were anti hindu nimisha sajayan suraj delivers awesome performances as usual but id love see something different nimisha actors who played surajs parents were good movie mocks hypocrisy so called believers,0.6255208333333332,0.08854166666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10,"Blunt, raw and beautiful.","This is definitely not the first movie to address the themes of gender inequality, gender discrimination, or ""the homemaker woman"" in Malayalam. It has always been a favorite topic for makers of family movies. But what makes this movie different is that, here the theme is not diluted for sake of giving balanced message. This movie shouts the message it says. Loud and clear. . It starts with the scene of an arranged marriage. From that moment, a beautiful mode of storytelling is set. The viewer witnesses visuals that happen everywhere in a traditional family and just by inviting attention to the places which needs attention, it is made clear what is wrong with it. It doesn't have the typical ""suppressed woman"" ingredients. The husband doesn't slap her. She is not shouted on. All that we see are the real raw things that happen typically, and still, the viewer will clearly understand what is wrong with all this. . Regarding the experience of watching the movie, the sound effects and camera work is exceptionally worth noting. It shows us that the art of cinematography is not just about making eye candy visuals. It is almost the opposite. Visuals are presented raw to us. . The actors comply very well with the standard set by the other aspects of the movie.

8,The GREAT MALE,"I had heard about this movie in 2020 in a review stating one among the top 10 Malayalam movies one should watch. I got to watch it recently And within the first 5 minutes - I was absorbed in it It is a brilliant movie. A Class apart that reflects a hidden dark truth of Indian society in general - more pertinently of the Brahminical higher class families who see women - as servants and the ones who do work and cook and serve the males.The issue is old and told many times before, but this time the Screenplay writer turned Director Jeo Baby has hit the nail hard not shying away from showing the truth as is.The story is simple. An educated dancer (several award-winning actress (Nimisha Sajayam) gets arranged-married to a teacher (Suraj Venaramood) in a traditional patriarchal family. Life as a newlywed bride with domestic routines starts with a bliss but slowly turns into a realization of the ugly truth of drudgery and patriarchal exploitative undertones - of how religious yet dirty these family men can be.Joe Baby through his tightly knit script does not miss a beat in every little detail of how insensitive men treat women - more in case their wives. Juxtaposed to the wife - the director has also shown other women - normalising the drudgery life with happiness and servilityNimisha Sajayam has done a brilliant job in acting through all the hard-work and dirtiness of daily household work load. The best part is there is not a single thing told as being preachy or shown negatively to create our audience's sympathy for the wife.Yet the sensitive audience will root for the wife. The best part of the movie is the ending which I won't reveal here to lukewarm it. It is dirty and good.Frankly I have seen a really good movie after a very long time. Surely all men who are patriarchal and pretending to be goody-goody husbands and kind - would find it very difficult to sit through this movie. They might not even understand - what is going on.It is also possible that many wives and women too would not be touched by the subject shown in the movieThis movie is a brutal truth as a tribute to the Indian wives married in an arranged marriage setup.I can keep on adding praise - worthy for his movie. It is once in a decade that such movies are made that are not only educational but socially changing.Brave, exceptional, powerful, must watch, classic - a hard slap on all the Indian mentality (which includes all family members who think women are here to do household chores)I recommend this movie to every husband, wife, in-laws and family members as compulsory viewing; and have discussion around their own households and daily lives.I would go with 8.25 out of 10 One of the highest rated movies of mine on IMDB (there are only 2 other rated so high by me)",great male,i had heard about this movie 2020 review stating one among top 10 malayalam movies one should watch i got watch it recently within first 5 minutes i was absorbed it it is brilliant movie class apart that reflects hidden dark truth indian society general more pertinently brahminical higher class families who see women as servants ones who do work cook serve males issue is old told many times before but this time screenplay writer turned director jeo baby has hit nail hard not shying away showing truth as is story is simple educated dancer several award winning actress nimisha sajayam gets arranged married teacher suraj venaramood traditional patriarchal family life as newlywed bride with domestic routines starts with bliss but slowly turns into realization ugly truth drudgery patriarchal exploitative undertones how religious yet dirty these family men can be joe baby through his tightly knit script does not miss beat every little detail how insensitive men treat women more case their wives juxtaposed wife director has also shown other women normalising drudgery life with happiness servilitynimisha sajayam has done brilliant job acting through all hard work dirtiness daily household work load best part is there is not single thing told as being preachy or shown negatively create our audiences sympathy wife yet sensitive audience will root wife best part movie is ending which i wont reveal here lukewarm it it is dirty good frankly i have seen really good movie after very long time surely all men who are patriarchal pretending be goody goody husbands kind would find it very difficult sit through this movie they might not even understand what is going it is also possible that many wives women too would not be touched by subject shown moviethis movie is brutal truth as tribute indian wives married arranged marriage setup i can keep adding praise worthy his movie it is once decade that such movies are made that are not only educational but socially changing brave exceptional powerful must watch classic hard slap all indian mentality which includes all family members who think women are here do household chores i recommend this movie every husband wife laws family members as compulsory viewing have discussion around their own households daily lives i would go with 8 25 out 10 one highest rated movies mine imdb there are only 2 other rated so high by me,0.5281524276377217,0.13428396358543418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.25}"

9,Totally watch this movie!,"The movie is about patriarchy, is simple and subtle but at the same time, raw and blunt. It revolves around what happens in a traditional family in an avg. Indian household, not only in Kerala. Regular everyday story told in a way that you see in everyday life but at the same time, it's a story that needs to be told, sadly even now in 2021.There's no in-your-face oppression/suppression, no domestic violence, no gender inequality/discrimination but the movie does a great job of saying how every day treatment of women in daily life is actually all of that. They go to show how elaborate Indian cooking is, just that women get used to doing all this on a daily basis and say ""It's easy!"" Sure, you've gotten used to it but it doesn't mean it's not a lot of work. We've all seen our mothers, relatives do all this work as kids, just never thought of how much effort goes behind putting food on the table.This movie shows that being a ""homemaker"" is far from easy and often comes at the expense of the hopes and dreams of women. It shows how stupid and oblivious men can be and sometimes, how women are asked to adjust/suck it up by women who've been through the pains of such a life.The movie's lead Nimisha Sajayan pretty much carries the entire movie on her shoulders, Suraj Venjaramoodu does a good job playing the bad guy. The movie has a lot of scenes in which there are no dialogues, just scenes of cooking inside the kitchen, which IMO were very important scenes. Just goes to show you don't need anything over-the-top, flashy ""item"" songs, a huge star cast to make a good movie.Totally watch this movie!

8,Must.,"In less than 24 hours I had the privilege to watch Jeo Baby's last two movies. One being a less than average film with a title of 'Kilometers and Kilometers' and another a gem called 'The great Indian Kitchen'.The second one is a gem not because of it's dialogues, cinematography, music or sceneic representation but rather despite of it, just because of it's story and subject.At least 5 people I personally know had recommended me to watch this movie, from a Bengali to Malayalis. Finally got to watch it with a friend's subscription on Neestream. Totally worth the hype and it's high time we change the Patriarchal norms acoustamisd in our society to Equality in the real sense.As a male and that too a newly married one, this movie was totally relatable not the torture parts but rather, I did feel guilty that women had/has to go such ordeals of hardships and exploitation. From childhood I have been told to pick my own things and get my own water but how many families do they teach such discipline?Jeo Baby says Amazon and Netflix rejected his movie, Netflix should have choosen this over Kilometers and Kilometers.Like Government exempts few movies from entertainment tax, such movies on OTT platform should also be made free or subsidized. As the Union budget today focused on PPP we should also have PPP model for brilliant and movies that are pivotal to the society. As someone said that ""Rang de Basanti"" was a Superhit but same applied in real life is not much appreciated for instance Farmer's Protest. Why so Hypocritical Society?? Why...The saying goes discrimination begins from home, I would say discrimination starts from Kitchen.Atleast Kerala had the guts to make and release this movie, in the Northern,Eastern and Western even few Southern belts of India I doubt that it would be released so easily, some or the other ""Sena"" would have objected, called out, and threatened to boycott or even chop off heads. Even if the problem is persisted in all parts but atleast few states have the courage to show up. The first step towards solving any problem is identification and acceptance of the problem. This isn't a gutsy or great cinema rather it's just reality portrayal in the simplistic way possible.No music and no nonsense. Just the female protagonist Nimisha Sajayan her husband played by Suraj Venjaramood and her choppping, mopping, cleaning. Not all abuses are direct and evident like verbal or sexual, some are intrusion of private space and freedom, causing immense internal violence. This film touches the chords of many people because it's so realistic and relatable. Everyone has experienced some kind of such tragic moments.The film also talks about the most important topic Oops sorry the taboo we Indians have. The obsession we have with Periods. Period. It's a natural biological thing why create so much fuss about it. I hope someday everything changes for good.Submission is not the solution.I love the way in the end, she drives her car but what I really really love is the subtle presence of Chekutty dolls, if you don't know what they are kindly Google it. Also as a Gujrati I feel proud that a Gujrati samaj school is shown in the end. Also a beautiful and brilliant dance performance in the end far better than Dance India Dance type's.This movie should be shown to newly weds, college students and even school children.A movie not just to be watched, but to be thought, discussed, debated, and evoluted and finally implemented.",must,less than 24 hours i had privilege watch jeo babys last two movies one being less than average film with title kilometers kilometers another gem called great indian kitchen second one is gem not because its dialogues cinematography music or sceneic representation but rather despite it just because its story subject at least 5 people i personally know had recommended me watch this movie bengali malayalis finally got watch it with friends subscription neestream totally worth hype its high time we change patriarchal norms acoustamisd our society equality real sense as male that too newly married one this movie was totally relatable not torture parts but rather i did feel guilty that women had has go such ordeals hardships exploitation childhood i have been told pick my own things get my own water but how many families do they teach such discipline jeo baby says amazon netflix rejected his movie netflix should have choosen this over kilometers kilometers like government exempts few movies entertainment tax such movies ott platform should also be made free or subsidized as union budget today focused ppp we should also have ppp model brilliant movies that are pivotal society as someone said that rang de basanti was superhit but same applied real life is not much appreciated instance farmers protest why so hypocritical society why saying goes discrimination begins home i would say discrimination starts kitchen atleast kerala had guts make release this movie northern eastern western even few southern belts india i doubt that it would be released so easily some or other sena would have objected called out threatened boycott or even chop off heads even if problem is persisted all parts but atleast few states have courage show up first step towards solving any problem is identification acceptance problem this isnt gutsy or great cinema rather its just reality portrayal simplistic way possible no music no nonsense just female protagonist nimisha sajayan her husband played by suraj venjaramood her choppping mopping cleaning not all abuses are direct evident like verbal or sexual some are intrusion private space freedom causing immense internal violence this film touches chords many people because its so realistic relatable everyone has experienced some kind such tragic moments film also talks about most important topic oops sorry taboo we indians have obsession we have with periods period its natural biological thing why create so much fuss about it i hope someday everything changes good submission is not solution i love way end she drives her car but what i really really love is subtle presence chekutty dolls if you dont know what they are kindly google it also as gujrati i feel proud that gujrati samaj school is shown end also beautiful brilliant dance performance end far better than dance india dance types this movie should be shown newly weds college students even school children movie not just be watched but be thought discussed debated evoluted finally implemented,0.5257554112554111,0.1748290043290043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8,Let's meet the First Classic of 2021. Simply unbreachable. Malayalam Cinema shows magnified images of most common issue of our society.,"The Great Indian Kitchen (2021) : Movie Review -It's been a while that Indian audience hasn't got anything on classic level so it is reasonable to say that The Great Indian Kitchen has striked at right. In addition, it has timed on correct time when this film was needed for the society. Last year, Anubhav Sinha's 'Thappad' tried the similar issue but failed to convince the audience by its soulless storytelling and stretched narration. Correcting all those mistakes, The Great Indian Kitchen has done it perfectly and with the ease like never before, and might be like never after.In the film we see that how after marriage a woman struggles to be the submissive wife that her husband and his family expect her to be. The story follows her journey, as she changes herself and, even more so, changes the household. Let's just declare it here that the screenplay for this storyline is outstanding and one of the best in recent times. It doesn't lose the focus from its content, it sticks right to it and even explores multiple innovative scenes. Right from the first scene it manages to gather every possible moment of any woman's life. The way this concept is crafted in this film is simply Remarkable!Nimisha Sajayan as the wife is truly amazing. There is hardly any moment when she didn't give her 100% and not a single frame goes without being noticed. Suraj Venjaramoodu as husband is equally great and despite being the second lead of the story he got his big impression left on us. The supporting cast is just fabulous. We don't see so much of natural performances together in one film. The cinematography is highly impressive as it gives you almost every possible angle around household. It has constantly changed frames of small small things going on in quick motions but the importance of it still remains high.Well, there are couple of mistakes which could have been skipped. For instance, it wastes a lot of time on useless frames and that too throughout the film again and again. Once the frame has made an impression it is supposed to remain one of it's kind rather than repeating itself many times to lose the quality of first impression. The director could have skipped this part and have it made even more engaging and tight. Rest, Jeo Baby has done a clapworthy job. He deserves a bunch of awards for the amazing direction he did in this film.Overall, The Great Indian Kitchen is a Must Watch for every single living soul in the society. It shows male audience the horrible mistakes they might be or must be doing daily. It shows female audience what they are tolerating just for the sake of social consciousness and it would definitely encourage them to finally break the silence on traditional torture. The filthy kitchen reflects to the filth men have in their minds as well as the filth women overlooks every day. If this mind-changing film can bring change in even 1% families then i all the honest efforts of the entire will be paid off. Just don't miss it by any chance, whatever you wish- the strong content, the artistic values or mainstream filmmaking it has got everything.RATING - 8/10*",lets meet first classic 2021 simply unbreachable malayalam cinema shows magnified images most common issue our society,great indian kitchen 2021 movie review its been while that indian audience hasnt got anything classic level so it is reasonable say that great indian kitchen has striked at right addition it has timed correct time when this film was needed society last year anubhav sinhas thappad tried similar issue but failed convince audience by its soulless storytelling stretched narration correcting all those mistakes great indian kitchen has done it perfectly with ease like never before might be like never after film we see that how after marriage woman struggles be submissive wife that her husband his family expect her be story follows her journey as she changes herself even more so changes household lets just declare it here that screenplay this storyline is outstanding one best recent times it doesnt lose focus its content it sticks right it even explores multiple innovative scenes right first scene it manages gather every possible moment any womans life way this concept is crafted this film is simply remarkable nimisha sajayan as wife is truly amazing there is hardly any moment when she didnt give her 100 not single frame goes without being noticed suraj venjaramoodu as husband is equally great despite being second lead story he got his big impression left us supporting cast is just fabulous we dont see so much natural performances together one film cinematography is highly impressive as it gives you almost every possible angle around household it has constantly changed frames small small things going quick motions but importance it still remains high well there are couple mistakes which could have been skipped instance it wastes lot time useless frames that too throughout film again again once frame has made impression it is supposed remain one its kind rather than repeating itself many times lose quality first impression director could have skipped this part have it made even more engaging tight rest jeo baby has done clapworthy job he deserves bunch awards amazing direction he did this film overall great indian kitchen is must watch every single living soul society it shows male audience horrible mistakes they might be or must be doing daily it shows female audience what they are tolerating just sake social consciousness it would definitely encourage them finally break silence traditional torture filthy kitchen reflects filth men have their minds as well as filth women overlooks every day if this mind changing film can bring change even 1 families then i all honest efforts entire will be paid off just dont miss it by any chance whatever you wish strong content artistic values or mainstream filmmaking it has got everything rating 8 10,0.503046928916494,0.19388198757763977,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8,Powerful storytelling coupled with a brilliant lead performance from Nimisha Sajayan! [+81%],"The Great Indian Kitchen is a film with a certain message; one it drives home so effectively and in a brilliantly satisfying way. In Jeo Baby's film, 'The Great Indian Kitchen' literally translates to The Great Indian Patriarchial Household. This is not just a tribute to homemakers who are often relegated to the salary-free, appraisal-free duty of cooking for the menfolk, cleaning up after them, and keeping the premises tidy every day, but to womanhood in general. It's difficult to believe that the same writer-director gave us the forgettable Kilometers and Kilometers last year. What a comeback, Mr. Baby!Casting Nimisha Sajayan as the woman in question and Suraj Venjaramoodu as her husband (who doesn't realize how much of a dick he is!) was a masterstroke. Right from the opening scene where we see shots of Sajayan at a dance class intercut with visuals of food being prepared in the kitchen, Jeo Baby wants to prove his point without resorting to any gimmicks like over-the-top dialogue, eccentric performances, loud background score, or melodrama. In fact, scenes of cooking and cleaning repeat several times in the first two acts just to make viewers (especially the men) realize how mundanely repetitive this whole cycle is and yet, we fail to appreciate our women's efforts (often having sacrificed dreams and aspirations of their own).Not naming the characters was another smart move. The reality being discussed here spans across every traditional Indian household that's yet to free itself from age-old regulations and mindsets. It doesn't matter if you're well-off, educated, or teach social sciences at a school for a living (like Suraj does!). Patriarchy continues to rule the roost in the kitchen, at the dining table, on the bed, at the porch, and even while eating out. This is impressively showcased before our very eyes through scenes that have little dialogue (or background score) but a whole lotta emoting, sweating, and multi-tasking on the women's part.The film also throws light at patriarchal conditioning of the older generations of women. That they're used to taking all sorts of crap from the men in the house (without questioning) makes it even more difficult for the modern, intelligent woman to fight her battles. Sajayan, who basically lives her character, is out to prove a point. And boy, she does so in style. I clapped and hooted during that powerfully written and performed climax. She needed that WIN. All homemakers (or let's put it this way - ALL WOMEN) do!",powerful storytelling coupled with brilliant lead performance nimisha sajayan,great indian kitchen is film with certain message one it drives home so effectively brilliantly satisfying way jeo babys film great indian kitchen literally translates great indian patriarchial household this is not just tribute homemakers who are often relegated salary free appraisal free duty cooking menfolk cleaning up after them keeping premises tidy every day but womanhood general its difficult believe that same writer director gave us forgettable kilometers kilometers last year what comeback mr baby casting nimisha sajayan as woman question suraj venjaramoodu as her husband who doesnt realize how much dick he is was masterstroke right opening scene where we see shots sajayan at dance class intercut with visuals food being prepared kitchen jeo baby wants prove his point without resorting any gimmicks like over top dialogue eccentric performances loud background score or melodrama fact scenes cooking cleaning repeat several times first two acts just make viewers especially men realize how mundanely repetitive this whole cycle is yet we fail appreciate our womens efforts often having sacrificed dreams aspirations their own not naming characters was another smart move reality being discussed here spans across every traditional indian household thats yet free itself age old regulations mindsets it doesnt matter if youre well off educated or teach social sciences at school living like suraj does patriarchy continues rule roost kitchen at dining table bed at porch even while eating out this is impressively showcased before our very eyes through scenes that have little dialogue or background score but whole lotta emoting sweating multi tasking womens part film also throws light at patriarchal conditioning older generations women that theyre used taking all sorts crap men house without questioning makes it even more difficult modern intelligent woman fight her battles sajayan who basically lives her character is out prove point boy she does so style i clapped hooted during that powerfully written performed climax she needed that win all homemakers or lets put it this way all women do,0.577127659574468,0.2101443768996961,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"
