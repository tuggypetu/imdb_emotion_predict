9,A movie worth seeing...,"A movie of the millennium, I would say that had come from Tamil Film Industry. The environment suited well for this movie. Kamal Hassan was exceptional in acting as usual. Nevertheless, Madhavan did well too. There is no hero in this movie. Only characters. The movie has a strong message to audience. A very good message. It teaches a valuable lesson. It explains what really God is and the true meaning life.The script and screenplay are awesome. There are some humor scenes. That fight could have been avoided. The theme song was really awesome. The song touched me very much. The music was awesome too. Other songs are good too, but not needed.Kama Hassan has given an excellent movie. Hats off to Kamal Hassan...Watch this movie. Learn the true meaning of life. You won't regret it. It's worth it.I give this movie a 9 out of 10.

9,Not a masterpiece cause its a remake?,"Many rule out this movie as a non-masterpiece just because its a remake....I stick to what Ram Gopal Verma said, 'nothing is original'. In Hollywood, people make movies inspired sometimes by small or Eastern/European movies, then much of the time it is an adaptation of a novel. The director gets a huge team of writers to fine-tune the script. The result, a masterpiece. Here, Kamal single-handedly carried and executed this film. He was inspired by a Hollywood movie which was a slapstick comedy. Did the original say ""God is Love"" and tackled communist views? This should never be called a remake. Kamal's detail in acting proves he can beat any given actor in this world, I dare to bet. Even in scenes which does not highlight him, he reacts perfectly. Even the minute details was taken care of in his movements and face reactions, the muscles, and the handicap. The best part of this movie is actually the depth of characterization in Kamal and Madhavan, they lived as Nalla and A. Ars throughout the screening in my mind. I have never seen the depth of characterization as much as this movie in the recent past. Deserves to be in the top 250. Is this Internet Movie Database or American Movie Database? I hardly saw a move with a richer context than this. Indian movies do provide masterpieces once at a time, and please do recognize these efforts.",not masterpiece cause its remake,many rule out this movie as non masterpiece just because its remake i stick what ram gopal verma said nothing is original hollywood people make movies inspired sometimes by small or eastern european movies then much time it is adaptation novel director gets huge team writers fine tune script result masterpiece here kamal single handedly carried executed this film he was inspired by hollywood movie which was slapstick comedy did original say god is love tackled communist views this should never be called remake kamals detail acting proves he can beat any given actor this world i dare bet even scenes which does not highlight him he reacts perfectly even minute details was taken care his movements face reactions muscles handicap best part this movie is actually depth characterization kamal madhavan they lived as nalla ars throughout screening my mind i have never seen depth characterization as much as this movie recent past deserves be top 250 is this internet movie database or american movie database i hardly saw move with richer context than this indian movies do provide masterpieces once at time please do recognize these efforts,0.3788548752834467,0.2335034013605442,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,An experience of a lifetime,"Why is Anbe Sivam regarded as the best movie in the history of Tamil cinema by many? Did this movie have any story at all? First of all is it a movie? No. Anbe Sivam is an experience, not only for one Madhavan but for another few thousands, who care to learn quite a lot of things and feel conceited about themselves, but fail miserably to confront the vagaries of life. What was the movie all about? An experienced matured man and a squeamish, egotist but tender hearted youth (a typical modern day youth) travelling together from Bhubaneshwar to Chennai(East coast of India).Fate hinders their journey in all possible ways which Madhavan initially considers exasperating but later reveres as an experience of a lifetime. The story is as simple as that but the associated scenes,dialogues and the lessons learnt reverberate through your mind for a long time.Be it the floods,train accident or the little boy's death it is Madhavan who breaks down and get shattered. But Kamalhassan adapts himself and reconciles himself to reality and helps in the best possible way he can. While it takes a lot of effort for Madhavan to tell Kamalhaasan about his fraternal love towards him, Kamalhaasan finds it easy to tell 'A.Ars, you are a go(o)d man' (it's not that easy to tell it to someone earnestly). From where did Kamal get this maturity? The story moves into the flashback of Kamal,a communist, who loves the daughter of a capitalist, Nasser, whom he opposes as a worker regarding wages. When the duo decide to elope to Kerala for marriage, their bus meets with a gory accident. Kamal is badly bruised losing a limb and is totally disfigured. While struggling in bed for life, Nasser speaks extremely rude and blatant to Kamal. On conjuring up the scenes after the accident, he evaluates stark contrast of Nasser and the sister. Kamal sees god through the sister and sees it subsequently in quite a lot of people who propagate love.His outlook changes completely. The first half with some lighter moments, the middle with some interesting dialogues and the last with some really shaking scenes Anbe Sivam stands tall amidst other usual Tamil movies. Madhavan is extraordinary communicating the emotions powerfully(especially in the climax dialogue with Kamalhaasan). The one fight scene in the middle could have been avoided. Rather than going abroad for shooting songs, this movie has brought out some really excellent locations in India( not only in machi machi song). The choice of season to shoot this movie has been brilliant with the monsoon accentuating the kind of feelings to be conveyed. Does the name 'Anbe Sivam' mean 'Anbarase Nallasivam' trying to say 'All are one soul'? Kamal only knows. Finally, I'm sure it would not take any effort for anyone who has seen this movie to say 'I love you Dr.Kamalhaasan' for such an excellent story and screenplay.",experience lifetime,why is anbe sivam regarded as best movie history tamil cinema by many did this movie have any story at all first all is it movie no anbe sivam is experience not only one madhavan but another few thousands who care learn quite lot things feel conceited about themselves but fail miserably confront vagaries life what was movie all about experienced matured man squeamish egotist but tender hearted youth typical modern day youth travelling together bhubaneshwar chennai east coast india fate hinders their journey all possible ways which madhavan initially considers exasperating but later reveres as experience lifetime story is as simple as that but associated scenes dialogues lessons learnt reverberate through your mind long time be it floods train accident or little boys death it is madhavan who breaks down get shattered but kamalhassan adapts himself reconciles himself reality helps best possible way he can while it takes lot effort madhavan tell kamalhaasan about his fraternal love towards him kamalhaasan finds it easy tell ars you are go o d man its not that easy tell it someone earnestly where did kamal get this maturity story moves into flashback kamal communist who loves daughter capitalist nasser whom he opposes as worker regarding wages when duo decide elope kerala marriage their bus meets with gory accident kamal is badly bruised losing limb is totally disfigured while struggling bed life nasser speaks extremely rude blatant kamal conjuring up scenes after accident he evaluates stark contrast nasser sister kamal sees god through sister sees it subsequently quite lot people who propagate love his outlook changes completely first half with some lighter moments middle with some interesting dialogues last with some really shaking scenes anbe sivam stands tall amidst other usual tamil movies madhavan is extraordinary communicating emotions powerfully especially climax dialogue with kamalhaasan one fight scene middle could have been avoided rather than going abroad shooting songs this movie has brought out some really excellent locations india not only machi machi song choice season shoot this movie has been brilliant with monsoon accentuating kind feelings be conveyed does name anbe sivam mean anbarase nallasivam trying say all are one soul kamal only knows finally im sure it would not take any effort anyone who has seen this movie say i love you dr kamalhaasan such excellent story screenplay,0.5604069405539994,0.11933551198257082,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9,"Awesome movie, amazing soundtrack","I watched the movie because of the stars - Kamal Hasan and Madhavan. I do not understand Tamil, yet the movie has been so well made that at times you do not feel that you need the dialogs.In brief, the movie shows two extremely different characters who are forced to spend time together due to circumstances.The movie tends to slow down in the middle, when it goes into the flashback of Kamal Hasan's life. However, for the most part, it is a pretty sensible piece of art - something that is a rarity in Bollywood. The movie could have been shorter - and that is the only complaint that I have. Otherwise, it is a brilliant idea that has been executed to near perfection.Kamal Hasan - as always - excels. Madhavan is great, too. The music score was really good.A must see!",awesome movie amazing soundtrack,i watched movie because stars kamal hasan madhavan i do not understand tamil yet movie has been so well made that at times you do not feel that you need dialogs brief movie shows two extremely different characters who are forced spend time together due circumstances movie tends slow down middle when it goes into flashback kamal hasans life however most part it is pretty sensible piece art something that is rarity bollywood movie could have been shorter that is only complaint that i have otherwise it is brilliant idea that has been executed near perfection kamal hasan as always excels madhavan is great too music score was really good must see,0.5616013071895425,0.21584967320261442,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10,Eternal theme of Humanity on art at it's best,"This is one of the movies i missed during it's release like many,due to the feeling that this movie won't be interesting and entertainment factor will be less(lot of downside info like reportedly 60 Million loss for producers at 2003 and also director didn't take salary and in fact the latter director capped Sundar.C hinted that Kamal made this movie as an influence and to satisfy his intellectual associate. Indeed was in development hell briefly with Priyadarshan been replaced and also the heroine i guess). Finally i saw this movie and was shocked to know that an Indian feature film has good quality without any artificial entertainment.To my knowledge the theme of humanity i first saw was on the 1940 feature film ""The great dictator"",Schlinder's List and many great movies.But this movie was striking direct on it's theme with it's relevant plot. Actor Kamalhaasan is one of the few unique distinguished film personality in India who has been making career in Indian movies right from 1961 till date.With his well developed artistic talent he has been working hard on quality right from 1987 movie Nayagan(Listed on TIME magazine as one of the great movie of the century).I would say this movie is just not another feather on his cap,but something more then that. With his singing of theme song on this movie is deep and emotional high. The hidden theme from the Nallasivam character is that he recovers from death to life because of love, besides opposing the selfish,fraud, phony people in the world.Its always easy to be an god fearing person in our society for security and selfish reason.But to be an atheist,not easy.We need to fight,oppose this selfish ,dishonest society every day. There are lot of signs this movie is classic and timeless as the story is more into emotional side of humans plus life. The movie seemed to be on about love, but it ended up saying about not loved-Loneliness, which is a classic progression.The story plot is simple,it's purely into character of Kamal and Madhavan.Madhavan and Kamal have done great job on their role.Madhavan is advertisement film maker and Kamal is communist theater actor,with artistic talent and simple human whose life is entirely an example of humanity. Example for his humanity is that he raises the dog which was the reason behind his disastrous accident and shattered his life.Beauty of forgiveness is well explained there.Especially the acting of dog(that too in climax) is up to the point which indeed shows the perfection of work and when lead actor says the dialogue ""pozhachu ponga"" it looks like he told the same for his haters who did politics against him and anti-Kamalians. And not to miss mentioning is actor Nasser performance, especially when he says ""sethu PO"" will be all time best hardcore villain dialogue(Can watch this piece when you are let down by life and life's people to get empowered to live well and confidently against the oppositions of life). I guess all the movie after Rare brothers(1989) by Mr. Kamal is been directed by himself(may be except director Shankar/Maniratnam i guess) and his directors are always Assistant/Associate director. This mention is not to take away credit of the director and let them down but it shows Mr. Kamal's command on creativity. In fact my interest in movie was in because of this movie and for many i guess, as Tamil film director Bala even stated his Naan Kaduval(2009) and the title indeed inspired from this movie. Especially this movie is medicine for people who are wounded by inhumanity and loneliness.The only boring part of this movie is insertion of communism(propaganda tone is indeed inevitable), which might be the influence of Movie genius Chaplin and Tamil writer Jayakanthan. Journalist/Writer/Cartoonist Madhan has done a great job in dialogues, as he is one of the original, knowledgeable creative person in Tamil Nadu. I wish he collaborates again with Kamal.On the downside the film is more of a character drama, missing wholesome entertainment/theme which strikes our heart easy and cool.. The tone of self pity and sentiment is over the top, but still everybody has to go through these in life, so no complaints. The Tsunami word used in the movie was picked up by Kamal after getting an invitation from Gollapudi Maruthi Rao(Telugu film producer/Director who acted in cameo on 2000 film Hey Ram) to institute an award in his sons name who lost his life in Tsunami while shooting for Telugu film Prema Pusthakam (1993 Telegu movie- actor Ajith's first movie). This usage turned out to be a sensation as Dec26-2004 seen real Tsunami in Tamilnadu (Film released on Jan-2003). Overall i would rate this film to be excellent due to its quality. Eternal theme of Humanity on art at it's best",eternal theme humanity art at its best,this is one movies i missed during its release like many due feeling that this movie wont be interesting entertainment factor will be less lot downside info like reportedly 60 million loss producers at 2003 also director didnt take salary fact latter director capped sundar c hinted that kamal made this movie as influence satisfy his intellectual associate indeed was development hell briefly with priyadarshan been replaced also heroine i guess finally i saw this movie was shocked know that indian feature film has good quality without any artificial entertainment my knowledge theme humanity i first saw was 1940 feature film great dictator schlinders list many great movies but this movie was striking direct its theme with its relevant plot actor kamalhaasan is one few unique distinguished film personality india who has been making career indian movies right 1961 till date with his well developed artistic talent he has been working hard quality right 1987 movie nayagan listed time magazine as one great movie century i would say this movie is just not another feather his cap but something more then that with his singing theme song this movie is deep emotional high hidden theme nallasivam character is that he recovers death life because love besides opposing selfish fraud phony people world its always easy be god fearing person our society security selfish reason but be atheist not easy we need fight oppose this selfish dishonest society every day there are lot signs this movie is classic timeless as story is more into emotional side humans plus life movie seemed be about love but it ended up saying about not loved loneliness which is classic progression story plot is simple its purely into character kamal madhavan madhavan kamal have done great job their role madhavan is advertisement film maker kamal is communist theater actor with artistic talent simple human whose life is entirely example humanity example his humanity is that he raises dog which was reason behind his disastrous accident shattered his life beauty forgiveness is well explained there especially acting dog that too climax is up point which indeed shows perfection work when lead actor says dialogue pozhachu ponga it looks like he told same his haters who did politics against him anti kamalians not miss mentioning is actor nasser performance especially when he says sethu po will be all time best hardcore villain dialogue can watch this piece when you are let down by life lifes people get empowered live well confidently against oppositions life i guess all movie after rare brothers 1989 by mr kamal is been directed by himself may be except director shankar maniratnam i guess his directors are always assistant associate director this mention is not take away credit director let them down but it shows mr kamals command creativity fact my interest movie was because this movie many i guess as tamil film director bala even stated his naan kaduval 2009 title indeed inspired this movie especially this movie is medicine people who are wounded by inhumanity loneliness only boring part this movie is insertion communism propaganda tone is indeed inevitable which might be influence movie genius chaplin tamil writer jayakanthan journalist writer cartoonist madhan has done great job dialogues as he is one original knowledgeable creative person tamil nadu i wish he collaborates again with kamal downside film is more character drama missing wholesome entertainment theme which strikes our heart easy cool tone self pity sentiment is over top but still everybody has go through these life so no complaints tsunami word used movie was picked up by kamal after getting invitation gollapudi maruthi rao telugu film producer director who acted cameo 2000 film hey ram institute award his sons name who lost his life tsunami while shooting telugu film prema pusthakam 1993 telegu movie actor ajiths first movie this usage turned out be sensation as dec26 2004 seen real tsunami tamilnadu film released jan 2003 overall i would rate this film be excellent due its quality eternal theme humanity art at its best,0.5703788737717309,0.1618567477496049,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9,A decent Hollywood Movie turned into An Emotional Masterpiece and the Greatest Human Drama for South Industry,"Anbe Sivam (2003) : Brief Review -A decent Hollywood Movie turned into An Emotional Masterpiece and the Greatest Human Drama for South Industry. It's been a long time i had tears rolling down from my eyes while moving towards the entracte part of any Indian Film. Anbe Sivam made it happen with the most simple formula ever possible in human genre and also made it socially intellectual with the reference of God inside every Human being. The film is adapted from Hollywood Comedy 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' (1987) but it has changed the entire theme and meaning of the story by putting emotional content. This is very different from the original film because it just took the basic idea of 2 strangers meeting each other and trapped for couple of days together and rest of the storyline is completely different hence no credit to the original film. Anbe Sivam deals with many things at one time like Communism, Atheism, Goodwill and Humanist values. Kamal Haasan delivers another outstanding performance while R Madhavan holds very well against him. I couldn't resist tears and claps in the climax when i saw that Kamal Haasan doing his Best and even his expressions on his face and those intentional ugly looks doing better than the situations. Some theories told by this film will remain with me for lifetime such as, A real Good Man don't need to look good and the Bad Man can be a good looking guy, God is Love etc. Sundar C's direction is as beautiful as his name. However, there were few low grade scenes which could have trimmed or shot better but since the story is great it all goes behind the curtain. Anbe Sivam is Overall a Masterpiece Storytelling causing a life-changing experience for viewers if you are the man with a good heart and emotions. I always prefer emotions over critic mindset so even if the film had some flaws, i wouldn't mind overlooking them for the sake of Heart-wrenching Climax and those tears i thrown out.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",decent hollywood movie turned into emotional masterpiece greatest human drama south industry,anbe sivam 2003 brief review decent hollywood movie turned into emotional masterpiece greatest human drama south industry its been long time i had tears rolling down my eyes while moving towards entracte part any indian film anbe sivam made it happen with most simple formula ever possible human genre also made it socially intellectual with reference god inside every human being film is adapted hollywood comedy planes trains automobiles 1987 but it has changed entire theme meaning story by putting emotional content this is very different original film because it just took basic idea 2 strangers meeting each other trapped couple days together rest storyline is completely different hence no credit original film anbe sivam deals with many things at one time like communism atheism goodwill humanist values kamal haasan delivers another outstanding performance while r madhavan holds very well against him i couldnt resist tears claps climax when i saw that kamal haasan doing his best even his expressions his face those intentional ugly looks doing better than situations some theories told by this film will remain with me lifetime such as real good man dont need look good bad man can be good looking guy god is love etc sundar cs direction is as beautiful as his name however there were few low grade scenes which could have trimmed or shot better but since story is great it all goes behind curtain anbe sivam is overall masterpiece storytelling causing life changing experience viewers if you are man with good heart emotions i always prefer emotions over critic mindset so even if film had some flaws i wouldnt mind overlooking them sake heart wrenching climax those tears i thrown out rating 9 10 by,0.5273775017253279,0.21310386473429954,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10,A must see!!!,"What a movie this is!?!!Can Tamil movie industry produce such a master-piece?I had this doubt for a long time..Not now!! This movie is above all. Among the usual formula films, this is a rare Gem! The story is not so new, but the screenplay and acting surpasses everything.Anbarasu(Madhavan) is a posh guy who like to be called A.Ars. While looking for a shooting location just 4 days before the marriage in Orissa, he is left stranded there because of the rains and floods. Sivam(Kamalhassan) is a handicap with bruises all over his face and he walks with a limp. He is on his way to Chennai after getting the check for the flood affected people back in Chennai. Circumstances make them both travel together. Anbarasu is extremely irritated with Sivam and he constantly scolds him for advising him far too much. Amidst that, Sivam's flashback unfolds. It is a usual story of Hero-loves-rich-girl-father-doesn't-accept-so-they-run-off.While they do that, Sivam is involved in an accident and thats the reason he has got all the bruises. When he returns back to see Bala(Kiran -his lover), his father Nasser tells him that she is married and settled in America. So Sivam comes off telling that he wont disturb her anymore.Anbarasu slowly begins to like Sivam who helped him come to Chennai safe and sound before the marriage. When he comes to know of his family, Anbarasu is touched. He asks Sivam to be his brother and to stay with him forever. The story goes as though it is going to have a happy ending, but there is a twist. The girl whom Anbarasu is going to marry is none other than Bala. When Sivam sees that, he is shocked. Nasser calls Sivam and talks with him. Sivam promises that he wont tell Bala about what happened only if Nasser signs the papers to increase the monthly wages of the workers in his factory from 910. He does that and the story does not end there. Nasser asks his right hand (Santhana Barathi) to kill Sivam who does not do that because of humanitarian reasons.The story ends there.The theme ""Love is God"" is perfectly brought out through this movie. Kamals acting as the handicap Nallasivam makes us cry at many places. Particularly when he sees his face in the mirror after the accident, tears welling up in his eyes, it makes everyone cry! What an actor he is?Madhavan is a surprise package! He has acted really well in this movie. His angry remarks to Sivam and the way he gets irritated by Sivam's stupid comments make it all the more enjoyable. A special mention about the dialog's penned by cartoonist Madhan (who eventually makes a guest appearance in the movie). The dialog's are both imaginative and powerful, which makes us laugh and at the same time think! Sundar.C, a man known for his comedy movies has made an impression here with his Awesome screenplay! Music rendered by Vidhyasagar is worth a mention, particularly the title song ""Anbe Sivam"" and the duet ""Poo Vaasam"".For the People who love Good cinema, this is a MUST SEE!!:)",must see,what movie this is can tamil movie industry produce such master piece i had this doubt long time not now this movie is above all among usual formula films this is rare gem story is not so new but screenplay acting surpasses everything anbarasu madhavan is posh guy who like be called ars while looking shooting location just 4 days before marriage orissa he is left stranded there because rains floods sivam kamalhassan is handicap with bruises all over his face he walks with limp he is his way chennai after getting check flood affected people back chennai circumstances make them both travel together anbarasu is extremely irritated with sivam he constantly scolds him advising him far too much amidst that sivams flashback unfolds it is usual story hero loves rich girl father doesnt accept so they run off while they do that sivam is involved accident thats reason he has got all bruises when he returns back see bala kiran his lover his father nasser tells him that she is married settled america so sivam comes off telling that he wont disturb her anymore anbarasu slowly begins like sivam who helped him come chennai safe sound before marriage when he comes know his family anbarasu is touched he asks sivam be his brother stay with him forever story goes as though it is going have happy ending but there is twist girl whom anbarasu is going marry is none other than bala when sivam sees that he is shocked nasser calls sivam talks with him sivam promises that he wont tell bala about what happened only if nasser signs papers increase monthly wages workers his factory 910 he does that story does not end there nasser asks his right hand santhana barathi kill sivam who does not do that because humanitarian reasons story ends there theme love is god is perfectly brought out through this movie kamals acting as handicap nallasivam makes us cry at many places particularly when he sees his face mirror after accident tears welling up his eyes it makes everyone cry what actor he is madhavan is surprise package he has acted really well this movie his angry remarks sivam way he gets irritated by sivams stupid comments make it all more enjoyable special mention about dialogs penned by cartoonist madhan who eventually makes guest appearance movie dialogs are both imaginative powerful which makes us laugh at same time think sundar c man known his comedy movies has made impression here with his awesome screenplay music rendered by vidhyasagar is worth mention particularly title song anbe sivam duet poo vaasam people who love good cinema this is must see,0.4948193111236591,0.16603378505552419,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.26}"

10,"kamal, the real guru","good comments from all the members Following is one nuance from me .. one main lesson that is learnt by madhavan(in the movie) but not shown explicitly is when at first scene kamal tells madhavan that nowadays good looking, learned people commit crimes more than the not-so-good looking ones... When Yugi sethu steals madhavan's belongings madhavan must have learnt this lesson... in fact apart from the hidden nuances of the film which u have pointed out... the film had lot of out spoken details of the society and what kamal as a individual feels about it... Be it the talk about Working for foreigners when they board the train and little details like when he keeps talking about his fathers death in a Tsunami, he dozes half way through it, meaning he has moved on with the fact of life.. and the way he asks madhavan if he goes around daily with thieves when madhavan says he has not seen thief in real!!!! or when he forgives the man in last scene, when he warns about using wet cell phones...But i do not understand 2 things... why wasn't the rebel song and his Umbrella fight commercially famous when nowadays simple fight sequences with no relevance of place or facts get so much news... and i must say that the press and media have not given the credit to the film that it deserved.... in this world of cheap stories and acting... a Kamal film like this still does not get, if not better, equal hype to Rajini's movies... If one is hyped for its commercial value this film should have been promoted for its story value... Even Kamal requires his films to do good at box office and does not want his films to be called out-of-the-world and great!!!!Other wise he too will jump into the gutter that is around him... and of course one well known trivia for all of us is that we all know how much Sundar.C must have contributed ;-) One more thing... It must be a heart break for some but this film has its ""one line"" plot from a Hollywood movie called ""Trains planes and automobiles"" but except the fact that 2 different people are made to travel together due to circumstances and one of them is narrating a story... The idea of atheist, practical, matured man who starts liking the emotional, finicky guy, nasser and kiran's character and also the train scene etc are kamal's own making and the underlying concept of the society is itself very fresh ... SO i hope everyone feels the same way... cos its not a first-scene-to-last remakethanks all hope u all enjoyed my comments",kamal real guru,good comments all members following is one nuance me one main lesson that is learnt by madhavan movie but not shown explicitly is when at first scene kamal tells madhavan that nowadays good looking learned people commit crimes more than not so good looking ones when yugi sethu steals madhavans belongings madhavan must have learnt this lesson fact apart hidden nuances film which u have pointed out film had lot out spoken details society what kamal as individual feels about it be it talk about working foreigners when they board train little details like when he keeps talking about his fathers death tsunami he dozes half way through it meaning he has moved with fact life way he asks madhavan if he goes around daily with thieves when madhavan says he has not seen thief real or when he forgives man last scene when he warns about using wet cell phones but i do not understand 2 things why wasnt rebel song his umbrella fight commercially famous when nowadays simple fight sequences with no relevance place or facts get so much news i must say that press media have not given credit film that it deserved this world cheap stories acting kamal film like this still does not get if not better equal hype rajinis movies if one is hyped its commercial value this film should have been promoted its story value even kamal requires his films do good at box office does not want his films be called out world great other wise he too will jump into gutter that is around him course one well known trivia all us is that we all know how much sundar c must have contributed one more thing it must be heart break some but this film has its one line plot hollywood movie called trains planes automobiles but except fact that 2 different people are made travel together due circumstances one them is narrating story idea atheist practical matured man who starts liking emotional finicky guy nasser kirans character also train scene etc are kamals own making underlying concept society is itself very fresh so i hope everyone feels same way cos its not first scene last remakethanks all hope u all enjoyed my comments,0.41962759462759464,0.19643162393162394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"

8,Love is God,"I happened to see this film which was a perfect blend of philosophy, realistic acting and the fine art of film making. Now, I am not a big fan of Kamal. Never was. The arrogance so clearly etched on his face is a major put off for me. But ever so often, Kamal makes me admit ( albeit grudgingly ) that he is the best at what he does.The philosophy of the film is best explained by the words of the title song, ... A rough translation goes something like this,For the theists, God is love. For the good among the atheists, Love is God.Who here is God ? You and me.The story is written by Kamal as is the screenplay. He has sung a couple of songs as well out of which the haunting title song stands out. Madhavan is but a tool in Kamal's hands which he uses effectively to his advantage.Kamal's character changes from that of a bumbling idiot in the first few scenes to a communist union leader with a artistic vein in the middle scenes to a god like figure in the last few scenes. In the last scene, as Kamal walks away into the horizon, we are left with no option but to stand up and salute the indomitable spirit of a man from whom life has taken away so much but still manages to smile.I wouldn't describe anything more about the story because any words that I can conjure up here wouldn't be enough. The film tells a philosophy that is best seen and understood.When Love lives in your mind, you are God.",love is god,i happened see this film which was perfect blend philosophy realistic acting fine art film making now i am not big fan kamal never was arrogance so clearly etched his face is major put off me but ever so often kamal makes me admit albeit grudgingly that he is best at what he does philosophy film is best explained by words title song rough translation goes something like this theists god is love good among atheists love is god who here is god you me story is written by kamal as is screenplay he has sung couple songs as well out which haunting title song stands out madhavan is but tool kamals hands which he uses effectively his advantage kamals character changes that bumbling idiot first few scenes communist union leader with artistic vein middle scenes god like figure last few scenes last scene as kamal walks away into horizon we are left with no option but stand up salute indomitable spirit man whom life has taken away so much but still manages smile i wouldnt describe anything more about story because any words that i can conjure up here wouldnt be enough film tells philosophy that is best seen understood when love lives your mind you are god,0.4244791666666667,0.24153645833333331,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10,The best Movie,"I consider ""Anbe Sivam"" as the best movie of all time. Fabulous story, exceptional screenplay and apt comedy make this movie a treat to watch. It's doubtful if anyone else will be able to make a movie again in the same caliber. Unfortunate that it was not sent for the Oscar's. It's music is riveting and apt for the situation. The characters are brilliant. The way the change of heart occurs for Anbu is perfectly done through the screenplay.Kamal at his best throughout the movie and well supported by Madhavan, Naser and others. It is one of the few movies to have a title that was apt for it's screenplay. It speaks about communism, love, friendship and what not. 10 out of 10",best movie,i consider anbe sivam as best movie all time fabulous story exceptional screenplay apt comedy make this movie treat watch its doubtful if anyone else will be able make movie again same caliber unfortunate that it was not sent oscars its music is riveting apt situation characters are brilliant way change heart occurs anbu is perfectly done through screenplay kamal at his best throughout movie well supported by madhavan naser others it is one few movies have title that was apt its screenplay it speaks about communism love friendship what not 10 out 10,0.7205882352941176,0.45686274509803915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"

In my opinion it is the best Tamil film in recent times. And one of the best non Mani Ratnam film ever. The socialism is subtle yet clear and the director has handled the movie very well. It will go down as a classic in Tamil movie history. As always with good art films, the movie didn't do very well at the box office but made an impact all the same.

9,Love Is God,"Before I begin with the film, I want to express a doubt on this site's functionality. Have the critics gone mad? You guys give this masterpiece just a 7.8? This film beats Hollywood films in many ways, trust me. Firstly, the atheism theme in this film is not intended to encourage people to join atheism, but not to misunderstand atheists as they're human beings as well. Kamal Haasan has been highly underrated in most of his films although he teaches us things that we don't learn in the daily screwed up education syllabus. This film teaches us patience, love, honesty, and sincerity. The work of art in this film is undoubtedly wonderful as they're presented in subliminal ways. This film is not a remake of Planes, Trains And Automobiles, but just inspired character wise. This film deserves several Oscars and many other awards as well. Besides that, I really look low upon IMDb in this as films such as The Avengers and Skyfall are overrated despite their illogical film making.

8,Love is God. Truth is God. This film stands for love and truth.,"Love is God. Truth is God. This film stands for love and truth.Titled as Anbe Sivam (Love is God in Tamil) and as Satyame Sivam (Truth is God in Telugu). This movie is about 2 characters Anbarasu (Satyanand in Telugu) and Nalla Sivam (Sada Sivam in Telugu).There is lot to speak about this film but I will put it all succinctly and I would like everyone to watch this film. Go through one of the most profound philosophical journeys of Indian films and it may make you feel happier, my very sincere request for every film viewer.The journey begins amidst floods in Bhubneshwar and ends in Chennai. But how did they make and what have they learnt of each other. How did Nalla get scars on his face and what is love for each of these two protagonists. It questions a lot of beliefs and in fact very authentically answers most of them. Most questions are by Anbe while most answers are by Sivam. There is a lot of metaphor hidden behing every thing in this film. Like the painting, Sivam does in an office. There is lot of hidden meaning which can be interpreted in multiple ways. But this is it, Truth is God and there is no so called God if there are no good humans. There is a god in every good human. Now, what is good, this abstraction is enhanced into objectivity by bringing in situations so important to each.Now, acting is top notch by both and so is music (though it brings in a kind of Enigma feeling). Lyrics, I must say are superb for Tamil and even Telugu versions.I being an atheist, I believe more in human values than in traditions and the abhorrent customs set by our predecessors. I neither value them nor follow them but yes surely, I have highest respect for humans and their peace and happiness.Technically, editing should have been better and cinematography had a lot of scope but camera was used very miserly to enhance beauty of scenes. Nevertheless, since I first saw it. I keep visiting this movie very often (say 2 times a year) and will continue to do so.It's 4/5 for a movie rich in characters and philosophy and even subtle humour. Kudos, to Kamal Haasan, the genius who gave such a wonderful script along with Madan.",love is god truth is god this film stands love truth,love is god truth is god this film stands love truth titled as anbe sivam love is god tamil as satyame sivam truth is god telugu this movie is about 2 characters anbarasu satyanand telugu nalla sivam sada sivam telugu there is lot speak about this film but i will put it all succinctly i would like everyone watch this film go through one most profound philosophical journeys indian films it may make you feel happier my very sincere request every film viewer journey begins amidst floods bhubneshwar ends chennai but how did they make what have they learnt each other how did nalla get scars his face what is love each these two protagonists it questions lot beliefs fact very authentically answers most them most questions are by anbe while most answers are by sivam there is lot metaphor hidden behing every thing this film like painting sivam does office there is lot hidden meaning which can be interpreted multiple ways but this is it truth is god there is no so called god if there are no good humans there is god every good human now what is good this abstraction is enhanced into objectivity by bringing situations so important each now acting is top notch by both so is music though it brings kind enigma feeling lyrics i must say are superb tamil even telugu versions i being atheist i believe more human values than traditions abhorrent customs set by our predecessors i neither value them nor follow them but yes surely i have highest respect humans their peace happiness technically editing should have been better cinematography had lot scope but camera was used very miserly enhance beauty scenes nevertheless since i first saw it i keep visiting this movie very often say 2 times year will continue do so its 4 5 movie rich characters philosophy even subtle humour kudos kamal haasan genius who gave such wonderful script along with madan,0.5039972899728997,0.2979674796747967,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10,A true masterpiece !!,"There are times when after the ending of a movie one has no feelings. You don't feel happy nor sad, you do not want to get up from the place, you have this empty kind of a feeling. Anbe Sivam gives you the same kind of feeling. Due to torrential rains both Nalla Sivam and Anbarasu are stuck in orissa with all trains and flights cancelled. The whole movie is their journey from Orissa to Chennai. Anbarasu dislikes and is suspicious of Nallasivam because of nallasivam's looks. But they keep bumping into each other. On the way,Nallasivam teaches some vital lessons of life to anbarasu. The movie is a commentary on the materialistic life we are leading and how real happiness is not achieved from the comforts which you have but is achieved from the respect which one earns from others. Kamal Hassan is brilliant(as always)in getting into the skin of the character. Madhavan, Nasser,Kiran Rathod and all the other countless characters (including the street dog) have all done their jobs perfectly. This movie has a universal appeal which will be appreciated by all.

7,Landmark movie from an outstanding actor,"This is the second film that I have seen in recent times (the other being Ikiru) that has the power to change the course of the life of its viewer, for the better. Haasan is breathtakingly brilliant in Anbe Sivam (Love is God), even more so in my opinion than his turn in the Godfather-inspired Nayakan. He traverses the entire gamut of emotions and is especially brilliant in the comic scenes. He is master thinker, too, which is evident from the screenplay that he has written. While the script prima facie seems to be a rip off of the classic ""Planes, trains and automobiles"" (""Due Date"" was another recent spin on the same story), the depth that Haasan offers because of the inherent conflict that he introduces in the exchanges between Sivam, who is a communist, a ""comrade"" and Anbarasu, the quintessential child of free market, gives the happenings a rare gravitas, inspite of the comic incidences. And although the love story that plays in flashback runs in a predictable fashion and takes away some of the sheen, it ends in a spectacularly jaw dropping climax that stunned me. Hindi movie audience has been truly unfortunate as we have seen so little of Kamal Haasan. There has been the odd Appu Raja, wherein he blew away with his double act. Then there was the abhorrent ""Abhay"", which could have put an insomniac to sleep.
