10.0,It was 1978 and everyone in the audience was about to wet their pants,"No, this is not the best film about the Vietnam War; it's hardly about Vietnam at all. The vets who don't like it have it wrong, as do the Vietnamese who found it racist. It could be any war, with any combatants. But because the (primary) victims here are recognizable American archetypes, Americans will feel this in their gut more than any other war film I know of. This is one of the very few post-war Hollywood films that shows a sincere reverence for the lives of small town Americans.After seeing it in a very high quality theater on its initial release, I walked out thinking it was easily one of the best movies I had ever seen - and that I never wanted to see it again. But I looked at it today on cable and found that not much had changed about it, or me. I don't want to see it again...but I want you to see it.Even now, the Russian Roulette scene (in context, people: watch all that comes before it first) is the single most intense sequence I've seen; it makes the end of ""Reservoir Dogs"" seem like a cartoon. Best Walken performance, period. Meryl Streep glows, DeNiro has seldom been more affecting. A unique classic...it is not surprising that Cimino didn't have another movie in him after something this wrenching.",it was 1978 everyone audience was about wet their pants,no this is not best film about vietnam war its hardly about vietnam at all vets who dont like it have it wrong as do vietnamese who found it racist it could be any war with any combatants but because primary victims here are recognizable american archetypes americans will feel this their gut more than any other war film i know this is one very few post war hollywood films that shows sincere reverence lives small town americans after seeing it very high quality theater its initial release i walked out thinking it was easily one best movies i had ever seen that i never wanted see it again but i looked at it today cable found that not much had changed about it or me i dont want see it again but i want you see it even now russian roulette scene context people watch all that comes before it first is single most intense sequence ive seen it makes end reservoir dogs seem like cartoon best walken performance period meryl streep glows deniro has seldom been more affecting unique classic it is not surprising that cimino didnt have another movie him after something this wrenching,0.42023280423280424,0.13832980599647268,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,"It's been given a fairly bad reputation over the years - undeservedly so, too. One of the greatest films ever made.","""One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot.""There's that particularly infamous scene in ""The Deer Hunter"" that seems to remain more disturbing each time we view it, when Michael (Robert De Niro), a Vietnam veteran, tracks down a friend of his named Nicky (Christopher Walken), who never arrived home after the war and is eventually found in Saigon, playing Russian Roulette for money, his mind an utter mess. He is unable to fully remember Michael, and refuses to return home, and what proceeds in the following sequence is a haunting example of gut-wrenching film-making.The Vietnam sequences take place midway through the movie, serving as a connection between the beginning and the end, both of which study the lives of the men and not the war around them. Michael, Nicky and Steven (John Savage) are young Pennsylvanian miners drafted into the war. Steven has just gotten married to the love of his life, but has little time to celebrate as he is shipped overseas with his friends. They eventually all find themselves taken hostage in a Vietnamese POW camp where their captors force them to play Russian Roulette. The rules of the game? Put a single bullet in a random chamber of a handgun, spin it, snap it, raise it to your head, squeeze the trigger, and repeat these steps until there's only one man left standing.After a series of fortunate events Michael, Nicky and Steven escape and make their way downriver. All three men are eventually rescued, Nicky via helicopter and Michael and Steven later on. Steven's battered, infected legs are amputated and he is left helpless in a wheelchair. Michael returns home as well only to find that Nicky is still back in Vietnam. Nicky's girlfriend back home, Linda (Meryl Street), begins to fall in love with Michael, but Michael soon remembers his promise to Nicky (""If I don't make it back don't leave me over there"") and travels over 2,000 miles back into the middle of his own personal hell to find and rescue his best friend. It's hard for him to understand why Nicky doesn't recognize him when he finally tracks him down. ""It's me, Mike."" ""Mike who?""Causing mass controversy upon its release because of its alleged ""racist"" content regarding the Vietnamese, a crowd of Vietnam veterans gathered around outside the Oscars ceremony and caused riots as well, claiming that the film was ""not accurate"" and somehow insulting to the veterans of the war. However as many film historians, authors and critics have already pointed out, the film is never meant to be a 100% accurate depiction of the events in Vietnam. It is not really a Vietnam War picture at all. Instead, it is a focus on the aftermath of war, and how damaging it can be, both physically and mentally, to its participants. Because of the era that ""The Deer Hunter"" was released in, Vietnam was a recent event, the focus of the nation, and is therefore used as a more convenient -- and relative -- backdrop (much like ""Apocalypse Now""). Unlike ""Platoon"" this is not a movie relating specifically to the Vietnam War, in fact less than a half an hour is devoted to the war scenes. It is a character study, and accusations of racism -- although perhaps justified to some extent -- are hardly convincing as the film itself is not concerned with bashing the participants of the war as it is the war itself.It is the film's necessary setup that is often called long and boring and, ironically, unnecessary, but this is essentially where the nature of each character is examined for the audience. To launch directly into the war sequences would be sloppy, and we would have a harder time caring for the characters. Instead, we are given scenes with weddings, discussions, and hunting trips -- normal events. Then, the end, a somber reflection upon the past, chronicles the aftermath of the damaging events in the lives of Michael, Steven, Nicky and their loved ones. Michael has a hard time adapting back to his normal life. It would be hard for anyone, after experiencing such damaging events and images. De Niro made a few post-Vietnam films during the '70s and '80s, the most famous being ""Taxi Driver,"" in which Travis Bickle was totally unable to find his way in life again after the war and resorted to violence in order to justify his existence and release his anger. ""The Deer Hunter"" is similar in approach but reveals more background; this would be a suitable prequel of sorts if the names had been changed.Over the years ""The Deer Hunter"" has surprisingly gained a fairly bad reputation -- most of which stems back to the controversy surroundings its release and protested accolades. Director Michael Cimino's follow-up (""Heaven's Gate"") was an enormous flop, bankrupting United Artists, and he had a hard time finding work afterwards. His first feature film, ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"" which starred Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges, was a buddy road movie that was also a sign of things to come in Cimino' later features, most notably the process of male bonding, which is a huge primal element in this project. Cimino was an extremely talented and visionary director, and it's a shame that the ambition of ""Heaven's Gate"" cost him his career.And furthermore, despite the negativity surrounding ""The Deer Hunter,"" it is still one of the finest works of American cinema, a touching, poignant and ultimately depressing film that asks us if the effects of war extend past the physical and into the realm of human mentality. Yes, I think they do.",its been given fairly bad reputation over years undeservedly so too one greatest films ever made,one shot is what its all about deer has be taken with one shot theres that particularly infamous scene deer hunter that seems remain more disturbing each time we view it when michael robert de niro vietnam veteran tracks down friend his named nicky christopher walken who never arrived home after war is eventually found saigon playing russian roulette money his mind utter mess he is unable fully remember michael refuses return home what proceeds following sequence is haunting example gut wrenching film making vietnam sequences take place midway through movie serving as connection between beginning end both which study lives men not war around them michael nicky steven john savage are young pennsylvanian miners drafted into war steven has just gotten married love his life but has little time celebrate as he is shipped overseas with his friends they eventually all find themselves taken hostage vietnamese pow camp where their captors force them play russian roulette rules game put single bullet random chamber handgun spin it snap it raise it your head squeeze trigger repeat these steps until theres only one man left standing after series fortunate events michael nicky steven escape make their way downriver all three men are eventually rescued nicky via helicopter michael steven later stevens battered infected legs are amputated he is left helpless wheelchair michael returns home as well only find that nicky is still back vietnam nickys girlfriend back home linda meryl street begins fall love with michael but michael soon remembers his promise nicky if i dont make it back dont leave me over there travels over 2 000 miles back into middle his own personal hell find rescue his best friend its hard him understand why nicky doesnt recognize him when he finally tracks him down its me mike mike who causing mass controversy upon its release because its alleged racist content regarding vietnamese crowd vietnam veterans gathered around outside oscars ceremony caused riots as well claiming that film was not accurate somehow insulting veterans war however as many film historians authors critics have already pointed out film is never meant be 100 accurate depiction events vietnam it is not really vietnam war picture at all instead it is focus aftermath war how damaging it can be both physically mentally its participants because era that deer hunter was released vietnam was recent event focus nation is therefore used as more convenient relative backdrop much like apocalypse now unlike platoon this is not movie relating specifically vietnam war fact less than half hour is devoted war scenes it is character study accusations racism although perhaps justified some extent are hardly convincing as film itself is not concerned with bashing participants war as it is war itself it is films necessary setup that is often called long boring ironically unnecessary but this is essentially where nature each character is examined audience launch directly into war sequences would be sloppy we would have harder time caring characters instead we are given scenes with weddings discussions hunting trips normal events then end somber reflection upon past chronicles aftermath damaging events lives michael steven nicky their loved ones michael has hard time adapting back his normal life it would be hard anyone after experiencing such damaging events images de niro made few post vietnam films during 70s 80s most famous being taxi driver which travis bickle was totally unable find his way life again after war resorted violence order justify his existence release his anger deer hunter is similar approach but reveals more background this would be suitable prequel sorts if names had been changed over years deer hunter has surprisingly gained fairly bad reputation most which stems back controversy surroundings its release protested accolades director michael ciminos follow up heavens gate was enormous flop bankrupting united artists he had hard time finding work afterwards his first feature film thunderbolt lightfoot which starred clint eastwood jeff bridges was buddy road movie that was also sign things come cimino later features most notably process male bonding which is huge primal element this project cimino was extremely talented visionary director its shame that ambition heavens gate cost him his career furthermore despite negativity surrounding deer hunter it is still one finest works american cinema touching poignant ultimately depressing film that asks us if effects war extend past physical into realm human mentality yes i think they do,0.44134599967933297,0.022609026775693455,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,A War Like All Wars A Film Like No Other,"""The Deer Hunter"" is 32 years old. How extraordinary to sit through it now. Walking over the politics that divided , somehow, all of its admirers then. ""Great film but..."" How silly to think of it now. Michael (a sensational young Robert De Niro) is as extreme a character as Rocco was in ""Rocco And His Brothers"" His goodness, the one that was always there but that he discovers under the most horrendous circumstances, underlined by Stanley Mayers's ""Cavatina"" permeates the entire film. I remember thinking, when I saw the film for the first time, that I couldn't or wouldn't spend ten minutes with Michael and his friends, the ones we meet at the beginning of the film but by the end I thought of them as brothers and I loved them. I actually loved them. That in itself is a sort of film miracle. John Savage will break your heart, it certainly broke mine and Christopher Walken is absolutely riveting. How strange to tho think that Michael Cimino, still a young man, is nowhere to be seen. Is still a punishment for ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""Indecent Exposure"" or there is something else we don't know about. The Cimino behind ""The Deer Hunter"" is a true master.",war like all wars film like no other,deer hunter is 32 years old how extraordinary sit through it now walking over politics that divided somehow all its admirers then great film but how silly think it now michael sensational young robert de niro is as extreme character as rocco was rocco his brothers his goodness one that was always there but that he discovers under most horrendous circumstances underlined by stanley mayerss cavatina permeates entire film i remember thinking when i saw film first time that i couldnt or wouldnt spend ten minutes with michael his friends ones we meet at beginning film but by end i thought them as brothers i loved them i actually loved them that itself is sort film miracle john savage will break your heart it certainly broke mine christopher walken is absolutely riveting how strange tho think that michael cimino still young man is nowhere be seen is still punishment heavens gate indecent exposure or there is something else we dont know about cimino behind deer hunter is true master,0.5898214285714285,0.21508928571428573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Hard to Watch At Times!,"1978's The Deer Hunter is one of the more polarizing movies to come out during the 1970's. It was the first movie with the deeply controversial subject of the Vietnam War to both become a critical and commercial success. However, there were several people who expressed dissent ranging from its portrayal of the Vietnam War to the controversial involvement of Russian roulette to the singing of ""God Bless America."" I remember not being too impressed with the film the first time I viewed it. I felt it was too long and violent. Years later, I am singing a different tune. It's a difficult film to sit through because of its violence and the effects of PTSD (post-trauma syndrome). But it is a highly engaging and effective film and I regard it as one of the more influential American movies of the 1970's. Not the best, but the most influential because there will be more successful films tackling the Vietnam War on the horizon.You can call this movie a symphony of some sort. I sort this film into three major segments. The first segment is the longest because of its lengthy and effective characterization. We meet three Pennsylvania factory workers: Michael (Robert De Niro), Steven (John Savage), and Nick (Christopher Walken). They enlisted in the army to serve in Vietnam. Steven decides to marry before going off to war and this wedding also serves as the farewell party. This section is eerily reminiscent of the opening act of The Godfather. There is lots of partying and dancing. And we essentially get to know these characters. These men are hard workers who get drunk at the party because they deserve a night for themselves. After the party, the trio of friends along with another friend Stan (John Cazale) go into the mountains to hunt for deer for one last trip. Hence the title of the movie. I found this section to be incredibly effective in character-building. Director Michael Cimino took his time with his part because it was important to understand these men before they go into the horrors of war.The second movement of our symphony is the actual war. Just like that with a loud noise, the film instantly changes its tone. From the foggy mountains of Pennsylvania to the tropical war zone of Vietnam we go. In one of the most terrifying sequences ever made, the three men are taken prisoner and are forced to play Russian roulette while their captors are betting who will win and who will die. Just seeing the men's faces as they are waiting their turn in the rat-infested cages are undeniably scary. One of the film's controversies is that roulette was not actually played in Vietnam. According to Cimino, he read articles saying they did play roulette although any of this has not been confirmed. But it's one hell of a way to add tension to the movie. You can also take this as a symbol for the war overall. Roger Ebert puts it perfectly in his review, ""Anything you can believe about the game, about it's deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply it to the war as a whole."" Essentially, this violence stands for the war itself and what these men face. Now our final act of the symphony is what happens after the horrors of the prison camp. Michael becomes a prominent character here as he returns home and is welcomed as a hero by his townsfolk and his girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). But Michael does not feel like a hero. Steven is in the hospital after losing his legs and Nick is somewhere in Vietnam still. Michael eventually goes back to find Nick who happened to take his roulette experiences to heart by playing this game professionally. This section is incredibly sad and moving as here we see what exactly war can do to strong-willed men. It was horrible to watch this transformation on screen. To see these characters we got to laugh with in the first part to seeing them play with death in the final act is sad to see. We also get to see an act of patriotism (or is it?) when the survivors join in a ragged rendition of ""God Bless America"" in the very end. This movie has a very strong cast, although the only star at the time was Robert De Niro. De Niro instantly became the film's leader and he played Michael very well. He became a bona fide star after his work in The Godfather: Part Two, and he put that stardom to work here. Christopher Walken had some of the strongest scenes in the movie because of his involvement with the deadly game of Russian roulette. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest actresses ever to grace our screens, and this was one of her first big roles. We end this paragraph with a sad note. This would be the last movie John Cazale would play because he was suffering from terminal cancer and he died before the film was released. He was very good as Stan, but you can tell in the movie that he was really sick.Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a incredible movie about the horror of wars and it effective covers themes ranging from PTSD to male bonding and friendship. It was one of the first movies to successfully cover the Vietnam War, although I'd say this film may not be the most accurate regarding the actual war. I do commend its effort on conveying the themes of general war though. This film was nominated for nine Oscars and it won five of them including Best Picture. Walken took home the statue for his amazing and tense performance as Nick. The film may be controversial and it may be hard to watch, but it's one you'll remember forever.

10.0,"A veteran's impression of ""The Deer Hunter""","I will not repeat much of the comments in the previous positive reviews, but will stick mostly to how the movie affected me. First off, I am an Army veteran of the Vietnam War. Thus there is much in this picture that deeply moves me. I still can not listen to the theme music piece played by John Williams, ""Cavatina"", without choking up and weeping.I identify much with the characters in this movie. I grew up in a very small town and come from a working class ( Norwegian, Scots-Irish, English) background. Two weeks out of high school and at the age of 17 I enlisted in the Army. Like the men in this movie I came from a tradition of serving one's country in the military. Both my brother, two cousins and my future brother-in-law also served in the Vietnam War.I identify with Michael, played by Robert DeNiro in his sense of honor in going back to 'Nam and trying to bring back his buddy Nick. Additionally I admire Mike when he visits Steven in the VA hospital and brings him back home. Honor is, as mentioned in the movie ""Rob Roy"", a gift a man gives to himself. Michael (and the movie) doesn't waste time on whether the war in Vietnam is right or wrong. Michael just does what he thinks is right with respect to his buddies. Ask any one who has served in the military and they will tell you that you're sense of commitment to your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment to your country.I do not see this movie as either pro or anti-Vietnam War. To me the movie portrays how war affects three individuals. It is a movie about character, honor, loyalty------what you are when everything around you is falling apart. I will continue to see this movie many times as I hope that the values depicted in it will still be reflected (albeit weakly) in me.In closing, I can not help to remember that the politically anti-Vietnam War movie ""Coming home"" starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight was also up for the same Oscars. When Jane Fonda was asked what movie would win the Academy award that year, she sneeringly replied that she hoped it wasn't ""The Deer Hunter"". In the years since Jon Voght has transitioned from being a Liberal to a Conservative. Parenthetically, Jane Fonda has never apologized for her pro-Viet Cong actions. At the age of 66, I am still proud that I served my country and volunteered for the US Army and the Vietnam War.",veterans impression deer hunter,i will not repeat much comments previous positive reviews but will stick mostly how movie affected me first off i am army veteran vietnam war thus there is much this picture that deeply moves me i still can not listen theme music piece played by john williams cavatina without choking up weeping i identify much with characters this movie i grew up very small town come working class norwegian scots irish english background two weeks out high school at age 17 i enlisted army like men this movie i came tradition serving ones country military both my brother two cousins my future brother law also served vietnam war i identify with michael played by robert deniro his sense honor going back nam trying bring back his buddy nick additionally i admire mike when he visits steven va hospital brings him back home honor is as mentioned movie rob roy gift man gives himself michael movie doesnt waste time whether war vietnam is right or wrong michael just does what he thinks is right with respect his buddies ask any one who has served military they will tell you that youre sense commitment your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment your country i do not see this movie as either pro or anti vietnam war me movie portrays how war affects three individuals it is movie about character honor loyalty what you are when everything around you is falling apart i will continue see this movie many times as i hope that values depicted it will still be reflected albeit weakly me closing i can not help remember that politically anti vietnam war movie coming home starring jane fonda jon voight was also up same oscars when jane fonda was asked what movie would win academy award that year she sneeringly replied that she hoped it wasnt deer hunter years since jon voght has transitioned being liberal conservative parenthetically jane fonda has never apologized her pro viet cong actions at age 66 i am still proud that i served my country volunteered us army vietnam war,0.2883961038961039,0.08806782106782106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,One Shot,"I can identify a lot with The Deer Hunter because my mother's family were of Ukranian background and my relatives on her side were a whole lot like the people we see here from Clairton, Pennsylvania. They worked in the same factory jobs that these men do and answered the call of their country at war, but in a whole different time. And the grandson of one my uncles recently served in Iraq as a marine.Make no mistake about it, these people for all their personal faults are the backbone of America. They are the folks whose blood gets spilled in the wars we fight. So when they are called it had better not be in an unrighteous or fruitless cause.Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage are three mill workers from small town Clairton, Pennsylvania. All from Slavic background as my family is and in a time when those of us more educated and more sophisticated and knowing better dodge the draft, these guys enlist and go to Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is about the effects of that war on all of them and all around them.John Savage gets overlooked a lot with both Robert DeNiro being nominated for Best Actor and Christopher Walken winning for Best Supporting Actor, but Savage is the guy most physically damaged, losing a leg as a result of the escape all three make from a Viet Cong prison. He's growing quite accustomed to what he calls the country club of the VA hospital he's in and can't bring himself to come home.Robert DeNiro is a hunter on weekends, as were some in my family. But the sure marksman from before Vietnam, after having to kill people to stay alive, is not about killing defenseless deer any longer. Meryl Streep plays the woman who loves both DeNiro and Walken and she's so totally immersed in her role and her role's ethnic background, I could swear she was one of my relatives.Christopher Walken will blow you away with his performance of the man totally unhinged by his capture with the Viet Cong and the Russian Roulette games they play with the captives. His final confrontation with DeNiro will move you beyond words.Michael Cimino who directed and co-wrote the screenplay got an Oscar for the film and himself and deserved every bit of it. Acclaimed the new genius of the cinema, his next project proved to be an overblown disaster, Heaven's Gate. Not that that film was as bad as it was made out to be, but Cimino's career plummeted and never really got back on track.28 years later I remember the Oscar ceremonies in 1979 when a dying John Wayne presented the Best Picture Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Ironic also because one of the cast member, John Cazale who played one of the friends in Clairton and best remembered for being Freddo Corleone in The Godfather also was dying of cancer while the film was being shot.Although I find it a bit too coincidental that three men from the same small town who join the Army would have the exact same service record, The Deer Hunter isn't really about the Vietnam War. It's about war and what it can do those that serve and to those around them.And this review is dedicated to those that serve.",one shot,i can identify lot with deer hunter because my mothers family were ukranian background my relatives her side were whole lot like people we see here clairton pennsylvania they worked same factory jobs that these men do answered call their country at war but whole different time grandson one my uncles recently served iraq as marine make no mistake about it these people all their personal faults are backbone america they are folks whose blood gets spilled wars we fight so when they are called it had better not be unrighteous or fruitless cause robert deniro christopher walken john savage are three mill workers small town clairton pennsylvania all slavic background as my family is time when those us more educated more sophisticated knowing better dodge draft these guys enlist go vietnam deer hunter is about effects that war all them all around them john savage gets overlooked lot with both robert deniro being nominated best actor christopher walken winning best supporting actor but savage is guy most physically damaged losing leg as result escape all three make viet cong prison hes growing quite accustomed what he calls country club va hospital hes cant bring himself come home robert deniro is hunter weekends as were some my family but sure marksman before vietnam after having kill people stay alive is not about killing defenseless deer any longer meryl streep plays woman who loves both deniro walken shes so totally immersed her role her roles ethnic background i could swear she was one my relatives christopher walken will blow you away with his performance man totally unhinged by his capture with viet cong russian roulette games they play with captives his final confrontation with deniro will move you beyond words michael cimino who directed co wrote screenplay got oscar film himself deserved every bit it acclaimed new genius cinema his next project proved be overblown disaster heavens gate not that that film was as bad as it was made out be but ciminos career plummeted never really got back track 28 years later i remember oscar ceremonies 1979 when dying john wayne presented best picture oscar deer hunter ironic also because one cast member john cazale who played one friends clairton best remembered being freddo corleone godfather also was dying cancer while film was being shot although i find it bit too coincidental that three men same small town who join army would have exact same service record deer hunter isnt really about vietnam war its about war what it can do those that serve those around them this review is dedicated those that serve,0.4161014911014912,0.20093240093240095,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,"Goodness. So Heartbreaking, So Sad, So Accurate, So Brilliant.","Outstanding and haunting Best Picture winner of 1978 that still packs a punch nearly 25 years later. Robert DeNiro (Oscar-nominated), Christopher Walken (Oscar-winning for Best Supporting Actor) and John Savage are on their way to fight for their country in Vietnam. The three are in for a rude awakening from their simple lives in a small steel town in Pennsylvania. The terrors of Vietnam will change all. DeNiro, an avid deer hunter, cannot stand to even shoot a gun after he returns. Savage loses his legs and is too ashamed and scared to return home to his new wife and friends. Walken has lost it mentally and stays in Vietnam and develops the taste for Russian roulette. The movie is a trial to sit through in many ways, but it is also an important film that was the first commentary on the topic of Vietnam. Meryl Streep also received her first of a record 12 Oscar nominations as Walken's love interest.

10.0,The Deer Hunter: 10/10,"Most young people today need to learn that Robert De Niro was not just the person in Meet the Parents or The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, but he starred in films like The Deer Hunter, which got him to where he is today. Not only is he a great actor, he always picks good films to act in. And with a strong supporting cast, also, you can't really go wrong with The Deer Hunter. Michael (De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage) sign up to go to Vietnam. They leave after a farewell party/wedding party for Stanley and Angela (Rutanya Alda). Once in the midst of the war, they are forced into playing Russian Roulette and eventually they escape, but none of them can forget the experiences from the war. It's sad to see that Michael Cimino fade from view, because his direction here is really memorable and it's what holds the film together. There's about 70 minutes in the beginning of the film that has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but it gets us to know these three main characters, and it seems like you wouldn't care if they even went to Vietnam, because you certainly were intrigued by these three people. And once they're in the perils of war, you feel enough for these three basic people to get through the war. The Russian Roulette scenes are harrowing, even when it's a complete stranger who has the gun to their head. I read that to get the tension on set, a live bullet was put into the gun, but it was checked to make sure that it wasn't the one about to be shot. And, since you've known these people for 90 minutes already, you obviously didn't want them to die, making them all the more nervous. The Deer Hunter is quite unlike another great Vietnam film, Full Metal Jacket. While FMJ just showed the immediate results, this movie showed the results immediately and in the future, back at home. This helped make everything seem more realistic, which it was. For each of the three main characters, the war has changed them greatly, and none for the better. De Niro is great, but the stand out here is Walken, who accurately takes his role and makes it into something memorable. Thankfully, he won best supporting actor. Meryl Streep was nominated as a supporting character, deservedly. However, this movie is not all about the acting, it's about the feeling you get. As one character says, 'I don't know how I feel.' That's exactly how you'll feel after seeing this tour-de-force. My rating: 10/10 Rated R for strong language and violence.",deer hunter 10 10,most young people today need learn that robert de niro was not just person meet parents or adventures rocky bullwinkle but he starred films like deer hunter which got him where he is today not only is he great actor he always picks good films act with strong supporting cast also you cant really go wrong with deer hunter michael de niro nick christopher walken steven john savage sign up go vietnam they leave after farewell party wedding party stanley angela rutanya alda once midst war they are forced into playing russian roulette eventually they escape but none them can forget experiences war its sad see that michael cimino fade view because his direction here is really memorable its what holds film together theres about 70 minutes beginning film that has nothing do with rest film but it gets us know these three main characters it seems like you wouldnt care if they even went vietnam because you certainly were intrigued by these three people once theyre perils war you feel enough these three basic people get through war russian roulette scenes are harrowing even when its complete stranger who has gun their head i read that get tension set live bullet was put into gun but it was checked make sure that it wasnt one about be shot since youve known these people 90 minutes already you obviously didnt want them die making them all more nervous deer hunter is quite unlike another great vietnam film full metal jacket while fmj just showed immediate results this movie showed results immediately future back at home this helped make everything seem more realistic which it was each three main characters war has changed them greatly none better de niro is great but stand out here is walken who accurately takes his role makes it into something memorable thankfully he won best supporting actor meryl streep was nominated as supporting character deservedly however this movie is not all about acting its about feeling you get as one character says i dont know how i feel thats exactly how youll feel after seeing this tour de force my rating 10 10 rated r strong language violence,0.4915079365079366,0.2691829004329004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,It's about character development,"A comment re the other comments: A lot of the comments criticize the first half hour as being too long. In my opinion, these comments miss the point of the movie.Of course many of the scenes in the first hour don't advance the narrative. They're not supposed to; they're for character development.The whole point of the movie is to show us how the various characters were affected by the war. It wouldn't have worked nearly as powerfully as it does had the first hour been trimmed down. We have to sense the careless and frat-boy-like immaturity of these young men. That's why the scenes all revolve around frivolity and seemingly senseless boyish behavior; it creates such a stark contrast to the devastated characters of the three who went to war (and the relatively unaffected personalities of those who stayed behind, like Stanley).The strong points of the film are the outstanding performances of nearly every actor in the movie. Yes, there are technical deficiencies in the sound, but it hardly matters.

9.0,Touching drama about the ruin of a group of men's friendship by war,"""The Deer Hunter"" is not a film about the Vietnam war, as it is wrongly said in many cases.""The Deer Hunter"" is a film tells the story of 3 friends within about 5-6 years, during which their friendship is repeatedly put to the test.It is primarily a picture of the contemporary life of a group of people around 30 living in a small American town during the Vietnam war.The first hour of the film portrays the every day life of three friends Mike (De Niro), Steven (Savage) and Nick (Walken), who look forward to Steve's wedding but at the same time have to prepare for their commitment in Vietnam. The main actors (above all De Niro and Walken) perfectly picture the character's inner conflict between their easygoing home town life and the forthcoming assignment in Vietnam. Despite this conflict the characters don't show their concerns to their environment.Particularly Nick is worried about him and his friends leaving his home town and perhaps never coming back, but he only tells his best friend Mike of his thoughts, who is much more resolute and sees their engagement as a strong masculine act.Cimino manages to show the simple irrationality of young men, going to a senseless war from which they might never return for the only purpose of glory and approval, and abandoning their settled and happy life for it. The spectator just can't understand why those young men voluntarily sign for the army and give up everything they have. The passage from the small-town-idyll to the war cruelty is greatly pictured. Cimino does not show the three friends' way to Vietnam or the training, he immediately switches from a happy get-together to the cruel war captivity of the Vietcong. This passage perfectly underlines the contrast and the inexplicability of the three men's actions.Although the passage that is set in Vietnam is only about one third of the whole film long, the war is omnipresent at any time, which is probably the best benefit of the whole film, Cimino does not need to bomb the spectator with pictures of crying children, mutilated soldiers or desert battlefields in order to illustrate the cruelty of war. Far from it! The changed behavior of all characters after the friends' returns tell more about wars' capability of changing someone's life, than anything else.And the fact that the many dreams that these three friends had before they went to Vietnam didn't come true, because of their longing for recognition by becoming an acclaimed veteran can even pluck your heartstrings.Cimino's great directing and the cast's awesome acting provide for a touching and honest drama about the friendship of a group of young men, that is destroyed by the Vietnam war.",touching drama about ruin group mens friendship by war,deer hunter is not film about vietnam war as it is wrongly said many cases deer hunter is film tells story 3 friends within about 5 6 years during which their friendship is repeatedly put test it is primarily picture contemporary life group people around 30 living small american town during vietnam war first hour film portrays every day life three friends mike de niro steven savage nick walken who look forward steves wedding but at same time have prepare their commitment vietnam main actors above all de niro walken perfectly picture characters inner conflict between their easygoing home town life forthcoming assignment vietnam despite this conflict characters dont show their concerns their environment particularly nick is worried about him his friends leaving his home town perhaps never coming back but he only tells his best friend mike his thoughts who is much more resolute sees their engagement as strong masculine act cimino manages show simple irrationality young men going senseless war which they might never return only purpose glory approval abandoning their settled happy life it spectator just cant understand why those young men voluntarily sign army give up everything they have passage small town idyll war cruelty is greatly pictured cimino does not show three friends way vietnam or training he immediately switches happy get together cruel war captivity vietcong this passage perfectly underlines contrast inexplicability three mens actions although passage that is set vietnam is only about one third whole film long war is omnipresent at any time which is probably best benefit whole film cimino does not need bomb spectator with pictures crying children mutilated soldiers or desert battlefields order illustrate cruelty war far it changed behavior all characters after friends returns tell more about wars capability changing someones life than anything else fact that many dreams that these three friends had before they went vietnam didnt come true because their longing recognition by becoming acclaimed veteran can even pluck your heartstrings ciminos great directing casts awesome acting provide touching honest drama about friendship group young men that is destroyed by vietnam war,0.5234450923226434,0.26190476190476186,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,to call it masterpiece is to state the obvious,"Of the first two American films about the Vietnam war with a priceless artistic weight, ""the Deer Hunter"" wins hands down over ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) although Francis Ford Coppola's work is very potent too.But would it be judicious to pigeonhole Michael Cimino's work in the category of the war movie? Unlike Coppola's visual nightmare, only the central part takes place in Vietnam and the filmmaker barely shoots one fight sequence before Mike (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Stevie (John Savage) are prisoners of the enemy and are forced to play Russian roulette in the notorious unbearable scene. Actually ""the Deer Hunter"" is a film straddling two movie genres: the war movie and the social drama. Rather than shooting a political film, Cimino chose to represent us the deadly impact this nightmarish war had on an American community whose hopes and values disappeared.Dividing his work in three parts: before, during, after and thanks to symbolical images, scenes or even eloquent details, Cimino used and honed his own cinematographic language to set out his stalls and the result can only command respect and admiration. Each sequence could be separately taken and carefully studied like the representation of the humdrum but reassuring living standards of the blue-collars with their everyday rituals (Cimino's obsession with rites and customs) revolving around factory, bar, friends and hunting (you have to admire the startling contrast between the dirty little town and the gorgeous, wild landscapes). Archetypal sequences that epitomize life and it reaches its height in the famous, unusually long wedding sequence. Perhaps Cimino wanted to stretch this sequence to make his characters take advantage of this rapture moment. But even during this state of bliss that lives inside them, the imminent tragedy ominously lurks: Mike and Nick gently laugh at an officer who remains dumb and when Stevie and his wife have to drink in a dish, some drops fall on her wedding dress. This sequence also epitomizes the polar opposite to the sequence of the Russian roulette in which death is just around the corner. After the war when Mike comes back to the small town, he's completely altered. Before, a devotee of deer hunting; after his traumatizing experience, he can't kill one. He's unable to talk about about what he went through and for his sidekicks, the experience of a war like this one is incomprehensible. Cimino eschews classical, predictable storytelling and hasn't recourse to psychological study. Nearly everything occurs in gestures and looks while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. Besides, during the whole movie the topic of the war is barely mentioned by the characters. A lyrical whiff blows on the film, dovetailed by Cimino's astounding directing.Cimino was consumed with ambition and went at it hammer and tongs to get his crew completely involved in his project. He was hard on his actors (Robert De Niro has often said that ""the Deer Hunter"" was his most grueling role to date) and was obsessed with absolute control. But the efforts weren't vain at all and gave a heartfelt, invaluable yardstick in war movie, even American cinema which reached the streets when America rose from its ruins. It was also the beginning of the end for Cimino, a filmmaker ahead of his time and on the fringe of cinematographic trends.",call it masterpiece is state obvious,first two american films about vietnam war with priceless artistic weight deer hunter wins hands down over apocalypse now 1979 although francis ford coppolas work is very potent too but would it be judicious pigeonhole michael ciminos work category war movie unlike coppolas visual nightmare only central part takes place vietnam filmmaker barely shoots one fight sequence before mike robert de niro nick christopher walken stevie john savage are prisoners enemy are forced play russian roulette notorious unbearable scene actually deer hunter is film straddling two movie genres war movie social drama rather than shooting political film cimino chose represent us deadly impact this nightmarish war had american community whose hopes values disappeared dividing his work three parts before during after thanks symbolical images scenes or even eloquent details cimino used honed his own cinematographic language set out his stalls result can only command respect admiration each sequence could be separately taken carefully studied like representation humdrum but reassuring living standards blue collars with their everyday rituals ciminos obsession with rites customs revolving around factory bar friends hunting you have admire startling contrast between dirty little town gorgeous wild landscapes archetypal sequences that epitomize life it reaches its height famous unusually long wedding sequence perhaps cimino wanted stretch this sequence make his characters take advantage this rapture moment but even during this state bliss that lives inside them imminent tragedy ominously lurks mike nick gently laugh at officer who remains dumb when stevie his wife have drink dish some drops fall her wedding dress this sequence also epitomizes polar opposite sequence russian roulette which death is just around corner after war when mike comes back small town hes completely altered before devotee deer hunting after his traumatizing experience he cant kill one hes unable talk about about what he went through his sidekicks experience war like this one is incomprehensible cimino eschews classical predictable storytelling hasnt recourse psychological study nearly everything occurs gestures looks while suggested has meaty part dialogs besides during whole movie topic war is barely mentioned by characters lyrical whiff blows film dovetailed by ciminos astounding directing cimino was consumed with ambition went at it hammer tongs get his crew completely involved his project he was hard his actors robert de niro has often said that deer hunter was his most grueling role date was obsessed with absolute control but efforts werent vain at all gave heartfelt invaluable yardstick war movie even american cinema which reached streets when america rose its ruins it was also beginning end cimino filmmaker ahead his time fringe cinematographic trends,0.4338693957115009,0.04953703703703704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.42}"
1.0,"Boring, historically inaccurate and FAR too long","Story about three buddies (played by Robert DeNiro, John Savage and Christopher Walken) going off to Vietnam. They're all gung ho about going and aren't prepared for what they experience. They all return home--one mentally affected, one physically handicapped and one dead.This came out in 1978 and was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. It was one of the few movies that dealt with Vietnam realistically (somewhat). It also really hit a lot of Vietnam vets and young guys hard. A friend of mine went to see it and after it was over he was in the mens room and saw 4 guys in their 20s crying nonstop. I saw it around that time. I was in high school and was bored silly. I figured at the time I was too young to appreciate it. I saw it years later and was STILL bored.For starters--it's too long--3 hours. The wedding sequence at the beginning goes on and on and ON. You learn nothing more about the characters than you could have in about 10 minutes. Even after they return home it moves slowly. The Russian roulette sequences (which were VERY hotly debated) never happened in reality. There's no proof at all that it ever happened. Also one character makes a living out of playing Russian roulette???? Come on! The Vietnamese are portrayed as victims or monsters--very black and white. No shadings of character. With the sole exceptions of DeNiro, Savage and Meryl Strepp the acting sucks. Seriously--HOW did Walken get an Oscar for this? DeNiro should have gotten it. And the irony at the end (when they're all singing ""God Bless America"") was SO heavy-handed it was almost comic. Wildly overpraised and overrated. This does not belong in the top 250 on IMDb.

3.0,A bloated bore.,"Three friends, Mike Vronsky (Robert De Niro), Steven Pushkov (John Savage), and Nick Chebotarevich (Christopher Walken), find their lives affected in different ways by the horrors of war.50 minutes, give or take a few: that's how long the opening wedding sequence takes in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter. It starts with the preparation, followed by the ceremony itself, and finishes at the reception where there is much drinking and dancing. It's about as much fun as being at a real wedding where you know none of the guests (other than your partner) and are forced to remain sober because you're the one doing the driving home. You want it all to end as soon as possible, but your other half insists on just one more drink (and another, and another) while she chats with all of her friends.Having bored the viewer to death with the wedding, Cimino then proceeds to numb the senses further with some dreary hunting scenes in the mountains, after which the film finally cuts to Nam for a little war action. Here we are treated to the infamous Russian roulette torture sequence, which is arguably the highlight of the film, both suspenseful and terrifying. But don't worry, we're soon back to the drudgery as the main characters escape capture, Mike returning to his steelworks hometown, Nick remaining in Saigon (to earn cash by taking part in Russian roulette games in seedy gambling dens), and Steven recuperating in a veterans hospital. Eventually, Mike decides to find Nicky and bring him home, which he does—with a bullet in his head, his luck having finally run out.Winner in 5 categories at the 1979 Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Director, Best Film Editing (seriously?), and Best Sound.

10.0,How far would you go for a friend?,"This is one of the best adaptions of the Vietnam War on film that I have seen. We have also ""Platoon"" that represented somewhat of the same thing that ""The Deer Hunter"" did as well, but this one came first and was a great version. It showed the intense horror and ultimate change effect on the men that fought in Vietnam. At first, I admit, I was a little bored because the beginning is a little long and felt unnecessary, but then I realized later in the film how much that developed the characters and understood their friendships and how they relate.Robert De Niro seems to be the strongest one of the group, his name is Mike. He has a lot of guts, but he also seems to care mostly about himself, he later on proves that after finally just letting go with his kept up emotions, he must take care of his friends as well. Christopher Walken, he's a baby in here! He's such a terrific actor and he did so well by portraying innocence in his role and the ultimate insanity of his character. He and Robert were amazing, they were just so believable and worked so well together.This was the best picture of 1978, so far I cannot really judge one wither or not it deserved the reward.

,Magnum Hopeless,"""The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do."" - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's ""The Four Feathers"", Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is exceptional throughout, but his film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters ""Best Years of Our Lives"" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see.The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese ""savages"" kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no.""Don't leave me over there,"" Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - ""best man"" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing ""God Bless America"". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars.Like most Vietnam war movies, ""Hunter"" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for ""virtuous, humane kills"" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the ""reason"" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in a wholly irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like ""Apocalypse Now"", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy ""dramatic"" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a ""simplistic lie"".As with most war movies, the overriding message is ""look what they did to us"". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's ""Burn!"", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and ""In the Year of the Pig"" and ""Hearts and Minds"", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats.In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (later supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in ""tiger cages"" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans.During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide.3/10 – Depressing.",magnum hopeless,story we tell ourselves about ourselves order account what we are doing is lie truth

10.0,The Deer Hunter is a masterful piece of cinema,"The Deer Hunter (1978) This is an epic war drama film about a trio of steelworkers whose lives are changed forever after they fight in the Vietnam War. The cast includes Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and George Dzundza. The story takes place in a little working class town south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor for Christopher Walken. It also marked Meryl Streep's very first Academy Award nomination. She is now the most nominated actor in history. It was named the 53rd greatest American film of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI). The film's initial reviews were mostly positive. It was hailed by many critics as the best American epic since The Godfather. The late Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars and called it ""one of the most emotionally shattering films ever made."" This film is an American classic. It is my favorite drama, and perhaps my favorite film of all time. It even holds up nearly 40 years later. My willingness to try older films, any films, was because of this picture.

10.0,As great as ever,"I've now seen this film three times with a decade or more between viewings, and every time I see it I come away feeling that movies can't get any better than this. People always comment on the Viet Nam scenes, and it's true that they are as powerful and intense as any war scenes ever filmed. The Russian-roulette betting game, in both its up-river and Saigon venues, may be the most riveting, shattering plot device ever invented, as measured by the pounding of the heart. But it's the 'home front' scenes that stick with me through the years. I think all the steel town scenes are nearly perfect, untoppable. And that very much includes the Eastern Orthodox wedding and its sequel. When anyone tells me they were bored I just shake my head. There's no arguing with short and shallow attention spans. You're either capable of appreciating art or you're not.  I do have a quibble or two. The deer-hunting scenes looked like nowhere I've ever seen in Pennsylvania, or anywhere else East of the Rockies. I think Cimino deliberately picked an ethereal location above the clouds as a contrast to the steel town. When John Cazale and the others get loaded and act like jerks it jars on Michael, because they have brought the stupid distractions of ordinary life to an extraordinary place. This would matter less if the 'genius loci' were not so strongly present in the other home front scenes. I wish he had used the soft, green forested hills of Pennsylvania for the hunting. And some of the dialogue--Meryl Streep's in particular--wouldn't work on the page, and only first-rate acting by an inspired ensemble--has there ever been a better cast of young actors?--pulls it off. But these are forgivable errors in one of the finest films ever made.",as great as ever,ive now seen this film three times with decade or more between viewings every time i see it i come away feeling that movies cant get any better than this people always comment viet nam scenes its true that they are as powerful intense as any war scenes ever filmed russian roulette betting game both its up river saigon venues may be most riveting shattering plot device ever invented as measured by pounding heart but its home front scenes that stick with me through years i think all steel town scenes are nearly perfect untoppable that very much includes eastern orthodox wedding its sequel when anyone tells me they were bored i just shake my head theres no arguing with short shallow attention spans youre either capable appreciating art or youre not i do have quibble or two deer hunting scenes looked like nowhere ive ever seen pennsylvania or anywhere else east rockies i think cimino deliberately picked ethereal location above clouds as contrast steel town when john cazale others get loaded act like jerks it jars michael because they have brought stupid distractions ordinary life extraordinary place this would matter less if genius loci were not so strongly present other home front scenes i wish he had used soft green forested hills pennsylvania hunting some dialogue meryl streeps particular wouldnt work page only first rate acting by inspired ensemble has there ever been better cast young actors pulls it off but these are forgivable errors one finest films ever made,0.5193229166666666,0.11203125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.28}"
5.0,Heartfelt But Unconvincing.,"Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families.Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about.Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.",heartfelt but unconvincing,michael cimino directs this long character study war picture that follows group friends wedding deer hunting trip finally vietnam war its aftermath over three hour film details their lives before after war both men their families fine cast includes robert de nero christopher walken meryl streep who all deliver heartfelt believable performances but trouble is that extended pow sequence involving russian roulette just feels so bizarre extreme that i had hard time buying it especially when one characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over somehow this drags film down by end instead feeling emotionally drained like many audience claimed film felt emotionally muted like it had gone too far afield lost sight what it was supposed be about still minority view i suppose since it did win academy award best picture director,0.6265277777777779,0.11972222222222224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.48}"
,Overlong and not as deep as it thinks but still a very good film,"Three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania prepare to go to war in Vietnam. The night before they go, Steven is married, sparking a large celebration. The next morning they go deer hunting one last time in the woods before they leave. Time passes and the three meet up again in Vietnam as prisoners of war. Brutal mental torture affects them in different ways before they escape and are separated again. Back in Pennsylvania Michael realises the extent to which the war has not only affected him but devastated the lives of his friends in different ways.I have seen this film several times and I'll admit that I always assume that it is a classic film mainly because I saw it twice when I was in my early teens and was blown away by parts of it. I say this because I want to acknowledge that it may not be as great a film as many critics lists believe it to be, but at the same time I still watch it occasionally as I find it to be a moving story and a good film. The plot is moving if it is viewed on it's surface as a tale of three men whose lives are deeply affected by the war. Going past that to deeper themes I always feel that the film doesn't manage to be as deep as it thinks it is, so I try not to linger too long on these.The breakdown of the film gives significantly more time to events in the home town rather than Vietnam. This is as it should be  for many people the war was a fleeting thing that has stayed with them for much longer than they were actually involved. The wedding scene is a little overlong but it does serve as a chance to get to see the characters in their setting before we quickly move to the events that changed them and the people they become. The time in Vietnam is quite short but very memorable (many people who have never seen the film will still know these scenes) and the final hour or so of the film is moving even if it takes things to an extreme to make it's point.The cast make the film work as well, if not more, than the material itself. De Niro is the rock on which it all stands and is pretty good. The only weakness in his performance was that he was the one who had to be `the hero' type who does what he can. Walken gets the lion share of praise for his is the role that changes the most significantly throughout the film. It is easy to forget that he was not anywhere near as famous as De Niro at this time and it is amazing in that regard to see him hold his own. Savage gives a good performance and support is strong in the form of such actors as Cazale, Dzundza and Aspegren. Even Streep gives a performance refreshingly free of sentiment or forced accents.The film is a little overlong and could easily have lost 30 minutes (although not all from one place) to give it a tighter feel. Some scenes feel stretched beyond their useful duration leading to the feel that the film wanted to be 3 hours long, rather than being cut back to 3 hours long. Despite this though I still think this is a good film that is a powerful story at it's heart. I personally don't think it would make my top 50 (were I ever to do one) but I will watch it again.",overlong not as deep as it thinks but still very good film,three steel workers small town pennsylvania prepare go war vietnam night before they go steven is married sparking large celebration next morning they go deer hunting one last time woods before they leave time passes three meet up again vietnam as prisoners war brutal mental torture affects them different ways before they escape are separated again back pennsylvania michael realises extent which war has not only affected him but devastated lives his friends different ways i have seen this film several times ill admit that i always assume that it is classic film mainly because i saw it twice when i was my early teens was blown away by parts it i say this because i want acknowledge that it may not be as great film as many critics lists believe it be but at same time i still watch it occasionally as i find it be moving story good film plot is moving if it is viewed its surface as tale three men whose lives are deeply affected by war going past that deeper themes i always feel that film doesnt manage be as deep as it thinks it is so i try not linger too long these breakdown film gives significantly more time events home town rather than vietnam this is as it should be many people war was fleeting thing that has stayed with them much longer than they were actually involved wedding scene is little overlong but it does serve as chance get see characters their setting before we quickly move events that changed them people they become time vietnam is quite short but very memorable many people who have never seen film will still know these scenes final hour or so film is moving even if it takes things extreme make its point cast make film work as well if not more than material itself de niro is rock which it all stands is pretty good only weakness his performance was that he was one who had be hero type who does what he can walken gets lion share praise his is role that changes most significantly throughout film it is easy forget that he was not anywhere near as famous as de niro at this time it is amazing that regard see him hold his own savage gives good performance support is strong form such actors as cazale dzundza aspegren even streep gives performance refreshingly free sentiment or forced accents film is little overlong could easily have lost 30 minutes although not all one place give it tighter feel some scenes feel stretched beyond their useful duration leading feel that film wanted be 3 hours long rather than being cut back 3 hours long despite this though i still think this is good film that is powerful story at its heart i personally dont think it would make my top 50 were i ever do one but i will watch it again,0.5100036630036628,0.1706300366300366,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
6.0,Overlong And Overrated,"THE DEER HUNTER was a movie I'd heard about ever since it was released in 1978 . It received its first broadcast on British television in 1984 and since I was on holiday via the penal system I never got to see it . I did later ask my friends what they thought of it and they all discussed the bits involving torture by the Vietnamese on their American prisoners which made me thankful that I wasn't doing time in a Vietnamese jail . It wasn't until 1988 that I finally saw the movie and was bitterly disappointed and bored in equal measure The problem with THE DEER HUNTER is with the script , it's shapeless and unfocused . Can anyone explain to me what the most important part of the story is ? Is it the wedding scene ? Is it the deer hunting scene ? Is it the prison scene ? is it ... ? I know it's difficult to write a script . In fact I once wrote a script entitled SOLITUDE a story of war and how it contrasts with peace which was set in the UK and Former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s . All the above criticisms made about Deric Washburn's script could certainly apply to mine ( In fact I describe it as "" A British version of THE DEER HUNTER ) , but unlike SOLITUDE the script for THE DEER HUNTER was produced and it's amazing the studio or director Michael Ciminio didn't sit Mr Washburn down and say "" Look this script is far too long , we can do without a good sixty pages that add nothing to the plot . Bring us back a script of one hundred and forty pages maximum "" !!!! SPOILERS !!!!There's another problem with the script and that's the level of coincidence involved when the action switches to 'Nam . Nick ( Walken ) and Steven ( Savage ) disembark from a copter where they meet their old buddy Michael ( De Niro ) . What's the chances of that happening in real life ? It should also be pointed out that the three characters were drafted into the army at the same time but that now Michael is an elite Green Beret while Nick and Steven are still draftee infantrymen . Didn't Green Berets have to serve a certain amount of time in the army before they could apply to become special forces ? I'm thinking if Michael was special forces Nick and Steven would have completed their military service . This introductory sequence also seems to have been heavily edited so much that it doesn't make much sense . But back to the coincidences .... After being captured by the VC South Vietnamese and American prisoners play Russian roulette that ends with Steven being imprisoned in a bamboo cage and Michael and Nick being the remaining contestants in the Russian roulette sweepstake . Unlikely enough but then they play with a revolver that has three bullets , they play several times and never shoot themselves once , the revolver only seems to work when they point it at their VC guards . Believe me there comes a time when coincidence gives way to unlikely farce There are some plus points to the movie such as the acting and seeing a movie where De Niro and Walken rising above material to put in truly great performances makes me very nostalgic . There's also a lot of little interesting stories surrounding the making of the film ( See the trivia page on the left ) but THE DEER HUNTER is very far from being a great movie far less being "" The best Vietnam war movie "" .

6.0,"Devastating at the time, uneven and problematic now","I hadn't seen this movie since it came out 43 years ago, at which point it seemed overwhelming--not perfect, just overwhelming in its scope and intensity. Of course, I was only 17 then, most of the actors were very new to audiences, and much of the content seemed groundbreaking as well as shocking. Seeing it all this time later, inevitably the credibility of the leads as ""ordinary steeltown folk"" would be a bit overshadowed by their familiarity from subsequent decades of stardom. Plus we've had lots of films about the Vietnam War since, and of course the violence is no longer very shocking.But ""The Deer Hunter"" has other problems now--problems it always had, I guess, but which weren't so apparent at the time. The screenplay has scope, yes, but the storytelling just kind of lurches from one incident to another with little connective thread, transitional material or real character development, and the dialogue often sounds improvised, as in kinda-feeble. (Cimino is on the record as saying he told Streep she could improvise dialogue, because in the script her character was basically a complete blank.) There are huge setpieces yet almost no transitions between them,The whole ""Russian Roulette"" thing is problematic not just because it's a gross distortion historically, but because even as a fictive leap of the imagination, it fails-first it's just part of the movie's one-note portrayal of the Viet Cong as monsters, then it's a ludicrous underground civilian pastime that one character even more ludicrously makes his ""living"" at. (Really? That would go on for months? Years? How long can anyone's luck hold out?) The hunting sequences meant to lend some mythic dimension here are just heavy-handed and absurdly action-packed; did no one tell Cimino that 99% of such hunting is patient waiting? The scenes meant to be ""everyday life""--notably that long, busy wedding party--are so overstuffed with forced joie de vivre and actorish ""business,"" they now feel more mannered than ""natural."" (And yes, that definitely applies to the always-controversial ""God Bless America,"" which the movie no longer has enough emotional potency to pass off as cathartic rather than a dramatic limb that shouldn't have been gone out on. I'm not a big fan of John Williams' often syrupy score, either--this film needs something edgier.) It's a bit sad that this is John Cazale's last movie, because his typical problem-causing-weakling character is almost completely extraneous here--he only gets in the way, to a degree where one wonders why any of other figures tolerate him.It's an alternately pretentious and broad movie that nonetheless is visually very well-crafted and has some powerful scenes. It's a pity this director didn't have a slower rise to the top, because winning Best Picture etc. Clearly made him oblivious to his shortcomings (mostly in the realm of storytelling), which became catastrophically clear when he was given free rein with ""Heaven's Gate."" If that movie seems to have been considerably underrated, ""The Deer Hunter"" now looks greatly overrated. They're both impressively scaled, problematic, great-looking, mixed-bag films by a talented director who needed to be kept on a much shorter leash to maximize his strengths and minimize his self-indulgences, and who proved his own worst enemy in recovering from such a drastic reversal of fortunes.""The Deer Hunter"" remains an interesting film, very effective in individual elements if awfully disjointed as a whole. But it certainly would look a lot better now if it hadn't been greeted as a ""masterpiece"" in the first place. It can no longer live up to a reputation it may never have deserved, but which made sense in the cultural moment of its initial release. What impresses now is film's messy ambitiousness, not so much what it actually achieves.

7.0,Uneven but often very impressive,"Considering the cast, the critical acclaim and accolades 'The Deer Hunter' garnered, and still does garner, part of me was expecting much more. It is a long way from a bad film, in fact it's good and often very impressive, but it's also uneven in places.'The Deer Hunter' is by some way director Michael Cimino's best film, and it contains his best ever directing. That's saying a good deal, considering that only a few years later he would go on to direct the notorious flop 'Heaven's Gate' and his career never really recovered. 'The Deer Hunter' is considered by some one of the finest Vietnam films (don't quite agree, to me there are far better examples), but it is also perhaps the most controversial. Either viewpoint is very easy to understand.Despite its many impressive, outstanding even, elements, 'The Deer Hunter' is uneven. It is a bit too long (and no before anybody sneers, there have been films of similar length and even longer that still manage to be great films, a few among the best ever made), and would have been solved by tighter editing and a little less time on the lengthy wedding sequence, which is compelling with some strong character development but could easily have been trimmed.Parts are disjointed too, with some abrupt scene shifts and a heavy-handed patriotic ending that felt incredibly tacky against the rest of the film. There are deficiencies in the sound quality on top of all this.On the other hand, editing aside, 'The Deer Hunter' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography is quite magnificent and the attention to detail in the settings and the rest of the production both sumptuous and rich in atmosphere, the authenticity also remarkable. The music haunts the mind and is very beautiful, the mournful guitar theme unforgettable.Cimino is at his best in the director's chair, while the script provokes thought and the story is often incredibly powerful and moving. The highlight is the justly acclaimed Russian Roulette sequence, which today is genuinely harrowing and will stay with you forever.Robert De Niro has seldom been more restrained and gives an affecting performance. Even better is Christopher Walken, who has never reduced me to tears before and he really wrenches the heart here, making his character a compellingly real one and the most relatable one. John Savage, John Cazale (in his last film before his ultimely death) and a young Meryl Streep are sterling in support.In summary, uneven film but often very impressive with much to admire. 7/10 Bethany Cox",uneven but often very impressive,considering cast critical acclaim accolades deer hunter garnered still does garner part me was expecting much more it is long way bad film fact its good often very impressive but its also uneven places deer hunter is by some way director michael ciminos best film it contains his best ever directing thats saying good deal considering that only few years later he would go direct notorious flop heavens gate his career never really recovered deer hunter is considered by some one finest vietnam films dont quite agree me there are far better examples but it is also perhaps most controversial either viewpoint is very easy understand despite its many impressive outstanding even elements deer hunter is uneven it is bit too long no before anybody sneers there have been films similar length even longer that still manage be great films few among best ever made would have been solved by tighter editing little less time lengthy wedding sequence which is compelling with some strong character development but could easily have been trimmed parts are disjointed too with some abrupt scene shifts heavy handed patriotic ending that felt incredibly tacky against rest film there are deficiencies sound quality top all this other hand editing aside deer hunter is exceptionally well made film cinematography is quite magnificent attention detail settings rest production both sumptuous rich atmosphere authenticity also remarkable music haunts mind is very beautiful mournful guitar theme unforgettable cimino is at his best directors chair while script provokes thought story is often incredibly powerful moving highlight is justly acclaimed russian roulette sequence which today is genuinely harrowing will stay with you forever robert de niro has seldom been more restrained gives affecting performance even better is christopher walken who has never reduced me tears before he really wrenches heart here making his character compellingly real one most relatable one john savage john cazale his last film before his ultimely death young meryl streep are sterling support summary uneven film but often very impressive with much admire 7 10 bethany cox,0.5534946236559142,0.3478629032258065,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.29}"
