1.0,The Holy Grail of bad movies,"This is it, folks: the worst movie ever made.I know, I know, there are many who argue that ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" are worse ""films"" than this one. Well, I'd advise those people to give ""Troll 2"" another viewing, this time with an open mind. As something of a self-made authority on the worst of the worst in modern cinematic torture, I feel qualified to make the bold assertion that ""Troll 2"" is the cream of that particular crop.From its laugh-inducing soundtrack (apparently recorded using only a vintage 1980s Casio keyboard) to its unilaterally awful acting, ""Troll 2"" is a life-changing experience, similar to the Middle Ages' trials by fire. If you succeed at ingesting this festering piece of cinematic detritus in one sitting, you will emerge a new person, like a phoenix rising from its own ashes. The watching itself may be painful, but it is ultimately worth the pain to be able to say, with conviction, ""I survived 'Troll 2,' and I'm still technically alive.""The special effects in this movie are, indeed, special -- like a one-legged blind woman with Alzheimer's. Trivia: one of the various Emmanuelles from the infamous ""Emmanuelle"" series of soft-core porno movies designed this movie's pitiful costumes. That should give you some indication of their quality.The acting -- my God, where do I start? Suffice it to say that, if you set any cast member on fire, I would lay down even money that he or she would have a hard time convincing onlookers that it hurt. They're really that bad. More trivia: One of Elliot's ""boys"" in this movie would later go on to reprise his role (Disposable Character in Bad Movie) in the Lou Diamond Phillips classic ""Bats."" Even more trivia: The father in this movie was a local dentist, and most of the extras were bona fide Utah residents, as well. Talk about low-budget.Back to the soundtrack -- There's not a single scene in the movie where the music is appropriate to the on-screen action. I get the impression that the ""composer"" employed for this stinker was, in fact, a failed auditioner for Def Leppard's still-vacant keytarist position. Seriously, it's rare, even in straight-to-video dogs like this one, to hear music of this woeful caliber.What more can I say that hasn't already been set forth in previous reviews? This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and that's saying something. It's physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting to watch this film -- I recommend doing it alone, at least the first time you see it...that way, you can concentrate on its truly majestic badness -- and on feeling your brain cells die off, one by one, until you are no longer able to speak.Good luck to you, if you decide to watch this one. It doesn't get any worse than ""Troll 2.""ADDENDUM (October 2007): This is still the worst movie of all time. Its status as such will never change. ""Troll 2"" is simply the perfect storm of bad writing, casting, direction, cinematography, costuming, score, makeup, effects, acting, editing, and inspiration.UPDATE (June 2010): I just watched it again. Alone. In one sitting. God help me, some component of my brain must be fundamentally defective.POSTSCRIPT (September 2013): This film continues to alter the life of each man, woman, and child with the good fortune/taste to bathe in its glory. I could not recommend it more strongly.CODA (February 2021): This magnum opus infests my soul still. Daily, I am haunted by its indelible essence. I will never escape.",holy grail bad movies,this is it folks worst movie ever made i know i know there are many who argue that plan 9 outer space manos hands fate are worse films than this one well id advise those people give troll 2 another viewing this time with open mind as something self made authority worst worst modern cinematic torture i feel qualified make bold assertion that troll 2 is cream that particular crop its laugh inducing soundtrack apparently recorded using only vintage 1980s casio keyboard its unilaterally awful acting troll 2 is life changing experience similar middle ages trials by fire if you succeed at ingesting this festering piece cinematic detritus one sitting you will emerge new person like phoenix rising its own ashes watching itself may be painful but it is ultimately worth pain be able say with conviction i survived troll 2 im still technically alive special effects this movie are indeed special like one legged blind woman with alzheimers trivia one various emmanuelles infamous emmanuelle series soft core porno movies designed this movies pitiful costumes that should give you some indication their quality acting my god where do i start suffice it say that if you set any cast member fire i would lay down even money that he or she would have hard time convincing onlookers that it hurt theyre really that bad more trivia one elliots boys this movie would later go reprise his role disposable character bad movie lou diamond phillips classic bats even more trivia father this movie was local dentist most extras were bona fide utah residents as well talk about low budget back soundtrack theres not single scene movie where music is appropriate screen action i get impression that composer employed this stinker was fact failed auditioner def leppards still vacant keytarist position seriously its rare even straight video dogs like this one hear music this woeful caliber what more can i say that hasnt already been set forth previous reviews this is worst movie i have ever seen thats saying something its physically mentally emotionally exhausting watch this film i recommend doing it alone at least first time you see it that way you can concentrate its truly majestic badness feeling your brain cells die off one by one until you are no longer able speak good luck you if you decide watch this one it doesnt get any worse than troll 2 addendum october 2007 this is still worst movie all time its status as such will never change troll 2 is simply perfect storm bad writing casting direction cinematography costuming score makeup effects acting editing inspiration update june 2010 i just watched it again alone one sitting god help me some component my brain must be fundamentally defective postscript september 2013 this film continues alter life each man woman child with good fortune taste bathe its glory i could not recommend it more strongly coda february 2021 this magnum opus infests my soul still daily i am haunted by its indelible essence i will never escape,0.4916745735238887,-0.029600802546008005,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,The Best bad movie EVER! Zero Stars out of 5,"This here is a treasure for bad movie buffs like myself. Absolutely unbelievable.Perhaps my favorite scene is when the family is greeted by complete strangers holding a welcome party in the FAMILY's house. Well... their temporary house that they, uh... well, you'd have to see the movie. Anyways, they are in the house and some old lady is playing country music on the piano. Everyone goes ""La la laaa la la la la la la laaaa"" and there is this fantastic breathtaking shot of a person carrying a cake towards the family. Well maybe my real favorite scene is where little Joshua is snooping during a town meeting. They are all discussing the evils of meat, sausages, and clusters of hemorrhoids.I have never seen a more delightful piece of absolute trash in my entire life. Everything here couldn't be more laugh inducing. It's made on such a technically inept level it's unimaginable. Some of the most memorable (not in a good way) lines of dialog are presented here:""Joshua is not a little s***, he's just very sensitive."" ""If my father discovers you here, he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them.""For a film that's titled ""Troll 2"" didn't it seem kind of strange that there were goblins and no trolls in the film? And don't let this fool you into thinking the original Troll film is terrible. It hasn't anything to do with that film.Yes, my friends, if you want bad film-making, look no farther!""Eggs!

1.0,Forced to watch!,"My sister made me watch this. She insisted it was a contagion, a disease she was compelled to spread. After seeing it, I truly understand, relate, and recommend. It's awful!

But fun - you want to see it over and over again, and force other people to watch it too.

1.0,"Do I give it a ""1"" because it was so bad, or a ""10"" because it was so good?","You often hear of movies that are so bad that they're good. It's hard to point to a single movie that is like this though. What some may say is ""so good it's bad"" may come off to others as just plain bad. However, everyone I have talked to who has seen this movie has agreed: Troll 2 is so horribly, shamelessly bad, that it is good.The writing for film is more than awkward (take the redundant ""Stonehenge Magic Stone""), and the character dialogue sounds so incredibly unnatural they might as well be robots. The reason for this is because the man who wrote the script and directed it, Claudio Fragasso, is a native speaker of Italian. He wrote the script in English when English was (barely) his second language. The acting is absolutely terrible, but who can blame them? This was most likely the first (and last) film any of these actors have been in.The costumes and special effects have that wonderful B-movie quality to them. While there are many blaringly obvious errors, I find that the smaller ones are actually funnier. Actors shaking when time is supposed to be ""frozen,"" or flies on their face during the climatic scenes. There are so many continuity mistakes that I sometimes found myself wondering if the director was putting them in on purpose. It was like every time the camera shot changed, the crew completely forgot how the previous shot was set up, and had the actors give their best guess on where they're supposed to be.I think everyone needs to see at least a few horrible movies in their lifetime. Troll 2 is entertaining and hilarious, especially when watched with friends. The plot is ludicrous, but at least you never know what's going to happen next. Many scenes seem completely unnecessary, and this film simply does not bother to justify any of the things that happen in it. The end result is a horror B-movie that ends up being so horrible that you can't help but laugh. The only question I find myself asking now is do I give it a ""1"" because it was so bad, or a ""10"" because it was so good?",do i give it 1 because it was so bad or 10 because it was so good,you often hear movies that are so bad that theyre good its hard point single movie that is like this though what some may say is so good its bad may come off others as just plain bad however everyone i have talked who has seen this movie has agreed troll 2 is so horribly shamelessly bad that it is good writing film is more than awkward take redundant stonehenge magic stone character dialogue sounds so incredibly unnatural they might as well be robots reason this is because man who wrote script directed it claudio fragasso is native speaker italian he wrote script english when english was barely his second language acting is absolutely terrible but who can blame them this was most likely first last film any these actors have been costumes special effects have that wonderful b movie quality them while there are many blaringly obvious errors i find that smaller ones are actually funnier actors shaking when time is supposed be frozen or flies their face during climatic scenes there are so many continuity mistakes that i sometimes found myself wondering if director was putting them purpose it was like every time camera shot changed crew completely forgot how previous shot was set up had actors give their best guess where theyre supposed be i think everyone needs see at least few horrible movies their lifetime troll 2 is entertaining hilarious especially when watched with friends plot is ludicrous but at least you never know whats going happen next many scenes seem completely unnecessary this film simply does not bother justify any things that happen it end result is horror b movie that ends up being so horrible that you cant help but laugh only question i find myself asking now is do i give it 1 because it was so bad or 10 because it was so good,0.521969696969697,0.009329004329004334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,"""There is no hospital in Nilbog"" but there is a looney bin","I collect crappy horror films, particularly the ""creature flicks"" and I have to confess that Troll 2 is my run-away all-time favorite. This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities, none. Had the acting, story, effects, dialogue, any one of those not been as awful as they are in this film then Troll 2 simply would not be the same. It would have been forgotten long ago and not held as the utter piece of crap that it is. First, there is absolutely no connect with the first Troll movie. This is probably a good thing since the first movie wasn't even funny in an awful way, just horribly lame. There is not a single troll in Troll 2 anyway, since they're all ""goblins."" The premise entails a family (Mom, Dad, Joshua, Holly) in some sort of ""exchange program"" which puts them in a town called Nilbog (get it?). It turns out that the town is really goblins who try to feed humans neon green slop that turns them into part-vegetables. The goblins then eat them. The family is evidently comfortable eating food like corn-on-the-cob with neon green stuff on top and cakes with ""eat up"" written in green ""icing,"" except for Joshua who suspects trouble by virtue of the fact that the boy is in communion with his dead grandfather, a man who conveniently knows all about the goblins and how to conquer them. As if this premise weren't enough, the acting is horrible. Holly has a boyfriend who comes along and drags three of his own friends who each suffer a gruesome fate (turned into a tree, drowned in popcorn, etc). These dorks couldn't score with Nilbog girls if they paid them, but since there's a weird homo erotic feel to their interactions, it probably wouldn't come to that. Holly's BAD at delivering her lines - it reminds me of second grade and how we'd read the parts of a play out loud in class. It sounds prepackaged and faked, like reading off a teleprompter. The Mom is equally awful and has really strange bug eyes. You half expect her to turn into a goblin. Apparently ""row, row, row your boat"" is her favorite song and she makes her family sing it. Joshua looks like he's in constant pain and every whine of his makes you grit your teeth and beg for a chainsaw (Creedence has one!). Although far from being good, the Dad here delivers the best performance, but maybe that's because he reminded me of Craig T. Nelson, who can actually act. As far as costumes, they went crazy with the green dye. It's everywhere. There are only three goblin mask molds that they use on different midget or kid actors so that the goblins look inbred. There's a closeup where we see a goblin's mouth and the fakeness of the mask is revealed. The music is a keyboard synthesizer. The strangest thing about this movie may be the continual string of non-sequiturs. We see ""Nilbog milk"" but we never find out why it's there or what it's supposed to do (It presumably doesn't aid in the vegetable-morph process). We never learn about grandpa's powers, why he's unable to stop the family from eating bad food yet is able to hack a goblin with an axe through a mirror later and produce a Molotov cocktail to hurl at the Nilbog preacher. Why turn Arnold into a tree? Who was that girl randomly running through the forest and why doesn't Arnold seem surprised to see goblins? Just who is Creedence and what does her family being ""from Stonehenge"" have to do with anything? How does ""the power of goodness"" vanquish the goblins? I have to conclude that there's a satirical undercurrent to this film because it's just that random. This film is obviously a local product from somewhere in Utah. It changes your perception of that state. According to the cover, this movie is just over an hour and a half but I swear it feels like a three hour movie. I recommend watching Troll 2 if you like funny bad movies, but it's best watched with friends and intoxicating substances. ""They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me!

,Another reason to dislike vegetarianism,"Exactly what is that makes Troll 2 so bad? Could it be the atrocious acting? The cringeworthy dialogue? The costumes that look as though they came from the Halloween section at K-Mart? The bizarre yet unintentional homosexual subtext? The unexplained disappearance of certain characters? The fact that the monsters who terrorize the heroes in this movie are referred to as goblins not trolls? I could go on and on...I never saw the first Troll movie, but I'm told that you don't need to see it as the two films are connected in name only. Troll 2 is a rather simple story about the suburban Waits family who decide to exchange houses with a farm family in the town of Nilbog (I'm sure everyone knows the genius behind this name by now). How or why they made such an arrangement is, of course, not explained, as are many other things to come later this film. This also coincides with the youngest son, Joshua's, late-night talks with his deceased Grandpa, who tells him stories about goblins that seek to turn humans into plants and eat them. Once they arrive in Nilbog, Grandpa Seth continuously warns Joshua that the town is inhabited by those very same goblins and he must stop his family from eating anything the Nilbogians offer them. Yes, this really is the plot.Troll 2 was made by Italians with a limited knowledge of English. And it shows with every line of nonsense the characters spout. According to Italian logic, a kick to the groin can make you homosexual, it's healthy to completely forget about your loved ones once they pass on, ghosts can suffer from a bad sense of direction, tightening your belt can ease starvation, and the only song most people know or like is ""Row Row Row Your Boat."" Also, corn is apparently an aphrodisiac. I won't go in to the ridiculousness of the actual quotes; you can see most of them on this page.The nonsensical dialogue is naturally accompanied by nonsensical behavior. A man running from the goblins (culminating in the legendary ""They're eating her and then they're gonna eat me"" scene) seeks refuge in the creepiest house he can find. Joshua stops his family from eating poisoned food by peeing on it and throwing Molotov cocktails at them. Teenage boys have no qualms about sleeping together half-naked. The citizens of Nilbog don't even try not to act suspicious yet no one ever questions their motives. Everyone is perfectly willing to consume spoiled milk and food covered in green slime without a second thought. The characters were so unbelievably stupid and blind that I often wondered why Joshua didn't just throw in the towel and let the Nilbogians eat his idiot family.Well, you have bad dialogue and behavior that defies explanation. What's the next logical step? Get bad actors, of course! The actors in this film have admitted to how inexperienced they were and once again, it shows. The standouts in bad acting would have to be Mama Waits and sister Holly. The mother's bug-eyed expressions and flat line delivery makes her seem cold and distant and the actress portraying Holly wouldn't have gotten a part in one of my high school plays. On the other end of the spectrum you have the preacher, the shop owner, and of course, the deliciously hammy Creedence. These three, while by no means good actors, at least appear to be putting some effort into their performances. Creedence nearly steals every scene she's in, not that that's a difficult accomplishment. I wonder if she had fun making this movie because it sure looks like it.I could go on about more of the negatives of this film: the cheap goblin costumes, the bargain basement special effects (the recycled lightning bolt being the most glaring one), the cheap and out-of-place music score, the ridiculous plot developments (the goblins are repelled by a bologna sandwich, Grandpa Seth does more dead than most people do alive, the contradictory twist ending), but it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. That and I only have 1000 words.Overall, Troll 2 is one of the funnest, most inept horror films you'll ever see; so much so, that I'm sure somewhere the spirit of Ed Wood is looking down upon it and smiling. Maybe he can freeze time like Grandpa Seth so we can appreciate it that much longer.",another reason dislike vegetarianism,exactly what is that makes troll 2 so bad could it be atrocious acting cringeworthy dialogue costumes that look as though they came halloween section at k mart bizarre yet unintentional homosexual subtext unexplained disappearance certain characters fact that monsters who terrorize heroes this movie are referred as goblins not trolls i could go i never saw first troll movie but im told that you dont need see it as two films are connected name only troll 2 is rather simple story about suburban waits family who decide exchange houses with farm family town nilbog im sure everyone knows genius behind this name by now how or why they made such arrangement is course not explained as are many other things come later this film this also coincides with youngest son joshuas late night talks with his deceased grandpa who tells him stories about goblins that seek turn humans into plants eat them once they arrive nilbog grandpa seth continuously warns joshua that town is inhabited by those very same goblins he must stop his family eating anything nilbogians offer them yes this really is plot troll 2 was made by italians with limited knowledge english it shows with every line nonsense characters spout according italian logic kick groin can make you homosexual its healthy completely forget about your loved ones once they pass ghosts can suffer bad sense direction tightening your belt can ease starvation only song most people know or like is row row row your boat also corn is apparently aphrodisiac i wont go ridiculousness actual quotes you can see most them this page nonsensical dialogue is naturally accompanied by nonsensical behavior man running goblins culminating legendary theyre eating her then theyre gonna eat me scene seeks refuge creepiest house he can find joshua stops his family eating poisoned food by peeing it throwing molotov cocktails at them teenage boys have no qualms about sleeping together half naked citizens nilbog dont even try not act suspicious yet no one ever questions their motives everyone is perfectly willing consume spoiled milk food covered green slime without second thought characters were so unbelievably stupid blind that i often wondered why joshua didnt just throw towel let nilbogians eat his idiot family well you have bad dialogue behavior that defies explanation whats next logical step get bad actors course actors this film have admitted how inexperienced they were once again it shows standouts bad acting would have be mama waits sister holly mothers bug eyed expressions flat line delivery makes her seem cold distant actress portraying holly wouldnt have gotten part one my high school plays other end spectrum you have preacher shop owner course deliciously hammy creedence these three while by no means good actors at least appear be putting some effort into their performances creedence nearly steals every scene shes not that thats difficult accomplishment i wonder if she had fun making this movie because it sure looks like it i could go about more negatives this film cheap goblin costumes bargain basement special effects recycled lightning bolt being most glaring one cheap out place music score ridiculous plot developments goblins are repelled by bologna sandwich grandpa seth does more dead than most people do alive contradictory twist ending but it would be like shooting fish barrel that i only have 1000 words overall troll 2 is one funnest most inept horror films youll ever see so much so that im sure somewhere spirit ed wood is looking down upon it smiling maybe he can freeze time like grandpa seth so we can appreciate it that much longer,0.4775431987140848,0.04594233473980312,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.37}"

4.0,Sure its bad but worst ever? nah,"Yes, the acting is bad, the costumes are cheap and the music is laughable. But worst movie of all time? definitely not. I don't have the energy to dissect the film scene by scene nor would anyone want that, but I actually did enjoy certain aspects of the film, what I enjoyed was its 'campy' improvised feel, and how it always manages to avoid cliché, and that even in the most unconventional ways. The film has the creators stamp all over it and when he encounters a snag or hiccup in the plot, be damned to those who disagree with how one should deal it, he plows through it and comes up with his own completely unique solution no matter how illogical it may be. This is film this is make believe, I don't care if it makes sense it is actually refreshing to see a little bit of 'weird' now and then. That is not to say that I wholly enjoyed the film, I found it to drag on and several times let myself be distracted by other things while the film played, it is no great film even in its badness, it is bad for sure, but there were more than a few entertaining moments.

1.0,"If this movie passes for a horror flick, then so does Bambi","YIKES! I have not seen this movie recently, but I remember wanting to see it when I was very young, right when it had just came out.

The movie progresses at an equally bad rate: A family comes to a town called Nilbog, and not a single one of them notices that Nilbog spelled backwards is Goblin, which makes no sense, because the title of the movie is, I believe, TROLL 2, not Goblin 2. Of course, the lead character, a small boy, happens to glance into a rear view mirror on his parents car, and see's that Nilbog backwards spells Goblin. Only one problem: Nilbog reflected in a rear view mirror spells qodliN, not gobliN. WHOOPS! Then there's this stupid chase scene through a forest, where Goblins keep on popping up from nowhere, and urging people to run towards them.

1.0,"Awful, but funniest thing ever.","Imagine....some really bored media students who have rented a motor-home and have loads of popcorn to be used. Then imagine a film where those are the most expensive things in it. This is that film. Troll 2 - yet has no troll. Just goblins. But hey. The first time I saw this, I wished I had been wearing a nappy or sitting on a very big sponge, it is that funny. Personally, I could not get up from rolling around on the floor, nor the people I was with, although they had it worse, as they kept falling off the bed. Unfortunately, it is funny without meaning to be, simply because it is that bad. It seems to just have people dragged in from the street in the leading roles, which could well be true. Maybe somebody was very drunk when they decided to make this film. Or when they made it. Or when they went ahead with all the stages of production. Just possibly. Anyway, it is hilarious. I got my DVD copy for £2. That says it all really I would say. Watch this film if you want to see: neon-coloured food, children in masks and dressed in sacks charging around a forest set to a dodgy 1990-theme, awful make up, worse acting, even worse dialogue, the funniest yokels ever (including Sheriff Freak - 'nuff said) and the mightiest weapon ever seen in any film ever.

1.0,"A more fitting tagline might have been ""What the hell was that?""","Oh, my God, where do I even begin with this film that hasn't already been said? Troll 2 is so famous that I think it can't be considered a cult film any more as it's gone more mainstream. Again, how I never saw this film until last night I don't know. I've heard so much about these Troll movies that it's just crazy how a film so bad has such a huge reputation. The Room by Tommy Wiseau has recently taken over the ""king of good bad movies"" crown but I had to see who was the former king and Troll 2 often came up in the conversation. Now of course due to YouTube the most famous scene being the ""They're eating her and then they're going to eat me! Oh, my Goooooood!"" has been uploaded too many times to count. But this film is so much more than that: horrifically bad acting, awful special effects, a weird ""plot"", bad writing and just craziness ensues.Joshua Waits is being contacted by his dead Grandpa Seth. Seth informs Joshua of evil creatures known as goblins roaming the world who force or trick humans into consuming poisoned food which will turn them into the goblin's favorite type of food, vegetables. The goblins would then eat them.Meanwhile Joshua's sister, Holly, receives a visit from her boyfriend Elliot. She accuses him of spending too much time with his friends. Since she and the rest of the family are going to Nilbog for a holiday, he offers to meet her on the way. She agrees but under the condition that he will come alone without his friends. However, Elliot does not turn up at their meeting point and Holly's parents, Michael and Diane, go on without him. They meet him further up the route but she angrily dismisses him since he is accompanied by his friends. A meal has been prepared at the house where they are staying, but Joshua's grandfather shows up again and freezes time for thirty seconds, giving Joshua a chance to stand up on the table and urinate on the food, and thus prevent his family from eating. Meanwhile one of Elliot's friends, Arnold, goes out for a walk and meets a woman being pursued by the goblins. Running away, they enter the house of the goblins' druid leader, Creedence, who uses the ""Stonehenge Magic Stone"" to give the goblins power. Creedence dupes the two into drinking a magic potion which causes the woman to disintegrate into a puddle of vegetable matter which is then eaten by the goblins, and now we know why everyone in the town is so eager to make the family eat their food, even though they're not so subtle about it.Between the ""you can't p*** on hospitality"" scene to the corn on the cob seduction scene, this movie is unbelievable. I don't know who was the worst actor in here but I'd say the leading contender is Deborah Reed who plays Creedence, the leader bad troll, I guess it was one of those ""non acting"" days. She was beyond over the top making you wonder what she was inhaling before each shoot. I love how the dead grandpa is talking to his young grandson, why wouldn't he just haunt one of the adults so maybe someone who doesn't sound like they have a wild imagination talk some sense into this family who is going to ""Nilborg"" mmph! Sorry, I'm still recovering from this movie, why the family would take vacation to this weird town is beyond me and how they didn't drive away with those ""subtle"" trolls in disguise as humans who keep telling them to eat, I mean just wow! Not to mention that they say they're vegetarian trolls, yet are turning human meat into vegetables, I mean, any vegan opinions? Bologna is their ultimate enemy and is by far the weirdest way to defeat an evil monster. I would say this movie is definitely a miracle, how it was created, who knows? Any of the actors or writers realize how bad this was while shooting it? I suppose I should see the documentary ""Best Worst Movie"" in order to find out, but the question is even if I want to see it? I still need to recover from Troll 2, all I can say is that after I finished watching this movie I finally snapped out of my mind set to see that I had been robbed and was sitting on the floor and the robber left a note saying how he felt bad for me that I was watching Troll 2 and that I would have no meaning for life any more after viewing it.1/10",more fitting tagline might have been what hell was that,oh my god where do i even begin with this film that hasnt already been said troll 2 is so famous that i think it cant be considered cult film any more as its gone more mainstream again how i never saw this film until last night i dont know ive heard so much about these troll movies that its just crazy how film so bad has such huge reputation room by tommy wiseau has recently taken over king good bad movies crown but i had see who was former king troll 2 often came up conversation now course due youtube most famous scene being theyre eating her then theyre going eat me oh my goooooood has been uploaded too many times count but this film is so much more than that horrifically bad acting awful special effects weird plot bad writing just craziness ensues joshua waits is being contacted by his dead grandpa seth seth informs joshua evil creatures known as goblins roaming world who force or trick humans into consuming poisoned food which will turn them into goblins favorite type food vegetables goblins would then eat them meanwhile joshuas sister holly receives visit her boyfriend elliot she accuses him spending too much time with his friends since she rest family are going nilbog holiday he offers meet her way she agrees but under condition that he will come alone without his friends however elliot does not turn up at their meeting point hollys parents michael diane go without him they meet him further up route but she angrily dismisses him since he is accompanied by his friends meal has been prepared at house where they are staying but joshuas grandfather shows up again freezes time thirty seconds giving joshua chance stand up table urinate food thus prevent his family eating meanwhile one elliots friends arnold goes out walk meets woman being pursued by goblins running away they enter house goblins druid leader creedence who uses stonehenge magic stone give goblins power creedence dupes two into drinking magic potion which causes woman disintegrate into puddle vegetable matter which is then eaten by goblins now we know why everyone town is so eager make family eat their food even though theyre not so subtle about it between you cant p hospitality scene corn cob seduction scene this movie is unbelievable i dont know who was worst actor here but id say leading contender is deborah reed who plays creedence leader bad troll i guess it was one those non acting days she was beyond over top making you wonder what she was inhaling before each shoot i love how dead grandpa is talking his young grandson why wouldnt he just haunt one adults so maybe someone who doesnt sound like they have wild imagination talk some sense into this family who is going nilborg mmph sorry im still recovering this movie why family would take vacation this weird town is beyond me how they didnt drive away with those subtle trolls disguise as humans who keep telling them eat i mean just wow not mention that they say theyre vegetarian trolls yet are turning human meat into vegetables i mean any vegan opinions bologna is their ultimate enemy is by far weirdest way defeat evil monster i would say this movie is definitely miracle how it was created who knows any actors or writers realize how bad this was while shooting it i suppose i should see documentary best worst movie order find out but question is even if i want see it i still need recover troll 2 all i can say is that after i finished watching this movie i finally snapped out my mind set see that i had been robbed was sitting floor robber left note saying how he felt bad me that i was watching troll 2 that i would have no meaning life any more after viewing it 1 10,0.6016117216117215,-0.05091575091575089,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"

When the Waits family swaps house with a family from Nilbog in the countryside to spend vacation, everybody is excited but Joshua since Grandpa has warned him that the place is evil. Joshua travels to Nilbog with his father Michael (George Hardy), his mother and his sister Holly (Connie Young) that invites her boyfriend Elliott Cooper (Jason Wright) to meet her and he also travels with his three best friends to Nilbog. Joshua discovers that the Nilbog is goblin written backwards and the place is the kingdom of evil goblins that want to eat them. But his family does not believe in his words.""Troll 2"" is one of the worst movies I have ever watched; but also one of the funniest. On 31 July 2003, I became curious with the reviews of this movie and I decided to check whether it could be so bad; actually it is worse. The horrible and ham actors and actresses and the amateurish direction, screenplay, dialogs, effects and make-up are lame.

1.0,I bet it was a goblin in disguise!,"I would like to begin my review by saying that watching this movie will be like taking a hot fork and shoving it in your eye socket for some people, whereas for others it will be the funniest F'n thing you've ever seen.Before I get into the meat of the story or as I like to call it a double decker bologna sandwichTroll 2 has nothing to do with trolls (just goblins), Troll 2 also has absolutely nothing to do with Troll 1. AHA but that's not all!!!! The guy who made the cover for Troll 2 didn't see Troll 1 or Troll 2!!!! The original cover of Troll 2 has a werewolf (Not in Troll 1 or Troll 2) chasing a little boy who doesn't even appear in either of the Troll movies! If that doesn't make you want to take your head and smash it against concrete, I don't know what does.I will now begin with the double decker bologna sandwich part of my analysis. The film begins with Grandpa Seth talking to his grandson Joshua. Joshua is constipated throughout the film and grandpa is dead. You know the kind of dead where you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you give your 12 year old grandson a Molotov cocktail and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come backthat kind of dead. He tells that old story of how Peter Pan ran through the woods one day, ate green goup, and turned into a MLANT. The mother, played by Margo Prey (AKA greatest actress ever) assures Joshua that it was just a dream and goes onto explain that Grandpa's death was, ""Very difficult for your father, for Holly, and for me his daughter."" You may want to give that quote a second reading The daughter is also brilliant in this picture. The chemistry between her and her boyfriend Elliott is sizzling!!! Ouch very hot! So sizzling that Elliott and his friends couldn't be more gay! Holly explains, ""You take them to bed with you too (referring to Elliott's guy friends that are hanging out the window) and I don't believe in group sex"". What??? Holly then explains that her parents don't like Elliott (that he is a good for nothing) and that they are going on vacation for a month. Ellliott then asks, ""Is it true you're going on vacation tomorrow?"" ""Yes!"" ""I'll come with you?"" ""OK I'll tell my father that you're coming with us tomorrow"" Believe me the movie keeps goingJoshua must do it he must do it! He must pee on everyone's food before they eat corn with green paste on it. Oh my god! Or how about ""You're a genius big Sister!"" Watch for the mother staring directly into the camera and yelling, ""Oh dear god what can we do!"" So they have this family exchange and they go to Nilbog and oh my god!This movie is a pure masterpiece. It's so bad it's fantastic! I recommend everyone to give it one viewing just so you can say you've survived it's stupidity. Make sure you watch it with friends thoughDO NOT watch this movie alone or you will lose your mind trying to figure out why anyone would make a movie this bad...I will leave you with this: Mother says ""Elliott what are you doing here?"" Daughter says ""Elliott is part of the family now!"" Mom puts her hand on Elliott's face, ""Oh Elliott!""",i bet it was goblin disguise,i would like begin my review by saying that watching this movie will be like taking hot fork shoving it your eye socket some people whereas others it will be funniest fn thing youve ever seen before i get into meat story or as i like call it double decker bologna sandwich troll 2 has nothing do with trolls just goblins troll 2 also has absolutely nothing do with troll 1 aha but thats not all guy who made cover troll 2 didnt see troll 1 or troll 2 original cover troll 2 has werewolf not troll 1 or troll 2 chasing little boy who doesnt even appear either troll movies if that doesnt make you want take your head smash it against concrete i dont know what does i will now begin with double decker bologna sandwich part my analysis film begins with grandpa seth talking his grandson joshua joshua is constipated throughout film grandpa is dead you know kind dead where you say you will be gone forever then you come back then you say you will be gone forever then you come back then you give your 12 year old grandson molotov cocktail then you say you will be gone forever then you come back that kind dead he tells that old story how peter pan ran through woods one day ate green goup turned into mlant mother played by margo prey aka greatest actress ever assures joshua that it was just dream goes onto explain that grandpas death was very difficult your father holly me his daughter you may want give that quote second reading daughter is also brilliant this picture chemistry between her her boyfriend elliott is sizzling ouch very hot so sizzling that elliott his friends couldnt be more gay holly explains you take them bed with you too referring elliotts guy friends that are hanging out window i dont believe group sex what holly then explains that her parents dont like elliott that he is good nothing that they are going vacation month ellliott then asks is it true youre going vacation tomorrow yes ill come with you ok ill tell my father that youre coming with us tomorrow believe me movie keeps going joshua must do it he must do it he must pee everyones food before they eat corn with green paste it oh my god or how about youre genius big sister watch mother staring directly into camera yelling oh dear god what can we do so they have this family exchange they go nilbog oh my god this movie is pure masterpiece its so bad its fantastic i recommend everyone give it one viewing just so you can say youve survived its stupidity make sure you watch it with friends though do not watch this movie alone or you will lose your mind trying figure out why anyone would make movie this bad i will leave you with this mother says elliott what are you doing here daughter says elliott is part family now mom puts her hand elliotts face oh elliott,0.545014245014245,0.0882936507936508,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"
7.0,Nilbog....Nilbog....,"And I thought comedy was dead...This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Truly. Undeniably, it is not intended to be funny. But my word, what can I say? The film opens with a man wearing a pointy hat being chased by what appears to be Yoda's inbred cousins. The pointy hat man falls and is revived by a girl with disturbing freckles. To be helpful, she offers him a bowl of green gunge. Naturally, pointy hat man drinks the green gunge without a second's thought. He then turns into a tree.This tragic story has been recounted by Grampa Seth to his irritating grandson, Joshua. It turns out Grampa Seth is a ghost who has extensive knowledge of goblins and their evil green food.Joshua and his cretinous family set off for a vacation as part of a house exchange with a family of retards who live in the town of Nilbog. Thoughtfully, the retard family have left a selection of hideous green cakes for them to eat. Unfortunately, Grampa Seth appears and hints to Joshua that having a waz on them might be a good idea.Close behind them, following in a camper van, is his sister's boyfriend and his boyfriends, I mean friends. One by one the boys encounter many terrible things. Dork #1 sees a terrified girl in the woods, to reassure her he chases her and jumps on top of her. He then meets a woman from Stone Henge, who sounds like she is from Transylvannia, who turns him into a plant. And puts him in a pot. Dork #2 meets a policeman called Sheriff Freak who drops him off in town in the middle of a group of men with moustaches. Dork #3 has a grisly encounter with popcorn.Meanwhile, the family are given a traditional Nilbog welcome by the town's residents - a great deal of clapping, chanting and more green cake. Troublemaker, Grampa Seth appears again and encourages Joshua to set fire to one of the party guests. Shortly after this the goblins appear and throw sandwiches at the house. The film soon comes to a dramatic conclusion.In many respects, this film is a disgrace. The acting is unforgettable - I am particularly surprised that the drugstore owner was not at least nominated for a best supporting Oscar. The dialogue is understated and poignant - especially where Holly punches her boyfriend in the gonads and he delivers the immortal line, 'Are you trying to turn me into a homo?'. And the music is the work of a genius of sorts, or at the very least a remedial level music student with a Casio keyboard.Nilbog....Nilbog.......",nilbog nilbog,i thought comedy was dead this is one funniest movies i have seen long time truly undeniably it is not intended be funny but my word what can i say film opens with man wearing pointy hat being chased by what appears be yodas inbred cousins pointy hat man falls is revived by girl with disturbing freckles be helpful she offers him bowl green gunge naturally pointy hat man drinks green gunge without seconds thought he then turns into tree this tragic story has been recounted by grampa seth his irritating grandson joshua it turns out grampa seth is ghost who has extensive knowledge goblins their evil green food joshua his cretinous family set off vacation as part house exchange with family retards who live town nilbog thoughtfully retard family have left selection hideous green cakes them eat unfortunately grampa seth appears hints joshua that having waz them might be good idea close behind them following camper van is his sisters boyfriend his boyfriends i mean friends one by one boys encounter many terrible things dork sees terrified girl woods reassure her he chases her jumps top her he then meets woman stone henge who sounds like she is transylvannia who turns him into plant puts him pot dork meets policeman called sheriff freak who drops him off town middle group men with moustaches dork has grisly encounter with popcorn meanwhile family are given traditional nilbog welcome by towns residents great deal clapping chanting more green cake troublemaker grampa seth appears again encourages joshua set fire one party guests shortly after this goblins appear throw sandwiches at house film soon comes dramatic conclusion many respects this film is disgrace acting is unforgettable i am particularly surprised that drugstore owner was not at least nominated best supporting oscar dialogue is understated poignant especially where holly punches her boyfriend gonads he delivers immortal line are you trying turn me into homo music is work genius sorts or at very least remedial level music student with casio keyboard nilbog nilbog,0.548655303030303,-0.04544249311294767,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,I watch this movie every day...,"Everytime I walk out of a movie theater, no matter what movie I had just seen, I always think to myself, ""this was no troll 2..."" No movie since has been made that has left such an impact on me as a serious film critic. Why is this movie so great? Unlike 99% of movies out today, Troll 2 accomplishes something most movies don't even come close to and usually fail at, it's entertaining.This movie has no relation to the original Troll and that is a good thing. The reason it was named Troll 2 is a mystery much like how Tarantino's movie, Reservior Dogs, has everyone guessing why it was named as that. Unfortunately, the director, Joe D'Amato, has taken that secret to the grave with him. The plot, every scene, every bit of dialouge, the acting, the costume and makeup, the music (especially the opening credits --classic), and every little detail of this movie captures your attention leaving you in awe from beginning to end. The movie is about a family who decides to go on a vacation in the small town of Nilbog despite protest from Joshua, the young son and hero of the movie, who was warned from his deceased grandfather about cruel deformed forest dwellers who live in Nilbog. As with most parents of the babyboomer generation, Joshua's pleads are not only ignored, but mocked and ridiculed. The family, needless to say, goes on with the planned schedule and the adventure begins.One might criticize the casting of this movie. I'd rather have ""regular people"" in this movie, (""regular people"" meaning the demeaning term used by arrogant movie star celebrities which refer to us, the people who aren't movie star celebrities), as this cast in Troll 2 has more personality than any overpaid, silicone enhanced, plastic surgery addicted, tabliod covering, tanning salon using, church of scientologist following, teen movie drama appearing, ""actor"" out there. Watching the cast is memorizing, especially how they react to the goblin threat.I could go on forever about this movie, I apologize for the rambling. Go and see this movie, find it, rent it, you will be introduced to a whole new experience you probably have never have had. Until Troll 1.5 or Troll 3, I'm going to defend Troll 2 as a true unique movie experience unlike anything else.

10.0,Hysterical-You haven't seen anything until you've seen TROLL 2!,"(Contains 1 minor spoiler (noted later in review, otherwise spoiler-free)Let's see..where do i start? This is unquestionably the funniest movie i have seen in my life. I had only heard bad things about this movie (to avoid it, etc.) but i came across the Troll/Troll 2 DVD used at a local store, and i like the first movie, so i bought it. Now don't get me wrong, i love the first movie, but Troll 2..oh man..i had no idea what i was in for until i watched it. i mean WoW, this movie is so bad, so horrible, that i just couldn't help but cry from laughter just about every 5-10 minutes. From the acting (if it can even be called that) to the 'plot', to the costumes, *Everything* about this movie is so over-the-top horrid/ridiculous, that it makes this movie one of, if not the best comedy ever made. While Troll 1, of course, is the meat & potatoes of this DVD, Troll 2, unbelievably, is the true reason to buy this DVD. It is so compellingly entertaining, is HAS to be seen to believed. Troll 2 rivals every so-bad-it's-hilariously good/entertaining movie that i've ever seen. It beats Halloween III, Link, It's Pat, Cabin boy, The good son, Sleepwalkers, and C.H.U.D. just to name a few. Don't get me wrong, i mean that in a good way, as i love the above movies, it's just that i didn't think it could get any better than those movies--and then Troll 2 happened. This movie is easily the king of cheese, and i also mean that in a good way, because regardless if it was indeed unintentional or not to make such a hilarious movie, it succeeds at what almost every current Hollywood fails at--Troll 2 is actually entertaining. And in the end, that's ultimately what matters--is that a movie is entertaining and holds the viewers' interest for the entire duration. Troll 2 does just that and much more. And it's actually extremely successful as a comedy. (WARNING: Minor spoiler ahead) If Troll 2 doesn't make you laugh throughout, just wait until you see what the little kid ends up pulling out of a carry sack (given to him by his grandfather)towards the end of the movie to be used as a 'secret weapon' to defeat the goblins. That scene has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen in *any* movie. At that point, my eyes were so full of tears from laughing, that i couldn't concentrate on the movie and so i had to momentarily pause the movie and recollect myself. In closing, to every fan of cheesy cinema out there-believe me when i tell you, this movie is rich. You haven't seen anything until you've seen TROLL 2. It's hysterical. It should be in every fan's collection. Go out and buy it now before it goes out-of-print. You'll regret it later.

I'm surprised Mystery Science Theater 3000 didn't riff this crappy in a good way sort of film for it would have been their most popular episode of all time, this movie has became a new cult sensation and even spawned a brilliant documentary called ""Best Worst Movie Ever"" which earned better reviews than this movie itself.

3.0,A rite of passage for fans of bad films.,"Written and directed by Claudio Fragrasso, a name that any self-respecting fan of bad films should be aware of, Troll 2 is a logic-free mess that features absolutely no trolls (vegetarian goblins, yes; trolls, no!), costumes by Laura Gemser (a woman who knows a lot about taking clothes off, but seemingly very little about designing them), bad 80s hair and fashion, a goblin queen by the name of Creedence Leonore Gielgud (who scrubs up rather nice and seduces a bloke with a cob of corn), lousy special effects and make-up, one of the most irritating child 'actors' of all time, and a crazy finalé that sees good triumph over evil with the help of a double-decker bologna sandwich and a rock from Stonehenge (quite what that is doing in Utah, I'll never know!).Whilst there is no doubt that Troll 2 is a technically very poor film, I'm not entirely convinced that it deserves it's current position of number 59 on the IMDb bottom 100. I've seen tons of films that I have enjoyed far less than Troll 2—films with seemingly no redeeming qualities whatsoever, the celluloid equivalent of Ketamine; at least this one provides plenty of unintentional laughs and is so utterly bizarre in places that it kept me watching to the bitter end. Surely that's gotta be worth a rating of at least a 3/10?P.S.

7.0,My sides hurt from laughing,"OK, this movie is bad. Like, really bad.Actually, it sets a standard for bad movies. My friend invited me over for a group screening of this film on a nice big projector screen. Probably one of the best moments of my life.I was side-split from the get-go. The movie opens up with a bunch of midgets wearing Halloween masks chasing some Paul Revere looking guy through the woods... to a song that sounds very similar to the theme song to Nickelodon's GUTS.After about 20 minutes in, I was taking tallies for well-delivered lines. By the end of the movie, I had no tallies on my list. Not a single one. There isn't a piece of good dialogue in this whole freakin movie. It's astonishing.I'd like to see a 'making of', especially after seeing the scene where the family battles the Goblins on their summer-vacation-home staircase. A ""goblin"" gets thrown down the stairs. Usually a movie with such a low budget will resort to using a dummy. Nope. Some midget (or a kid) got dressed up and thrown down a flight of stairs in full-costume. I've seen some nasty falls in my life... all I have to say is ""broken collar-bone?"" The ""Mom"" of the main character in this movie is by far my favorite character. She always had a surprised look on her face, which I thought at first was added for some sort of intensity for the role. I was wrong. I think she has adult ADHD or something. Though, I'm extremely grateful for all of the close-up full face shots we got of this monstrosity of a woman.The main character is a little boy. He looks like he could be Zach Ty Bryan's brother. He's by far the best actor in this whole movie. When it comes to screaming in terror and chewing on a bologna sandwich while looking straight into the camera, he's the best. ""CONCENTRATE!!!... CONCENTRATE HARDER!!!"" Another notable performance is this evil witch who's name is as obnoxious and unnecessary as her whole role in this film. This woman is cracked out to the max. She thinks she's some sort of horror-expression actor like Boris Karloff, making scary faces to the camera. What she achieves is something more like a substitute 5th grade teacher who got stuck working on Halloween (and decided to sniff rubber cement for 20 minutes straight before class started) The ""Goblins"" themselves are midgets in costumes. Or maybe kids. I hope they're midgets though, because these little guys get rocked pretty hard by the cast throughout the movie. Pushed down by a face-palm by the dad, thrown down the stairs like I mentioned earlier, getting beaten with a slab of wood, etc. I'm just worried, because this isn't the type of movie that I'd imagine took too many safety precautions on-set.By the way, I put ""Goblins"" in quotations because this movie's title is ""Troll 2""... and there isn't any mention of ""trolls"" but ""Goblins"". That itself is a failure beyond anything I've ever seen in the B-movie industry.My friend noted that there was a lot of long shots of the witches apothecary... which consisted of a bunch of coffee mugs with dry ice in them. Dry ice, being the best special effect used in this whole movie. Actually, I take that back - green jello and green food coloring was used well.The soundtrack - which I mentioned earlier premieres with the GUTS theme song, cools down to some pretty eerie synth ballads after awhile. These haunting 8 bit MIDI airs easily explode into Yamaha keyboard music after the ""Demo"" button is pushed. Lots of synth brass, it reminded me of the ""Casino Zone"" music from the hit game Sonic the Hedgehog 2.All this aside, watching this movie with some of my best friends was one of the best experiences of my life. It's one of those movies that's so bad, you're gonna need a few alcoholic beverages to make it worthwhile. I was slightly inebriated during my viewing, and it added to the experience.Troll 2 is easily the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. Not the best, not the worst... the 7 stars I'm giving this movie is exclusively for it's FUN value. Go check it out if you can find it!!! Oh, and before I go...Things I've learned from this movie: Getting hit in the groin makes you homosexual.Making another notch in your belt and tightening it curbs hunger-pains.It's common for suburban white families to fast for 2-3 days for no reason at all.Hospitality is measured in how long a large group of people can stand around somebody and chant the same song over and over again.Teenage cool-dudes from the 80s-90s will go to extreme lengths to get some hot babes.Corn-on-the-cob is a fantastic sexual aid.",my sides hurt laughing,ok this movie is bad like really bad actually it sets standard bad movies my friend invited me over group screening this film nice big projector screen probably one best moments my life i was side split get go movie opens up with bunch midgets wearing halloween masks chasing some paul revere looking guy through woods song that sounds very similar theme song nickelodons guts after about 20 minutes i was taking tallies well delivered lines by end movie i had no tallies my list not single one there isnt piece good dialogue this whole freakin movie its astonishing id like see making especially after seeing scene where family battles goblins their summer vacation home staircase goblin gets thrown down stairs usually movie with such low budget will resort using dummy nope some midget or kid got dressed up thrown down flight stairs full costume ive seen some nasty falls my life all i have say is broken collar bone mom main character this movie is by far my favorite character she always had surprised look her face which i thought at first was added some sort intensity role i was wrong i think she has adult adhd or something though im extremely grateful all close up full face shots we got this monstrosity woman main character is little boy he looks like he could be zach ty bryans brother hes by far best actor this whole movie when it comes screaming terror chewing bologna sandwich while looking straight into camera hes best concentrate concentrate harder another notable performance is this evil witch whos name is as obnoxious unnecessary as her whole role this film this woman is cracked out max she thinks shes some sort horror expression actor like boris karloff making scary faces camera what she achieves is something more like substitute 5th grade teacher who got stuck working halloween decided sniff rubber cement 20 minutes straight before class started goblins themselves are midgets costumes or maybe kids i hope theyre midgets though because these little guys get rocked pretty hard by cast throughout movie pushed down by face palm by dad thrown down stairs like i mentioned earlier getting beaten with slab wood etc im just worried because this isnt type movie that id imagine took too many safety precautions set by way i put goblins quotations because this movies title is troll 2 there isnt any mention trolls but goblins that itself is failure beyond anything ive ever seen b movie industry my friend noted that there was lot long shots witches apothecary which consisted bunch coffee mugs with dry ice them dry ice being best special effect used this whole movie actually i take that back green jello green food coloring was used well soundtrack which i mentioned earlier premieres with guts theme song cools down some pretty eerie synth ballads after awhile these haunting 8 bit midi airs easily explode into yamaha keyboard music after demo button is pushed lots synth brass it reminded me casino zone music hit game sonic hedgehog 2 all this aside watching this movie with some my best friends was one best experiences my life its one those movies thats so bad youre gonna need few alcoholic beverages make it worthwhile i was slightly inebriated during my viewing it added experience troll 2 is easily most entertaining movie ive ever seen not best not worst 7 stars im giving this movie is exclusively its fun value go check it out if you can find it oh before i go things ive learned this movie getting hit groin makes you homosexual making another notch your belt tightening it curbs hunger pains its common suburban white families fast 2 3 days no reason at all hospitality is measured how long large group people can stand around somebody chant same song over over again teenage cool dudes 80s 90s will go extreme lengths get some hot babes corn cob is fantastic sexual aid,0.5062020502645502,0.07096560846560847,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

1.0,So this is crap in motion....,"Troll 2, Quickie Review (Edited from original review) This film is rated as one of the worst movies ever made on IMDb.com, and you know what? It got that rating for a damn good reason. ***SOME SPOILERS IN THIS ONE, BUT THEY WON'T HURT THIS FILM*** The movie follows a family that, for no apparent reason, is just ""switching homes"" with some hicks in some podunk town called ""Nilbog"" for a vacation. If that concept isn't weird enough, don't worry, the movie will quickly outshine that wet spot. Well, the town is infested with--you guessed it--goblins. What's that? You guessed trolls? Ha ha, sorry sucker, this movie is titled wrong--probably just to throw you off!! In fact, as the horrible little boy in the movie suffers the line, ""Nil-bog isss Gob-lin... back-waa-ards!!"" you begin to realize this the movie has a wealth of increasing crappiness yet to vomit your way. The goblins are immensely laughable, if not downright pathetic--they're midgets (oh, I'm sorry, not-tall people) dressed in what appear to be fire-damaged carpet with masks apparently crafted by the artful hands of Helen Keller. One of them has eyes the size of golf balls--and they never blink! On top of it, the ""goblins"" are vegetarians, so of course, in order to eat the visiting humans (in case you haven't guessed, the whole town is goblin-infested, like in ""The Howling,"" but crappy), they--get ready--turn them into vegetables of some sort. The acting is gut-wrenchingly bad--the worst is the woman playing the Mom in the family, there is no atmosphere--it takes place under the terror of daylight, and well, there is but one entertaining thing in the whole movie: That classic scene where, haunted by the ghost of grandpa, the little boy pisses all over the family's dinner to prevent them from eating food that would vegetate them into Goblin-meal.

,Utterly flawless,"This IS the best movie ever made. Nothing I have experienced has displayed the degree of perfection attained by the geniuses (yes geniuses and nothing less) behind Troll II.The story-line is gripping, believable, and damn scary. The Waits family is on a month long vacation in the country town of Nilbog, as part of the family exchange program. They leave the modern conveniences of their home to ""rough it"" in Nilbog's rural setting. I'm on the edge of my seat already, but wait, there's more. Young Joshua's deceased Grampa Seth comes back from the grave to warn the family of Nilbog's dangers. The beautiful Holly Waites's boyfriend tags along with his blatantly homo-erotic chums. There's something strange about the curiously unrefrigerated ""Nilbog Milk."" Oh, and did I forget to mention that the town is full of GOBLINS?!!!The acting in this film can be summed up in one word and one word only: superfine. Every member of the Waites family was portrayed realistically and intriguingly. The chemistry between Elliot and Holly was so intense that I would be surprised to hear that there was not something going on off camera. The town matriarch has full command of the screen whenever she graces it with her presence. One actor takes the cake, however. Scene stealer Draco Floyd as the Store Owner is a sight to behold. He truly takes this movie that extra step into masterpiece. Watch for him. He'll give you chills.The special effects are top of the line for 1992, and some of these techniques are still used today. Watch for the spear throwing, the regeneration of Creedence's hand, Grampa Seth in the mirror, ""the shirt buttoning scene,"" the vegetable transformations, ""the popcorn scene,"" and of course, the goblin costumes.The underlying social commentary of Troll II was truly ahead of it's time. Homosexuality is dealt with on many different levels. Elliot and his boys are obviously repressed closet homosexuals. Their's is a constant struggle for acceptance into the Waites family. The town of Nilbog is in fact run by a lesbian who lusts after Holly Waits and takes great pleasure in the demasculinization of Arnold. Vegetarianism is approached more directly. The goblins turn their human victims into vegetables before devouring them. This says in no uncertain terms that everything you eat (plant or animal) was alive once, and killing is still killing. Troll II takes a chilling look at organized religion in the sermon scene. The Preacher (played by my father, I'm pretty sure of it) has his congregation in the palms of his hands and easily turns them against the lovable, freckled Joshua. Power like that belongs in no one man's hands.On the whole, realism sells Troll II. It's scary because it COULD happen. Don't watch this one alone or at night, but DO watch it. You won't forget it.",utterly flawless,this is best movie ever made nothing i have experienced has displayed degree perfection attained by geniuses yes geniuses nothing less behind troll ii story line is gripping believable damn scary waits family is month long vacation country town nilbog as part family exchange program they leave modern conveniences their home rough it nilbogs rural setting im edge my seat already but wait theres more young joshuas deceased grampa seth comes back grave warn family nilbogs dangers beautiful holly waitess boyfriend tags along with his blatantly homo erotic chums theres something strange about curiously unrefrigerated nilbog milk oh did i forget mention that town is full goblins acting this film can be summed up one word one word only superfine every member waites family was portrayed realistically intriguingly chemistry between elliot holly was so intense that i would be surprised hear that there was not something going off camera town matriarch has full command screen whenever she graces it with her presence one actor takes cake however scene stealer draco floyd as store owner is sight behold he truly takes this movie that extra step into masterpiece watch him hell give you chills special effects are top line 1992 some these techniques are still used today watch spear throwing regeneration creedences hand grampa seth mirror shirt buttoning scene vegetable transformations popcorn scene course goblin costumes underlying social commentary troll ii was truly ahead its time homosexuality is dealt with many different levels elliot his boys are obviously repressed closet homosexuals theirs is constant struggle acceptance into waites family town nilbog is fact run by lesbian who lusts after holly waits takes great pleasure demasculinization arnold vegetarianism is approached more directly goblins turn their human victims into vegetables before devouring them this says no uncertain terms that everything you eat plant or animal was alive once killing is still killing troll ii takes chilling look at organized religion sermon scene preacher played by my father im pretty sure it has his congregation palms his hands easily turns them against lovable freckled joshua power like that belongs no one mans hands whole realism sells troll ii its scary because it could happen dont watch this one alone or at night but do watch it you wont forget it,0.5604146420472952,0.194533527696793,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.23}"
