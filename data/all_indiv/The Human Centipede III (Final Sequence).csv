,If it's sole purpose was to troll mankind it is a masterpiece...,"What is there to say at this point in the game? Tom Six really exists only to disgust his audience to the best of his abilities in bad taste. Does 'The Human Centipede III' live up to this lofty goal at reaching a new level of disgust and bad taste? Not really. 'Centipede II' was far more disgusting but this one may be much harder to sit through. It's far more successful at being loud and obnoxious than it is at making me want to throw up. I think Six' core audience of torture porn fans will probably be very bored with this one. It just doesn't do anything. His detractors though who see him as a cinematic Antichrist are going to have a blast with 'Centipede III'. It's disgusting, offensive, and really a waste of film except in the fact that it will tick off a lot of people. In an odd way I have to give Six credit for this...I've seen the other films in this horror classic trilogy and so in a way I sort of wanted to see what horrible things Six could conjure up to end this trilogy. Six is much more a freak show host than he is a filmmaker, trying to get people to shed their decency to indulge in debauchery even with the realization that a lot of his audience are going to the film to advertise their disgust with it. I thought the first film actually had some merit to it. It was really well shot and Dieter Laser is outstandingly campy as the mad doctor. 'II' was gratuitous but in all honesty that was the point. 'III' tries to up the ante with the size and scope of everything. The fact is that freak shows aren't as interesting when they are big. It's a little more interesting when it's smaller and filthier. 'III' is a victim of trying to fill up a large canvas with the stupid centipede idea that can't really hold it. For the most part the movie is Laser on steroids.Dieter Laser constantly looks like he is on the verge of convulsing into a stroke into this film as he shouts out the horrific racist dialogue. I'm torn between saying wow and wanting to turn the thing off. This is pretty much all the film is. I thought his performance in the first film was campy and over the top but it's incredibly subtle in comparison (dried clitorises anyone?)Is 'III' disgusting enough though? Not really. The whole centipede subplot doesn't come until the end. There's a horrific rape dream sequence with Laser that really is so over the top that it doesn't elicit anything. It's just blah. Sticking a gun in a stoma hole is gross but with the over punctuation by Laser and Six it just becomes ""We get it already""...I think I would have found some level of enjoyment of the film if I had viewed it with an audience at a midnight show scenario. This movie is utterly worthless being streamed or watched on DVD. It's a movie that's entire appeal comes from reading the bad reviews and watching your fellow audience members squirm. I would trade the ninety minutes I spent watching 'Centipede III' for ninety minutes of watching others watching 'Centipede III'.",if its sole purpose was troll mankind it is masterpiece,what is there say at this point game tom six really exists only disgust his audience best his abilities bad taste does human centipede iii live up this lofty goal at reaching new level disgust bad taste not really centipede ii was far more disgusting but this one may be much harder sit through its far more successful at being loud obnoxious than it is at making me want throw up i think six core audience torture porn fans will probably be very bored with this one it just doesnt do anything his detractors though who see him as cinematic antichrist are going have blast with centipede iii its disgusting offensive really waste film except fact that it will tick off lot people odd way i have give six credit this ive seen other films this horror classic trilogy so way i sort wanted see what horrible things six could conjure up end this trilogy six is much more freak show host than he is filmmaker trying get people shed their decency indulge debauchery even with realization that lot his audience are going film advertise their disgust with it i thought first film actually had some merit it it was really well shot dieter laser is outstandingly campy as mad doctor ii was gratuitous but all honesty that was point iii tries up ante with size scope everything fact is that freak shows arent as interesting when they are big its little more interesting when its smaller filthier iii is victim trying fill up large canvas with stupid centipede idea that cant really hold it most part movie is laser steroids dieter laser constantly looks like he is verge convulsing into stroke into this film as he shouts out horrific racist dialogue im torn between saying wow wanting turn thing off this is pretty much all film is i thought his performance first film was campy over top but its incredibly subtle comparison dried clitorises anyone is iii disgusting enough though not really whole centipede subplot doesnt come until end theres horrific rape dream sequence with laser that really is so over top that it doesnt elicit anything its just blah sticking gun stoma hole is gross but with over punctuation by laser six it just becomes we get it already i think i would have found some level enjoyment film if i had viewed it with audience at midnight show scenario this movie is utterly worthless being streamed or watched dvd its movie thats entire appeal comes reading bad reviews watching your fellow audience members squirm i would trade ninety minutes i spent watching centipede iii ninety minutes watching others watching centipede iii,0.5281532861078314,-0.06225485373212645,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.21}"
4.0,Bigger doesn't mean better.,"I've been a big supporter of writer/director Tom Six and his taboo-busting Human Centipede films since the beginning: I rated the first film 8/10, and gave the jaw-droppingly twisted sequel 9/10. The only reason I didn't give Part Two full marks was because I believed that Six still had a few tricks up his sleeve and would probably surpass himself with his third film.As it happens, I was wrong.As far as the controversial content is concerned, the film delivers numerous scenes that live up to Six's notorious reputation, kicking off with some sexual abuse, before proceeding to serve up such sordid treats as the torture of a prisoner with pans of boiling water, a nauseating castration scene, the insertion of a gun barrel into a man's stoma, the consumption of human testicles and dried clitorises, some wound-rape and coma-rape, and, of course, the creation of not just the biggest human centipede yet, but also a human caterpillar, the surgical process for both depicted in graphic detail.But while the film doesn't wimp out on the deviancy, it does suffer from two major problems that make it a very unsatisfying experience overall. The first is the prison setting, which is so implausible that it renders the whole movie utterly ridiculous. The first two films, while unlikely, were at least vaguely plausible: it was possible to believe that a raving lunatic might try to stitch a few folks ass-to-mouth out of curiosity, but the notion that the head of a large correctional facility could do the same, with the co-operation of his staff, is absurd in the extreme and seriously detracts from the film's overall effectiveness as a shocker. Even when viewed as a black comedy, it's still a dumb premise.The second issue I have is with Dieter Laser (the actor who played Dr. Heiter in the first film): his performance as sadistic warden Bill Boss is hugely irritating, the guy drawing out every single syllable at the top of his voice to the point where I would have liked to have seen HIS mouth sewn to someone's ass just to shut him up. Laurence Harvey (bug-eyed star of the second film) is also crap, but at least he's not quite as annoying. Both guys are out-acted by porn-star Bree Olson, who is also a whole lot easier on the eyes.If the subtitle 'Final Sequence' is to be believed, this film sees an end to the Human Centipede series; it's a hugely disappointing way to wrap things up. Let's hope that Six's next film sees the director back on form: we need something to flush away any memories of this rather obnoxious mess.",bigger doesnt mean better,ive been big supporter writer director tom six his taboo busting human centipede films since beginning i rated first film 8 10 gave jaw droppingly twisted sequel 9 10 only reason i didnt give part two full marks was because i believed that six still had few tricks up his sleeve would probably surpass himself with his third film as it happens i was wrong as far as controversial content is concerned film delivers numerous scenes that live up sixs notorious reputation kicking off with some sexual abuse before proceeding serve up such sordid treats as torture prisoner with pans boiling water nauseating castration scene insertion gun barrel into mans stoma consumption human testicles dried clitorises some wound rape coma rape course creation not just biggest human centipede yet but also human caterpillar surgical process both depicted graphic detail but while film doesnt wimp out deviancy it does suffer two major problems that make it very unsatisfying experience overall first is prison setting which is so implausible that it renders whole movie utterly ridiculous first two films while unlikely were at least vaguely plausible it was possible believe that raving lunatic might try stitch few folks ass mouth out curiosity but notion that head large correctional facility could do same with co operation his staff is absurd extreme seriously detracts films overall effectiveness as shocker even when viewed as black comedy its still dumb premise second issue i have is with dieter laser actor who played dr heiter first film his performance as sadistic warden bill boss is hugely irritating guy drawing out every single syllable at top his voice point where i would have liked have seen his mouth sewn someones ass just shut him up laurence harvey bug eyed star second film is also crap but at least hes not quite as annoying both guys are out acted by porn star bree olson who is also whole lot easier eyes if subtitle final sequence is be believed this film sees end human centipede series its hugely disappointing way wrap things up lets hope that sixs next film sees director back form we need something flush away any memories this rather obnoxious mess,0.45896760343481663,-0.035723156624795964,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,"If i believed in giving films a 0, this would rightly qualify","There are no words in the English language (that i can use here) that can accurately describe how utterly terrible, awful, and just downright dumb this 'movie' was. May i first ask who wanted this movie to be made? What? No-one? OK, THEN WHY ON EARTH DID TOM SIX DECIDE TO MAKE THIS Piece OF GARBAGE??? There is no way, any sane human being would believe that this was in any way imaginable a good idea. It has some of the worst acting i have ever seen in my entire life from every single person in this film and will someone tell Dieter Laser to STOP BLOODY SHOUTING EVERY DAMN SENTENCE LIKE WE ARE 100km AWAY, JEEZ. And on top of the god- awful acting it comes accompanied by the worst scripts in history, and a plot that made absolutely no sense whatsoever, in fact, there was no plot for 90% of this thing. This is 'The Human Centipede' right? SO WHERE WAS THE CENTIPEDE FOR THE FIRST HOUR AND 20 MINUTES??? I honestly do not know which was more difficult to sit through, the surgery (or lack thereof) or that piece of garbage that was the culmination of bad acting, writing, directing and everything else. There were a few times where the film showed signs of trying to be satirical and even self aware but it was so ridiculously dumb that by that point you just want to gouge your eyes out. I don't even know why i am still wasting my time talking about this when i just wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my life watching it.

1.0,HUGE Disappointment,"The Plot.Bully prison warden Bill Boss, leading a big state prison in the US of A, has a lot of problems; his prison statistically has the highest amount of prison riots, medical costs and staff turnover in the country. But foremost he is unable to get the respect he thinks he deserves from his inmates and the state Governor. He constantly fails in experimenting with different ideas for the ideal punishment to get the inmates in line, which drives him, together with the sizzling heat, completely insane. Under threats of termination by the Governor, his loyal right hand man Dwight comes up with a brilliant idea. A revolutionary idea which could change the American prison system for good and save billions of dollars. An idea based on the notorious Human Centipede movies, that will literally and figuratively get the inmates on their knees, creating the ultimate punishment and deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. I LOVED the first two....especially the second which was really surreal.Trust me...this movie is horrible.

2.0,Let's Hope It Is The Final Sequence,"Bill Boss the warder of a tough maximum security prison watches the European art house black comedy films involving the human centipedes and invites the films director Tom Six to see how viable this would be in real life I can't say I was a massive fan of the original HC . I missed out on the sequel and only watched this one because I had the opportunity of seeing it free and contains the bizarre casting of Eric Roberts and former porn star Bree Olson. On top of all that there seemed to be a meta-fictional aspect of director Tom Six playing himself and the trailer looked good . What's wrong with investing a couple of hours in blackly comical horror ? Well to be fair the trailer is accurate in a way of ""Meglomaniac abuses power and really pushes the boat out"" but the execution is dreadful . Dieter Laser looks totally camp in the trailer as Bill Boss and while the performance is bearable in a two minute trailer it's not in a feature length film . I can understand that he's not supposed to be taken seriously for a moment but that's not really the point as he shouts , squeals and uses lots and lots of swear words while inflicting violence on people . It's not satire we're watching but absolute farce and Laser becomes painfully irritating , so much so that you find yourself looking forward to Eric Roberts appearing if only to see a calm and reserved performance . Yes chaps you read that right - Eric Roberts probably gives the most calm , rational and realistic acting performance in the entire movie . I suppose you could also give Tom Six a back handed compliment in making a sequel that is a billion light years removed from the original movie but nothing about it really works and in cinematic terms it feels like a juvenile delinquent who wants to shock the adult world but just ends up looking silly . Take this insult: ""Not even the corpse of a spastic would want you . Now f--k off"" That's probably the most witty line in the film and I've come out with funnier compliments throughout my entire life which hopefully says more about THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III than it says about me",lets hope it is final sequence,bill boss warder tough maximum security prison watches european art house black comedy films involving human centipedes invites films director tom six see how viable this would be real life i cant say i was massive fan original hc i missed out sequel only watched this one because i had opportunity seeing it free contains bizarre casting eric roberts former porn star bree olson top all that there seemed be meta fictional aspect director tom six playing himself trailer looked good whats wrong with investing couple hours blackly comical horror well be fair trailer is accurate way meglomaniac abuses power really pushes boat out but execution is dreadful dieter laser looks totally camp trailer as bill boss while performance is bearable two minute trailer its not feature length film i can understand that hes not supposed be taken seriously moment but thats not really point as he shouts squeals uses lots lots swear words while inflicting violence people its not satire were watching but absolute farce laser becomes painfully irritating so much so that you find yourself looking forward eric roberts appearing if only see calm reserved performance yes chaps you read that right eric roberts probably gives most calm rational realistic acting performance entire movie i suppose you could also give tom six back handed compliment making sequel that is billion light years removed original movie but nothing about it really works cinematic terms it feels like juvenile delinquent who wants shock adult world but just ends up looking silly take this insult not even corpse spastic would want you now f k off thats probably most witty line film ive come out with funnier compliments throughout my entire life which hopefully says more about human centipede iii than it says about me,0.5482142857142857,0.10126984126984126,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
1.0,Jumped the shark with this sequel,"If you've recently been introduced to the Human Centipede series, I suggest just checking out the first two movies and completely ignoring this 3rd installment. This one tried to be comedic, which is a major disappointment. Fans of this series loved the first two movies because they were very dark and twisted. Tom Six seems to not understand this and only wanted to make a comedic sequel just for the sake of it being ""different"". I've seen this happen with other horror sequels, and it never turns out well. The comedy itself was in bad taste.. as a few others have pointed out.You know a movie is going to be bad when you have a porn star (Bree Olson) as one of the main cast.",jumped shark with this sequel,if youve recently been introduced human centipede series i suggest just checking out first two movies completely ignoring this 3rd installment this one tried be comedic which is major disappointment fans this series loved first two movies because they were very dark twisted tom six seems not understand this only wanted make comedic sequel just sake it being different ive seen this happen with other horror sequels it never turns out well comedy itself was bad taste as few others have pointed out you know movie is going be bad when you have porn star bree olson as one main cast,0.46546296296296297,-0.08282407407407405,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.11}"
4.0,"Interesting way to make sequels, but still just bleh","My quick rating - 4,1/10. Don't listen to any nonsense about how violent/gore filled this is. It just isn't. The movie leads itself to being a sequel within a new movie premise taken a step further from how part 2 was to 1. Kudos to Tom Six for making sequels that don't follow the traditional role, but smack him at the same time for being so pretentious to think a film fan won't see right through his arrogance. Multiple scenes of what Tom considers humor point this out entirely by being long, drawn out scenes with Deiter Laser (Bill Boss) acting like a complete jackass overacting a joke to the point that would make Jim Carrey cringe. Basically the story in a nutshell (about all you need) is a deranged prison warden (Laser) decides at his last straw to use the ideas from the Human Centipede movies to punish criminals and deter further offenders to ever break the law. This revelation is made when the governor (played by, wait for it, Eric Roberts) gives Boss 2 weeks to get his prison in order. What better way then take all the prisoners and sew them ass to mouth together, right? Anyway, back to the gore, a scene or two MAY have been considered ""gross"" years ago, but there is nothing to raw at all. Some of the humor is quite funny in a very dark way (his idea of health food is one of them) but the overshadowing of the poor acting is a deterrent (in other words, yes, it is a b- budget movie BUT it was so painfully obvious the actors were purposely acting bad to become a b-budget movie) So again the numbnut,Tom Six, thinks he is outsmarting the audience with this backasswards attempt at laughs. These laughs tend to come more from suggestion and the cheesy attempt at being an exploitative film(women should love a secretary named ""Tits"") All and all, it has the pros but is to outweighed by the cons. Good news, it was only supposed to be a trilogy, so we may be spared of another one.",interesting way make sequels but still just bleh,my quick rating 4 1 10 dont listen any nonsense about how violent gore filled this is it just isnt movie leads itself being sequel within new movie premise taken step further how part 2 was 1 kudos tom six making sequels that dont follow traditional role but smack him at same time being so pretentious think film fan wont see right through his arrogance multiple scenes what tom considers humor point this out entirely by being long drawn out scenes with deiter laser bill boss acting like complete jackass overacting joke point that would make jim carrey cringe basically story nutshell about all you need is deranged prison warden laser decides at his last straw use ideas human centipede movies punish criminals deter further offenders ever break law this revelation is made when governor played by wait it eric roberts gives boss 2 weeks get his prison order what better way then take all prisoners sew them ass mouth together right anyway back gore scene or two may have been considered gross years ago but there is nothing raw at all some humor is quite funny very dark way his idea health food is one them but overshadowing poor acting is deterrent other words yes it is b budget movie but it was so painfully obvious actors were purposely acting bad become b budget movie so again numbnut tom six thinks he is outsmarting audience with this backasswards attempt at laughs these laughs tend come more suggestion cheesy attempt at being exploitative film women should love secretary named tits all all it has pros but is outweighed by cons good news it was only supposed be trilogy so we may be spared another one,0.47673278475910064,0.010272534483060793,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7.0,Tongue-in-cheek Gore Horror,"7.5 of 10. Picking up where the other 2 films left off, but not as a literal sequel. There's an unexpected side-step as the filmmaker decides to both make a new centipede film and change the setting and plot. This is definitely more over-the-top and humorous than the straight out gore and psychological horror of the other 2.In the end, that makes it a smarter, more enjoyable film for those looking for more than a film testing their ability to watch through the most painful, gruesome, and disgusting scenes.Tom Six steps out from behind the pen and camera to become an active character in this film to both openly acknowledge his fame and to create a sense that this is actually happening. Like the other films, the ending definitely isn't happy. It is, however, consistent with the earlier films and bizarre enough that it should please those seeking the horror/gore originality that probably got them to watch it initially.",tongue cheek gore horror,7 5 10 picking up where other 2 films left off but not as literal sequel theres unexpected side step as filmmaker decides both make new centipede film change setting plot this is definitely more over top humorous than straight out gore psychological horror other 2 end that makes it smarter more enjoyable film those looking more than film testing their ability watch through most painful gruesome disgusting scenes tom six steps out behind pen camera become active character this film both openly acknowledge his fame create sense that this is actually happening like other films ending definitely isnt happy it is however consistent with earlier films bizarre enough that it should please those seeking horror gore originality that probably got them watch it initially,0.5286050156739811,0.061311389759665616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"

5.0,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),"Razzie nominated director Tom Six, who apparently worked on the Dutch version of Big Brother, where it first began, completes his highly controversial trilogy with this climax that brings both the original and sequel into play, including the stars of them, and turns the shock factor up another notch. Basically psychotic prison warden William ""Bill"" Boss (First Sequence's Dieter Laser) watches The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) with his accountant Dwight Butler (Full Sequence's Laurence R. Harvey), Bill says he hates the films, he enjoys sexually assaulting his assistant Daisy (porn star Bree Olson), to the dismay of Dwight watching, who tries to pitch a ""brilliant idea"", before being interrupted. Bill and Dwight are summoned to the prison to look at the aftermath of an assault that occurred, an officer was stabbed by an inmate, Bill punishes the prisoner, Inmate 178 (The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister), by snapping his arm, exposing his bone and causing immense pain, Bill hurls several racist slurs at him, and promises to do this again when his bones heal. In the Warden's office, Bill receives his package, specially imported dried African clitorises, which he eats 'for strength', next Bill waterboards Native American prisoner, Inmate 346 (Jay Tavare), disfiguring him with boiling water. Governor Hughes (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts) threatens to fire Bill and Dwight if they do not clean up their acts, desperate to gain respect Bill orders all prisoners are castrated, he graphically castrates a prisoner, Inmate 297 (Robert LaSardo), himself. Bill next eats the prisoner's cooked testicles for lunch, Daisy is forced to give him fellatio, while Dwight watches and angrily stamps his papers in the corner, after she swallows he offers her something to take away the taste, she eats one of the dried clitorises, mistaking it for candy. Dwight is finally able to pitch his ""brilliant idea"", he suggests all prisoners should be surgically connected, mouth to anus, forming giant human centipede, saying it will save them money, and it will be the ultimate deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. Bill initially opposes the idea, because of his hatred of The Human Centipede films, dismissing the idea as impossible, and claiming the films director Tom Six has a fetish for feces, after a drunken argument with Dwight, Bill has a nightmare of the prisoner he castrated raping him in the kidney. The director himself, Tom Six, is summoned to the prison, Bill is warming to Dwight's idea, Six confirms that it is ""100% medically accurate"", Six gives permission to use his Centipede idea, but he wants to witness the operation. The first two Human Centipede films are screened to the prisoners in the prison canteen, showing them what is going to happen, a riot breaks out, several guards are injured, the prisoners spread, trapping Bill and Dwight in the Warden's office, one inmate beats Daisy into a coma and another masturbates watching, backup arrives and manage to herd the prisoners back to their cells. Bill readies all prisoners, going to each cell and shooting all inmates with tranquilisers, but some prisoners are not compatible for the centipede, one prisoner has a stoma, and one prisoner is disabled, Bill kills them both. They also discover a prisoner has Crohn's disease, causing constant diarrhoea, Bill orders the prisoner he castrated and raped him in his dream is attached to him as further punishment, Bill and Dwight visit Daisy who is in a coma, Dwight tells Bill he loves her, Bill ignores his protests and rapes Daisy's motionless body. Tom Six returns and is met by Bill and Dwight, touring the cells the trio discover a mentally unstable prisoner eating his own feces, wanting to be sewn into the centipede, not wanting anyone to enjoy the centipede punishment Bill kills the prisoner, they next observe the operation going ahead, including the death row inmates being dismembered for a ""special project"", Six vomits seeing this. The five-hundred person human centipede is complete, Governor Hughes arrives and is disgusted by what he sees, not only a Human Centipede has been created, but also a Human Caterpillar, made up of prisoners serving life sentences, with all limbs removed, meaning they cannot move, also Daisy has accidentally been sewn into the Centipede, Bill and Dwight detail the saving of money for tax payers and other benefits from it, but Hughes concludes they are insane and should get the death penalty, before leaving in abhorrence. Bill murders Dr. Jones (Clayton Rohner) in anger, then Hughes returns to the prison and has had a change of heart, he claims the Centipede punishment is ""just what America needs"", the end sees Bill and Dwight celebrate their success, but Bill shoots Dwight for trying to take credit for the idea, even though it was his idea in the first place, and Bill is seen naked dancing and screaming from the watchtower over the prison centipede. Also starring First Sequence's Akihiro Kitamura as Inmate 333, Bill Hutchens as Inmate 488 and Carlos Ramirez (identical twin brother of Efren from Napoleon Dynamite) as Inmate 109. The casting of stars from the previous two films as actually a clever idea, Laser is fantastically exaggerated and sadistic, while Harvey is amusingly eccentric and authoritative, the appearances of Roberts, Olson, Lister and even the film's own director Six add a little something as well. I questioned if this final film in the trilogy would have as many cuts by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) as the second film did, it certainly doesn't hold back on the violence, body mutilation or other disgusting things going on, you could argue that some of it is done for comedic value, depending on your opinion of the series, certainly not to be watched if your squeamish, and it satirises politics, racism and sexism, I admit it's no quite as good as the previous two, but it's not a bad satirical horror.

8.0,Six manages to ramp it up again,"The original 'Human Centipede' was a brilliant idea for a film. The trailer alone was truly shocking and made any horror/gore fan adamant that they had to see it. The idea alone was enough to carry the film and the results were indeed brilliant and shocking. Then there came the problem that writer/director Tom Six wanted a sequel, in fact a couple of them. The idea alone was no longer going to be shocking enough to carry them. He had to up the ante. And that's exactly what he did with 'The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)'. In fact he upped it possibly more than he needed to. It truly was an incredibly shocking film, with one scene in particular really standing out in my memory. The only problem was that made upping the ante again for part three even tougher. Did he manage it? All I can say is he gave it a hell of a try.The movie really is carried by the lead character of Bill Boss, played by Dieter Laser who also starred in the original. In what must have been an exhausting performance to pull off, he is simply going full throttle from scene one to the dying seconds of the film. He gives it his all and he pulls it off. The character is captivating to watch and wonder what he is going to do next. Laurence R. Harvey, the star of part two, also returns in a little more toned down role this time, as do some other actors in smaller parts. In fact even Tom Six himself makes an appearance this time around.It goes without saying that this film won't be for everyone, however I absolutely loved it. A number of scenes are again truly shocking and the overall plot of the film is nothing short of fascinating. It's far from highbrow, Oscar winning cinema, but then it never sets out to be anything of the sorts. It's there to entertain its audience and that it does in spades.",six manages ramp it up again,original human centipede was brilliant idea film trailer alone was truly shocking made any horror gore fan adamant that they had see it idea alone was enough carry film results were indeed brilliant shocking then there came problem that writer director tom six wanted sequel fact couple them idea alone was no longer going be shocking enough carry them he had up ante thats exactly what he did with human centipede ii full sequence fact he upped it possibly more than he needed it truly was incredibly shocking film with one scene particular really standing out my memory only problem was that made upping ante again part three even tougher did he manage it all i can say is he gave it hell try movie really is carried by lead character bill boss played by dieter laser who also starred original what must have been exhausting performance pull off he is simply going full throttle scene one dying seconds film he gives it his all he pulls it off character is captivating watch wonder what he is going do next laurence r harvey star part two also returns little more toned down role this time as do some other actors smaller parts fact even tom six himself makes appearance this time around it goes without saying that this film wont be everyone however i absolutely loved it number scenes are again truly shocking overall plot film is nothing short fascinating its far highbrow oscar winning cinema but then it never sets out be anything sorts its there entertain its audience that it does spades,0.5866044616044617,0.048611111111111105,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"
2.0,Migraine inducing boredom,"The standard for torture porn isn't exactly high but it isn't so low that you can substitute being a passable well made film with torturing the viewer with boredom, which this final installment does. The first two at least had some kind of passable narrative and were decently shot and edited. This on the other hand can't get the basics right. The acting is god awful. Its worse than just being flat because the main character, governor Hughes, yells out every damn line he has. Even after this it still somehow has the problem of NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR/UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. The audio is pretty poor. The dialogue at times is muffled by the soundtrack, which is pretty pathetic. How long is the film? 2hrs and 20 minutes! If you are going to make a piece of crap then at least make it 1hr and 30 max. So what about the ""plot""? Governor Hughes is shown the first two films first thing in the film. You would think that the main character, Hughes, a over the top Texan loudmouth psychopath who abuses his prisoners, would get the idea that he has been shown the film because his accountant wants to do it for real. Nope. Instead we have a long drawn out tour of the prison. There is though a decent message to the film about the state of prison abuse and the contempt of the Americans to actually care. Sadly it beats you over the head with it in the final 20 minutes of the film. As for the gore there are two decent scenes. There is a waterboarding with boiling water and a mutilation. I would not watch the film just to see those scenes simply because it is surrounded by 2 hrs of yelling and boredom.

4.0,The taste will never leave your mouth // instagram: moviesmaniax,"""The taste will never leave your mouth"", don't eat anything while you watch this, you have been warned. This was one of my anticipated horror films of 2015 and I must say I was really disappointed. With the film's big premise and ambition, it turns out to be ultimately dull throughout with little entertainment here. The film is filled with perversely sick moments, immaturely psychotic performance, and shocking GORES that's intended to make you puke and gross you out instead of making a gleefully enjoyable one to watch. One of the main problems here is the performance of Dieter Laser which make him looks like Marlon Wayans going pull psycho which is amusing to watch for like 5 minutes and the rest is just childishly annoying and just dull, making the film laughable and looks like a parody of itself. Another problem is how the story drags out and we have to sit through the whole psychotically dull act and vulgarly racist dialogue before the final sequences happen which is nothing that surprising since most of them are already shown in the trailer. Overall, The Final Sequence is crude, vulgar, perversely sick, over-the-top in its violence and chessily insane performance, yet still ends up too dull to enjoy even for the fans of the genre.>>C-<<",taste will never leave your mouth instagram moviesmaniax,taste will never leave your mouth dont eat anything while you watch this you have been warned this was one my anticipated horror films 2015 i must say i was really disappointed with films big premise ambition it turns out be ultimately dull throughout with little entertainment here film is filled with perversely sick moments immaturely psychotic performance shocking gores thats intended make you puke gross you out instead making gleefully enjoyable one watch one main problems here is performance dieter laser which make him looks like marlon wayans going pull psycho which is amusing watch like 5 minutes rest is just childishly annoying just dull making film laughable looks like parody itself another problem is how story drags out we have sit through whole psychotically dull act vulgarly racist dialogue before final sequences happen which is nothing that surprising since most them are already shown trailer overall final sequence is crude vulgar perversely sick over top its violence chessily insane performance yet still ends up too dull enjoy even fans genre c,0.6599206349206349,-0.18220238095238095,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.29}"

3.0,The Human Centipede III : Well it was certainly memorable,"The first Human Centipede movie had a certain novelty factor about it. It was meant to shock and it succeeded, thus making it somewhat watchable.The second was a disgusting mess with no redeeming features and would likely be in my bottom 100 movies ever made.This, is an odd creature.So the antagonists from both previous movies return, but they both play different characters! In the second movie the first movie was made out to be exactly that, just a movie. In this one both the first and second are supposed to have been movies.Still with me?Adding an element of humor this third part is undeniably memorable but not for the right reasons. It aims to shock once again and pulls out all the stops in doing so.Credit where credit is due, the lead takes the character and makes it his own and saves the film (To an extent). The Human Centipede III is disgusting, and there is barely a story but it has moments that are very hard to get off your mind so it at least succeeds there.Not for the faint.The Good:Dieter Laser certainly makes for an interesting character with Billy BossThe Bad:Shock for the sake of shockNo real storyline",human centipede iii well it was certainly memorable,first human centipede movie had certain novelty factor about it it was meant shock it succeeded thus making it somewhat watchable second was disgusting mess with no redeeming features would likely be my bottom 100 movies ever made this is odd creature so antagonists both previous movies return but they both play different characters second movie first movie was made out be exactly that just movie this one both first second are supposed have been movies still with me adding element humor this third part is undeniably memorable but not right reasons it aims shock once again pulls out all stops doing so credit where credit is due lead takes character makes it his own saves film extent human centipede iii is disgusting there is barely story but it has moments that are very hard get off your mind so it at least succeeds there not faint good dieter laser certainly makes interesting character with billy bossthe bad shock sake shockno real storyline,0.44760204081632643,0.029234693877551024,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.28}"

1.0,Could Dieter Laser be the worst actor in history? Perhaps...but his performance as the Warden is clearly the worst performance I've seen in years!,"I have an unusual hobby. I like to occasionally watch horrible films, as I find many of them unintentionally funny. Because of this passion, I have seen every movie in Harry Medved's ""The 50 Worst Movies"" and nearly all of IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. However, of all these bad films, one I simply could not bring myself to finish was ""The Human Centipede II"" as I found it so overwhelmingly disgusting, stupid and awful that I simply couldn't finish the job. This made my watching ""The Human Centipede III"" something I really did NOT look forward to doing! Should I have paid more attention to my brain and simply refused to see this third film? To put it bluntly...yes.When the film begins, you can't help but marvel at Dieter Laser as he plays the crazy Warden. I couldn't believe how bad an actor he was and what a horrible performance he could give as this very, very stupid character. Warden Boss is like a cartoon character....so evil he's utterly ridiculous. He overacts constantly and is so dumb and awful you just need to see and hear him to believe it! Additionally, his heavy German accent simply made it sound as if he'd JUST learned English a few minutes before attempting this role! Is he completely to blame? No...the writer and director must own some of this as well, though I strongly suspect they were penguins as I cannot imagine a person directing or writing THIS poorly. His character is 100% sadism and 100% stupid....to the point where he becomes tedious....and dumber than Tor Johnson in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""!Overall, this movie was SLIGHTLY less disgusting than the prior film but the utter stupidity of the script and Laser put it in a class all by itself. I would clearly place this in a list NOT of the worst 100...but worst dozen films ever made. It' THAT bad...that pointless...that offensive...and that amateurish.

10.0,"A ""not for everyone"" funny comedy horror","I think the reason this movie has such a bad rating is that some people don't get that this is a comedy horror, if you try to watch it seriously or if you expect something like the first two movies then yeah you're probably not gonna enjoy yourself, but then again it's not how it is meant to be watched. Comedy horrors are extremely hard to get right because it combines the most difficult genres to get right, not everybody laughs at the same things and not everybody is scared of the same things. This movie relies on shock humor and extremely exaggerated acting. I find Dieter Laser as Bill Boss hilarious and same goes for Laurence R Harvey as Dwight, they're a very funny duo and very memorable characters. But then again, if screaming profanities and saying the word ""cock"" every two seconds isn't your humor and ball cutting scenes aren't your type of horror then you're going to hate this movie.I'm giving it a 10 while acknowledging that this movie isn't for everyone, but that doesn't make it a bad movie that just makes it a controversial movie. You might love it, you might hate it, there's no in between and I think Tom Six doesn't want an in between, he wants strong reactions and that's exactly what he gets with each of his movie.

2.0,And Pythagorus called Three a noble number.....,"George H. W. Bush Prison is ruled over by the Warden Bill Boss, a sweat-soaked shaved- headed sadist brainwashed with delusions of madness and brutality.Boss' 'Igor' is his accountant, Dwight, but the prison's real problems are High costs, inmate fights, guard injuries and other numerous failures.Boss has his own ideas for how to fix the place, shouting incomprehensible waffle in his garbled English, but mild-mannered Dwight keeps on mentioning an even better idea. If Bill would only watch these two horror movies to see how it might work Third times the charm right? It's absolutely not in this abomination of a film, easily the worst film of the year, directed by Tom Six, who must be laughing all the way to the bank with his trilogy of trash.The concept of the original movie was a good enough idea, but it was executed poorly. The second one was more meta, and a better movie, but that's the same as saying that losing an arm is better than losing your sight, which would be beneficial in this films case.So we have Laser as the warden, barely making any sense literally shouting his lines throughout looking like he is on some sort of substance. Seriously, this is one of the poorest performances I've seen in a film, I don't know what he was trying to channel, but my goodness, his performance is painful.Harvey fares a little better, but he looks like Stan Laurel, at least he pulls the reins in on his performance. The film is exceptionally offence, sexist, homophobic, culturally incorrect, and so wrong on so many accounts.Six appears as himself, and even he vomits due to the quality of his own creation.In trying to be shocking, Six fails on every level imaginable, shock doesn't mean to offend all the time, shock should stay with you, make you think, not make you want to press the off button.When the unveiling of the titular experiment is finally revealed, your still recovering from the insufferable poison the previous hour showered you with.And this is supposed to be a black comedy too? That sentence in itself is funnier than anything present on screen.The jokes on us unfortunately, as the 'auteur' cemented his name in legend, because this film will be remembered.......for all the wrong reasons of course.But I'll give credit where credits due,there are some landscape shots that are truly psychedelic.It's really really really not worth 100 minutes of your life.

2.0,"100% Medically, and Even More Intellectually Full of S***!","Alright, there's no denying how the concept of seeing spoiled, ditsy assholes, bullies, and violent criminals get tortured by being forced to eat each other's crap can be somewhat gratifying, but watching an adult lose touch with reality and rage like an infant for 90 minutes is hardly fun. I know some fans of the Will Ferrell comedy cult would disagree on that last point, and if this is you then I can only say: Just keep on smoking your dope, drink your Jaegermeister, and don't ever leave your mother's house! Unlike the first sequel, which had superb acting talent, this one failed completely on that point with all characters excepting those who played the convicts (victims). Not even creepy Dieter Laser could follow up the mad-scientist acting skill which he displayed in the original to this series, he just isn't suited for the Texas Prison Warden role, and it was painful to watch him fall down on that.As for reality, and the claims which Tom Six makes to how any of these turds reflect this, ""The Final (Insult)"" takes itself much too seriously on it's medical and political ideas, and anybody who thinks otherwise needs to be locked up before they try anything so stupid. I'm no physician, nor have I any sort of medical training, but then I don't have to be in order to disprove the accuracy of Tom Six's medical claims. Considering that the Millenials grew up with all of the world's information available to them at the click of a few buttons, to see that generation making and accepting such ideas as true is the true horror which this movie causes.Well, kids, it's not actually true that human life ca be sustained by eating feces. I would have thought that everyone down to 10 years old would know through osmosis and even TV that urine is indeed sterile, while poop is heavily laden with bacteria which will kill you if ingested. The bacteria exist safely and usefully within your colon, but if your colon leaks or you eat poop, you will become infected and you will die! Which is something to consider if you ever find yourself tempted to join that ass-rimming cult of sexual stimulation (make sure there isn't any fecal matter present).You may have seen your dog eating his own poop when he's hungry, but this is normal for dogs and some other animals with short intestinal tracts. On account of the shortness, their digestion is much less efficient for them than it is for humans and other primates. Therefore, there is enough food value remaining in their feces that it makes sense for them to re-digest it when they cannot get better food, or somebody forgets to feed them. A dog can do this safely because it is descended from wolf stock, which has been evolving antibodies against bacteria and other pathogens for millions of years longer than primates have, and in much harsher climates. Humans have such efficient digestive systems that even if it weren't for the deadly bacterial hazard there is less nutrition in our poop than is worth the energy to digest it. Therefore, if you were put in a human centipede and you were the second in line behind the one who gets fed any sort of edible food, there's no chance that you would survive, and the last few people in a line of 500 would not even taste any s***, they would begin starving immediately.Don't ask me how I know the above, just go look it up for yourself. I'm not saying believe anything you see that's posted on the subject, far from it - make sure, before you believe anything, that it's agreed upon by multiple, and qualified sources who present their facts in a level-headed manner without any hype, ad-hoc nonsense arguments or other manipulative tactics.As for how this warden's lunatic idea won even a Texas governor's approval...I know there are some who would smile at that idea, but they could not expect that their voters, so many who have imprisoned family members, would not destroy their political careers.",100 medically even more intellectually full s,alright theres no denying how concept seeing spoiled ditsy assholes bullies violent criminals get tortured by being forced eat each others crap can be somewhat gratifying but watching adult lose touch with reality rage like infant 90 minutes is hardly fun i know some fans will ferrell comedy cult would disagree that last point if this is you then i can only say just keep smoking your dope drink your jaegermeister dont ever leave your mothers house unlike first sequel which had superb acting talent this one failed completely that point with all characters excepting those who played convicts victims not even creepy dieter laser could follow up mad scientist acting skill which he displayed original this series he just isnt suited texas prison warden role it was painful watch him fall down that as reality claims which tom six makes how any these turds reflect this final insult takes itself much too seriously its medical political ideas anybody who thinks otherwise needs be locked up before they try anything so stupid im no physician nor have i any sort medical training but then i dont have be order disprove accuracy tom sixs medical claims considering that millenials grew up with all worlds information available them at click few buttons see that generation making accepting such ideas as true is true horror which this movie causes well kids its not actually true that human life ca be sustained by eating feces i would have thought that everyone down 10 years old would know through osmosis even tv that urine is indeed sterile while poop is heavily laden with bacteria which will kill you if ingested bacteria exist safely usefully within your colon but if your colon leaks or you eat poop you will become infected you will die which is something consider if you ever find yourself tempted join that ass rimming cult sexual stimulation make sure there isnt any fecal matter present you may have seen your dog eating his own poop when hes hungry but this is normal dogs some other animals with short intestinal tracts account shortness their digestion is much less efficient them than it is humans other primates therefore there is enough food value remaining their feces that it makes sense them re digest it when they cannot get better food or somebody forgets feed them dog can do this safely because it is descended wolf stock which has been evolving antibodies against bacteria other pathogens millions years longer than primates have much harsher climates humans have such efficient digestive systems that even if it werent deadly bacterial hazard there is less nutrition our poop than is worth energy digest it therefore if you were put human centipede you were second line behind one who gets fed any sort edible food theres no chance that you would survive last few people line 500 would not even taste any s they would begin starving immediately dont ask me how i know above just go look it up yourself im not saying believe anything you see thats posted subject far it make sure before you believe anything that its agreed upon by multiple qualified sources who present their facts level headed manner without any hype ad hoc nonsense arguments or other manipulative tactics as how this wardens lunatic idea won even texas governors approval i know there are some who would smile at that idea but they could not expect that their voters so many who have imprisoned family members would not destroy their political careers,0.3998498498498499,0.018656156156156147,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.43}"
2.0,Avoid,"There's a German guy shouting gibberish all the time which gives you a headache and makes the movie really cringe-worthy and difficult to watch. Yes there's still the gore but it feels like an eternity before you actually see it. What's more it's set in a prison full of hardened criminals (who become the centipede) which makes it harder to sympathise with any victims. There's less suspense than the first movie because it focuses less on the victims. Also being in a prison means you automatically know no character will believably escape, meaning a good chunk of suspense is just thrown away. In summary I'd avoid at all cost, the original movie did the job much better. It feels like too much effort to watch.",avoid,theres german guy shouting gibberish all time which gives you headache makes movie really cringe worthy difficult watch yes theres still gore but it feels like eternity before you actually see it whats more its set prison full hardened criminals who become centipede which makes it harder sympathise with any victims theres less suspense than first movie because it focuses less victims also being prison means you automatically know no character will believably escape meaning good chunk suspense is just thrown away summary id avoid at all cost original movie did job much better it feels like too much effort watch,0.39791666666666675,0.18593750000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
