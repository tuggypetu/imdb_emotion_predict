6.0,Shutdown Your Brain and Enjoy This Gross and Funny B-Movie,"Lake Victory is a dead place after the tragic events with the invasion of prehistoric flesh-eaters piranhas. In Cross Lake, Merkin County, the greedy Chet (David Koechner) opens The Big Wet Water Park against the will of his stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker). When the van of her friends Travis (Paul James Jordan) and Ashley (Meagan Tandy) is found in the water and the couple is missing, Maddy and her friend Shelby (Katrina Bowden) miss them and they talk on a wooden deck on the lake; out of the blue, they are attacked by piranhas. Maddy visits the specialist in piranhas Mr. Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) with her former school friend Barry (Matt Bush), who works at The Big Wet, and with her former boyfriend, Deputy Kyle (Chris Zylka), and they discover piranhas in the lake. However Chet refuses to shutdown his water park and soon his costumers are under the attack of the fearful piranhas.I saw ""Piranha 3DD"" on DVD and I found it a gross and funny B-Movie, with stupid but hilarious characters. The director knows the B-movie formula, with teats and beautiful girls. Christopher Lloyd has become stereotyped as the mad scientist in American comedies in the end of his career. The uncredited Ving Rhames afraid of the water and shooting with his leg is comical. But David Hasselhoff steals the movie making fun of himself as the most famous lifeguard of all times. If you shutdown your brain, you will certainly enjoy this movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Piranha 2"" (""Piranha 2"")",shutdown your brain enjoy this gross funny b movie,lake victory is dead place after tragic events with invasion prehistoric flesh eaters piranhas cross lake merkin county greedy chet david koechner opens big wet water park against will his stepdaughter maddy danielle panabaker when van her friends travis paul james jordan ashley meagan tandy is found water couple is missing maddy her friend shelby katrina bowden miss them they talk wooden deck lake out blue they are attacked by piranhas maddy visits specialist piranhas mr carl goodman christopher lloyd with her former school friend barry matt bush who works at big wet with her former boyfriend deputy kyle chris zylka they discover piranhas lake however chet refuses shutdown his water park soon his costumers are under attack fearful piranhas i saw piranha 3dd dvd i found it gross funny b movie with stupid but hilarious characters director knows b movie formula with teats beautiful girls christopher lloyd has become stereotyped as mad scientist american comedies end his career uncredited ving rhames afraid water shooting with his leg is comical but david hasselhoff steals movie making fun himself as most famous lifeguard all times if you shutdown your brain you will certainly enjoy this movie my vote is six title brazil piranha 2 piranha 2,0.49333333333333335,0.0025000000000000022,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.25}"
6.0,"Only for those with an acquired taste, I thought it was great though.","Piranha 3DD is set a year after the horrible events at lake Victoria where a once believed extinct species of Piranha ate lots of people, money grabbing businessman Chet (David Koechner) runs the Big Wet water-park with his stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) who both have differing opinions on how the park should be run. Meanwhile in an underground lake nearby yet more ferocious Piranha hatch & make their way in the local water system killing & eating anyone that wanders into the water. With the grand summer opening of Big Wet the park is going to be packed full of people looking to have a good time but the killer Piranha manage to feast on them after being sucked into the park through water pipes. The Piranha seem unstoppable as they tear their victims apart...Directed by John Gulager, the son of veteran actor Clu Gulager who has a small role in this, I am sure the average person on the street will probably hate Piranha 3DD with it's stupidity, moronic character's, over the top gore, in jokes, film references & downright silliness but I have to say I really liked it & I am 100% serious when I make that statement. Every one of the 80 odd minutes that Pirahna 3DD lasts for is either gory, funny or downright stupid & there's never a dull moment if nothing else. It takes a special kind of person to appreciate a film like Piranha 3DD, I am that kind of person as I found the constant in jokes & references absolutely hilarious, seriously I just found this so funny & during the moments that were supposed to be funny as well. Any scene with David Hasselhoff is just brilliant, he makes fun of himself & his public image seemingly in good humour from a hotel room encounter with two gorgeous twenty something girls to his droll reaction to the carnage at the water-park as he states the obvious when he says 'once these moron's get out of the water the fish are hardly likely to follow them home' to a really funny send up of the Baywatch opening credits just after the closing credits here as a curious little bonus. In fact the film itself lasts for a mere 70 minutes yet the end credits last for 12 minutes with lots of outtakes including what looks like a couple of deleted scenes (the female life guard being strangled on her own whistle cord) & messing around by the cast & crew. The whole film is just so much fun to watch, from the first moments with the farting cow corpse to the scene in which Josh runs around with a Piranha clamped to the end of his penis before castrating himself to the young kid who gets his head bitten off at the very end. The more I think about Piranha 3DD the more I like it. There's plenty of gore although maybe not quite as much as the first & there's plenty of flesh on show with nude swimming pools & lots of horny teens wanting sex. Call me easily pleased but I laughed at the right places, I got just about all the in jokes & film references & enjoyed the film as a whole too as it has a reasonable if not exactly brilliant story, in fact the story is basically the same as the original Piranha (2010) but set in a water-park rather than a big lake & it's considerably more funny.The special effects are alright, the CGI Piranha look okay but not much else & I can't believe they roar like Lions. Whose decision was that exactly? It's the aspect of Piranha 3DD that I thought ended up really lame. There's some gore here, there's plenty of blood & chewed up bodies, there's another severed penis as in the original & to go with all the blood there's lots of nudity on show. Blood & boobs, what more do you want? There's nothing particularly scary here, there's not much build-up of tension & you can guess what's going to happen but it's still great fun. There are lots of bad taste humour & tastelessness going on, a guy with a flapping Piranha stuck up his bum & the priceless line of dialogue where a woman says 'Josh cut of his penis because something came out of my vagina' which is surely one of the greatest lines ever spoken in a motion picture. Enough said. No-involved in the making of Piranha 3DD is taking it seriously so I suggest that anyone watching it doesn't either & just take it for what it is.The IMDb says that Piranha 3DD had a budget of about $20,000,000 which it total rubbish, try about half that. Since I am blind in one eye I cannot watch films in 3D so I have no idea how effective it is here. Filmed in Wilmington in North Carolina. The cameos from Christopher Lloyd & Ving Rhames reprising their roles from the original are also pretty funny, especially Rhames & his gun legs which he borough by saving money from 'not buying any socks'! Gary Busey also has a small cameo at the start. The rest of the cast are OK, they were obviously chosen for their looks rather than their acting skills.Piranha 3DD is a film that the majority of people will hate & despise, of that I have no doubt but for those of us who it was actually made for will probably love it. Sure, it constantly tries to appeal to the lowest common denominator with it's nudity, gore, nastiness & outright silly send-ups & gags but there's no harm in that.

1.0,Just Pathetic,"Well this was a huge disappointment! I really liked the first Piranha 3D film so I was looking forward to this. This is a lazy, lifeless, and pointless sequel that had no business being made. Instead of being so bad it's good like the first film, this one is just so bad it's terrible. For starters, the first Piranha film actually had likable characters and somewhat of a plot to it. This one has the thinest of a plot you can get and the characters are incredibly lifeless and not even the main character serves any purpose to the film at all. You'd think that with this being a sequel they would amp up the gore and deaths, but the deaths in this one are actually tamer than the first and there's actually less of them. The film tries to be much more of a comedy this time around by adding more humor which all of it falls flat. The humor in this film is so awful and outdated thats it's hard to believe anyone over the age of 13 actually wrote this film. But, what really annoyed me about this film is just how damn stupid it is! The writers couldn't even come up with a decent way to get these characters in a situation to set up a death scene and instead have them do something really stupid or come up with a really stupid reason to get them in a situation that sets up a lame death. The acting here (even though it's suppose to be bad) is bad even for a B-Movie. And just when you think you will finally get a payoff after sitting through 55 minutes of crap, the film presents you with a lazy and totally underwhelming climax that is filmed so poorly that most of the time you can't even tell what is going on (And this really sucks because that was the highlight of the first film). And then, the film presents us with an ending so stupid and forced that even those who can suspend their disbelief the most will be left frustrated with just how incredibly stupid the ending is. The film is a short (althought it feels much longer) 70 minutes followed by 11 minutes of credits that include a ton of lame outtakes. I can now see why The Weinstein Company decided to only release this in barely any theaters and just put in on VOD. I still can't believe how bad this movie was. The director John Gulager shouldn't ever be allowed to be involved with a film ever again because this guy can't direct to save his life. Alexandre Aja who directed the first film actually understood the material he was working with. John Gulager had no idea what the hell he was doing and just decided the wip out a POS to make a quick buck because he obviously didn't care about this film at all and just wanted to get paid. As far as the cameo's in the film go, Gary Busey is only in the films opening scene and is wasted (the only thing we get to see him do is light a cow's farts on fire). Ving Rhames cameo doesn't just feel forced, but also is just really pathetic and sad to watch. The only positive things I can say about this film was that David Hasselfhoff's scenes are actually chuckle worthy and there's a lot of gorgeous nude women on screen many times. Even though i'm only giving the film 1/2 a star, that feels generous. This film could've really been a blast and fun just like the first one was, but it really is just an atrocity of a film that not even the biggest fans of the first one will enjoy. If you are looking for a fun B-Movie, go rent Piranha 3D and just forget that this film even exist. Piranha 3DD tries to so self-award of itself that it just ends up being exactly what it's parodying.",just pathetic,well this was huge disappointment i really liked first piranha 3d film so i was looking forward this this is lazy lifeless pointless sequel that had no business being made instead being so bad its good like first film this one is just so bad its terrible starters first piranha film actually had likable characters somewhat plot it this one has thinest plot you can get characters are incredibly lifeless not even main character serves any purpose film at all youd think that with this being sequel they would amp up gore deaths but deaths this one are actually tamer than first theres actually less them film tries be much more comedy this time around by adding more humor which all it falls flat humor this film is so awful outdated thats its hard believe anyone over age 13 actually wrote this film but what really annoyed me about this film is just how damn stupid it is writers couldnt even come up with decent way get these characters situation set up death scene instead have them do something really stupid or come up with really stupid reason get them situation that sets up lame death acting here even though its suppose be bad is bad even b movie just when you think you will finally get payoff after sitting through 55 minutes crap film presents you with lazy totally underwhelming climax that is filmed so poorly that most time you cant even tell what is going this really sucks because that was highlight first film then film presents us with ending so stupid forced that even those who can suspend their disbelief most will be left frustrated with just how incredibly stupid ending is film is short althought it feels much longer 70 minutes followed by 11 minutes credits that include ton lame outtakes i can now see why weinstein company decided only release this barely any theaters just put vod i still cant believe how bad this movie was director john gulager shouldnt ever be allowed be involved with film ever again because this guy cant direct save his life alexandre aja who directed first film actually understood material he was working with john gulager had no idea what hell he was doing just decided wip out pos make quick buck because he obviously didnt care about this film at all just wanted get paid as far as cameos film go gary busey is only films opening scene is wasted only thing we get see him do is light cows farts fire ving rhames cameo doesnt just feel forced but also is just really pathetic sad watch only positive things i can say about this film was that david hasselfhoffs scenes are actually chuckle worthy theres lot gorgeous nude women screen many times even though im only giving film 1 2 star that feels generous this film couldve really been blast fun just like first one was but it really is just atrocity film that not even biggest fans first one will enjoy if you are looking fun b movie go rent piranha 3d just forget that this film even exist piranha 3dd tries so self award itself that it just ends up being exactly what its parodying,0.5559548978153632,-0.07914023960535586,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,"Good for a laugh, familiar faces","This was more enjoyable than I thought. The acting was not as bad as some of the reviewers say, and for a film that doesn't take itself seriously, neither should you. I actually didn't mind the movie being short, after all it was always hard to stretch the storyline more than an hour.The whole movie was more like a spoof, and somehow I felt Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames and of course The Hoff all added to the fun. The Hoff in particular was great. His role really suited him. He also had a bit more screen time than I would've thought.I didn't see this in 3D, and I'm not sure if that would've changed my rating. There was a fair bit of gratuitous nudity, but I suppose the gratuitous gore balances that out.So if you find gratuitous blood, body parts and boobs (and screaming) hilarious, this movie is worth a look over a beer and popcorn.

1.0,Essentially just a booby pic.,"""Piranha 3DD"" is a film which is mostly just an excuse to show very naked women. The movie is essentially a bad disaster film combined with a soft core porno flick. I don't understand the combination and would recommend viewers who want to see copious nudity find something better and without the silly piranha plot...either a good porno or a good disaster film.The film is set at a water park where the owner has hired strippers as lifeguards. In addition to seeing various sexy ladies naked, you eventually see insane fish show up and chomp on everyone. 'Nuff said about the plot!The fact that ""Piranha 3DD"" is on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list isn't much of a surprise. After all, it's got '3DD' in the title and is rauchier and sillier than a Porky's film. Add to that cartoonish characters and dopey dialog and you have a film which seems bound to lose a lot of money. In the US, the distributors barely tried to recoup their losses but amazingly the picture did reasonably well overseas.As for me, I'm a bit ashamed I watched it. While I have been working hard to see every one of the Bottom 100, this one is dumber and dirtier than pretty much all the rest.",essentially just booby pic,piranha 3dd is film which is mostly just excuse show very naked women movie is essentially bad disaster film combined with soft core porno flick i dont understand combination would recommend viewers who want see copious nudity find something better without silly piranha plot either good porno or good disaster film film is set at water park where owner has hired strippers as lifeguards addition seeing various sexy ladies naked you eventually see insane fish show up chomp everyone nuff said about plot fact that piranha 3dd is imdbs infamous bottom 100 list isnt much surprise after all its got 3dd title is rauchier sillier than porkys film add that cartoonish characters dopey dialog you have film which seems bound lose lot money us distributors barely tried recoup their losses but amazingly picture did reasonably well overseas as me im bit ashamed i watched it while i have been working hard see every one bottom 100 this one is dumber dirtier than pretty much all rest,0.5637878787878786,0.06628787878787878,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.29}"
2.0,Exhaustingly incompetent and ferociously indulgent,"Piranha 3DD is the first 3D film, or ""3DD"" film in this case, to be released both theatrically and through video on demand. I wouldn't even call this 3D. All you get are creatures, breasts, blood, water, and vomit careening towards the camera amateurishly and in an unnecessary fashion. At least it's in bright colors and not dimmed with a ludicrous surcharge.The film is an affront to the genre of horror-comedy, shielded by the unacceptable and numbing phrase ""leave your brain at the door,"" and atrociously erected off of clichés, idiocy, and nude characters. The original Piranha 3D was a surprising summer success, and to be fair, it wasn't horrifically awful. The actors in it knew they were in a goofy, outrageous B-movie ode, and some sequences were well arranged. The problem? The CGI, which killed many of the death scenes, making them look implausible and unrealistic, virtually killed the mood and the idea that this was a low budget, cheesy horror flick.And now, the marginally passable horror flick has a sequel leaching off of it, that pushes the envelope of parody so far that it becomes dreadfully incompetent. It is so indulgent, always trying to be so witty and cute with its puns, references, and spoof-elements that the stench of desperation quickly fogs the screen.Instead of a beach, this time, we are taken to a water-park, ran by the royally perverted and careless step-dad of our main character (Koecher). He is so pre-occupied with prepubescent fantasies that he ignores everyone around him completely. His daughter Maddy (Panabaker), co-owner of the water-park and aspiring marine biologist, is concerned that with the rumor of piranhas swimming through sewers and drain pipes that they may be a hazard to the park. Her step-dad doesn't listen, and it isn't before long that he gets his comeuppance.The remainder of the picture is a mindless shows for the kiddies, containing more breasts than anything I've seen this whole year, sometimes even two or more pairs per frame. The film is so juvenile, crass, and filthy-minded, and the characters so impotent, one-note, and poor that one can not help either drifting away while watching or just simply not caring.There is a degrading, nasty scene in the film I'd like to discuss. It involves a piranha festering around the part of a woman that goes without saying, before it leapfrogs and jumps out onto that part of a man that goes without saying, before he has to cut the whole thing off with scissors. The scene is nothing short of unnecessary and borderline reprehensible.One thing that Piranha 3D had was the star-power its sequel woefully lacks. It had the appearances of great actors like Elizabeth Shue, Jerry O'Connell, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd, showing despite their well deserved success, could still pull off a campy exercise relatively well. Lloyd makes a cameo in a scene far too short, Rhames does too and earns the only laughs the picture sees, and David Hasselhoff, portraying himself as a lifeguard, shows us why he has fallen off the face of the mainstream world in the first place.Now, maybe I'm being too brazen and unfair. Piranha 3DD is a fairly harmless piece of work, but not a good one at that. Its structure of scantily clad women, many full-frontally nude, phoned-in characters, too little, too late cameos, third rate special effects, and cheap, nonexistent suspense wears so thin so quickly it becomes appalling. I have no problem with horror, even when it creates a hybrid with the neighboring genre of comedy, but this is a work of hybrid indulgence and overkill.NOTE: The film ends the same way Piranha 3D ended, with an abrupt, unsuspecting scene that provides us with one last quick jump and conveniently leaves the franchise open for another sequel. Though with the very secluded release of this sequel, I wouldn't put all my money on ""3DDD"" so quickly.Starring: Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner, Chris Zylka, Katrina Bowden, Gary Busey, Christopher Lloyd, and David Hasselhoff.

2.0,makes the first one look like the best horror movie ever made!,"Has anyone ever watched Severance? Now there's a beautiful example of a horror movie with just the right amount of pitch black humor. I loved it!This total piece of garbage? Oh, please! I have to dig deep into the Steven Seagal archive to find movies that are equally uninspired. It doesn't work as a horror movie (no suspense!) and it sure as hell doesn't work as a comedy (bad, lame and sick jokes at best!). The worst part is that only after one hour does the movie decide to wanna be a comedy as well. Until then they desperately try to create suspenseful scenes, in which people almost get bitten. It's like saying: ""Well, we just can't seem to make it scary. Let's turn it into a travesty. Ideas? Anyone? Say what? A fish inside of her...? And then it bites into his...? Awesome! Let's do this. Quick, guys, before I get sober again!""Do you know what made the first one good? It packs a brutal punch but still finds the time to tell a story and develop some characters.3DD fails to deliver on all fronts.

,Nauseating Garbage,If you have seen any one of the Piranha movies going all the way back to 1978 then what is shown here is more of the same. By casting David Hasselhoff as himself they showed they really weren't even trying with this one.The only awards the female lead Danielle Panabaker might win for her performance here is an Amber Tamblyn lookalike contest. Set in the water park equivalent of a strip club with profoundly unlikeable and spectacularly dumb characters the essential hook here is to show naked people (Mostly women) and gore which is not something everyone wants to see together or even separately.The gross-out factor gets to be pretty intense and for the second one of these movies in a row male genital mutilation is served up for audience approval and that isn't even the most disgusting thing shown. What we see readily earns this flick its R rating within 10 minutes. There is political incorrectness and then there is Girls Gone Wild out-takes intercut with cheap indie horror. The piranhas look like claymation when you see them up close. You'd expect more from a production with a estimated $20 million budget.Shot in Wilmington.

4.0,The Aquatic Penis Munching Continues,"The aquatic penis munching and poor character choices continue in Piranha 3DD, the even goofier follow-up to Alexandre Aja's surprisingly entertaining 2010 remake, the former of which has just been made available on DVD and Blu-ray. Although containing plenty of both intentional and unintentional laughs, ""3DD"" often mistakes simple-minded schlock cinema for parody and balls-out nonsense for organic fun. The Weinstein Company/Dimension Films should strongly consider packing this disc with a six pack of beer combo offer.It's really no surprise that an influx of gratuitous nudity, celebrity cameos (as game and often ironically funny as they often are) and heaps of sheer camp can do little to raise Piranha 3DD to the level of its predecessor. It's even less mysterious as to how populating this film with jerks, ditsy bitches and pure morons (who are seemingly all bipolar judging by their mood, rationalizing and motivations) fail to make for a compelling B-movie. Of course we expect these human-shaped hunks of piranha fodder to make poor decisions for the sake of crimson water, but when it seems like the writers are intentionally trying to craft most of these individuals with the IQ of water-logged bait worms, it comes off more as insulting.A year has passed since the massacre at Lake Victoria, and following an eradication campaign that led to the complete and utter contamination of the water, the town's tourist industry has been likewise extinguished. But to paraphrase Dr. Malcolm from Jurassic Park, ""life finds a way"" and a newly evolved school of prehistoric nasties has managed to elope to another nearby lake, which unlucky for its inhabitants, supplies the local water park called ""The Big Wet."" Oh and in case you were even going to ask, these piranha have mutated to thrive in chlorinated water or something, so the attack may, in fact, commence without delay. Of the things to enjoy in Piranha 3DD, it's bar none the extended cameos from Ving Rhames (complete with a shotgun leg) and a booze-swilling, out-of-shape David Hasselhoff whose self-lampooning is the only effective instance of parody to be found in this sequel. His reluctant ""celebrity appearance"" at the opening of ""The Big Wet"" amounts to nearly all of the films involuntary chuckles and his bond with a young boy (which forms because he is the only one who doesn't recognize him as the star from Baywatch) is close to the stuff of comedy gold. Aside from those fleeting moments of inspiration, Piranha 3DD is missed opportunity after miscalculated set-piece. I mean, if you've managed to devise a scenario where a fish has managed to enter (and live in) a woman's vagina and then manage to overlook the chance to make an ""eating out"" joke, the filmmakers have failed us all. As far as high camp is concerned, you could certainly find more blasé fare, though that doesn't excuse this film from being an unnecessary sequel that seems to think its audience consists of horny preteens who have never seen a proper parody rather than horror buffs looking for a faithful and lovingly crafted follow-up to Piranha 3D.",aquatic penis munching continues,aquatic penis munching poor character choices continue piranha 3dd even goofier follow up alexandre ajas surprisingly entertaining 2010 remake former which has just been made available dvd blu ray although containing plenty both intentional unintentional laughs 3dd often mistakes simple minded schlock cinema parody balls out nonsense organic fun weinstein company dimension films should strongly consider packing this disc with six pack beer combo offer its really no surprise that influx gratuitous nudity celebrity cameos as game often ironically funny as they often are heaps sheer camp can do little raise piranha 3dd level its predecessor its even less mysterious as how populating this film with jerks ditsy bitches pure morons who are seemingly all bipolar judging by their mood rationalizing motivations fail make compelling b movie course we expect these human shaped hunks piranha fodder make poor decisions sake crimson water but when it seems like writers are intentionally trying craft most these individuals with iq water logged bait worms it comes off more as insulting year has passed since massacre at lake victoria following eradication campaign that led complete utter contamination water towns tourist industry has been likewise extinguished but paraphrase dr malcolm jurassic park life finds way newly evolved school prehistoric nasties has managed elope another nearby lake which unlucky its inhabitants supplies local water park called big wet oh case you were even going ask these piranha have mutated thrive chlorinated water or something so attack may fact commence without delay things enjoy piranha 3dd its bar none extended cameos ving rhames complete with shotgun leg booze swilling out shape david hasselhoff whose self lampooning is only effective instance parody be found this sequel his reluctant celebrity appearance at opening big wet amounts nearly all films involuntary chuckles his bond with young boy which forms because he is only one who doesnt recognize him as star baywatch is close stuff comedy gold aside those fleeting moments inspiration piranha 3dd is missed opportunity after miscalculated set piece i mean if youve managed devise scenario where fish has managed enter live womans vagina then manage overlook chance make eating out joke filmmakers have failed us all as far as high camp is concerned you could certainly find more blas fare though that doesnt excuse this film being unnecessary sequel that seems think its audience consists horny preteens who have never seen proper parody rather than horror buffs looking faithful lovingly crafted follow up piranha 3d,0.5175284356166708,0.014273830744418974,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.44}"

But after we know in which direction this film is taking us - an 'Adults only'-pool with water certified strippers - and the awful acting of several supporting cast members, I knew this wasn't gonna be the good-kinda-bad. Sadly ""Piranha 3DD"" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself). This one just lacks originality.

There is some backstory, but it really doesn't matter - all that matters are the sporadic chompings of individuals leading up to the wholesale slaughter which comprises the final section.For those who saw the first movie, there is little to surprise them here - a moderate amount of nudity, a huge amount of gore, a cast of unknowns, and a scattering of cameos (Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames made return visits). There is an attempt to recapture the gleeful sleazy trashiness of its predecessor, although I felt it tried a bit too hard, and lost some of the innocent sense of fun to be had among the severed penis sequences (and, yes, I am quite aware of how ludicrous that sentence sounds).Making up for everything, though, is a wonderfully funny and self-deprecating performance from David Hasselhoff - the Hoff lampoons his own perceived pomposity mercilessly and with pinpoint accuracy.

2.0,CRAP to an EXTREME,"Wow. Just wow. Let me note that I enjoyed the first Piranha, and went into this movie with an open mind (despite horrible reviews). What a absolutely HORRIBLE sequel. The time around, the directors have obviously run out of ideas. It was a sequel to a movie that didn't need a sequel. You can only get about 1 good movie from a concept as simple as piranhas, and that's all but clear, seeing as this movie sucked. First of all, this movie is disgusting. You see a fat mans bloody ass, the tip of a severed penis, gore galore (and not the good kind...the bad overly bloody fake looking kind), and a piranha that swam up a girls v- a-g. At points you could tell the piranha's were puppets, and the puns were cheesy one liners at best. The whole film made me nauseous, and the deaths of several people were fake as fake can be. A guy gets decapitated from a yellow flag ribbon...yah...that's right...a guy's head gets severed (though the neck bone and all), by a piece of plastic that is soft, stretchy, only about 1 nano-meter thick, and not even sharp. There is also a guy who gets skewered through the eye, because of an explosion that caused a trident to have impeccable aim falling from the sky. Also, one of the main characters has enough aim to skewer a bag of chips and a piranha perfectly from a good 20 feet away, which begs the question of how he is a lifeguard. The whole film makes no sense, with a girl who has a seizure while having sex (due to a piranha inside her)only to come back to life once a guy severs his pen!s, and the kick- butt black man from the first movie has a shot gun leg. And finally, the ending sucked to an extreme. The piranhas have now begun to walk (or really hop), at the end, only to cut off the entire head of a really nice innocent kid, just for a cheesy one liner that wasn't even funny. In short, this movie is complete an utter crap. Avoid watching (unless you like stupid, gross, and fake movies).",crap extreme,wow just wow let me note that i enjoyed first piranha went into this movie with open mind despite horrible reviews what absolutely horrible sequel time around directors have obviously run out ideas it was sequel movie that didnt need sequel you can only get about 1 good movie concept as simple as piranhas thats all but clear seeing as this movie sucked first all this movie is disgusting you see fat mans bloody ass tip severed penis gore galore not good kind bad overly bloody fake looking kind piranha that swam up girls v g at points you could tell piranhas were puppets puns were cheesy one liners at best whole film made me nauseous deaths several people were fake as fake can be guy gets decapitated yellow flag ribbon yah thats right guys head gets severed though neck bone all by piece plastic that is soft stretchy only about 1 nano meter thick not even sharp there is also guy who gets skewered through eye because explosion that caused trident have impeccable aim falling sky also one main characters has enough aim skewer bag chips piranha perfectly good 20 feet away which begs question how he is lifeguard whole film makes no sense with girl who has seizure while having sex due piranha inside her only come back life once guy severs his pen s kick butt black man first movie has shot gun leg finally ending sucked extreme piranhas have now begun walk or really hop at end only cut off entire head really nice innocent kid just cheesy one liner that wasnt even funny short this movie is complete utter crap avoid watching unless you like stupid gross fake movies,0.6710577673692427,-0.05761124121779859,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"

As with the first one there is lots of nudity and lots of gore! Which I like. Danielle Panabaker is great as the lead and done well with this film. Ving Rhames was back and that was just delightful. David Hasselfhoff - well, what can you say about David? Just too awesome for words. Katrina Bowden gives us the best line in the film ""Josh cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina"" then of course Ving with his ""Bring me my legs"". The other cast members were hilarious! It was great seeing some not so familiar faces. The effects (again) were not amazing but enjoyable non the less. The deaths were inventive and funny (wait for the last one)! And of course - Christopher Lloyd, amazingly crazy once again. I gave the Piranha 3D 9/10, this one I give 8/10. It's awesome but the first one is, well... AMAZING! Just don't take the film so seriously, just enjoy it, have a laugh and smile! When this comes on DVD I will have my beer and pizza ready!

1.0,Feels like it was written by 8th graders,"I really enjoyed 2010's remake of ""Piranha."" It was a rare type that managed to not only work as a stand alone movie, but delivered everything that it promised: boobs, gore, and comedy. It was also well directed, acted, and had a level of wit within the proceedings.Well, the studio decided that it was a movie that warranted a sequel, and decided to hand over the reigns to the guys that brought you ""Feast."" Well, with it's small (about 75 theaters) theatrical release and On-Demand run, it's easy to see why it's not getting a whole lot as far as promotion is concerned: it's a really s#!tty movie.Taking place one year after the events of the first movie, the movie opens with a cameo from Gary Busey and Clu Gulagar becoming food for Piranhas that come out of a dead but still flatulent cow. Yes, that is the level of humor we are dealing with. Brace yourself, because it gets worse.The next day, Maddy (Daniel Panabaker) is in a bit of a disagreement with her stepfather Chet (David Koechner) because he's turned the family water park (called ""The Big Wet"") into a more adult oriented place with strippers as lifeguards. However, the piranha's are back, and headed to the pool via the pipe system. Her friends Barry (Matt Bush) and Kyle (Chris Zykla) must now try to do something to stop the upcoming onslaught-and you can guess how that goes. Meanwhile, Shelby (Katrina Bowden) is ready to lose her virginity, but a baby piranha goes up her...um, lady parts. Also, Ving Rhames, Paul Sheer and Christpher Lloyd return, and David Hasselhoff shows up as himself.The best word I can think of describing ""Piranha 3DD"" (ha ha) would be ""lazy."" The direction by John Gulagar ranges from pedestrian to just plain bad, with murky underwater shots, poor editing and no clue how to direct moments of violence or any of the actors. Here, you have people who have proved themselves to be good to decent actors delivering awful performances, with some (in particular Rhames) seeming to be embarrassed to be there. In their defense, they are working with a script that feels like it was written by 8th graders. This is a movie where people do things that are dumb even by the standards of horror movies, and characters change motivations (Kyle goes from being an alright guy to a total asshole just completely out of the blue) without any attention to consistency.So, does the humor work? Well, as you can tell from the third paragraph, no. There's one moment that's funny, but most of the movie plays out like something you'd get from a really bad comedy (stuff like ""Fired Up!"") with gore and female nudity. This is movie that thinks a piranha going up a fat man's ass is great comedy. How about the gore? It's pretty tame compared to the last movie, with the inevitable water park massacre feeling anemic in comparison to the all out slaughter fest of the last movie. Sure, there's decapitations and blood in the water, but it's nothing you haven't seen a billion times before.Now I know, I know. ""It's supposed to be dumb!"" you might be saying. Hell, I enjoy dumb entertainment as much as the next guy. This however, is the bad kind of dumb entertainment. The kind that makes no effort whatsoever, and expects you to go along with it because hey man, tits and ass and gore! I'm sorry, but it takes more than that to make a good trashy movie. This is the kind of thing that gives trash a bad name. Being dumb is no excuse for being lazy.It's really no surprise as to why this didn't get a wide theatrical release and has gotten next to no promotion-it f#@%ing sucks. Everything about this feels like a really bad direct-to-video sequel, and that the studio had no idea what to do with it. This is a movie that's best left avoided.

8.0,A total trashy tongue-in-cheek treat,"The ferocious flesh-eating prehistoric fish make a bee-line down river so they can snack on the hard-partying tourists at the grand opening of the Big Wet Water Park. Yep, that's about it for the admittedly flimsy plot, but fortunately director John Gulager and screenwriters Patrick Melton, Joel Soisson, and Marcus Dunstan don't take any of this cheery spirited foolishness seriously for a minute; instead they pile on the tasty excessive gratuitous distaff nudity, over-the-top graphic gore, and blithely rude'n'crude humor with a go-for-broke spoofy joy and brio that's both uproarious and entertaining in good measure. The whole gloriously tasteless affair reaches its jaw-dropping sick'n'sidesplitting apex during an outrageous coitus interuptus set piece that's truly something special to behold. The lively cast really sink their teeth into the endearingly crass material: The foxy Danielle Panabaker makes for an appealing and attractive heroine as the spunky Maddy, Matt Bush contributes an engaging turn as the amiable Barry, David Koechner jerks it up nicely as smarmy amusement park owner Chet, Chris Zylka likewise hits it out of the slimy ballpark as hunky, but sleazy and corrupt deputy Kyle, Katrina Bowden brings a cute charm to her part as sweet virgin Shelby, Christopher Lloyd ravenously devours the scenery as flaky fish expert Mr. Goodman, and Ving Rhames has several sidesplitting moments struggling to surmount his hydrophobia as the scared and crippled Deputy Fallon. Best of all, the Almighty Hoffmeister sends up his pumped-up pompous ""Baywatch"" persona something rotten as his own supremely cool and self-deprecating self. Gary Busey and Clu Gulager both get munched early in the action. The outtakes during the end credits are simply priceless.

1.0,One of the worst films ever made - and not in a good way,"The first Piranha surprised audiences in 2010 with its wit, over the top nudity, and excessive gore. It never took itself seriously and had a solid cast. This follow-up to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had, but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction, laughably bad acting and dialogue, and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.Why is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot - there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.So which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters ""Welcome to rock bottom."" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.And also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.I have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully). Don't waste your time.",one worst films ever made not good way,first piranha surprised audiences 2010 with its wit over top nudity excessive gore it never took itself seriously had solid cast this follow up 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing it had all elements that first movie had but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction laughably bad acting dialogue some cheapest gore effects ive ever seen why is this movie so bad lets start with plot there is none if you can buy premise that piranhas are going go underground lakes somehow end up water park swimming well then i have bridge sell you as well characters are all terrible one couple van early exists only die no other purpose no even attempted development yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance only its forgotten 5 minutes later one scene that people will probably remember involves girl that had piranha swim up her lady parts somehow survive only bite her boyfriends penis during intercourse trying be inventive there but really just shows lack any restraint with this movie but even if you think plot acting are atrocious at least there will be good gore right wrong gore effects can be described one word cheap special effects with piranhas are terrible too you wonder where they spent 20 million this movie not mention inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence lacks any punch it looks like they just poured some red dye pool hired few extras flop around massacre scene first film had some best gore effects id ever seen this is joke follow up so which actors disgraced themselves paycheck there is cameo by david hasselhoff where hes basically mocking himself but you have wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters welcome rock bottom i wonder if irony is lost this man david koechner is just obnoxious terrible jerry oconnell played this type character way better first film every time koechner was screen i was just wanting him get killed off already also surprisingly we dont even get any good nudity all extras they hired this movie look like washed up strippers none cute female leads goes topless maybe they ran out budget couldnt pay them enough do it i have feeling that 95 people involved this film will ever have meaningful work hollywood again thankfully dont waste your time,0.5430335097001764,-0.007462522045855379,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"

It's not even possible for the piranha to just crawl up between her legs and she didn't notice. Also, the piranha would just eat her, not live in her genitalia. This is just some really stupid film.

4.0,Is This A Propaganda Film By The Taliban ?,"I'd nearly written this review before I'd even seen it . Something along the lines of "" I really hate 3-D BLAH BLAH BLAH . The narrative drive is held up by self congratulatory mis-en-scene BLAH BLAH BLAH . The camera angles are of an unnatural nature BLAH BLAH BLAH "" and my fears were confirmed by the opening pre-title sequence as we're shown long lingering shots that merely exist to show the audience this is a film in 3-D but after this I saw something totally unexpected - a film so bad it made me forget I was watching something with a gimmick and made me think I was watching something produced by either Mad Mullah Omar or Fred Phelps From the outset we're watching a film that has an entirely ethnocentric world view of America . People of the United states are very young , impossibly good looking and incredibly stupid . The only people who aren't are very old , very ugly and very stupid and everyone has a sex drive higher than Mount Everest . This is acceptable if you're good looking and female and totally disgusting if you're notWe're introduced to heroine Maddy and villain Chet her stepfather . We know Maddy is the heroine because her breasts can't be bigger than 34B and are natural unlike 99% of the women featured . One wonders how the other women can swim since their obviously enhanced boobs make it aerodynamically impossible . We know instantly Chet is the villain because he own's 51% of the water-park to Maddy's 49%. That and the fact Chet comes across as so creepy you just want to look him up on the Megan's Law website And that's the thing about PIRANHA 3-DD . The humour relies on innuendo but it's not the type of naughty but nice innuendo you see in the likes of THE BENNY HILL SHOW but this lazy near the knuckle humour along the lines of "" Are you still wet "" that wasn't funny to begin with and continues for most of the film , so much so you find yourself very tempted to switch off What saves the film from being a total disaster is that the final third works very well when we're introduced to David Hasselhoff playing ..... David Hssselhoffa sort of hetrosexual Liberace . The set-piece of the piranha attacking the swimmers at the water-park are very entertaining in a tasteless way . One thing I remember about the Joe Dante original is the lack of internal logic where people wade through the water for no other reason than to be eaten . This is referenced by a woman asking for the Hoff to help and his replying that "" They've only got themselves to blame by staying in the water . What'd expect the fish to do ? Follow them home "" which had me laughing out-loud while wondering why this type of post modernist wit wasn't employed earlier ? In short this is a very uneven film . It's trash as so many people have said but some of it is slightly witty , or rather slightly witty in comparison with much of the other humour employed . Being a 3-D movie many scenes merely exist to show the audience that it's a 3-D movie whilst some scenes exist merely to show that America has a monopoly on bikini babes with silicon breasts.

1.0,Piranha 3DD,"The first film is viciously grisly, darkly funny and in moments sexy, when I found out there was going to be a sequel I was naturally excited, and the pun title gave a clue as to what would feature, 3D effects and bigger (double D) breasts. Basically it has been one year since the events at Lake Victoria, which has become a deserted and restricted area, dried up and deserted due to no tourism after the infestation of prehistoric piranha fish. But this threat is to return when in a nearby lake farmer Clayton (Gary Busey) and his friend are in the water to recover a dead cow, and below them are many more of the fish eggs that hatch, and they attack and kill the two men. Not far away, the Big Wet water park is making preparations to open to the public for the summer, and marine biology student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), who co-owns the park, doesn't approve of her step-father Chet (David Koechner) adding an adult-themed section and hiring strippers. She also reacquaints herself with old friends, like policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (Chris Zylka), friend Barry (Matt Bush) who has had a secret crush on her for ages, and close friends Ashley Fallon (Meagan Tandy) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). One night Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny dipping in the lake, and a baby piranha swims up into her vagina, and at the same time Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) are having sex in their van when the handbrake is tripped and they go into the lake to be devoured by the fish. The next day Maddy consoles Shelby on the jetty, and it is there that piranhas attack them, but they get out of it and manage to have one of the fish swim on the shore to kill it. The two of them and Barry go to see Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) to examine the fish, and he gives them the explanation that the fish are moving via sewage pipes and underground in the unseen lakes below, they conclude that the drains the fish may use go from the lake and lead into the new water park. While something is to be done, Shelby and Josh have sex, and the piranha in her vagina comes out to bite his penis, so he chops it off with a knife, and they both go to hospital. Maddy finds out that Kyle is not all that good as well, he has been accepting bribes that allow Chet to drain water for the water park from the lake, with the vast amount coming from the underground lakes. Big Wet opens to the public, with Baywatch star David Hasselhoff appearing as a celebrity lifeguard, and also arriving is Lake Victoria survivor Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames), who lost his legs, and former cameraman Andrew 'Drew' Cunningham (Paul Scheer) who pushes his wheelchair. Maddy tries to shut the park down, but Chet and Kyle stop her doing anything as they do not believe there will be any piranhas, but of course soon enough the fish come along and attack all the guests and lifeguards. Fallon has a shotgun attached to his legs and shoot many of the blood thirsty monsters, and Hasslehoff feels happy that he rescued a little boy - his first rescue in real life, and in the chaos, Chet makes a run with the money he made, before having his head sliced off by a cable. Barry starts to drain the pool to stop the fish getting in and the water flowing to dry the place out, but in the pool Maddy gets pulled down by suction, Kyle refuses to save her, so Barry, who can't swim, leaps in and saves her. Another employee at the same pours gasoline into the pipe system, and with a lit cigarette put in as well an explosion causes most of the piranhas to be blown up, and Kyle is impaled by a falling trident. As Massy and Barry kiss and feel relieved it is over, Mr. Goodman calls them and informs them that the fish are evolving, as his in the tank has grown legs and run away, and soon enough one piranha crawls out the water to attack the boy Hasselhoff rescued. Panabaker is rather dull, Lloyd is still relatively amusing, and Hasselhoff badly spoofs himself, and director John Gulager badly paces the action when it is supposed to be exciting, there are so many problems with this follow up to a hit movie. The story needed a lot of work, the acting is daft, the gore was less grisly and did not appear often enough, the penis munching and cutting sequence is just disgusting, the special effects are wasted, and no big boobs bouncing and flashing can save it, it is a terrible horror comedy sequel.
