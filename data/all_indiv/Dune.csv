10.0,"My movie of 2021, so far.","It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.The story is somehow easier to follow than in the last adaptation, motives and actions are easier to see and follow. I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.",my movie 2021 so far,its been amazing being back cinemas after last year i have seen some good films some shockers this though is first great film year me story is somehow easier follow than last adaptation motives actions are easier see follow i felt as though book had come life here even if there are couple changes acting is impressive as is music visuals however are most incredible thing about this film it looks awe inspiring battles are epic staging is impressive you almost feel close action i cannot praise that element highly enough when i saw part one i was little surprised i was little more surprised by ending i only hope wait isnt too long pacing considering where film ends it never felt slow or drawn out i was captivated start finish truly i was blown away 10 10,0.5686666666666668,0.26099999999999995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,DUNE - A Great Modern Sci-Fi,"Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible for decades, to write and direct a faithful adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. And I'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. And to this day, it's one of the best stories I've ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn't enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than Lynch ever could. But on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.From reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. It's kind of how they did it with ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy.But, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. I've seen it in IMAX twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. It's epic in every meaning of the word. And all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.The actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn't get enough screen time.This movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second IMAX viewing, i felt that Villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. But that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could've dived deeper into the lore. Two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. And with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.But that being said, I had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. I've been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. And still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made DUNE. It's finally here, it's gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it's two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it's still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic CGI and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. It's most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. We need part 2, we need it badly. This story deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template.",dune great modern sci fi,denis villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible decades write direct faithful adaptation fantastic 1965 sci fi novel by frank herbert im here tell you he has done it he has actually done it i was introduced world dune 1992 by playing video game dune released that year story completely captivated me so i decided read book this day its one best stories ive ever read tale absolutely grand scale filled with details making it really hard adapt big screen even today with all technology we have at our disposal i saw film made by david lynch few years after i read book about 10 years after it was released i didnt enjoy it much 1984 film completely fails at capturing very essence novel feels shallow unfocused one main differences with this movie 1984 movie is that villeneuve has only centered first half first novel with over two half hours runtime he is able concentrate more small details than lynch ever could but flip side this also means that this movie has no conclusion reading book i know what comes next i know how this story ends but lot people watching this movie especially those who havent read book can obviously feel like they were watching prologue something great that never happens this is very risky move by both villeneuve production companies because this can only work if part 2 is released conclude story its kind how they did it with lord rings trilogy but still without conclusion what massive blast movie this is ive seen it imax twice already grand scale everything sandworms space ships ornithopters buildings sound effects soundtrack locations its epic every meaning word all this without losing track deep relationships between characters this is movie that manages perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions actors are near perfectly cast all carrying their roles really well although i felt some them didnt get enough screen time this movie does follow book quite closely but some things has been changed or left out fit movie format i must admit that during my second imax viewing i felt that villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as mini series instead but that would have dramatically changed grand scale everything but other hand he couldve dived deeper into lore two half hours adapt half first novel is cutting it real tight with all stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie it can become somewhat difficult follow understand it all but that being said i had really high hopes this film i was one those people hyped beyond belief ive been waiting this movie about 30 years still most this movie is either as i imagined it myself or better what denis villeneuve has accomplished here is actually quite astonishing he has actually made dune its finally here its gigantic close everything i asked only big drawback is as i mentioned that this movie has no conclusion its two half hours build up something great that never happens but its still huge epic packed with awesome soundtrack solid acting fantastic cgi sound effects jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography its most definitively made big screen absolutely no doubt about that denis villeneuve has once again shown us hes force be reckoned with brilliant filmmaker one best his generation even one best all time i give this movie 9 out 10 we need part 2 we need it badly this story deserves be concluded but if it never comes i will just imagine last half first novel with this movie as template,0.5211257763975153,0.17111024844720502,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,"""He shall know your ways as though born to them.""","It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.",he shall know your ways as though born them,its been some time since ive read frank herbert novel i had already forgotten much story however it wasnt problem picking things up as characters situations presented themselves this film so id have say that was plus this viewer scope this picture is quite outstanding spanning as it does complex fragmented universe worlds kingdoms central story is valued importance placed spice thats preferred hallucinogenic some elite important component required interstellar travel novel i believe it was something as common as cinnamon but planet arrakis required intensive mining operation reclaim it barren desert soil which its found entire story is veiled with mystical sort ambiance which protagonist paul atreides timoth e chalamet learns his destiny while obliquely being referred as one legend person who will come into great power quite honestly setting costuming characterizations palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent star wars even if original novel was written over decade before george lucas arrived scene even hostile environment arrakis has feel tatooine with appearance shai hulud recalling sarlacc one jabba hutts favorite pets what surprised me with this first installment dune saga was how well director denis villeneuve managed condense epic scope massive novel onto film even if half story is yet be told movie incorporates most critical elements novel into narrative that works really well even though i actually did enjoy 1984 version directed by david lynch this one proves be more inclusive events novel i look forward successful conclusion saga due time,0.5567307692307693,0.21474358974358976,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.47}"
4.0,Dune- as Endless as a Desert.,"There is probably no point in warning about spoilers for this film. You've probably read the book or seen either the 1984 Dino DeLaurentis version or the 2000 Sci-Fi mini-series.... If you've seen either one of those, you've seen this movie. This movie only covers half the story, the sequel we'll probably never get to see will cover the other half.So how does it stack up? Not well, in my opinion. It's a loud, dull action movie, with an ear-splitting soundtrack. It has all the scenes you might have seen if you watched either of those two versions, but didn't do them nearly as well.At two and a half hours, it drags on. The Lynch version of the film was 137 minutes, and got the whole story in. This film leaves key aspects out, and only tells half the story, and it just goes on and on and on.To start, let's talk about characters. DeLaurentis got a cast of largely unknowns back then, many of whom went on to distinguish themselves. Kyle MacLachlin, Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, Sean Young. Heck, even the little girl actress, Alicia Witt, went on to have a career as an adult. This movie uses a cast of people you've heard of, and their screen time is often based on ""I know who that is."" Other characters, more critical ones, were kind of shuffled to the side.I'll give two examples. A key point in the book is that the betrayal by Dr. Yeuh, (played here with no charisma by Cheng Chen) because as a Suk Physician, taking a human life is against his conditioning. No build up, no nothing, he just does it.On the other hand, because Duncan Idaho is played by Jason Momoa, he gets a lot more screen time than his presence in the book. (Duncan's clones become a much more important part of later books, but that's neither here nor there.) His final fight scene goes on interminably here, while they were quickly brushed over in the previous versions.Similarly, while Peter DeVries is a key player in the book, here they don't even mention him by name, and he's just ""Henchman who gets poisoned"". Other characters are omitted altogether, including Emperor Shaddam, Princess Irulan and Feyd Ruatha. Concepts such as the Mentats, Guild, Bene Geserit, are kind of glossed over to get to those sweet, sweet action sequences.The movie rises and falls on the actor who plays Paul Atreides... and again, he's actually closer to the age that the character is supposed to be at the beginning of the book, but he comes off as a little Emo.Again, trippy as it was, the 1984 version did this better. The Sci-Fi Channel did it better... Now, this film really LOOKS good. The visuals are immersive. But without strong characters and story to back them up, what's the point? It's almost like watching a Transformers movie. The thing is, they HAD strong characters and a story... they just didn't use them.",dune as endless as desert,there is probably no point warning about spoilers this film youve probably read book or seen either 1984 dino delaurentis version or 2000 sci fi mini series if youve seen either one those youve seen this movie this movie only covers half story sequel well probably never get see will cover other half so how does it stack up not well my opinion its loud dull action movie with ear splitting soundtrack it has all scenes you might have seen if you watched either those two versions but didnt do them nearly as well at two half hours it drags lynch version film was 137 minutes got whole story this film leaves key aspects out only tells half story it just goes start lets talk about characters delaurentis got cast largely unknowns back then many whom went distinguish themselves kyle maclachlin patrick stewart dean stockwell sean young heck even little girl actress alicia witt went have career as adult this movie uses cast people youve heard their screen time is often based i know who that is other characters more critical ones were kind shuffled side ill give two examples key point book is that betrayal by dr yeuh played here with no charisma by cheng chen because as suk physician taking human life is against his conditioning no build up no nothing he just does it other hand because duncan idaho is played by jason momoa he gets lot more screen time than his presence book duncans clones become much more important part later books but thats neither here nor there his final fight scene goes interminably here while they were quickly brushed over previous versions similarly while peter devries is key player book here they dont even mention him by name hes just henchman who gets poisoned other characters are omitted altogether including emperor shaddam princess irulan feyd ruatha concepts such as mentats guild bene geserit are kind glossed over get those sweet sweet action sequences movie rises falls actor who plays paul atreides again hes actually closer age that character is supposed be at beginning book but he comes off as little emo again trippy as it was 1984 version did this better sci fi channel did it better now this film really looks good visuals are immersive but without strong characters story back them up whats point its almost like watching transformers movie thing is they had strong characters story they just didnt use them,0.4976648351648353,0.10492216117216119,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9.0,Amazing cinematic experience,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Dune. Part I"" (2021) was amazing cinematic experience. This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of ""Blade Runner 2049"" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!",amazing cinematic experience,greetings lithuania dune part i 2021 was amazing cinematic experience this is movie that demands be seen big screen no less i havent read book nor seen previous version it therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh me i wont lie i did felt be lost here there but at end day storyline was clear visual side this movie was staggering this is 100 movie going experience special effects looked as real as it gets if you enjoyed visual side blade runner 2049 you will get same here grandiose sets design sound all technical stuff this movie at every scene looked breathtaking yet i wished cinematography was done by roger deakins but still it was solid but could been even better acting was very good by all involved you cant ask more such cast overall few reasons why i did not gave it 10 10 is because it did felt like set up story more then once way more then once also there are some pacing issues here there finally this movie will loose 80 its visual side when watched at home my opinion this is real movie going experience but at end i liked it very much would like see part ii fingers crossed,0.38920931449502877,0.2390538984824699,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,"Started off sensational, but eventually overlong with too much going on for too little happening.","Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.",started off sensational but eventually overlong with too much going too little happening,although film is called dune opening title refers it as dune part one i knew when i saw this it probably should have been better wait part two before watching it as result some characters felt underdeveloped some simply vanished halfway through movie they also kept talking about paul atreides timothee chalamet being one but one what this somehow reminded me neo matrix also being one regardless dune is spectacle note stunning visuals state art cgi production design cinematography good performances stellar cast great score this is one amazing movie sure film wont satisfy everyones palate if youre not sci fi fantasy fan dune will not appeal you however one cant help but be impressed by what theyve accomplished ok now you can crucify me if you want but me there were some issues with film with movie being so long i later found myself thinking theres hell lot going with very little happening maybe this is because this is not completed movie being part one but i didnt always understand character motives i still dont really understand what pauls real mission is spice is most valuable substance universe i understand paul follows his fathers footsteps preserve spice production but he is always move i dont follow whereto it sometimes also felt like they were holding back action sequences some action scenes ended so abruptly also large parts movie reminded me other films like tremors chronicles riddick star wars then number credibility issues film is set 10191 but there were medieval elements here as well will they still be using scrolls so far into future read messages will they still read books will they address leaders as my lord this their costumes felt very dated if film was about 30 minutes shorter it would have been much better paced with all unnecessary scenes cutting room floor it was just too long keep me entertained entire 155 minutes no matter how astonishing production values ok now that ive had my rant dune is still incredibly well made film worth watching at least once,0.507906746031746,0.2162425595238095,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"
6.0,"Visually stimulating, but tedious and verbose, with audio difficulties","I have never read the books that Frank Herbert wrote. I have friends who were big on these books and told me about them and how the original movie adaptation was lacking much content. Apparently the books are laboriously detailed and complex.Immediately I noticed there is a lot more filler in this production. Is it needed? I guess it depends on the viewer. The first production by David Lynch was abridged and rejected by many, but I enjoyed it for the efforts and the constraints put on him by the executives. He had a limited budget and had to keep the run time down. This was pre-LotR trilogies and 3 hour movies were not acceptable.The second production I have watched is the SciFi mini series which was good but forgettable. It was too complex and detailed. That casting was more than acceptable and the effort in to special effects was visually entertaining.This production is amazingly wonderful visually. I wish I would have read the books so I have something to compare the scenes to, because it might give me a better perspective to what I'm watching.Several of the scenes in the first 35 minutes are very similar to the 1984 version of Dune. The hand in the box/fear is the mind killer scene I think was very well done. The fight scene with Gurney is good, I liked the special effects but the scene felt cut short.When I saw the trailer I was put off by the casting choices, specifically Paul. However, here I am in 36 minutes and I've been pleased with the most of the cast's performances. Again, I wish I had read the books so I would have a better understanding of the descriptions of the characters.Some of them are very similar to each production, but others are complete opposites! I do not care for Jason Momoa being cast. He seems out of place. I noticed the dramatic changes in male/female of some of the characters as well, the age and the height of them. I'm not sure of the book and the description given. I did like that they used an Asian for Dr. Yueh.I've never understood the plot where Dr. Yueh turns off the shields. This seems more like deus ex machina to me because the writer needed a betrayal. I don't care for how simple the process was for this character to commit the betrayal. It should have had more of a complexity to it. Then in the reverse, the whole ""buy freedom for my wife"" by putting a hollow tooth with poison in the Duke's mouth so he can blow the poison on to the Barron? That's about as complex and convoluted of a plot device as you can make, but they do one then the other back to back. It is a low point in the story.The one thing that immediately disappointed me is the audio. I normally listen to my movies on a 12/100 level while using headphones. Sometimes I have to raise the volume to 18 or 20, but this production I had to raise it to 58/100 just to hear some of the voices. The voices were not brought to the forefront. When a character whispers, you don't keep their voice at a whisper. You bright it forward in the audio track so it is raised above the music or the ambient sounds. I also do not like how the volume rises and drops when transitional music is played. The audio is definitely a problem, and this is a production issue. I blame the director and the audio technicians for this.There are several scenes which I feel aren't needed. When Paul is talking to the servant who is watering the palms. I didn't feel this was necessary. It is more filler than it is to story development.As I stated, there are many scenes which are not in either of the previous productions. I think many of them added to the story which I did not understand previously. Some of them are worthwhile, others are filler which the production could have left on the cutting room floor.Overall, I think it is a good script, produced in an attempt to be true to the book. There are highs and lows. Some scenes great, other scenes meh. I question some of the casting. I think they did as good as they could do given the two different productions before it, but failed to find a middle ground.",visually stimulating but tedious verbose with audio difficulties,i have never read books that frank herbert wrote i have friends who were big these books told me about them how original movie adaptation was lacking much content apparently books are laboriously detailed complex immediately i noticed there is lot more filler this production is it needed i guess it depends viewer first production by david lynch was abridged rejected by many but i enjoyed it efforts constraints put him by executives he had limited budget had keep run time down this was pre lotr trilogies 3 hour movies were not acceptable second production i have watched is scifi mini series which was good but forgettable it was too complex detailed that casting was more than acceptable effort special effects was visually entertaining this production is amazingly wonderful visually i wish i would have read books so i have something compare scenes because it might give me better perspective what im watching several scenes first 35 minutes are very similar 1984 version dune hand box fear is mind killer scene i think was very well done fight scene with gurney is good i liked special effects but scene felt cut short when i saw trailer i was put off by casting choices specifically paul however here i am 36 minutes ive been pleased with most casts performances again i wish i had read books so i would have better understanding descriptions characters some them are very similar each production but others are complete opposites i do not care jason momoa being cast he seems out place i noticed dramatic changes male female some characters as well age height them im not sure book description given i did like that they used asian dr yueh ive never understood plot where dr yueh turns off shields this seems more like deus ex machina me because writer needed betrayal i dont care how simple process was this character commit betrayal it should have had more complexity it then reverse whole buy freedom my wife by putting hollow tooth with poison dukes mouth so he can blow poison barron thats about as complex convoluted plot device as you can make but they do one then other back back it is low point story one thing that immediately disappointed me is audio i normally listen my movies 12 100 level while using headphones sometimes i have raise volume 18 or 20 but this production i had raise it 58 100 just hear some voices voices were not brought forefront when character whispers you dont keep their voice at whisper you bright it forward audio track so it is raised above music or ambient sounds i also do not like how volume rises drops when transitional music is played audio is definitely problem this is production issue i blame director audio technicians this there are several scenes which i feel arent needed when paul is talking servant who is watering palms i didnt feel this was necessary it is more filler than it is story development as i stated there are many scenes which are not either previous productions i think many them added story which i did not understand previously some them are worthwhile others are filler which production could have left cutting room floor overall i think it is good script produced attempt be true book there are highs lows some scenes great other scenes meh i question some casting i think they did as good as they could do given two different productions before it but failed find middle ground,0.43496540496540503,0.1512260887260887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8.0,The Beginning,"Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were.

,"Long Winded Scenes, Slow Boring Pace","About an hour of back story that really made no sense. The Atreades are on their own planet, so they take about a thousand troops to the spice planet to mine for spice, at the request of the Emperor. When the colony is attacked, that is the end of the Atreades? What happened to their home planet?A lot of the back-story did not make sense. Even worse, the pace of this movie was incredibly slow and boring. The story of the Fremen is not explained. Why are the Harkkunen evil? That is not explained. The Harkkunen have been making gigantic amounts of money from their monopoly on the spice planet, so why are they bitter?I had a lot of questions. The dialogue was not very helpful. The Mother and Grandmother have special powers, why? Nothing is explained about their sect, or why French lead actor, Chalamet, might be ""The One.""There is not much action until the last 40 minutes or so. The fact that the family doctor can turn off the alarm system and shields to the entire colony was incredibly lame. That nobody was awake to know they were being attacked was even more lame. That King Atreades had absolutley no security staff, and got his ass kicked by the skinny doctor was pathetic.James Brolin is the top fighter for the Atreades clan, and he does almost nothing in this movie. Jason Momoa is the other top warrior and he is marginal. Both of these actors are wasted in this movie. They basically do nothing except to encourage the French kid with standard cliches.Zendaya shows up in the same visions that are repeated numerous times in the movie.

Long, very long movie of a very slow pace, with very dark and gloomy lights, very dour mood and very depressing feeling overall. It produces a rather sour taste and this sand sees to ooze everywhere. Timothée Chalamet is OK, but he is not yet the star to save the whole production. Other more mature stars, like Rebecca Ferguson or Oscar Isaac seem to be slightly better off here but the whole plot does not allow the to be beyond very tight frames which stifle them a lot. Zendaya or Josh Brolin are so limited in their screen time that it is almost null and void. Maybe, Jason Momoa is the real winner here with his bright and powerful prsence.Generally, the aftertaste is dour and sour and leaves no desire to wait for the second part, as the unbearably slow tempo of the first part and dark brooding atmosphere produce very limited wish to persevere.I'd say I am not impressed.

Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story.

I found the film about as dry as the desert world on which it takes place.

Surviving the assault, Paul and his mother avoid being killed by Harkonnen soldiers and eaten by giant sand-worms, and ultimately join forces with the indigenous people, the Fremen.Not being familiar with the source material, a lot of the finer plot details went way over my head, making the whole experience even more of a chore. And this film is only half of the story: director Denis Villeneuve has split the book into two halves, and is currently working on part two now that enough profit has been made from part one.

I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story.

9.0,A Darker Dune,"Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve.

4.0,"Lame, colourless adaptation, uninterestingly acted, gassy and dull","Frank Herbert was a guy who stumbled upon a brilliant idea, completely failed to bring it to life on the page with his total lack of writing ability, and yet was rewarded for his efforts anyway when his book became a resounding success.I can't imagine how hard it must have been for him to write it. He could barely string a sentence together, and utterly failed to make multiple sentences flow. It must have been painstaking for him to write, and it was certainly painstaking to read.And yet it became a bestseller, and did for sci-fi what Lord of the Rings did for fantasy.

Perhaps people read so rarely that they don't expect to find the writing engaging, and so don't notice when it isn't.""Dune: Part One"", the movie, is about as dull and lifeless in style as the book was in execution. There is even so little colour to its images that you may as well be watching a black and white movie. It doesn't even have an arresting look, for all the money that obviously went into it. And the actors are boring: what does Timothee Chalamet do, but look wan, pale and wide-eyed? And Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista? Jessica was really the protagonist of the novel, a strong, female character before that became a tired cliché. And Baron Harkonnen was a pretty cool villain.

6.0,They forgot the story.,"It physically pains me to leave a negative review for ""Dune"" and to give the film that I've been eagerly waiting to see for 2 years such a low score. Note: this was my subjective experience and I'm about to give my personal opinion on the film; I should mention that I am the only person I know who did not love it (although not many people have seen it yet). In any case, I suggest you still go see it in a theater by yourself and form your own opinion about it.A little intro for those of you who hear the word ""Dune"" in the context of a movie for the first time. ""Dune"" is a 60s science-fiction novel taking place in the time of advanced space travel. The family of young Paul (Timothy Chalamet) is burdened with protecting the planet Arrakis, a home to the most valuable resource in the galaxy: ""spice"". With it's hostile native people, giant sandworms and interstellar wars, ""Dune"" is described by some as ""Star Wars for adults"". This best-selling epic (which I haven't read) was not very successfully adapted to screen by David Lynch in 1984, but this 2021 film here was supposed to be The Adaptation that will please each and every fan and revive the epic story for the newer generations. The director Dennis Villeneuve has proven himself a master of filmmaking over the last 10 years (Blade Runner 2049; Arrival; Prisoners; Sicario). He seemed like the perfect man for the job, considering he did the impossible and made a sequel for a classic movie ""Blade Runner"" that turned out better than the original. As I saw it, ""Dune"" was supposed to be the biggest, the most exciting and the most expensive film of the year (just look at the cast), and the last time I've been that excited to see a film was probably Infinity War 3 years ago. I went for the best possible cinematic experience - IMAX 3D; and bought the tickets for the first release date in my country. Three hours later, I walked out of the theater in a bad mood. As they say: ""my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined"". And, after pondering on it for two days, it isn't at all because I set my expectations too high.There is this little thing called ""dramatic structure"": how any dramatic work such as a book or a film are or should be built. There are obviously deviations and different versions of it (things like Memento and Pulp Fiction still exist), but probably the most commonsensical, useful and widely-used one is called the ""Freytag's pyramid"" and consists of five parts: exposition (introduction to the characters and setting), rising action, climax, falling action and resolution. They give you this structure in school as an essay-writing guide. ""Dune"" is a 2h 35min exposition. There is no plot. They forgot the story. The movie is finished before any kind of rising action begins. After waiting for two years and three hours, you get a National Geographic documentary ""Life of Paul: Struggles on Arrakis"". I admit that I had no idea Villeneuve had planned that Dune would be a two-part movie from the very beginning, but I also can't be blamed because it was not at all clear from it's marketing; judging by the fact that the whole audience looked around in confusion after the abrupt non-ending - I wasn't the only one. That really doesn't matter though, I did not come to the cinema to watch a three hour introduction to something that may never even be made - Villeneuve never got a contract for a sequel yet, it will only be made if this piece of work makes enough money. How can you make a film without a cohesive story that relies entirely on it's continuation without ever being absolutely sure that this continuation is in the making? Why would you ever face those odds and why not make at least something of importance happen in part one, so it can be viewed and enjoyed as a standalone picture?It doesn't stop there. Perhaps this is more of a criticism of the source material, but Dune is like a made-up history book with all-too real actors, politics and little details. It's like ""The Martian"" with it's extreme scientific accuracy, but here the author thinks up a world and maximizes realism, thinking through all the little details about how this world functions: trade, spice harvesting, religion, wars... Usually it's amazing that authors pay so much attention to details, but in this case it doesn't work. It feels like you're watching a drama-documentary about some ancient (despite it being set in the future) civilization with every meticulous little detail built in. Like, really? You had a whole universe of creativity at the palm of your hand, an ocean of unlimited potential, and you chose to simply dress ""Earth geopolitics"" in a science-fiction disguise? I felt like setting these artificial intellectual boundaries by tying the story tightly to real-life problems and patterns seriously hindered Dune's creative potential. My point is - I did not come to the movies to watch the news.The annoying thing is how contrarily perfect the cinematic and visual aspects of the film are - Greig Fraser's cinematography, strongly reminiscent of the work of Roger Deakins, does not get any better than this. The unimaginable scale of the film is truly Nolan big, and the IMAX sound makes you feel the sand brushing against your cheeks. You can almost feel a slight, subtle scent of peaches emanating from the main character. Also, despite the limited room to play around in, the acting is simply top notch, an admirable ensemble with every single actor in their perfect place. However, when it comes to the soundtrack by my beloved Hans Zimmer, it felt pretty plain - cool at times, but very far from remarkable in comparison to anything of his previous works, from Interstellar, Inception and Gladiator to Lion King. But all these positive elements could not have ever made up for the biggest failure of them all - the simple lack of story. I watched the movie with my girlfriend and my cousin. They both loved it and I asked them to explain to me in 2-3 sentences what the movie was about. They couldn't. And neither could I, because it isn't about anything. It's a three hour introduction to a film that may never come to exist.Honestly, the trailer was more exciting than the film itself.",they forgot story,it physically pains me leave negative review dune give film that ive been eagerly waiting see 2 years such low score note this was my subjective experience im about give my personal opinion film i should mention that i am only person i know who did

best possible cinematic experience imax 3d bought tickets first release date my country three hours later i walked out theater bad mood as they say my disappointment is immeasurable my day is ruined

perhaps this is more criticism source material but dune is like made up history book with all too real actors politics little details its like martian with its extreme scientific accuracy but here author thinks up world maximizes realism thinking through all little details about how this world functions trade spice harvesting religion wars usually its amazing that authors pay so much attention

1.0,"Atrocious Plot Changes; Dull, Pointless","I was hoping Dune 2021 would more rigorously stick to the Book's plot and bring alive Herbert's detailed story in a way the compressed / compromised Dune 1984 could not. Instead D2021 glosses over or completely leaves out major plot points, changes key aspects of its characters, makes up new plots when convenient, or simply repeats certain scenes from D1984 with nearly the same dialog but without the necessary context. D1984 also has significantly better acting. Zendaya's acting is so flat the EKG wouldn't register. Timothee Chalamet's acting is similarly flat and uninspiring: For his Paul Atriedes, Spice is salt and very mild pepper.
