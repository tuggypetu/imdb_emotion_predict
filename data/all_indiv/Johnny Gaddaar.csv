9.0,Excellent crime thriller that stands with the best,"This seems to be a watershed year or at least month so far as thrillers in Hindi movies are concerned. First there was Manorama 6 Feet Under and now I saw Johnny Gaddar, which totally ROCKS!! A tight and layered script that pays a lot of homage to erstwhile thrillers (tons of 70's references here) but remembers to have its own identity, absolutely SUPERB direction and performances that are indicative of the relish all the actors took in their parts. Even Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy provide some measure of compensation for the emasculation of 70's songs they did in their remix albums by coming up with a background score that's booming with the meaty brass sounds of that era. If there is any flaw I'd say the lead pair of Neil Mukesh and Rimi Sen are kinda vacuous but even that mostly works in the film's favor because they play characters that remain under everyone else's horizon.",excellent crime thriller that stands with best,this seems be watershed year or at least month so far as thrillers hindi movies are concerned first there was manorama 6 feet under now i saw johnny gaddar which totally rocks tight layered script that pays lot homage erstwhile thrillers tons 70s references here but remembers have its own identity absolutely superb direction performances that are indicative relish all actors took their parts even shankar ehsaan loy provide some measure compensation emasculation 70s songs they did their remix albums by coming up with background score thats booming with meaty brass sounds that era if there is any flaw id say lead pair neil mukesh rimi sen are kinda vacuous but even that mostly works films favor because they play characters that remain under everyone elses horizon,0.6062770562770563,0.361038961038961,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,True Blue Thriller,"There have been very few proper thrillers in Indian film industry, and counting few good ones in them is easy task. However here comes a movie that has the potential to redefine the genre. Most probably this movie will prove to be a dud at Box office, however it will sure go down as a cult for generations to come.In most of the thrillers that I have seen, I am able to second guess the director on what he is going to show. However this movie is something that didn't let me do that. Even though the pacing seemed to be slow in parts, however it actually was never slow. Every few minutes the events took a dramatic change, and even though you realize that this could have been expected, however it was not.This is type of cinema that I prefer to enjoy alone, not with friends Or with family. Simply go into the theater and immerse yourself.My only regret is the way the music was used. Initially only the title track was released but later there was an elaborate album. And it was one of the best score to hit the shelves in a long time. The album gave an impression that it was not typical Bollywood fare, however would be used in background. It had some excellent themes and instrumental pieces and sometimes it gave an impression if modern day Hollywood themes were inspired from Bollywood of 70's, and one expected those pieces to play a pivotal role to elevate the movie. However they were hardly used in the movie, except for couple of occasions.Since I have heard the original album, that is the reason my expectations were sky high from the background music and theme music of the music, but still its a rare masterpiece coming out of Bollywood. This one deserves an elaborate DVD version.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED at ANY COST !! *****",true blue thriller,there have been very few proper thrillers indian film industry counting few good ones them is easy task however here comes movie that has potential redefine genre most probably this movie will prove be dud at box office however it will sure go down as cult generations come most thrillers that i have seen i am able second guess director what he is going show however this movie is something that didnt let me do that even though pacing seemed be slow parts however it actually was never slow every few minutes events took dramatic change even though you realize that this could have been expected however it was not this is type cinema that i prefer enjoy alone not with friends or with family simply go into theater immerse yourself my only regret is way music was used initially only title track was released but later there was elaborate album it was one best score hit shelves long time album gave impression that it was not typical bollywood fare however would be used background it had some excellent themes instrumental pieces sometimes it gave impression if modern day hollywood themes were inspired bollywood 70s one expected those pieces play pivotal role elevate movie however they were hardly used movie except couple occasions since i have heard original album that is reason my expectations were sky high background music theme music music but still its rare masterpiece coming out bollywood this one deserves elaborate dvd version highly recommended at any cost,0.5165364265364265,0.17233618233618234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Watch out for Johnny!!,"If you grew up reading James Hadley Chase and his prototype stories of the not so bad (but not good) protagonists, who always fell for the wrong woman, tried to make it big, but things went wrong in a very bad way - then this is a must watch for you! I am still stunned by the sheer quality, charisma and entertainment of this film. Dharam was Garam, Neil is a heart-throb and he can act, even Rimi Sen was competent. Dharam made me so nostalgic for the 70s - ""It is not about age but mileage"" LOL!!! I liked Rasika, Govind Namdeo, Zakir Hussain - in fact it is safe to say that no one turned in a bad performance. Neil Mukesh is one to watch out for - best when he played the innocent, but also great when he was the schemer. Move over Hritik, forget it Ranbir, the new man about town is certainly Neil Nitin Mukesh.There were more references to everyone's favorite moments in books (Hadley Chase mostly) and films (of course the ubiquitous Johnny Mera Naam, and many many Bachchan films including the early and all important Parwana) than I can remember (and it might take another viewing to capture them all!), there was your favorite music from yesteryear's (Aage bhi jaane Na tu for one) and some cool new stuff, there was blood and gore galore, and there was an inevitability to the story (just like your favorite Hadley Chase book had).And after you are done watching Johnny Gaddaar then go back and watch Jewel Thief and Johnny Mera Naam, maybe even Parwana, to get even more out of the film!I highly recommend this film to all lovers of pulp fiction (and I do not mean the film alone), the noir genre, heists, double-crosses, and just unusual cinema that is very well done. Kudos to Sriram Raghavan, I wish I could get into his head to see where all this came from.",watch out johnny,if you grew up reading james hadley chase his prototype stories not so bad but not good protagonists who always fell wrong woman tried make it big but things went wrong very bad way then this is must watch you i am still stunned by sheer quality charisma entertainment this film dharam was garam neil is heart throb he can act even rimi sen was competent dharam made me so nostalgic 70s it is not about age but mileage lol i liked rasika govind namdeo zakir hussain fact it is safe say that no one turned bad performance neil mukesh is one watch out best when he played innocent but also great when he was schemer move over hritik forget it ranbir new man about town is certainly neil nitin mukesh there were more references everyones favorite moments books hadley chase mostly films course ubiquitous johnny mera naam many many bachchan films including early all important parwana than i can remember it might take another viewing capture them all there was your favorite music yesteryears aage bhi jaane na tu one some cool new stuff there was blood gore galore there was inevitability story just like your favorite hadley chase book had after you are done watching johnny gaddaar then go back watch jewel thief johnny mera naam maybe even parwana get even more out film i highly recommend this film all lovers pulp fiction i do not mean film alone noir genre heists double crosses just unusual cinema that is very well done kudos sriram raghavan i wish i could get into his head see where all this came,0.6201301707551707,0.18314619408369415,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.17}"
7.0,Johnny Gaddaar,"Now this is something hits unexpectedly. Johnny Gaddar quite thoughtfully titled like 70's hard-boiled thriller spins a devious plot and pulls off a fantastic thriller. This is one of those relentless movies just refuses to slow down. Having said that is a complement in itself. Bollywood always has flavor for romance and comedy but thriller is still not first class citizen here. In old days B R Chopra gave us real good mysteries and thrillers, in our time Abbas-Mastaan used to deliver but they have lost their way terribly these days. Writer-Director Raghvan's last venture was brilliant Ek Haseena Thi with Saif's snaky performance- his best till date. With Johnny Gaddar he exercised in the same genre and maturating it more and more. He penned a clever on-the-edge thriller and then got in director's chair doing a through job.Plot is a classic crime setup. Five regular partners going for a deal splitting profit five ways as usual. It is fine until one of guys (of course Apana hero Neil) wants all and elope with his mistress(Rimi Sen). But of course plan will not be executed without flaws and none of the member of the crew is a rookie or push-over. Then onwards film is a gripping tale with twists and turns. It pays-off and it is also not timid to avoid contemporary cliché conclusion.Film doesn't have A-list stars to draw attention but has actors doing their job nifty making this kind delight. Star of the show is Neil Mukesh. This is a very bold, confident feature debut for the talented actor, certainly Lambi Race Ka Ghoda for the industry. Film offers some real good scenes. I really liked the scene when a cop sitting beside the rat in the gang suggests changing the topic and talk about his favorite actor extracting a virtual confession out. And there is another scene shows glimpse of gray in human carnival when one character held on gun-point and asked about how others solve the mystery earlier and met their demise. He bleeding, about to die, smiles wicked; refuses to answer saying that will puzzle and torment him rest of the life.Film got a vintage treatment and several references are made to some classics. One of things I admired most here, hero is not sly or wicked but the script is. There seems so many innocent thread suspended loosely initially to pay attention but double backs in as crucial smart clues later. Altogether film is a darn dandy pleasure. Full entertainment all over. Strong Thumps up JohnnyO!!",johnny gaddaar,now this is something hits unexpectedly johnny gaddar quite thoughtfully titled like 70s hard boiled thriller spins devious plot pulls off fantastic thriller this is one those relentless movies just refuses slow down having said that is complement itself bollywood always has flavor romance comedy but thriller is still not first class citizen here old days b r chopra gave us real good mysteries thrillers our time abbas mastaan used deliver but they have lost their way terribly these days writer director raghvans last venture was brilliant ek haseena thi with saifs snaky performance his best till date with johnny gaddar he exercised same genre maturating it more more he penned clever edge thriller then got directors chair doing through job plot is classic crime setup five regular partners going deal splitting profit five ways as usual it is fine until one guys course apana hero neil wants all elope with his mistress rimi sen but course plan will not be executed without flaws none member crew is rookie or push over then onwards film is gripping tale with twists turns it pays off it is also not timid avoid contemporary clich conclusion film doesnt have list stars draw attention but has actors doing their job nifty making this kind delight star show is neil mukesh this is very bold confident feature debut talented actor certainly lambi race ka ghoda industry film offers some real good scenes i really liked scene when cop sitting beside rat gang suggests changing topic talk about his favorite actor extracting virtual confession out there is another scene shows glimpse gray human carnival when one character held gun point asked about how others solve mystery earlier met their demise he bleeding about die smiles wicked refuses answer saying that will puzzle torment him rest life film got vintage treatment several references are made some classics one things i admired most here hero is not sly or wicked but script is there seems so many innocent thread suspended loosely initially pay attention but double backs as crucial smart clues later altogether film is darn dandy pleasure full entertainment all over strong thumps up johnnyo,0.5140600944948772,0.25086266390614215,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,You wouldn't want to miss this one.,"I have sat through below average movies several times because I have always believed in something 'keep your expectations low and you are in for a positive surprise'. However, I have been reading the pre release media coverage on this one and had it on in my watch list. I had expectations on this set already and usually it contrives the other way round, but this one proved me wrong. I still get to gain, since this is something which I rate as a rare cinematic experience as far as bollywood goes. I believe its a very brave effort to even think about a plot and to give it the look it has. With more of fantasy driven plots doing the rounds at bollywood box office, movies which venture in to unexplored territories always score better with me. Not just that, this one has quite a few reasons. Cinematography - It takes you to the retro era of the 70's. The color combinations of black and blood red, with the tall fonts for cast and the posters is very pleasing and reminiscing of the era of not so technical but still gruesomely intense thrillers of the 70's. Its a real tribute to that era.Music - The title track is one of the best and looks like to be a big hit already. The blend of the old and the contemporary techno music is very refreshing. Plot - The unpredictability is something which has not been seen in a while considering that you know the culprit through out. It makes you see the movie through the eyes of the characters. Its like a anti-climax repeated several times. It keeps your brain cells on the toes and you better not sit back and relax if you don't want to appear dumb after wards. The performances have been superb and still it manages to have its own humorous moments as well. It reminds me of 'Sholay' since there are so many scenes which appear so discretely superb but blend in perfectly.Highly recommended to the metro-plex audiences.",you wouldnt want miss this one,i have sat through below average movies several times because i have always believed something keep your expectations low you are positive surprise however i have been reading pre release media coverage this one had it my watch list i had expectations this set already usually it contrives other way round but this one proved me wrong i still get gain since this is something which i rate as rare cinematic experience as far as bollywood goes i believe its very brave effort even think about plot give it look it has with more fantasy driven plots doing rounds at bollywood box office movies which venture unexplored territories always score better with me not just that this one has quite few reasons cinematography it takes you retro era 70s color combinations black blood red with tall fonts cast posters is very pleasing reminiscing era not so technical but still gruesomely intense thrillers 70s its real tribute that era music title track is one best looks like be big hit already blend old contemporary techno music is very refreshing plot unpredictability is something which has not been seen while considering that you know culprit through out it makes you see movie through eyes characters its like anti climax repeated several times it keeps your brain cells toes you better not sit back relax if you dont want appear dumb after wards performances have been superb still it manages have its own humorous moments as well it reminds me sholay since there are so many scenes which appear so discretely superb but blend perfectly highly recommended metro plex audiences,0.48084595959595955,0.2065909090909091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,This one came in from the cold,"I have a simple test of a masterpiece. Once you come out of the theater do you masticate the movie in your mind, going over every character, discussing their nuances, idiosyncrasies, opining on the modus operandi and going home to listen to the soundtrack. Johnny comes through on all these counts. A brilliantly scripted, directed and edited tale with convincing performances by the players. There is not a moment which allows you to leave the theater even if the nature's call is of particular urgent nature. The lead actor, Nel Mukesh, does fit the bill in his role as the cold killer but then on a neutral ground I was not too impressed with his histrionics capabilities. The credit goes to the director for riding with all the actors, unique in their own right, and blending them better that those Hawaiin cocktails with little umbrellas on them. Every Hindi thriller that I have seen, be it Don II or Dhoom, I have always tried to guess the twist and have succeeded, more often than not. Well, happy to admit that Johnny G got the better of me. With so many gray characters floating around, twists come dime a dozen and well thought through at that. The movie surely stands as among the top ten best made Hindi movies in my list.",this one came cold,i have simple test masterpiece once you come out theater do you masticate movie your mind going over every character discussing their nuances idiosyncrasies opining modus operandi going home listen soundtrack johnny comes through all these counts brilliantly scripted directed edited tale with convincing performances by players there is not moment which allows you leave theater even if natures call is particular urgent nature lead actor nel mukesh does fit bill his role as cold killer but then neutral ground i was not too impressed with his histrionics capabilities credit goes director riding with all actors unique their own right blending them better that those hawaiin cocktails with little umbrellas them every hindi thriller that i have seen be it don ii or dhoom i have always tried guess twist have succeeded more often than not well happy admit that johnny g got better me with so many gray characters floating around twists come dime dozen well thought through at that movie surely stands as among top ten best made hindi movies my list,0.6578609221466366,0.36380385487528344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8.0,A Rare Species,"Here is a film directed by someone whose previous directorial venture (Ek Hasina Thi), though stylishly executed, was a box office dud. A film which has Dharmedra as the biggest name in the credits. The second biggest is perhaps Shankar Ehsaan Loy, who are favorite composers for big banners these days. They have done a neat job here as well. A film which has a debuting actor with musical genes in lead role (he is grandson of legendary singer Mukesh). So what would be expected from such a venture? Not much I reckon. And that's the biggest strength of the film. Low expectations, high returns. The film is classic thriller by all standards. Be it acting, script, direction anything.Commenting anything about the storyline would be a sin for this genre of cinema. Though its not suspense of ""Who did it"" sorts, but still its best that story is left untold. But it deserves to be told that unfolding and turn of events is gripping. It keeps you glued to your seats.Technically the film is a jewel. Cinematography is top notch. Editing is crisp, narrative fast paced. There is hardly a dull moment. Background score is racy and innovative. Sriram Raghvan proves that the promise shown in his directorial debut was not fluke. He is a director to look out for. And thanks to him, we now have an actor too to look out for in Neil Nitin Mukesh.So, some may call Johnny Gaddar a cult classic, some call it style exemplified. But in simple terms, it's a good film. Go and watch it.",rare species,here is film directed by someone whose previous directorial venture ek hasina thi though stylishly executed was box office dud film which has dharmedra as biggest name credits second biggest is perhaps shankar ehsaan loy who are favorite composers big banners these days they have done neat job here as well film which has debuting actor with musical genes lead role he is grandson legendary singer mukesh so what would be expected such venture not much i reckon thats biggest strength film low expectations high returns film is classic thriller by all standards be it acting script direction anything commenting anything about storyline would be sin this genre cinema though its not suspense who did it sorts but still its best that story is left untold but it deserves be told that unfolding turn events is gripping it keeps you glued your seats technically film is jewel cinematography is top notch editing is crisp narrative fast paced there is hardly dull moment background score is racy innovative sriram raghvan proves that promise shown his directorial debut was not fluke he is director look out thanks him we now have actor too look out neil nitin mukesh so some may call johnny gaddar cult classic some call it style exemplified but simple terms its good film go watch it,0.4142692939244662,0.21672413793103448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,Johnny Slick! One Hell of a Movie!,"A combination of slickness and intelligence is rare in Hindi cinema. 'Johnny Gaddaar' is one such film. Not only is it slick and intelligent, it has a gripping fast-paced plot, impressive performances (none bad), keeps you at the edge of the seat and entertains. It just kept me so involved! I loved the numerous reference to Indian classics (like 'Bandini', 'Johnny Mera Naam' and so many more) and the Chase novels. The dark humour provides several laugh out loud moments e.g. during the second scene Dharmendra turns on the stereo to listen to his wife sing. Raghavan's inspiration clearly shows (note inspiration NOT ripoff) and the man did one hell of a job in creating an Indian pulp fiction! The cast itself is a smartly gathered unusual ensemble that works very well. Dharmendra rocks as the leader of the gang. This guy has brought a wise freshness in his last three films (the other two being 'Life..in a Metro' and 'Apne'). Zakir Hussain, Govind Namdeo and Vinay Pathak are great in their parts. Ashwini Kalsekar is natural while Rimi Sen is no good. However, 'Johnny Gaddaar' rests on débutant Neil Nitin Mukesh. The actor isn't fully comfortable in front of the camera but his awkwardness and novel presence fits the character (who is the newest member of the gang).The background score deserves special mention. The instrumental tracks heard in spy movies, the trance music...all add a nice and cool touch. The item number in the end could have been shortened but the songs give a feel of the wild 70s.Raghavan's debut film 'Ek Hasina Thi' happens to be one of my favorite thrillers. Now I can add his second film to my favorites! Even though the plot becomes slightly predictable during the last 45 minutes, it doesn't lose its charm. It's a howdunnit rather than a whodunnit. Undoubtedly, one of the most enjoyable films of the year and one of the best of its genre to come out from India.",johnny slick one hell movie,combination slickness intelligence is rare hindi cinema johnny gaddaar is one such film not only is it slick intelligent it has gripping fast paced plot impressive performances none bad keeps you at edge seat entertains it just kept me so involved i loved numerous reference indian classics like bandini johnny mera naam so many more chase novels dark humour provides several laugh out loud moments e g during second scene dharmendra turns stereo listen his wife sing raghavans inspiration clearly shows note inspiration not ripoff man did one hell job creating indian pulp fiction cast itself is smartly gathered unusual ensemble that works very well dharmendra rocks as leader gang this guy has brought wise freshness his last three films other two being life metro apne zakir hussain govind namdeo vinay pathak are great their parts ashwini kalsekar is natural while rimi sen is no good however johnny gaddaar rests d butant neil nitin mukesh actor isnt fully comfortable front camera but his awkwardness novel presence fits character who is newest member gang background score deserves special mention instrumental tracks heard spy movies trance music all add nice cool touch item number end could have been shortened but songs give feel wild 70s raghavans debut film ek hasina thi happens be one my favorite thrillers now i can add his second film my favorites even though plot becomes slightly predictable during last 45 minutes it doesnt lose its charm its howdunnit rather than whodunnit undoubtedly one most enjoyable films year one best its genre come out india,0.5542102206736355,0.23162020905923342,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8.0,strength of the movie is its .....UNPREDICTABILITY!,"Unquestionably one of the smartest films I've seen recently, the biggest strength of Johnny Gaddaar is its unpredictability. Unlike most conventional thrillers with a heist at its core, this one's not a whodunit  it can't be, because you know all along who's done it  the question instead is, how's he going to get away with it? Really the film's biggest accomplishment is the manner in which it compels you, the viewer to think differently  midway through the film you've got the drift, you begin to expect the unexpected, you even begin to predict what's going to happen next. That's the level of involvement you're able to muster up for this film.Dharmendra as leader of the gang, Zakir Hussain as the crass club-owner, Vinay Pathak as the smarmy card-shark, and Neil Nitin Mukesh as the rookie, the youngest member of the gang  you couldn't find better actors to fill out these roles.Zakir Hussain in particular, stands out with a performance that is ingenious in every sense of the word. And Neil Nitin Mukesh makes an inspired debut; he's clearly an actor to look out for.it's a thriller very unlike his own previous film Ek Hasina Thi, and very unlike most thrillers you've seen recently.

9.0,"Shock and Awe - Slick, Brutal and Pummelling Promethean...","It's the retro age - Recently i saw this Tarantino film (must admit I'm a huge fan of his!!) on the Grindhouse backdrop and it amazed me because of the recreated era - sublimely yet effectively treated and brought on screen. I kept wondering whether I will ever lay my eyes on any such film in the Hindi Film Industry.Sriram Raghavan (of ""Ek Hasina Thi"" fame) has much the same treatment for us - Shock and Awe. Yes!! It is a complete disappointment for the people' who can predict every twist and turn while watching a Thriller - because the film is genuinely UNPREDICTABLE, right till the credits flash across your gaping faces. (I'm sure you will be staring in sheer disbelief at the audacity of the Director) It is the treatment that blows you off - and the director is not even shy to reveal his ""inspirations"" for he surpasses them! The plot is about a supposedly well planned and organized barter of things gone wrong - ""The Gang"" of Five wants to get hold of something which requires a payment of 2.5 crores, an investment which shall get doubled with time. But someone among them betrays. You get to know about who the betrayer is, but not the other four in the gang. It sets off a chain of events that involves five underhand dealers, their families, a cop has a perfect denouement. It is almost like a short story - leaves you yearning for more, just as you thought you knew it whole! Fast and slick - right from the credits which is sexy and suave, through the images - that of Johny's transition from warmth exuding from the eyes to that cold glimpse which petrifies, from Pune to Goa and back again, the bars, the ""in-built"" and ""in-sync"" songs, the promises made only to be broken, the message is clear - Evil begets Evil and consumes Evil too.The actors are brilliant (except for Neil who does a good job, but somehow he seemed to be emulating rather than delivering originality). Be it VInay Pathak, Dharmendra or Zakir Husaain, their characters have been sketched to perfection. Watch out for the ironies and the metaphors that have sublimely been blended into the film (say for instance, Why the name ""Johny Gaddar"" ?)...The camera work has to be seen to be believed. The editing is absolutely A-class. The soundtrack is a perfect foil to the hectic pace of the film.

8.0,Sriram Raghavan does a Pulp Fiction !!!,"Relax. The movie does not rip off Pulp Fiction.Rather, it captures the ESSENCE of Pulp Fiction. And that essence is HOMAGE... Just like Pulp Fiction, Johnny Gaddaar is a homage to some of the classic thrillers of world cinema. But that's where the similarity ends.Both movies are different and have different appeals. While Pulp Fiction has it's appeal in amazingly witty dialogues and a few memorable performances, Johnny Gaddaar has it's appeal in a taut storyline with a good ""twist-at-the-end"".The story follows the protagonist as he double-crosses his gang members, and then tries to ensure that his gang members do not suspect him of double-crossing. Whether he succeeds in evading the gang's suspicion and making off with the booty is what makes the entire plot.The plot has all the elements of an edge-of-the-seat thriller. However, what differentiates Johnny Gaddaar from the rest is the Style of it's execution. The movie has Style with a capital S. The scene in the train stands out as an example of how the director chooses to use his influences. He uses the plot sequence of the classic Hindi thriller ""Parwana"" and executes it in the style of classic French thriller ""Rififi"". And the outcome is excellent....Johnny Gaddaar also rides on some excellent performances from it's cast. The stand out performances come from Zakir Hussain (Shardul), Vinay Pathak (Prakash), Govind Namdeo (Kalyan) and Ashwini Kalsekar. Dharmendra is excellent but should have been given lesser English lines. English doesn't seem to come naturally to him. His eloquence in Hindi & Urdu could've been better utilized in this film.The protagonist (..or antagonist..) Vikram is a complex character to portray. Debutante Neil Mukesh does a fair job of it. Sometimes you feel that he is putting some extra effort to say his Hindi lines. Whether he is capable of histrionics in his likely future projects as an actor is another question mark. However, one cannot deny that he has good screen presence. The soundtrack is noteworthy & is consistent with the mood of the movie.Johnny Gaddaar has it's share of flaws too. The dream sequence feels like a forced attempt by the director to instill some needless thrill in an already thrilling film. The gore sequence with the nurse also feels forced & seems a bit incongruent with the movie. These scenes, to a certain extent, adversely affect the movie's length as well...However, with it's intriguing storyline & innovative style of execution, Johnny Gaddaar sets a precedent for other thrillers to follow...8/10",sriram raghavan does pulp fiction,relax movie does not rip off pulp fiction rather it captures essence pulp fiction that essence is homage just like pulp fiction johnny gaddaar is homage some classic thrillers world cinema but thats where similarity ends both movies are different have different appeals while pulp fiction has its appeal amazingly witty dialogues few memorable performances johnny gaddaar has its appeal taut storyline with good twist at end story follows protagonist as he double crosses his gang members then tries ensure that his gang members do not suspect him double crossing whether he succeeds evading gangs suspicion making off with booty is what makes entire plot plot has all elements edge seat thriller however what differentiates johnny gaddaar rest is style its execution movie has style with capital s scene train stands out as example how director chooses use his influences he uses plot sequence classic hindi thriller parwana executes it style classic french thriller rififi outcome is excellent johnny gaddaar also rides some excellent performances its cast stand out performances come zakir hussain shardul vinay pathak prakash govind namdeo kalyan ashwini kalsekar dharmendra is excellent but should have been given lesser english lines english doesnt seem come naturally him his eloquence hindi urdu couldve been better utilized this film protagonist or antagonist vikram is complex character portray debutante neil mukesh does fair job it sometimes you feel that he is putting some extra effort say his hindi lines whether he is capable histrionics his likely future projects as actor is another question mark however one cannot deny that he has good screen presence soundtrack is noteworthy is consistent with mood movie johnny gaddaar has its share flaws too dream sequence feels like forced attempt by director instill some needless thrill already thrilling film gore sequence with nurse also feels forced seems bit incongruent with movie these scenes certain extent adversely affect movies length as well however with its intriguing storyline innovative style execution johnny gaddaar sets precedent other thrillers follow 8 10,0.472985347985348,0.19972527472527474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.51}"
8.0,Retro Cool,"There is no dispute on Vijay Anand being the de facto Master of Suspense/Thriller in Indian Cinema history. So when we have a movie that pays tribute to this master (starting from quite an obvious title), purists like me sit up and get ready to tear apart any failings. Consider the astonishment when the movie not only lives up to the name, but dignifies it! That this movie actually got made, and then received a wide-release is in itself a surprise - hardly are any studios or distributors in India who support movies that do not conform to the fabric of established norms of Bollywood. Yet we have this movie. Raghavan gives us a genuine film-noir that is so rare that it is easy to lose it in the mêlée of mediocrity that Bollywood blockbusters represent.An almost gray-scale visual theme with shocks of Red (very Sin City - nobody is innocent), no break-out sessions for song&dance and a crisp running time (135 minutes) alienates it from regular cinema. The movie revels in what it is, and religiously refers to the works it inspires from. Yet, and in doing so, it establishes a unique identity that would live through the said mêlée.The casting choices of the movie also make for a great ensemble, especially with the presence of Dharamendra, whose stature and age are also put to great use. Neil Nitin Mukesh makes his debut, and is already lost in the shadows while lights shine on other star-kids. Yet he plays the most daring and convincing maiden role to establish a sure-fire position on the ""to-be-watched"" list.Raghavan makes the most inherently ""cool"" movie of the year, complete in 60's retro garb of film-making (cinematography, editing, character focus, color grading) that fits right in with the film-noir subject. If not for the obvious anachronisms, this could easily have been a movie from the 60s, if not from the Master himself.",retro cool,there is no dispute vijay anand being de facto master suspense thriller indian cinema history so when we have movie that pays tribute this master starting quite obvious title purists like me sit up get ready tear apart any failings consider astonishment when movie not only lives up name but dignifies it that this movie actually got made then received wide release is itself surprise hardly are any studios or distributors india who support movies that do not conform fabric established norms bollywood yet we have this movie raghavan gives us genuine film noir that is so rare that it is easy lose it m l e mediocrity that bollywood blockbusters represent almost gray scale visual theme with shocks red very sin city nobody is innocent no break out sessions song dance crisp running time 135 minutes alienates it regular cinema movie revels what it is religiously refers works it inspires yet doing so it establishes unique identity that would live through said m l e casting choices movie also make great ensemble especially with presence dharamendra whose stature age are also put great use neil nitin mukesh makes his debut is already lost shadows while lights shine other star kids yet he plays most daring convincing maiden role establish sure fire position be watched list raghavan makes most inherently cool movie year complete 60s retro garb film making cinematography editing character focus color grading that fits right with film noir subject if not obvious anachronisms this could easily have been movie 60s if not master himself,0.5281388452817023,0.20086889301175015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Johnny Scores !!!,"Neons,Red neons, Yellow Milestones, Pune Railway Station,Lancers, maroon Maruti 800, Bombay-Pune Highway,more Neons and UV Lights in da Club, no Bling Bling, only CASH and Bam Bam. Phew!! What a ride!!Johnny Gaddar is ..wait for it...the Best Hindi movie of its genre. Should I say that again or was I loud enough to make my point clear? ADLABS presents, ...Sriram Raghavan's...and then Boom. The title credits are absolutely a thing to watch and watch out for. Awesome is the Word..or is it Legendary. OK, I should come out of the Barney-shell and just tell you more about the movie and why I loved it. Reason 1: Solely for the title credits which is a huge tribute in its own right to all the 60's and 70's thrillers, especially ( and well clearly mentioned too) to Vijay Anand's works from Johnny Mera Naam( from which the movie's title has been taken) to Jewel Thief . I definitely felt that Mr.Raghavan always wanted to pay a kind of homage to them, and what rightfully done!! In scenes like, Rimi Sen reading R.K.Narayan's 'Guide'( made into a film by Vijay Anand) or well, Vikram, the protagonist who is a big Big-B fan, watches Parwana (may be for his influences eh!) to Johnny Mera Naam. Well,there are other trivial stuff too which would soon make their way on the trivia list of IMDb like, while Shiva is being called the first time, he is watching Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. The movie also brings back the genre of ""Kaun-Kaise-Kaha-Kyun"" in a very crisply done script just like taken from the pages of "" James Hadley Chase"".Reason 2: This is not a Who-Dun-it? It is more of how did he-when did he-kinda flick, and it continuously kept me( and also all the people at the theater) at the edge of my seat and made me wonder, about what next?It made me think and think, and hold on to the chair tight, made me wanna kick the guy sitting in front of me talking over the phone, cause I was sensing the air of suspense and was totally gripped by the claws of this reel-o-magic. Reason 3: The entire cast,from the mastermind of the ""plan-A"" Seshadri (Dharmendra) to Prakash a.k.a Pakya(Vinay Pathak) to the very briefly kept Twinkle a.k.a Mrs.Shardul (Rimi Sen),everyone has been able to pull off exactly what the film expected them to. Debutante Neil Mukesh as Vikram a.k.a Johnny G is a discovery. He is not just plain wood as the other six-packs,sculpted physique league of bloody ordinary gentlemen are, but makes his presence felt throughout and has been absolutely successful in making the character of Johnny Gaddar come to life. Johnny isn't a strong guy, he is a smart guy. He has his weaknesses and he is scared of the bigger and stronger Cons. But his smartness,his luck and his perfect timing makes his Plan-B work. And Neil makes us believe that he IS Johnny while he deceives and betrays everyone. Last but not the Least, Zakir Hussain as Shardul is absolutely brilliant and Ashwini Kalsekar as Mrs.Pakya a.k.a Beauty Parlor is the icing on the Cake. Go watch the movie to find out why.Reason 4: The movie includes PUNE. Yippeee. From Pune Station to MG Road, to glimpses of Magnum Mall and Bombay Garage(was it?) . Woo hoo. I loved it. Reason 5: all of the ABOVE and even more. Johnny G offered me a slice of Tarantino even in vernacular. Especially the scene when Shardul is being hit and falls down back-first on his glass center table. Kill Bill revisited. Woohoo. What I liked most about the movie besides the Title Credits, is the pace at which the movie carried on. There are no extras or fillers or any element of Priyadarshan or RGV ki Aag. I have watched Mr.Raghavan's previous flick ""Ek Hasina Thi"" and I thought it was a good movie. Johnny G just surpasses all the expectations I had. It is a brilliantly made movie in all aspects from the sets to the script to the action chodeography to the fast paced editing to the jaw-dropping fast cinematography which captures the closed Train Toilets to the dim-lit compartments as brilliantly as the crowded dance floor of Club Escape or the intense nightmare mood of Vikram's apartment. Complaints: Only complaints are that it is a rated-A movie. So well, besides the Bam-Bam and the Dhishum Dhishum, I wanted some Muah-Muah too. Not that the movie did not have any scope for it. Rimi and Neil could have had a moment . Friggin!!!!! Just when you thought that it was flawless, my hormones pop-out. LOL. Need I say more. A word more spoken and I would start sounding like I have been paid for the publicity of this movie. Go watch it and you will and shall LOVE it. 8 on 10",johnny scores,neons red neons yellow milestones pune railway station lancers maroon maruti 800 bombay pune highway more neons uv lights da club no bling bling only cash bam bam phew what ride johnny gaddar is wait it best hindi movie its genre should i say that again or was i loud enough make my point clear adlabs presents sriram raghavans then boom title credits are absolutely thing watch watch out awesome is word or is it legendary ok i should come out barney shell just tell you more about movie why i loved it reason 1 solely title credits which is huge tribute its own right all 60s 70s thrillers especially well clearly mentioned too vijay anands works johnny mera naam which movies title has been taken jewel thief i definitely felt that mr raghavan always wanted pay kind homage them what rightfully done scenes like rimi sen reading r k narayans guide made into film by vijay anand or well vikram protagonist who is big big b fan watches parwana may be his influences eh johnny mera naam well there are other trivial stuff too which would soon make their way trivia list imdb like while shiva is being called first time he is watching kubricks eyes wide shut movie also brings back genre kaun kaise kaha kyun very crisply done script just like taken pages james hadley chase reason 2 this is not who dun it it is more how did he when did he kinda flick it continuously kept me also all people at theater at edge my seat made me wonder about what next it made me think think hold chair tight made me wanna kick guy sitting front me talking over phone cause i was sensing air suspense was totally gripped by claws this reel o magic reason 3 entire cast mastermind plan seshadri dharmendra prakash k pakya vinay pathak very briefly kept twinkle k mrs shardul rimi sen everyone has been able pull off exactly what film expected them debutante neil mukesh as vikram k johnny g is discovery he is not just plain wood as other six packs sculpted physique league bloody ordinary gentlemen are but makes his presence felt throughout has been absolutely successful making character johnny gaddar come life johnny isnt strong guy he is smart guy he has his weaknesses he is scared bigger stronger cons but his smartness his luck his perfect timing makes his plan b work neil makes us believe that he is johnny while he deceives betrays everyone last but not least zakir hussain as shardul is absolutely brilliant ashwini kalsekar as mrs pakya k beauty parlor is icing cake go watch movie find out why reason 4 movie includes pune yippeee pune station mg road glimpses magnum mall bombay garage was it woo hoo i loved it reason 5 all above even more johnny g offered me slice tarantino even vernacular especially scene when shardul is being hit falls down back first his glass center table kill bill revisited woohoo what i liked most about movie besides title credits is pace at which movie carried there are no extras or fillers or any element priyadarshan or rgv ki aag i have watched mr raghavans previous flick ek hasina thi i thought it was good movie johnny g just surpasses all expectations i had it is brilliantly made movie all aspects sets script action chodeography fast paced editing jaw dropping fast cinematography which captures closed train toilets dim lit compartments as brilliantly as crowded dance floor club escape or intense nightmare mood vikrams apartment complaints only complaints are that it is rated movie so well besides bam bam dhishum dhishum i wanted some muah muah too not that movie did not have any scope it rimi neil could have had moment friggin just when you thought that it was flawless my hormones pop out lol need i say more word more spoken i would start sounding like i have been paid publicity this movie go watch it you will shall love it 8 10,0.5517804928989141,0.26438492063492064,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Ode to Vijay Anand and James Hadley Chase,"Johnny Gaddaar is an original, honest, well-made and truly ""different"" attempt. It has a gripping storyline with twists paced out evenly every 15-mins. You will see shades of Tarantino'ism including the retro music played in the background. And the movie does transport into the 70's era.Johnny Gaddaar and then Om Shanti Om!

Needs to polish his skills as he progresses and choose wisely  or else risk himself turning into poor-man's Hritik.Rimmi Sen  Confident.Zakir Hussain  As usual dependable. Liked his flamboyant shirts.Vinay Pathak  Piece of advice:: Don't just stick to comedy, your versatility in this role speaks for itself. Govind Namdeo  Reminds of Danny's role in ""Aitbaar"".Ashwini Kalsekar  Gives her heart and soul into every little she does.Daya Patel  Short role, but leaves an impact (he is macko-man ""Shiva"", btw).Rasika Joshi  Well suited role (unlike Aag or Bhool Bhulaiya)----------------------------------------------------------------I thought Sridhar Raghavan's ""Ek Hasina Thi"" was a fluke owing to two factors namely RGV banner backing it (flying high then) and Sidney Sheldon's novel which it heavily borrowed the basic premise. With Johnny Gaddaar, Mr. Raghavan proves that he can pull off a spectacular feat.----------------------------------------------------------------Shortcomings:: Too much of reference to Faraar Dev Anand's howling got better off me a while later If the movie is trimmed by about 20-minutes it can translate into a sleek, edge-of-seat entertainment.****************************************************************Moral of the story:: Plain-lucky Johnny shouldn't press his luck too far.",ode vijay anand james hadley chase,johnny gaddaar is original honest well made truly different attempt it has gripping storyline with twists paced out evenly every 15 mins you will see shades tarantinoism including retro music played background movie does transport into 70s era johnny gaddaar then om shanti om is 70s era new buzzword bollywood today performances dharam paaji role shorter than expected why south indian name niel nitin mukesh promising indeed needs polish his skills as he progresses choose wisely or else risk himself turning into poor mans hritik rimmi sen confident zakir hussain as usual dependable liked his flamboyant shirts vinay pathak piece advice dont just stick comedy your versatility this role speaks itself govind namdeo reminds dannys role aitbaar ashwini kalsekar gives her heart soul into every little she does daya patel short role but leaves impact he is macko man shiva btw rasika joshi well suited role unlike aag or bhool bhulaiya i thought sridhar raghavans ek hasina thi was fluke owing two factors namely rgv banner backing it flying high then sidney sheldons novel which it heavily borrowed basic premise with johnny gaddaar mr raghavan proves that he can pull off spectacular feat shortcomings too much reference faraar dev anands howling got better off me while later if movie is trimmed by about 20 minutes it can translate into sleek edge seat entertainment moral story plain lucky johnny shouldnt press his luck too far,0.5382059607059607,0.17126581751581751,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8.0,Johnny Gaddar,"The movie was released without much fanfare, but it created a host of acclaimed reviews that I had to take notice and make effort to see this movie.The story is about 5 crooks  Seshadri (Dharmendra) is the respected ringleader, Prakash (Vinay Pathak) is the casino-club owner, Shardul (Zakir Hussain) is the businessman, Shiva (Daya Shetty) is the strong man and Vikram aka Vicky (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is an aspiring young man who wants to become rich quickly and he plays Johnny Gaddar. All of them put Rs.50 lakhs to buy a consignment from a Bangalore based Police Inspector Kalyan (Govind Namdeo). Shiva is sent to deliver the money from Bombay to Bangalore via train. Vicky plans to rob the money so that he can run away with Shardul's beautiful wife Twinkle (Rimi Sen). In doing so he kills Shiva. I would not tell you the whole story here, otherwise you will loose the fun of watching the movie.The movie is an edge of the seat thriller. We know who is the killer and are eager to see what would happen next. The Director Sriram Raghavan maintains the suspense till the very last frame of the movie and remains ahead of audiences. I read in the reviews comparisons being made of Sriram Raghavan to Quentin Tarantino and Pulp Fiction style narrative. I agree to that. This movie brings to Indian cinema this fine element of suspense and beautiful execution through fine direction. Truly Sriram Raghavan has arrived. His first venture Ek Hasina Thi was good, but was too restrictive form of revengeful story telling and after interval became not so engrossing film. But with Johnny Gaddar Sriram is in full tempo. Not only he has written the movie with great skill but directed it too, extracting fine performances from his cast. It is marvelous to see Dharmendra portray the role of respected ringleader (a big relief  otherwise Amitabh has sadly- overcaptured all the elderly roles of film industry); apart from him everyone else has acted fabulously. One passing reference to the new kid in the block Neil Nitin Mukesh and he has delivered the goods above average in his first movie. I think the casting of him as an innocent looking youngest member of the gang was an winning ace from Sriram.I would also like to mention the passing references made in Johnny Gaddar of contributions made by Hindi cinema through several decades, by adding old songs,music in background, adding dialogues that refer to some movie, character, actors, movies running on TV etc. Very well integrated!Lastly, the inspiration of the movie title  must be from Johny Mera Naam!

9.0,Awesome Thriller!!,"Recently saw this movie when one of my friend told me that it is an adaptation of James Hadley Chase's novel. I have read most of the JHC books and will vouch for it that if you read all of his books and act on them you'll one day end up a big fraud. There are so many innovative ways which JHC come up with to con people. Now being an ardent fan of JHC, I made it a point to see this movie but had some apprehensions at first because some years ago even Ketan Mehta tried to adapt a JHC novel, 'The Sucker Punch' into AAR YA PAAR, even some of the dialouges were lifted from the book but i guess he failed in the script. He went too far from what was there in the novel. Coming back to Johnny Gaddaar I found the story is not lifted from any of JHC's novels, it does follow a somewhat similar plot though. I feel it is Sriram Raghavan's (Of 'Ek Haseena Thi' fame) tribute to many personalities, Vijay Anand, R K Narayan (Rimi Sen is reading 'Guide' in the film), Rama Gopal Verma (Sriram was RGV's assistant), Hitchcock etc. In the opening credits he mentions some of the names like JHC and Vijay Anand.The movie features the grandson of the legendary singer Mukesh, Neil Nitin Mukesh and what a debut!!!!! I was amazed by the way he has carried out his role. Flawless. Also another brilliant performance by Vinay Pathak after Bheja Fry.The movie is about a gang whose members are involved in some kind of shady deals. One such deal promises the gang a lot of money, but one member of the gang is lured by the 'Whiff of Money' (Another JHC novel which Neil Mukesh is reading in the train) and began to hatch his own secret plans, leading to unforeseen situations for the group. The things go wrong when his plans goes astray. The movie is a relentlessly rigorous take on the wages of crime and what evil men do to their conscience for the sake of money. Johnny Gaddaar is not a compelling thriller but its witty direction and sincere performances make it a fine thriller, among the best in recent years. It is a much needed respite from song and dance type of movies which are being churned out these days. The soundtrack is groovy, Vishal-Shekhar has done justice to some old song references by mixing them well. Even the songs are a tribute to the olden era (Read Navketan Productions) of thrillers. Songs like Johnny Breakbeat Mera Naam aka 'Johnny Mera Naam', 'Bhule Bisre Geet', 'Revenge of the 70's', are well done. It is sad that the movie didn't got its due share commercially. But after the movie was well received by the critics, it mustered some figures commercially.

May not be a box office success, but this one is surely a good watch.The direction, the story, the camera work is great. But thing that stands out for me is acting. Great performances because good actors have been chosen for the movie. No lazy sons of yesteryear actors here.Also, the songs are few, short and faithful to the film. However, there are few problems.First half is perfect. But next 40 minutes are quite average and the film tends to drag but in the final stages, it again picks up and regains its form. Another problem is length. Shouldn't have been more than 1 hr 45 minutes but it was almost 40 minutes lengthier..Anyways, it was a good watch and easily comparable to good Hollywood thrillers.

10.0,best movie of 2007. must watch,"A fast-paced thriller, Johnny Gaddaar is ample testimony that you can make a gripping Bollywood movie without any of the big names.Also, as long as you have a decent story you don't have to go gallivanting around the globe filming in locales like Namibia, Australia, Switzerland or Brazil.Without doubt, Johnny Gaddaar comes with a nice story and a tight script. No meandering or sloppy detours here.Most Bollywood movies are unwatchable despite the presence of big name heroes and sultry sirens because of the wafer-thin stories. That is when our Bollywood bozos are not shamelessly stealing from Hollywood. Fortunately, Johnny Gaddaar is different.In the late British author James Hadley Chase tradition of providing a strong protagonist who is usually a criminal but not really a completely evil or loathsome figure, Johnny Gaddar offers us the criminal Vikram. Bad but not repulsive and carried along mostly by the tide, Vikram holds our attention throughout the movie.Johnny Gaddar packs all the ingredients of a fine thriller - love, crime, sexy girls, action, unexpected twists and betrayal.Newcomer Neil Nitin Mukesh (grandson of the famous singer Mukesh) does a decent job as the young lad Vikram in a haste to get rich. Only in one crucial scene featuring a confrontation with Dharmendra does Neil Nitin Mukesh falter and fails to deliver the goods.Besides Neil Nitin Mukesh, Dharmendra, Zakir Hussain, Vinay Pathak and Ashwini Kalsekar deliver solid performances too. Even that Bollywood clown Rimi Sen has thrown in an acceptable performance here.The story centers around a gang of five criminals headed by Seshadri (Dharmendra) who embark on an assignment that is supposed to net them a hefty profit in just a few days.But one member of the gang has other ideas.He wants all the money for himself so that he can make a new beginning in a far off place with his girl friend Mini (Rimi Sen). So the double crosser sets in motion a train of events with deadly consequences for the others.Johnny Gaddaar is easily one of the best Bollywood movies we've seen in this year.10/10",best movie 2007 must watch,fast paced thriller johnny gaddaar is ample testimony that you can make gripping bollywood movie without any big names also as long as you have decent story you dont have go gallivanting around globe filming locales like namibia australia switzerland or brazil without doubt johnny gaddaar comes with nice story tight script no meandering or sloppy detours here most bollywood movies are unwatchable despite presence big name heroes sultry sirens because wafer thin stories that is when our bollywood bozos are not shamelessly stealing hollywood fortunately johnny gaddaar is different late british author james hadley chase tradition providing strong protagonist who is usually criminal but not really completely evil or loathsome figure johnny gaddar offers us criminal vikram bad but not repulsive carried along mostly by tide vikram holds our attention throughout movie johnny gaddar packs all ingredients fine thriller love crime sexy girls action unexpected twists betrayal newcomer neil nitin mukesh grandson famous singer mukesh does decent job as young lad vikram haste get rich only one crucial scene featuring confrontation with dharmendra does neil nitin mukesh falter fails deliver goods besides neil nitin mukesh dharmendra zakir hussain vinay pathak ashwini kalsekar deliver solid performances too even that bollywood clown rimi sen has thrown acceptable performance here story centers around gang five criminals headed by seshadri dharmendra who embark assignment that is supposed net them hefty profit just few days but one member gang has other ideas he wants all money himself so that he can make new beginning far off place with his girl friend mini rimi sen so double crosser sets motion train events with deadly consequences others johnny gaddaar is easily one best bollywood movies weve seen this year 10 10,0.5311288349331827,0.12299548277809148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,A Perfect James Hadley Chase Thriller,"The entire movie has just one word - Awesome!!!! Cheers to director, he has evolved from better to best since his last movie- Ek Hasina Thi . I cannot wait for his next venture Cast: The team of crooks has really done a nice job. Dharmendra is no longer in a wasted role. The three other actors (Shiva, Shardul and Prakash) fit well in their roles. But rarely do you find an actor who can make such a lasting impression in his first movie, Neil. He easily fits as Vikram, the young charming hero (Anti-Hero????) having romance with one of the characters wife. His plan to steal the money from the entire team leads him to become a murderer. The movie then goes through lots of twists that it keeps you guessing what next. Thankfully the romance doesn't go beyond whats necessary. Songs don't take you away from the script.

It is like the Hitchcock movie ""North By Northwest"" or like the movie ""Phone Booth"" - when you start watching it you cannot stop, you have to see the whole movie.Sad but a true fact that non-masala good movies always fail at box office, so it is no surprise that Johnny G didn't do well at Box Office.I wasn't aware of this film director before, but the way the movie is directed and the bits and pieces are displayed - I am really impressed! Each and every detail are so nicely laid out, even the titles at the start are really impressive. Don't forget the way the word ""Intermission"" is shown.

10.0,A must watch!!,"Great performance from each of the actors. Fantastic direction. Great sound track. The action sequences were well thought of. No where the movie is unnecessarily stretched and no exaggerations. The movie might not do well all over India but certainly deserves a big viewer-ship and probably will do very well in the big cities and abroad. Very minute details were looked into such as driving over night from one city to the next and the head lights of the car remains on the next morning when its bright. Train passing through stations and the sounds that one is used to hearing when the train pulls out of the city slowly picking up speed. Guy knocking on the train toilet door and another guy coming out of the toilet with a toot brush in his hand is so very real. There is so much to write about the movie but that would mean writing some spoilers. Its not very often when the Indian cinema comes out with great thrillers.

8.0,"For Vikram, killing people is like eating potato chips...you can't stop with just one!","""Johnny Goddaar"" is a very good crime film. It's about a gang leader who betrays his friends...yet none of the other leaders know who the betrayer is...and end up killing each other or being killed as a result.The film concerns a small group of hoods who all report to the local boss. When the boss arranges for a huge shipment of money to be picked up and transported back to him, Vikram decides it's a chance to once and for all make a big score--a score that will enable him to disappear with a fellow gangster's wife, Minni. But Minni's husband, Shardul, is a tough guy and so are the rest of the gangsters...and Vikram sure doesn't seem tough enough to carry it off. His only chance is if he's incredibly lucky...and he is throughout most of the film...incredibly lucky! But, like many crime films, his luck can only hold up so long.So what did I like about this film? Mostly it was the very clever story--especially the way everything worked out perfectly by the end of the film. One of the better Bollywood gangster films I've seen and well worth your time.",vikram killing people is like eating potato chips you cant stop with just one,johnny goddaar is very good crime film its about gang leader who betrays his friends yet none other leaders know who betrayer is end up killing each other or being killed as result film concerns small group hoods who all report local boss when boss arranges huge shipment money be picked up transported back him vikram decides its chance once all make big score score that will enable him disappear with fellow gangsters wife minni but minnis husband shardul is tough guy so are rest gangsters vikram sure doesnt seem tough enough carry it off his only chance is if hes incredibly lucky he is throughout most film incredibly lucky but like many crime films his luck can only hold up so long so what did i like about this film mostly it was very clever story especially way everything worked out perfectly by end film one better bollywood gangster films ive seen well worth your time,0.5827777777777778,0.17175213675213674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Johnny The Deciver,"With the very under-rated 2008 Bollywood Neo-Noir Maharathi having given me a preview of what excellent Neo-Noir work could be done in Bollywood,I decided to search round on Google,with a small amount of hope that I would eventually run into another Bolly-Noir.To my surprise,one of the first results that I was very lucky to find,was an a essay which took a look at the modern rise of Film Noir in Bollywood, that had a completely unknown ,(to me) film as the centre for the discussion on Film/Neo-Noir in Bollywood.Checking up for more info about this intriguing Neo-Noir,I was thrilled to see almost nothing but complete praise for this exciting looking movie.After reading as much as I could about the film,I felt that it was about time for me to meet the one and only Mr Johnny Gaddaar. The plot: Barely missing from hitting a car,a police van patrol the local streets as a mysterious stranger at a near by house,shoots someone who is attempting to unlock a garage door. A few weeks earlier: Stopping a coach from allowing his on-off again girlfriend from leaving him behind,""business man"" Vikram impersonates a cop to successfully grip his runaway girlfriend .Desperately trying to win her trust,Vikram is given a tough ultimatum by his girlfriend:either go with her,or carry working in a group of four other ""businessmen"" who run an illegal gambling operation.Thinking about the hand that he's been dealt,Vikram tries to make his girlfriend forget about the ""problems,by successfully charming her to his hotel bed.Whilst Vikram keeps trying to patch things up with the girl,the other four gangster businessmen, ( Seshadri, Shardul, Shiva and Prakash) begin to plan on how they can all finally leave the ""chicken feed"" behind,and at last enter the big league's.Building up a series of fairly high-level congestion's,the gang eventually decide that they will each contribute a good part of their own personal savings,in order to have complete control over a huge intake of drugs,which are to be brought into the city in a few days time by a corrupt cop.As each of the ""loyal"" gang members start to gather up their cash,Vikram begins to consider that,instead of fully cooperating with his friends plan of climbing up the ladder,if he should instead make the drug deal a bust,and cunningly take the money and run? View on the film: From this amazing film's pastel colour opening credits,co-writer/ (along with Vinay Choudary) director Sriram Raghavan shows an astonishingly stylised,intelligent eye which gives even the most ""normal"" moments in the movie a real flair.Using the pre-credits scene to cleverly set the movie in a James Hadley Chase inspired Neo-Noir world,Siram smartly uses bold neon colours in the film (from Vikram tossing a coin to decide his destination,to the bright objects hanging by a characters window) to give the film a fantastic,sharply-lit gritty Noir feel,which intensifies into an abrasive mood,as the film reaches its stunning down beat end.Looking at the screenplay of the film,Raghavan and Choudary brilliantly have their web of deceit and back stabbing gradually come to the surface of the movie.As the impressively non-tangled web allows for the viewer to pick up on ""hints"" in the initial first section of the film,Sriram and Vinay choose the best moments to progress the films story with shocking,grim twist & turns that allow the film to end in the murky Noir rain.",johnny deciver,with very under rated 2008 bollywood neo noir maharathi having given me preview what excellent neo noir work could be done bollywood i decided search round google with small amount hope that i would eventually run into another bolly noir my surprise one first results that i was very lucky find was essay which took look at modern rise film noir bollywood that had completely unknown me film as centre discussion film neo noir bollywood checking up more info about this intriguing neo noir i was thrilled see almost nothing but complete praise this exciting looking movie after reading as much as i could about film i felt that it was about time me meet one only mr johnny gaddaar plot barely missing hitting car police van patrol local streets as mysterious stranger at near by house shoots someone who is attempting unlock garage door few weeks earlier stopping coach allowing his off again girlfriend leaving him behind business man vikram impersonates cop successfully grip his runaway girlfriend desperately trying win her trust vikram is given tough ultimatum by his girlfriend either go with her or carry working group four other businessmen who run illegal gambling operation thinking about hand that hes been dealt vikram tries make his girlfriend forget about problems by successfully charming her his hotel bed whilst vikram keeps trying patch things up with girl other four gangster businessmen seshadri shardul shiva prakash begin plan how they can all finally leave chicken feed behind at last enter big leagues building up series fairly high level congestions gang eventually decide that they will each contribute good part their own personal savings order have complete control over huge intake drugs which are be brought into city few days time by corrupt cop as each loyal gang members start gather up their cash vikram begins consider that instead fully cooperating with his friends plan climbing up ladder if he should instead make drug deal bust cunningly take money run view film this amazing films pastel colour opening credits co writer along with vinay choudary director sriram raghavan shows astonishingly stylised intelligent eye which gives even most normal moments movie real flair using pre credits scene cleverly set movie james hadley chase inspired neo noir world siram smartly uses bold neon colours film vikram tossing coin decide his destination bright objects hanging by characters window give film fantastic sharply lit gritty noir feel which intensifies into abrasive mood as film reaches its stunning down beat end looking at screenplay film raghavan choudary brilliantly have their web deceit back stabbing gradually come surface movie as impressively non tangled web allows viewer pick up hints initial first section film sriram vinay choose best moments progress films story with shocking grim twist turns that allow film end murky noir rain,0.6060249433106574,0.13102154195011342,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.4}"
