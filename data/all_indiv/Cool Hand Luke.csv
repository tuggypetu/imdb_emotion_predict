10.0,"""Luke"" is a character Newman was born to play - and this is one hell of a beautiful film","This film got me from the first frame to the last. It's not even because of the story (which I love, of course) - it's just so very well made. And so modern. The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven't seen in an American film released prior to this one. And yet, although it is considered a classic, when people talk about the ""New Hollywood"" somehow 'Cool Hand Luke' is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967 and before 'The Graduate'. I look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn't aged a bit. This is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting, iconic characters and scenes, wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable. Funny, tragic and moving, 'Cool Hand Luke' is one hell of a film. What we've got here is NOT failure to communicate - but a 10 star masterpiece.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",luke is character newman was born play this is one hell beautiful film,this film got me first frame last its not even because story which i love course its just so very well made so modern kind angles perspectives camera uses way it zooms out or even allows itself literally get dirty way this whole picture was shot is just something i havent seen american film released prior this one yet although it is considered classic when people talk about new hollywood somehow cool hand luke is hardly ever mentioned despite fact that it came out only couple months after bonnie clyde 1967 before graduate i look at this film mainly as character study but story arc also works very well it hasnt aged bit this is one those rare films that was way ahead its time which has simply everything great acting iconic characters scenes wonderful music cinematography is just unbelievable funny tragic moving cool hand luke is one hell film what weve got here is not failure communicate but 10 star masterpiece favorite films masterpieces low budget b movies tv shows reviewed,0.5329173430735932,0.1776988636363636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,"Not just a prison film, but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it","Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce's novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it's transfer to the big screen. I was not disappointed.Cool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that. It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into. When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is ""Small Town, not much to do in the evening"", which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid. Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds ""just settlin some old scores"". It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property. As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private. Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body's rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong. At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, ""calling it your job don't make it right, Boss."" In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, ""A man's got to go his own way"" or as he also puts it, ""I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can't seem to find no elbow room"". As Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates. Some of them wear chains, some of them do not. It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes. We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform.  You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line. As the Captain reiterates, ""for your own good, you'll learn the rules"" A point driven home often.What we discover about their crimes is minuscule. One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us. It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don't feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce's story, and Luke as the focal point. Because of his individuality, it doesn't take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates. It is not a role he chooses, or even wants. It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others. He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn't have to deal with it. He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.Another principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy). It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten. Dragline's admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process. He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm. I can't remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.Cool Hand Luke is not without it's humorous moments especially in the early going. It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages. Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke's dilemma.In translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen. Lalo Shifrin's memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang. Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here.  As Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career. It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman's role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character. As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I'm at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.Cool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word. It is a film that will long be remembered.My grade: A+",not just prison film but excellent film about not being able conform world that requires it,having had advantage reading donn pearces novel about year before seeing cool hand luke it was with great anticipation that i awaited its transfer big screen i was not disappointed cool hand luke could easily be classified by misguided as just prison yarn but it is so much more than that it is story man who refuses be nailed down or conform rules regulations society that he has never craved fit into when lucas jackson is arrested cutting heads off parking meters his explanation prison captain strother martin is small town not much do evening which would have us believe he was just being drunk stupid later one other inmates he mutters same answer but importantly adds just settlin some old scores it is brief but important point helping define character luke beyond just being drunk damaging public property as service man we also discover that luke won bronze star achieved rank sergeant but came out as private again early evidence that luke is unable conform any bodys rules but his own yet we are given clear evidence that luke knows what is right principal what is wrong at one point film when they are putting luke box under less than reasonable circumstances he tells boss calling it your job dont make it right boss visit his mother arletta jo van fleet luke says plenty about his own character by telling her mans got go his own way or as he also puts it i tried live always free above board like you but i cant seem find no elbow room as luke enters prison that will supposedly be his home next two years we meet other inmates some them wear chains some them do not it is point early film that director stuart rosenberg emphasizes we understand quickly that sooner or later you conform you either walk line way bosses tell you or they will find means get you walk line as captain reiterates your own good youll learn rules point driven home often what we discover about their crimes is minuscule one is jailed manslaughter after hitting pedestrian with his car another is paper hanger another new inmate is charged with breaking entering assault nature their crimes is unimportant us it enables view these prisoners as men while we dont feel any genuine sympathy them feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been distraction true purpose pearces story luke as focal point because his individuality it doesnt take luke long before he unexpectedly becomes hero other inmates it is not role he chooses or even wants it unexpectedly imposes burden him having live up expectations others he never truly understands nature this hero worship would be just as happy if he didnt have deal with it he is still trying find his way world if there is any real purpose his existence another principal character is dragline george kennedy it is he who finally establishes fact that cool hand luke is man who can not be beaten draglines admiration luke seems extend fact that he dragline has learned rules how get by but yet regrets having lost some his own individuality process he is rest inmates microcosm i cant remember role that george kennedy has ever been better he deservedly won best supporting actor award cool hand luke is not without its humorous moments especially early going it is these moments that help move film early stages darker more despairing later stages perhaps that reason alone we are even more effected by lukes dilemma translating his novel screen donn pearce along with frank pierson has managed bring heart soul his nove big screen lalo shifrins memorable score emphasizes often repeated drudgery working chain gang director stuart rosenberg made more good films after cool hand luke but my opinion never achieved same degree perfection that he does here as cool hand luke paul newman give one most memorable performances long distinguished career it is not easy task portraying man who travels road being sincere individualist man who may be beaten defeated yet end is still unwilling accept that fate although rod steiger won best actor award that year one could argue that newmans role was more difficult as it required substantially different subtle ranges character as failure cool hand luke achieve best picture nomination im at loss explain that malfunction especially when likes doctor doolittle guess whos coming dinner far lesser efforts than this were nominated cool hand luke is true classic every sense word it is film that will long be remembered my grade,0.559933944157245,0.16771809635887305,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Prison classic with a career-best Newman,"On the face of it, Cool Hand Luke tells a simplistic story about a guy who breaks the law and is sent to a rural prison, where he must earn status among the prisoners. This in turn sets him against the guards and governor, who want nothing better than to knock him down, and the plot goes from there.Where this film excels is in its depth. It can be read in a number of different ways, from example as a religious allegory and also in terms of status and power in the modern age. In essence there's a microcosm of society inside the prison with each character fulfilling a different role or tier. Paul Newman plays the classic rebellious character, a man unwilling to conform, ever, and he does it in such a brilliant way that I'm surprised he didn't win his Oscar.Newman's the perfect fit for the part: upbeat, funny, and incredibly sympathetic. I haven't seen all of his films, but I find it hard to imagine he could better his role here. Equalling him is George Kennedy, also at his best, and fully deserving his best supporting actor Oscar. His character is perfectly written and, indeed, this film is perfectly made, with great attention to visual detail throughout. It's also notable for featuring a number of classic sequences, from the egg eating to the 'Plastic Jesus' song and of course the escape attempts. A fantastic film indeed.",prison classic with career best newman,face it cool hand luke tells simplistic story about guy who breaks law is sent rural prison where he must earn status among prisoners this turn sets him against guards governor who want nothing better than knock him down plot goes there where this film excels is its depth it can be read number different ways example as religious allegory also terms status power modern age essence theres microcosm society inside prison with each character fulfilling different role or tier paul newman plays classic rebellious character man unwilling conform ever he does it such brilliant way that im surprised he didnt win his oscar newmans perfect fit part upbeat funny incredibly sympathetic i havent seen all his films but i find it hard imagine he could better his role here equalling him is george kennedy also at his best fully deserving his best supporting actor oscar his character is perfectly written indeed this film is perfectly made with great attention visual detail throughout its also notable featuring number classic sequences egg eating plastic jesus song course escape attempts fantastic film indeed,0.5312289562289563,0.3819023569023569,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Newman's Brilliance,"Cool Hand Luke (1967) **** (out of 4) Paul Newman plays the title character, a man who just can't reform to the rules in life and can't reform to the rules when sent to a chain gang. This is certainly without question one of my favorite movies and it certainly had a large impact on my life when I watched it as a teenager. I hold this film very close to my heart and especially the character of Luke but even without the personal feelings this remains one of the better movies out there. Some have called it a prison movie but I think that's really an insult because the film is so much more than that including one of the best character studies out there. The film has so many laughs, so many painful moments and so many dramatic moments but I think the true heart of the film is in its honesty towards Newman's character. There are countless great scenes including the legendary egg eating contest but one of my favorites has always been the ending with Newman talking to God inside the church. Needless to say, Newman is brilliant in the role and while it's hard to say which one performance of his is his greatest this one here is awfully close. You can really see Newman sticking his heart and soul into the role and you really can't imagine anyone else playing the character. George Kennedy also deserved his Oscar and Strother Martin makes for one great villain.",newmans brilliance,cool hand luke 1967 out 4 paul newman plays title character man who just cant reform rules life cant reform rules when sent chain gang this is certainly without question one my favorite movies it certainly had large impact my life when i watched it as teenager i hold this film very close my heart especially character luke but even without personal feelings this remains one better movies out there some have called it prison movie but i think thats really insult because film is so much more than that including one best character studies out there film has so many laughs so many painful moments so many dramatic moments but i think true heart film is its honesty towards newmans character there are countless great scenes including legendary egg eating contest but one my favorites has always been ending with newman talking god inside church needless say newman is brilliant role while its hard say which one performance his is his greatest this one here is awfully close you can really see newman sticking his heart soul into role you really cant imagine anyone else playing character george kennedy also deserved his oscar strother martin makes one great villain,0.6176929392446633,0.2661330049261083,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,What we have here is no failure,"Greetings again from the darkness. I went way too many years without watching this movie again, so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series, I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history: ""What we have here is failure to communicate."" No question that's a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.Based on the novel by Donn Pearce, who spent two years on a chain-gang, this is the story of Luke (Paul Newman) who just can't bring himself to conform to the rules, regardless whether those be the rules of the military, society, prison, or those self-imposed by the convicts. We are introduced to Luke as he drunkenly cuts off the top of parking meters on main street of a small town. Later, in a throw away line, we learn he was gaining revenge on someone. It's the clear indication that while he doesn't always want to fit in, Luke clearly knows right from wrong.There are so many terrific scenes in this film, that it's not possible to discuss each. Every scene with the prison warden, played by Strother Martin, is intense. Each of the Boss guards are frightening, especially Morgan Woodward as the sharpshooter behind the mirrored shades. There are numerous impactful scenes featuring the group of convicts. Even though we learn little about the individuals, we realize the fragile male psyche is on full display. Despite the power of all of these characters and scenes, the real strength of the film is the relationship between Luke and Dragline (George Kennedy). Watching the early cat and mouse game, and the subsequent transfer of power, feature two amazing actors at the top of their game.George Kennedy rightfully won the Best Supporting Actor award and continued on to become one of the most successful and prolific character actors of the 70's and 80's, and his career culminated with his iconic role in the Naked Gun series. As for Paul Newman, this is one of his best performance in a long line of standout performances. This one is in the middle stage of his career and he exuded manliness with a touch of sensitivity. He and Strother Martin would meet again in one of the best sequences of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Watching Luke win over all the convicts, including the previous leader played by Kennedy is stunning, yet gut-wrenching when offset by the scenes with the guards who are hell bent on getting Luke to understand his place. They understand the risk he poses to the systematic rhythms of the prison.The supporting cast is downright incredible. This was the feature film debut for: Ralph Waite (4 years later he became the beloved paternal figure of TV's The Waltons); Joe Don Baker(Buford Pusser from Walking Tall); James Gammon (later the crusty manager in Major League); and Anthony Zerbe, another iconic character actor of the 70's and 80's. Also featured are Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton (singing a few songs), Wayne Rogers (from MASH), Richard Davalos (James Dean's brother Aron in East of Eden), and Rance Howard (Ron's dad as the sheriff). In a brief, but truly great scene, Jo Van Fleet (also from East of Eden), appears as Arletta, and we quickly understand Luke's background.Often overlooked by film historians, ""Lucille"" putting on a show for the convicts as she washes her car, is a scene that is meant for more than titillation. As she creatively buffs the windows, the reaction of the convicts reminds us that these are still men and no amount of humiliation and degradation can change that. One of my friends argues that Joy Harmon was clearly cheated out of an Oscar for this scene.The score is the handy work of Lalo Schifrin and expertly captures the moment ... especially in the black top scene. Director Stuart Rosenberg was known only for his TV work when he got this script. He went on to direct another prison movie in 1980 called Brubaker. Starring Newman's Butch Cassidy co-star Robert Redford, the film was a decent prison drama, but not at the level of Cool Hand Luke ... which by the way, was installed into the National Film Registry in 2005.",what we have here is no failure,greetings again darkness i went way too many years without watching this movie again so when cinemark included it summer classic film series i was my seat nice early mention this movie first thing people do is quote one most famous lines movie history what we have here is failure communicate no question thats great line but there is so much more this movie it holds up beautifully 45 years later based novel by donn pearce who spent two years chain gang this is story luke paul newman who just cant bring himself conform rules regardless whether those be rules military society prison or those self imposed by convicts we are introduced luke as he drunkenly cuts off top parking meters main street small town later throw away line we learn he was gaining revenge someone its clear indication that while he doesnt always want fit luke clearly knows right wrong there are so many terrific scenes this film that its not possible discuss each every scene with prison warden played by strother martin is intense each boss guards are frightening especially morgan woodward as sharpshooter behind mirrored shades there are numerous impactful scenes featuring group convicts even though we learn little about individuals we realize fragile male psyche is full display despite power all these characters scenes real strength film is relationship between luke dragline george kennedy watching early cat mouse game subsequent transfer power feature two amazing actors at top their game george kennedy rightfully won best supporting actor award continued become one most successful prolific character actors 70s 80s his career culminated with his iconic role naked gun series as paul newman this is one his best performance long line standout performances this one is middle stage his career he exuded manliness with touch sensitivity he strother martin would meet again one best sequences butch cassidy sundance kid watching luke win over all convicts including previous leader played by kennedy is stunning yet gut wrenching when offset by scenes with guards who are hell bent getting luke understand his place they understand risk he poses systematic rhythms prison supporting cast is downright incredible this was feature film debut ralph waite 4 years later he became beloved paternal figure tvs waltons joe don baker buford pusser walking tall james gammon later crusty manager major league anthony zerbe another iconic character actor 70s 80s also featured are dennis hopper harry dean stanton singing few songs wayne rogers mash richard davalos james deans brother aron east eden rance howard rons dad as sheriff brief but truly great scene jo van fleet also east eden appears as arletta we quickly understand lukes background often overlooked by film historians lucille putting show convicts as she washes her car is scene that is meant more than titillation as she creatively buffs windows reaction convicts reminds us that these are still men no amount humiliation degradation can change that one my friends argues that joy harmon was clearly cheated out oscar this scene score is handy work lalo schifrin expertly captures moment especially black top scene director stuart rosenberg was known only his tv work when he got this script he went direct another prison movie 1980 called brubaker starring newmans butch cassidy co star robert redford film was decent prison drama but not at level cool hand luke which by way was installed into national film registry 2005,0.5032356532356531,0.2369963369963371,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Sticking it to the Man,"""For the secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance."" - Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Stuart Rosenberg directs ""Cool Hand Luke"". The plot? Paul Newman plays Luke Jackson, a young drifter who returns home after WW2. Luke's been dealt one bad hand after the next, and, no matter how he plays his cards, always seems to lose. The film opens with Luke, drunk and shameless, knocking the heads off parking meters. The authorities try to cash in on our everyday movements, and this lack of freedom ticks Luke off. The poor guy just wants to be free, man.After being arrested, Luke is sent to a Florida prison. What then unfolds is one of the greatest existential movies of all time. Luke's experiences, his conversations with God, his isolation and alienation, and a pair of profound scenes, both involving his mother, elevate ""Cool Hand Luke"" above most prison-break movies.Of course this period saw a number of strong prison flicks (""The Great Escape"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""King Rat"", ""Birdman of Alcatraz"", ""Papillon"", ""Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Hole"", ""Escape from Alcatraz"", ""A Man Escaped"", ""Riot in Cell Block 11"" etc), but ""Cool Hand Luke"" takes a far more mythical stance. We don't know much about Luke. He's held at a distance, never looks anyone in the eyes when speaking and always has a sly grin on his face. And yet behind his smile we sense deep pain, though its a pain matched by a dogged spirit to continue fighting. Interestingly, whilst a film like ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" had a system that despite its flaws genuinely tried to heal and help others, Luke's social institution is corrupt and in many aspects pointless. Still, for a while Luke abides by it. He goes about the state's business with a smile, cutting grass and paving roads. He only has 2 years in chains. He can make it. And like he says, he has no place else to go. No plans. He plays his cards with cool, detached ambivalence.In one beautiful scene, Luke's dying mother comes to visit. What follows is a touching conversation, she informing us that tried her best with Luke, giving him nothing but love. And yet, no amount of motherly affection has helped her family. Because of this, she says, she ""wishes mankind were like dogs"". She wishes she could abandon her children and forget about them, never having to worry or fret about how they are, what they'll do or where they'll go. Of course she loves Luke, but hates the agony he puts her through. And yet we sense that she understands him intimately. Perhaps she admires him because she too has been dealt a life of bad hands.Luke's outlook changes when his mother dies and the prison warden locks him in a box for no particular reason. When the Boss says ""Just doing my job"", Luke replies ""That don't make it right."" From here on Luke begins to fight back. He refuses to spend his life on his knees and refuses to submit. The film then becomes a tale of resistance and idolatry. The other inmates quickly begin to idolise Luke, worshipping his never-give-up spirit. But rather than fight themselves, they sit back and exalt Luke, relying him to personify their own desires. Luke begins to resent this. ""Step feeding off me!"" he yells. But they're content to sit on the sidelines. He's a one man revolution, and like many revolutionaries is praised for his stance from afar but never actively supported. Why do men have to die for causes before we take notice?The film ends on an ambiguous note, in which Luke may or may not be riddled with bullets. Does Luke smile? Does he die? Does he survive? If he does survive, is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film. The ending thus suggests that though Luke has died and the system utterly beaten him down, the men nevertheless choose to believe in him. They believe he has risen - indeed, the film is filled with Christian imagery) - that he's survived death and still fighting the fight, sticking it to the man for all of mankind.But like that photograph, the inmate's belief is an illusion. Luke is dead, and though his fighting spirit remains in the hearts of these men, it will take something larger to wake them up and shake them out of weak surrender. In the end, ""Cool Hand Luke"" suggests something almost contradictory: that hope must be held onto lest we submit, but that such hope, fuelled by a kind of mythologising and shared delusion, is precisely what engenders submission. 9/10- An accidental masterpiece. The planets really lined up for this one. The only flaw is an overly silly (though iconic) car wash scene.Worth multiple viewings.",sticking it man,secret mans being is not only live but have something live without stable conception object life man would not consent go living would rather destroy himself than remain earth though he had bread abundance fyodor dostoyevsky stuart rosenberg directs cool hand luke plot paul newman plays luke jackson young drifter who returns home after ww2 lukes been dealt one bad hand after next no matter how he plays his cards always seems lose film opens with luke drunk shameless knocking heads off parking meters authorities try cash our everyday movements this lack freedom ticks luke off poor guy just wants be free man after being arrested luke is sent florida prison what then unfolds is one greatest existential movies all time lukes experiences his conversations with god his isolation alienation pair profound scenes both involving his mother elevate cool hand luke above most prison break movies course this period saw number strong prison flicks great escape bridge river kwai king rat birdman alcatraz papillon cuckoos nest hole escape alcatraz man escaped riot cell block 11 etc but cool hand luke takes far more mythical stance we dont know much about luke hes held at distance never looks anyone eyes when speaking always has sly grin his face yet behind his smile we sense deep pain though its pain matched by dogged spirit continue fighting interestingly whilst film like one flew over cuckoos nest had system that despite its flaws genuinely tried heal help others lukes social institution is corrupt many aspects pointless still while luke abides by it he goes about states business with smile cutting grass paving roads he only has 2 years chains he can make it like he says he has no place else go no plans he plays his cards with cool detached ambivalence one beautiful scene lukes dying mother comes visit what follows is touching conversation she informing us that tried her best with luke giving him nothing but love yet no amount motherly affection has helped her family because this she says she wishes mankind were like dogs she wishes she could abandon her children forget about them never having worry or fret about how they are what theyll do or where theyll go course she loves luke but hates agony he puts her through yet we sense that she understands him intimately perhaps she admires him because she too has been dealt life bad hands lukes outlook changes when his mother dies prison warden locks him box no particular reason when boss says just doing my job luke replies that dont make it right here luke begins fight back he refuses spend his life his knees refuses submit film then becomes tale resistance idolatry other inmates quickly begin idolise luke worshipping his never give up spirit but rather than fight themselves they sit back exalt luke relying him personify their own desires luke begins resent this step feeding off me he yells but theyre content sit sidelines hes one man revolution like many revolutionaries is praised his stance afar but never actively supported why do men have die causes before we take notice film ends ambiguous note which luke may or may not be riddled with bullets does luke smile does he die does he survive if he does survive is his survival merely wishful thinking part his fellow inmates note that films final image is brief shot photograph it was established earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents lie we also know that photographs image was staged that photograph itself was torn shreds earlier film ending thus suggests that though luke has died system utterly beaten him down men nevertheless choose believe him they believe he has risen indeed film is filled with christian imagery that hes survived death still fighting fight sticking it man all mankind but like that photograph inmates belief is illusion luke is dead though his fighting spirit remains hearts these men it will take something larger wake them up shake them out weak surrender end cool hand luke suggests something almost contradictory that hope must be held onto lest we submit but that such hope fuelled by kind mythologising shared delusion is precisely what engenders submission 9 10 accidental masterpiece planets really lined up this one only flaw is overly silly though iconic car wash scene worth multiple viewings,0.5421000417710944,0.11999411407306142,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.43}"

Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact... The motion picture (nominated for 4 Academy Awards) won him his 4th Academy Award nomination... Newman is again a cynical loner, but he's also charming, and everything is calculated to involve us with him; like ""Hombre,"" the film begins and ends with closeups of his face, but here, appropriately, he has an engaging smile The opening, where he drinks beer, unscrews tops from parking meters and mumbles to the arriving cop, recalls Dean's drunken incoherence at the start of ""Rebel Without a Cause""an apt title for Luke He breaks rules for no apparent reason, wherever he is, including the chain gang to which he's sentenced Unlike Paul Muni in ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,"" who steals only to eat and is turned by society into a hardened criminal, Luke is a criminal from the start, and his crime isn't motivated by hunger It's a meaningless anti-authority gesturethe existentialist ""gratuitous act,"" committed purely for the sake of committing it Luke engages our sympathy not because he is economically deprived or the product of an unhappy home, but because for him the act of rebellion is its own justification: he's the perfect sixties heroInitially, Luke alienates the prisoners by his indifference and sarcasm, and the top dog, Dragline (George Kennedy) picks a fight with him Luke is severely beaten but keeps fighting, and thisplus his continual defiance of the guardswins him the men's respect Their admiration grows when he proves he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs, one after the other, in only one hour, another gratuitous act (""somethin' to do""). But Luke gradually becomes a victim of the excessive admiration, rebelling because they expect him to, which leads to a pattern of escapes and captures As the warden says, ""What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach."" Even though Luke becomes subservient after torture, he again escapes Dragline admires the way he fooled the guards while planning all along to escape But Luke says he really did break down, and asserts: ""l never planned anything in my life."" Even his last act is motivated not by heroism but by impulseThe physical punishment Newman's characters often undergo reaches an extreme here, as Luke constantly invites pain (in his fight with Dragline, he says, ""You're gonna have to kill me.""). Underlying his sometimes vigorous rebelliousness is despair at a cruelly indifferent world But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had ""that Luke smile"" to the very end We last see a montage of shots of Luke smilingthe men's vision of him as unbeaten and almost immortal Newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism As in ""Hombre,"" he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, ""cool"" manner He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him Like Rocky Graziano, he says he tried to live cleanly, but could never find a way But the mood is quite different here: instead of intense emotion, there are on1y ingenious expressions of uneasiness, regret, sadness, acceptance Newman conveys his unspoken affection entirely through his glances and reactions, as she wistfully remarks that she once had high hopes for him The actor even survives the film's pretentious attempts to make him a mock-Christ figure Besides the obvious sacrifice-resurrection parallel, he's even shown in the exact crucifixion position following his fifty-egg (Last Supper?) ordeal There are two badly conceived dialogs with a God he doesn't believe inafter which he realizes, ""l gotta find my own way,"" a rather unconcealed statement of existential despairbut Newman performs them with quiet conviction. His mock religion is better suggested by the bottle opener he wears in lieu of a religious medal And the despair is effectively dramatized in his reaction to his mother's death The men leave him by himself, and he sits on his bed, playing the banjo With a sad, breaking voice, he sings a religious parody: ""l don't care if it rains or freezes, long as 1 got my plastic Jesus"" He looks down and begins crying, but sings faster, obsessively, withdrawing into himself and expressing his utter loneliness in a world that has no God It's one of the most moving scenes in all of Newman's workParalleled to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a character study, which works beautifully, very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view, a good-looking

8.0,memorable,"Truly a memorable movie, and more than just a documentary about southern road gangs. It's a study on the theme of the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of oppression. I was about to name this as Newman's finest performance until I thought of Eddy Felsen in ""The Hustler"" and Frank Galvin in ""The Verdict""; it's impossible to choose among such a cornucopia of acting achievements, but Luke is right up there (the analogy to Luke as Christ becomes a tad heavy-handed when we see him, at the close of the egg-eating scene, stretched out, arms outward, feet crossed, as if crucified; none the less, it's a powerful image). There is no doubt, however, about George Kennedy as Dragline; it is his finest achievement, and fully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is also fascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates - actors such as Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite. and Wayne Rogers - who would go on to fame in their own right.

,The anti-hero,"One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero). This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.

It was offered as such even on VHS.When I looked at this film sometime in the '90s, I was surprised that the famous line from it: ""What we have here is a failure to communicate,"" was only used twice, and the second time being the last sentence uttered by Newman. I had thought that Strother Martin had said it several times. Boy, Martin was one of the more effective villains in some 1960s film, a mean-talking sadistic guy.This movie was another of the pioneers in promoting a new thing on screen: the ""anti-hero,"" so it was popular in the protest decade of the '60s. Newman's character fit right into the period where the rebel is the hero and the authority figure is the bad guy. You've seen this repeatedly ever since, although filmmakers have always loved rebels.George Kennedy gives Newman memorable support as ""Dragline"" and was aptly awarded for his performance.

8.0,"""He's A Rebel And He'll Never Never Be Any Good""","In Cool Hand Luke Paul Newman shows us what the underside of what life is like as a rebel. Picture James Dean doing this part had he lived to do films like these.Newman plays his usual non-conformist rebel type, but he's really a rebel without a cause. He's in his early forties, a Korean war veteran who just hasn't found his place in civilian life. He gets himself busted for no great cause, just on a drunken spree in some Southern town he decides to knock the heads off a bunch of parking meters.That lands him a stint in a county jail with a lot of outdoor work on a road gang. He fights with, but later wins the respect and becomes friends with George Kennedy the head honcho in his barracks.The real tragedy of Cool Hand Luke is that Newman is a failure in life, it's why he's in prison. He gains the respect of his fellow convicts for those ways, but that involves going against the penal system and in the end that gets you nothing. Can you picture James Dean as a forty something doing what Newman is doing? It would have been his kind of role for sure.Newman does a fine job playing the non-conformist Luke who seems to be just going on the path fate has decreed for him. George Kennedy got his Oscar winning career role as Dragline. Other men in Luke's barracks are Wayne Rogers, Robert Drivas, and J.D. Cannon and they fill their roles well.Strother Martin as the warden of the place is the guy with the film's favorite line, ""what we've got is failure to communicate."" Martin and his correction officers have many interesting ways of getting their point across.Cool Hand Luke may very well be the saddest role Newman ever undertook in his long career.",hes rebel hell never never be any good,cool hand luke paul newman shows us what underside what life is like as rebel picture james dean doing this part had he lived do films like these newman plays his usual non conformist rebel type but hes really rebel without cause hes his early forties korean war veteran who just hasnt found his place civilian life he gets himself busted no great cause just drunken spree some southern town he decides knock heads off bunch parking meters that lands him stint county jail with lot outdoor work road gang he fights with but later wins respect becomes friends with george kennedy head honcho his barracks real tragedy cool hand luke is that newman is failure life its why hes prison he gains respect his fellow convicts those ways but that involves going against penal system end that gets you nothing can you picture james dean as forty something doing what newman is doing it would have been his kind role sure newman does fine job playing non conformist luke who seems be just going path fate has decreed him george kennedy got his oscar winning career role as dragline other men lukes barracks are wayne rogers robert drivas j d cannon they fill their roles well strother martin as warden place is guy with films favorite line what weve got is failure communicate martin his correction officers have many interesting ways getting their point across cool hand luke may very well be saddest role newman ever undertook his long career,0.4332264957264958,0.18108974358974356,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.46}"
7.0,Unforgettable Paul Newman as a cool prisoner in a Southern chain gang who flees and is recaptured,"Interesting flick about the deprivations and subhuman conditions of a chain gang and a rebel prisoner to whom wardens will attempt to break his free spirit . Based on a real story by Donn Pearce who wrote the novel on which the movie is based , he spent 2 years on a chain gang for safe-breaking ; Pearce makes a cameo appearance in the movie as a convict named Sailor . It deals with Luke (Paul Newman ) who is sent to a prison camp , where he gets a reputation as a hard man . He becomes a prisoner on a Southern chain gang , there the head of the gang hates him , and attempts to break him by beating him up . It doesn't work, and he gains respect and not even the deprivations of these wrong conditions will break his spirit . Irrepressible Luke even manages to win the admiration of his rival (George Kennedy) in the chain gang . Luke is visited by his ill mother (Jo Van Fleet was only 11 years older than Paul Newman , Bette Davis was first offered the role of Luke's mother, but refused the bit part) ; after that , Luke refuses to conform to life in a rural prison and he getaways , but is caught, but escapes again .Modern slant on chain gang sub-genre with one of Paul Newman's greatest interpretations from his prestigious and long career , here as an obstinate , stubborn prisoner . George Kennedy's acting was equally excellent and deservedly won him a supporting Academy Award . Rosenberg's magnificent direction that underlines the strength of personalities involved , undercutting the less pleasant aspects and putting the focus squarely on Newman's tough performance and including the memorably unforgettable egg-eating contest . Top-notch secondary cast who gives splendid performances as Strother Martin , Lou Antonio , Wayne Rogers , J.D. Cannon , Dennis Hooper , Harry Dean Stanton , Morgan Woodward , Joe Don Baker , and Ralph Waite , Anthony Zerbe's film debuts , among others . Good sets and fine scenarios , as a Southern prison camp was built just north of Stockton, California , a dozen buildings were constructed, including a barracks, mess hall, warden's quarters, guard shack, and dog kennels . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Conrad L. Hall . Atmospheric musical score by Lalo Schifrin in his usual style .Stuart Rosenberg was one of the best TV directors of the 50s and 60s and subsequently realized segment of crime and mystery series . In 1967 directed his first film , ¨Mystery Inc¨ , and subsequently the successful ¨Cool Hand Luke¨ with Paul Newman . Rosenberg and Newman attempted in vain to repeat the formula in three further movies together as ¨WUSA movie¨, ¨Pocket money¨ and ¨The drowning pool¨ . However he achieved other two hit smashes , in the terror genre with ¨The Amityville horror¨ and again with a prison film titled ¨Brubaker¨. Since then Rosenberg's output has been unsatisfactory and sporadic as ¨The Pope of Greenwich village ¨ a Mickey Rourke vehicle . Rosenberg directed 5 actors in Oscar nominated performances: Peter Falk, Paul Newman, Lee Grant, Geraldine Page and of course George Kennedy with his top-drawer performance as Dragline . Rating : Above average , wholesome watching . Essential and indispensable seeing for the Paul Newman's fans .",unforgettable paul newman as cool prisoner southern chain gang who flees is recaptured,interesting flick about deprivations subhuman conditions chain gang rebel prisoner whom wardens will attempt break his free spirit based real story by donn pearce who wrote novel which movie is based he spent 2 years chain gang safe breaking pearce makes cameo appearance movie as convict named sailor it deals with luke paul newman who is sent prison camp where he gets reputation as hard man he becomes prisoner southern chain gang there head gang hates him attempts break him by beating him up it doesnt work he gains respect not even deprivations these wrong conditions will break his spirit irrepressible luke even manages win admiration his rival george kennedy chain gang luke is visited by his ill mother jo van fleet was only 11 years older than paul newman bette davis was first offered role lukes mother but refused bit part after that luke refuses conform life rural prison he getaways but is caught but escapes again modern slant chain gang sub genre with one paul newmans greatest interpretations his prestigious long career here as obstinate stubborn prisoner george kennedys acting was equally excellent deservedly won him supporting academy award rosenbergs magnificent direction that underlines strength personalities involved undercutting less pleasant aspects putting focus squarely newmans tough performance including memorably unforgettable egg eating contest top notch secondary cast who gives splendid performances as strother martin lou antonio wayne rogers j d cannon dennis hooper harry dean stanton morgan woodward joe don baker ralph waite anthony zerbes film debuts among others good sets fine scenarios as southern prison camp was built just north stockton california dozen buildings were constructed including barracks mess hall wardens quarters guard shack dog kennels colorful glimmer cinematography by conrad l hall atmospheric musical score by lalo schifrin his usual style stuart rosenberg was one best tv directors 50s 60s subsequently realized segment crime mystery series 1967 directed his first film mystery inc subsequently successful cool hand luke with paul newman rosenberg newman attempted vain repeat formula three further movies together as wusa movie pocket money drowning pool however he achieved other two hit smashes terror genre with amityville horror again with prison film titled brubaker since then rosenbergs output has been unsatisfactory sporadic as pope greenwich village mickey rourke vehicle rosenberg directed 5 actors oscar nominated performances peter falk paul newman lee grant geraldine page course george kennedy with his top drawer performance as dragline rating above average wholesome watching essential indispensable seeing paul newmans fans,0.4756535947712418,0.23436819172113285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,The quintessential Paul Newman movie,"I like Paul Newman, he is very likable while being suitably brooding and intense in his films. To me, as much as I do like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cool Hand Luke is my favourite movie of this great actor. What of Newman himself? Well he is just superb here, very cool and charismatic as well as the skills he is best at. The cinematography is also a delight, the Technicolour is just stunning, and Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a career-best. The dialogue is crisp and memorable, and the story is beautifully constructed. As for any memorable scenes, the prologue and the egg-eating scene are classics, the film succeeds adeptly at being a character study and I for one had no problem with the religious symbolism. Lalo Schifrin's music is very nice too.

The fellow chain gang members are made up of LOTS of very familiar faces--as is like a Who's Who of character actors. Additionally, the stars of the film (George Kennedy and especially Paul Newman) are great--and at the top of their game. Additionally, the writing and especially the dialog are great. But, the writing, while very, very good also left me a bit cold at the end with its vague ending. Additionally, the film is very episodic and seemed a bit disjoint.

8.0,"""Sometimes nothing can be a pretty cool hand.""","'Cool Hand Luke (1967)' was and remains one of Paul Newman's most iconic performances, with the image of Luke Jackson  with his piercing blue eyes, blissfully carefree smile, dogged determination  forever entrenched in the minds of all who see the film. Having experienced a lifetime of difficulty and oppression, Luke is one man who never learned to conform to society, and who is willing to sacrifice himself in order to avoid compromising his own integrity. On many occasions, the motivation behind Luke's actions are dubious at best {his numerous escape attempts appear to have been orchestrated for the mere sake of rebellion}, but this all adds to the lure of his enigmatic personality. Many critics have noted the film's scattered Biblical references, with some proposing that Newman's character is an allusion to Christ, who mentored a group of ""disciples"" before offering his own life in the face of tyranny. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and wonderfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall {whose final film, 'Road to Perdition (2002)' is among the most beautiful of the new century}, the story of ""Cool Hand Luke"" remains one of cinema's most definitive prison dramas.Influencing, in some way or another, just about every prison movie that followed, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to Milos Forman's masterpiece 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),' the film's legacy has continued to stretch into the present, and the Captain's (Strother Martin) memorable line ""What we've got here is failure to communicate"" continues to be quoted often. Of course, it is Cool Hand Luke whom we shall always remember so vividly, his nickname representative of his independence, individualism and unwillingness to conform. Newman's superb performance was nominated for an Academy Award at the 1968 Oscars, but he was beaten by an equally-memorable Rod Steiger for 'In the Heat of the Night (1967).'

8.0,Paul Newman was nominated for an Oscar and George Kennedy received one for his work in this allegorical prison drama.,"Paul Newman was nominated for an Oscar and George Kennedy received one for his work in this allegorical prison drama. Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. While the avowed ambition of the captain (Strother Martin) is for each prisoner to ""get their mind right,"" it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain. Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast, including Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Joe Don Baker as members of the chain gang.",paul newman was nominated oscar george kennedy received one his work this allegorical prison drama,paul newman was nominated oscar george kennedy received one his work this allegorical prison drama luke jackson paul newman is sentenced stretch southern chain gang after hes arrested drunkenly decapitating parking meters while avowed ambition captain strother martin is each prisoner get their mind right it soon becomes obvious that luke is not about kowtow anybody when challenged fistfight by fellow inmate dragline george kennedy luke simply refuses give up even though hes brutally beaten luke knows how win at poker even with bad cards by using his smarts playing it cool luke also figures out way men get their work done half usual time giving them afternoon off finally when luke finds out his mother has died he plots his escape when hes caught he simply escapes again soon luke becomes symbol hope resilience other men prison camp symbol rebelliousness that must be stamped out guards captain along with stellar performances by newman kennedy martin cool hand luke features superb supporting cast including ralph waite harry dean stanton dennis hopper wayne rogers joe don baker as members chain gang,0.4946078431372549,0.06876750700280114,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.6}"
9.0,The Sin of the Angry Believer,"This film is set in America's Deep South in the years after the Second World War. Luke Jackson, a down-on-his-luck war veteran, is arrested for vandalising parking meters while drunk and sentenced to imprisonment in a brutally tough prison. At first his offhand, seemingly arrogant, attitude alienates not only the prison governor and guards but also his fellow-prisoners, and he is soon challenged to a fight by another inmate named Dragline. The tall, powerfully built Dragline is an easy victor, but Luke's determination and fighting spirit, never knowing when he is beaten and refusing to quit, arouse the respect of the others, especially Dragline who becomes his close friend. Luke becomes a hero to the prisoners because they see him as a rebel who refuses to be beaten by the system. (His nickname stems from the cool way in which he plays a hand at poker, but it also refers to his remaining cool in the face of persecution). Luke makes two escape attempts, but on both occasions he is recaptured and brought back to the prison for punishment by the guards who are determined to break his spirit. It seems that they have succeeded, but then Luke and Dragnet make one last break for freedom.On one level this film is a critique of the inhumanity of the American prison system, part of a tradition going back to ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" and continuing more recently with ""Brubaker"" (also directed by Stuart Rosenberg) and the less successful ""The Last Castle"". The regime in this jail is particularly inhuman. The prisoners are put to work all day digging ditches in the hot sun. (It is never made clear whether the ditches need to be dug and the prisoners are a useful source of free labour, or whether putting them to demeaning and useless work is seen as a means of keeping them under control and of giving vent to the sadistic impulses of their jailers). There is a long list of petty regulations, breach of which is punished by ""a night in the box"", a tiny cell used for solitary confinement. The guards take a perverse delight in tormenting and humiliating the prisoners. Strother Martin's governor (who prefers to be called ""the Captain"") is a particularly frightening figure, a little man with a grating, high-pitched voice who can even make a piece of bland management-speak like ""What we have here is a failure to communicate"" sound like a terrifying threat.The film is more, however, than a social-realist exposure of conditions in America's jails. It was made in the sixties, the decade when the times they were a-changing and when traditional concepts of authority were being challenged everywhere. Like a number of films from the sixties and seventies, ""Cool Hand Luke"" reflects this popular mood. The film with which it has most in common is ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in which Jack Nicholson does for mental asylums what Paul Newman does here for prisons. Newman's screen persona was often that of the cool, detached outsider. This may have had the effect of narrowing his range as an actor somewhat- he could often seem too laid back in more traditional types of film, such as Hitchcock's ""Torn Curtain""- but it meant that he could be excellent playing anti-heroes in films of this nature. (""Hombre"" is another example). Here, in one of his best performances, he makes Luke a symbol of the little man standing up against authority. We learn that he was a hero in the war and was decorated a number of times but that he finished the war as a private after being demoted from sergeant. The implication is that military discipline was as uncongenial to him as prison discipline and that he lost his rank for some act of insubordination. Even his crime can be seen as a protest against the petty tyranny of rules and regulations of which parking meters are a symbol.There has been speculation about the possible religious implications of the film and whether Luke is intended to be a Christ-figure. Certainly, the shot in which he is seen in a crucifix-like pose after the egg-eating contest is derived from standard Christian imagery, but in my view this is not a deliberate Christian allegory along the lines of ""Whistle Down the Wind"" or ""The Omega Man"". In orthodox Christian thought, Christ is much more than a rebel against authority or even a man unjustly persecuted; he is also the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind. One scene does not an allegory make. Nevertheless, there are undoubted religious overtones to the film. If Luke is an allegorical figure, the allegory is not with Christ but with Everyman, a man in search (sometimes a despairing search) of God. He claims not to believe in God, yet has long conversations with Him. The song he sings after the death of his mother is irreverent, possibly blasphemous, but blasphemy is the sin of the angry believer, not of the unbeliever. A true atheist cannot blaspheme, because there is nothing for him to blaspheme against.Newman was nominated for ""Best Actor"" and George Kennedy won a well-deserved ""Best Supporting Actor"" for his portrayal of Dragline, but I was surprised that the film was not nominated as ""Best Picture"", especially as the nominations in 1968 included a film as weak as ""Dr Doolittle"". Whatever the Academy may have thought, however, ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a film that has matured well. It is a multi-layered film that works well on each of its several levels of meaning. With ""I am a Fugitive."" and ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"", it is one of the greatest of all prison dramas. This was Stuart Rosenberg's first feature film, but like Orson Welles (""Citizen Kane""), Sidney Lumet (""Twelve Angry Men"") and Bryan Forbes (""Whistle Down the Wind"") he made a great film on his first attempt. 9/10",sin angry believer,this film is set americas deep south years after second world war luke jackson down his luck war veteran is arrested vandalising parking meters while drunk

7.0,Influential 60's prison drama,"Set in the rural south, a man serves time on a chain gang after vandalising parking meters. When inside, he stubbornly refuses to bow down to anybody, be it the prison authorities or his fellow inmates. Soon, though, he becomes a symbol of hope to the other prisoners and his rebellious nature teaches them that their integrity is the most important thing they have.This anti-authoritarian film is very much in a similar mould to Bonnie and Clyde which also came out in 1967. In both of these films the establishment are shown to be the bad guys and the criminals anti-heroes deserving of our sympathy. With this in mind it would only be fair to say that, like Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke could be regarded as one of the very first New Hollywood movies. It certainly is a film which indicates that the cinematic norms were changing. It's also one of the first of a new type of prison drama which tried to reach for more authenticity. In many ways it is a precursor to the classic incarcerated-man-against-the-system movie One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). For me, it's not in the same league as that one but it's pretty obviously a very influential work. It benefits from a good ensemble cast, with Paul Newman leading the picture very well, with impressive support in particular from George Kennedy who would go on to win an Oscar for his efforts.",influential 60s prison drama,set rural south man serves time chain gang after vandalising parking meters when inside he stubbornly refuses bow down anybody be it prison authorities or his fellow inmates soon though he becomes symbol hope other prisoners his rebellious nature teaches them that their integrity is most important thing they have this anti authoritarian film is very much similar mould bonnie clyde which also came out 1967 both these films establishment are shown be bad guys criminals anti heroes deserving our sympathy with this mind it would only be fair say that like bonnie clyde cool hand luke could be regarded as one very first new hollywood movies it certainly is film which indicates that cinematic norms were changing its also one first new type prison drama which tried reach more authenticity many ways it is precursor classic incarcerated man against system movie one flew over cuckoos nest 1975 me its not same league as that one but its pretty obviously very influential work it benefits good ensemble cast with paul newman leading picture very well with impressive support particular george kennedy who would go win oscar his efforts,0.5090264893836324,0.2540996701710988,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,Some men you just can't reach.,"Cool Hand Luke is perhaps Paul Newman's most memorable character. He was outstanding as Hud, but he seems to have topped that performance in this 1967 classic.Newman plays a man named Luke. After cutting the heads off some parking meters, he is thrown into a prison system where he's forced to do some hard time tending to country roads. This character has to be one of the biggest enigmas in film history. Luke is likable enough. His mother points out to him that he's even had some good jobs. The viewer is left to ponder why in the heck he can't stay out of trouble.Not much is told about his past. We know he fought WWII, and even won some medals. He has no wife or children to care for. He has a mother who appears to be dying of lung cancer or some such ailment. His other family members seem to hold a grudge against him. We never really learn why he feels the need to cut the heads off the parking meters, but he's caught red-handed. The prison he's sent to makes its inmates work their tails off, but it looks like they'll treat you fairly if you follow their rules. Luke has no intentions of following any rules laid down by the warden or the ""bosses"" that watch over the road work, though.After taking a tremendous beating from the toughest inmate (Kennedy), Luke quickly begins to win the admiration of his fellow prisoners. His spirit catches on with the others, and they begin to get their work done more quickly and effectively than ever before. Things begin to go downhill for Luke once he learns of his mother's passing. He repeatedly tries to escape, and soon the warden and his cronies are out to break his spirit and make him conform. The film becomes a test of wills, and a fascinating character study.The biggest question the viewer is left with is ""why?"". Luke could have simply served out his time and then gone on to a more normal existence. That seems to be out of the realm of possibilities for the character, however. He isn't simply out to impress the other prisoners. At one point he even demands they stop trying to feed off of him for all their strength. Luke seems like a man who simply cannot allow others to tell him how to live. There are a few moments where he openly questions the existence of God, but that angle doesn't go very far. It merely makes the guards want to abuse him even more, but that's about it. It becomes almost frustrating to see this man keep digging a bigger and bigger hole for himself. At one point Luke is forced to literally do just that.What exactly is the film trying to tell us? It doesn't seem to be advocating disobedience. We cheer for Luke when he's causing trouble for the guards, but we feel his pain when they punish him. The film's conclusion is more somber than inspiring.Rosenberg's direction is outstanding, and the supporting cast shines. George Kennedy earned an Oscar for his performance. Overall this is an excellent film not to be missed! 10 of 10 stars from The Hound.",some men you just cant reach,cool hand luke is perhaps paul newmans most memorable character he was outstanding as hud but he seems have topped that performance this 1967 classic newman plays man named luke after cutting heads off some parking meters he is thrown into prison system where hes forced do some hard time tending country roads this character has be one biggest enigmas film history luke is likable enough his mother points out him that hes even had some good jobs viewer is left ponder why heck he cant stay out trouble not much is told about his past we know he fought wwii even won some medals he has no wife or children care he has mother who appears be dying lung cancer or some such ailment his other family members seem hold grudge against him we never really learn why he feels need cut heads off parking meters but hes caught red handed prison hes sent makes its inmates work their tails off but it looks like theyll treat you fairly if you follow their rules luke has no intentions following any rules laid down by warden or bosses that watch over road work though after taking tremendous beating toughest inmate kennedy luke quickly begins win admiration his fellow prisoners his spirit catches with others they begin get their work done more quickly effectively than ever before things begin go downhill luke once he learns his mothers passing he repeatedly tries escape soon warden his cronies are out break his spirit make him conform film becomes test wills fascinating character study biggest question viewer is left with is why luke could have simply served out his time then gone more normal existence that seems be out realm possibilities character however he isnt simply out impress other prisoners at one point he even demands they stop trying feed off him all their strength luke seems like man who simply cannot allow others tell him how live there are few moments where he openly questions existence god but that angle doesnt go very far it merely makes guards want abuse him even more but thats about it it becomes almost frustrating see this man keep digging bigger bigger hole himself at one point luke is forced literally do just that what exactly is film trying tell us it doesnt seem be advocating disobedience we cheer luke when hes causing trouble guards but we feel his pain when they punish him films conclusion is more somber than inspiring rosenbergs direction is outstanding supporting cast shines george kennedy earned oscar his performance overall this is excellent film not be missed 10 10 stars hound,0.4771972369194592,0.1417124953236064,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Prison,"Forty years ago. When I first saw this, I was completely captured by it. I was a simple soul who believed in simple situations. It was a bad time, a time of evil politicians and a bad war. This resonated, as a strong soul, casually defiant. It mattered in an affirmative way, to the emerging counterculture (what we thought was such, anyway).Twenty years ago, I saw it again and was struck by the genre nature of it. The 30's was the previous era where the powerful establishment was distrusted and people suffered as a result. In that time prison movies formed a strong genre that has all but disappeared now. But the then it was a subgenre to have an innocent, good man, often a war hero, sent to prison to suffer at the hands of the man. By simple dint of Biblical-quality goodness, he wins in some way. The viewers silently celebrate, and then left the theater to fight their own fights with the system.It struck me how similar this was to that template, and how similar the reasons. The only difference was that in the 30s the audience would be swept toward socialist ideals and in the sixties the war was against some disembodied notion of domino communism. And the genre had to be hidden by setting it in the south, then as now evoking a backward people.But I just saw it again. Since the last time I have heard Paul Newman speak of it. He is annoyed because he can see himself obviously acting. His character works when the character is acting a role  and we see him do it. Its an unintentional fold, the sort of acting that Paul could pull off in later years, starting with ""The Verdict."" But because the job is bigger than his chops at the time, you can see how poorly he does when his character isn't creating a self: when he comes back to the barracks beaten. When he speaks to God. Even when he says that famous last line. He is inadequate, and the idea that a lessor self could be so attractive kept him drunk for decades.Its really not a very good movie: a collection of templates put together at the right time and striking a nerve.A pretty remarkable phenomenon. Now, I wonder, where is the modern equivalent of this film, one that seems to be about charm, but which depends on dishonest politicians who destroy us? Will it be a jail movie, or does that reference not carry the same weight today?As I write this, Paul is ill.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",prison,forty years ago when i first saw this i was completely captured by it i was simple soul who believed simple situations it was bad time time evil politicians bad war this resonated as strong soul casually defiant it mattered affirmative way emerging counterculture what we thought was such anyway twenty years ago i saw it again was struck by genre nature it 30s was previous era where powerful establishment was distrusted people suffered as result that time prison movies formed strong genre that has all but disappeared now but then it was subgenre have innocent good man often war hero sent prison suffer at hands man by simple dint biblical quality goodness he wins some way viewers silently celebrate then left theater fight their own fights with system it struck me how similar this was that template how similar reasons only difference was that 30s audience would be swept toward socialist ideals sixties war was against some disembodied notion domino communism genre had be hidden by setting it south then as now evoking backward people but i just saw it again since last time i have heard paul newman speak it he is annoyed because he can see himself obviously acting his character works when character is acting role we see him do it its unintentional fold sort acting that paul could pull off later years starting with verdict but because job is bigger than his chops at time you can see how poorly he does when his character isnt creating self when he comes back barracks beaten when he speaks god even when he says that famous last line he is inadequate idea that lessor self could be so attractive kept him drunk decades its really not very good movie collection templates put together at right time striking nerve pretty remarkable phenomenon now i wonder where is modern equivalent this film one that seems be about charm but which depends dishonest politicians who destroy us will it be jail movie or does that reference not carry same weight today as i write this paul is ill teds evaluation 2 3 has some interesting elements,0.49795051353874886,0.03753034547152194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,A classic that became a big part of my life,"I first saw ""Cool Hand Luke"" the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. ""Luke"" is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is nothing less than a working man's parable of a truly good soul who just couldn't seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn't let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn't knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I've clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall's cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. ""Dragline"". The most unforgettable ""gentle giant"" I believe I've ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman's masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in ""Cool Hand Luke"" and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can't speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, ""Cool Hand Luke"" was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn't worth his getting worked up over. Wasn't gonna get to his spirit.",classic that became big part my life,i first saw cool hand luke first week it came out went see it with my father at theater upper east side manhattan we were just few blocks away hospital where my mom was dying cancer we just needed break it was cathartic feeling as beat up left dead as i was at time i came across character who knew how take punches luke is beautifully crafted film not one wasted frame or moment donn pearce frank piersons screenplay is nothing less than working mans parable truly good soul who just couldnt seem get break ways it could be said he truly didnt let himself but strength within luke that would not let him compromise who he was who he was told be resilience fight back against those who tried fight him that was inspirational whether it was carefully chosen remark or just one them luke looks they knew they couldnt knock him out no matter how badly they knocked him down seems he handled life like that it was example ive clung have tried follow almost fifty subsequent years conrad halls cinematography was breathtaking providing scope all integral parts story with immediacy all most intimate moments any single frame could hang your living room wall as centerpiece cast dennis hopper strother martin lou antonio ralph waite george kennedy academy award winner george kennedy dragline most unforgettable gentle giant i believe ive ever seen silver screen each every one them all their glory simplest nuances helped raise paul newmans masterful portrayal ever higher level maybe his best work ever character is very much story cool hand luke ensemble brings it life frustrating challenging confusing pain ass life with just enough that rebellious spirit bring hope those facing some their tougher times i saw film four more times that first year probably twice each year since whenever i could find it check with luke boys breath fresh air some world shaking hope cant speak anyone else but luke is right up there with atticus finch me when it comes celluloid heroes these are two whose stories got me through some really really bleak times me cool hand luke was ultimately story hope story man who never gave never gave up never stopped grinning all that they piled him all they tried bury him under just wasnt worth his getting worked up over wasnt gonna get his spirit,0.5113383838383838,0.18451659451659452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
6.0,He fought the law...,"Highly rated film that I don't rate that highly, if truth be told. There's plenty to savour, particularly in the acting stakes but I was ultimately confused and disappointed by the resolution to the various themes at play here.The enigmatic opening, with Newman's Luke character casually vandalising the state's parking meters amusingly recalled to me the famous tag-line from Bob Dylan's near contemporaneous song ""Subterraneaen Homesick Blues"" - ""Don't follow leaders and watch the parking meters"", (both parts of the line are relevant - at one point he screams ""Stop feeding off me"" to his ""follower"" inmates) as Luke gets incarcerated in a brutally-run Southern prison work-house and becomes the unlikely and from his point of view, at times unwelcome talismanic figure representing to his fellow inmates a focal point of resistance to authority and in a wider sense, general conformity.And yet this self-effacing persona which Luke adopts more than once however doesn't square, with me, to the self-publicising acts he does elsewhere, most famously the fight scene with the prison's ""Big Daddy"" inmate, Dragline, played by Arthur Kennedy and of course the egg-scoffing scene, where he deliberately draws attention to himself. I also didn't get Kennedy's character's change (adapting Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"") from George to Lennie, when after punching Luke to a pulp and establishing one would think once and for all superiority over him, we see him by the end almost acting as his lackey. Add to that an admittedly revisionist minor revulsion at the blatantly sexist soft-porn episode of the tongues-out chain gang ogling a scantily-clad nymphet foaming up a car and you can tell I had some issues with the movie, although a minor counter-case against the latter could be made for the insertion of the very mild homo-erotic and played for laughs sub ""Jailhouse Rock"" scene of the prisoners dancing with each other, dressed only in their shorts, on the 4th of July.The ambiguities in the narrative however threw me off-kilter and while I can see that I was expected to cut Newman's character a lot of slack as a societal misfit whose ""different-ness"" is accentuated further after his beloved mother dies, ultimately, again to paraphrase Dylan, nothing has been proved. As to style, director Rosenberg certainly captures the heat and sweat of the workhouse but even then a lot of his imagery seems second-hand, lifting from the likes of Leone and Sturges. Lalo Schifrin delivers a satisfactory if occasionally blaring soundtrack.The acting is great though, yet I'm sure I can see Steve McQueen playing the Newman role better. Arthur Kennedy is robust enough until he's reduced to a simpering wimp by the conclusion. Strother Martin, with that enervating southern drawl gets most of the best lines (especially the well-known ""What we have here is a failure to communicate"") and his underlings similarly exude cruelty and inhumanity, especially when breaking Luke over the pointless digging of a ditch. Amongst the inmates, by the way, it's interesting to note emerging actors of the television screen like Wayne Rogers (""M.A.S.H.""), Ralph Waite (""The Waltons"", ""Mississipi"") and Anthony Zerbe (everything else...) plus the young (Harry) Dean Stanton and Dennis Hopper.Grandstanding scenes notwithstanding, by the conclusion, the film hadn't held me as it should have done and further weakened its case as an expose of the working methods of jail-masters of the recent past with a sentimental collage of Newman's smiling image set before us with all the integrity of an episode of the afore-mentioned ""The Waltons"".",he fought law,highly rated film that i dont rate that highly if truth be told theres plenty savour particularly acting stakes but i was ultimately confused disappointed by resolution various themes at play here enigmatic opening with newmans luke character casually vandalising states parking meters amusingly recalled me famous tag line bob dylans near contemporaneous song subterraneaen homesick blues dont follow leaders watch parking meters both parts line are relevant at one point he screams stop feeding off me his follower inmates as luke gets incarcerated brutally run southern prison work house becomes unlikely his point view at times unwelcome talismanic figure representing his fellow inmates focal point resistance authority wider sense general conformity yet this self effacing persona which luke adopts more than once however doesnt square with me self publicising acts he does elsewhere most famously fight scene with prisons big daddy inmate dragline played by arthur kennedy course egg scoffing scene where he deliberately draws attention himself i also didnt get kennedys characters change adapting steinbecks mice men george lennie when after punching luke pulp establishing one would think once all superiority over him we see him by end almost acting as his lackey add that admittedly revisionist minor revulsion at blatantly sexist soft porn episode tongues out chain gang ogling scantily clad nymphet foaming up car you can tell i had some issues with movie although minor counter case against latter could be made insertion very mild homo erotic played laughs sub jailhouse rock scene prisoners dancing with each other dressed only their shorts 4th july ambiguities narrative however threw me off kilter while i can see that i was expected cut newmans character lot slack as societal misfit whose different ness is accentuated further after his beloved mother dies ultimately again paraphrase dylan nothing has been proved as style director rosenberg certainly captures heat sweat workhouse but even then lot his imagery seems second hand lifting likes leone sturges lalo schifrin delivers satisfactory if occasionally blaring soundtrack acting is great though yet im sure i can see steve mcqueen playing newman role better arthur kennedy is robust enough until hes reduced simpering wimp by conclusion strother martin with that enervating southern drawl gets most best lines especially well known what we have here is failure communicate his underlings similarly exude cruelty inhumanity especially when breaking luke over pointless digging ditch amongst inmates by way its interesting note emerging actors television screen like wayne rogers m s h ralph waite waltons mississipi anthony zerbe everything else plus young harry dean stanton dennis hopper grandstanding scenes notwithstanding by conclusion film hadnt held me as it should have done further weakened its case as expose working methods jail masters recent past with sentimental collage newmans smiling image set before us with all integrity episode afore mentioned waltons,0.5139135194307608,0.07932676518883414,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,"Wow, George Kennedy?","Okay, I had written an enormous blurb about how great the ending of this film was and how the ending is a film's most important part, but I think we all understand that well enough. I am going to talk about something else:George Kennedy's Oscar winning role. Wow, is he awesome! I, like I assume many people of my generation are, am only familiar with Kennedy through his role as the police Captain Ed from the Naked Gun series, in which he was hilarious, and his stint selling breath mints on infomercials. I never expected that he ever won an Oscar! And it was entirely deserved. He created a very complex character in this film. Bravo!I loved Paul Newman, too, of course. I just looked at who else was nominated that year, and I have not seen either the winner of that year's best actor Oscar (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night) or one other nominee (Spencer Tracy in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner), but of those I have seen (Warren Beatty, Bonnie and Clyde and Dustin Hoffman, The Graduate) I would personally have picked Warren Beatty, seeing as Bonnie and Clyde is one of my very favorite films, and I love Beatty in it. Anyway, Cool Hand Luke was a masterpiece itself, and I do give it a 10/10",wow george kennedy,okay i had written enormous blurb about how great ending this film was how ending is films most important part but i think we all understand that well enough i am going talk about something else george kennedys oscar winning role wow is he awesome i like i assume many people my generation are am only familiar with kennedy through his role as police captain ed naked gun series which he was hilarious his stint selling breath mints infomercials i never expected that he ever won oscar it was entirely deserved he created very complex character this film bravo i loved paul newman too course i just looked at who else was nominated that year i have not seen either winner that years best actor oscar rod steiger heat night or one other nominee spencer tracy guess whos coming dinner but those i have seen warren beatty bonnie clyde dustin hoffman graduate i would personally have picked warren beatty seeing as bonnie clyde is one my very favorite films i love beatty it anyway cool hand luke was masterpiece itself i do give it 10 10,0.6748000000000001,0.3204000000000001,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.27}"
5.0,Life on a chain gang in rural Florida in the early 50s,"Released in 1967 and directed by Stuart Rosenberg based on Donn Pearce' novel, ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a prison drama starring Paul Newman in the eponymous role as a loner who disdains rules in the early 50s. He is sentenced to two years on a prison farm in Florida run by a stern warden, the Captain (Strother Martin), and guarded by a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward). Carr (Clifton James) the floorwalker, tells the rules to the new prisoners with violations resulting in spending the night in ""the box,"" a small square room with limited air and little room to move. George Kennedy and Dennis Hopper are on hand as fellow prisoners, amongst many others.I was wondering about the totally stoo-pid reason Luke gets 2 years in prison at the beginning of the film. He likely got a ticket for a ""violated"" parking meter while in town. So he has a few beers, gets his mitts on a big pipe cutter, and thought, ""I'm gonna show these jerks.""""Cool Hand Luke"" has a big reputation but, for me, it doesn't quite live up to it. The highlight is the iconic car wash sequence with Joy Harmon, as well as the ending when Luke talks with God about why He made him such a misfit. The rest is a decent prison drama about an eccentric individualist who inspires those around him stuck in the same pen. It's a character study of a likable, impressive, but unruly person who doesn't seem to grasp that getting sloshed and destroying public property has negative repercussions. Gee, maybe you shouldn't try to solve your problems by getting drunk and vandalizing. The movie is realistic and well-made, but generally tedious, although I'm sure that's the point – being confined on a prison farm WOULD be tedious. The Christ typology is interesting, however; and I can understand how some grade it higher. The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot Tavares & Jacksonville, Florida; and San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, California, with studio work done in Burbank.

9.0,a classic anti-hero and a near-great Hollywood prison movie of the 1960s,"I read another comment on here that said that this and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are two films which are pretty much identical. While I was watching Cool Hand Luke I did recollect the other classic (to me still much more extraordinary) guys-locked-up movie Cuckoo's Nest, as it did have its hero knocking an authority as tough as a ton on bricks. But there's a big difference between the two films- in Cuckoo's Nest, you had in Nicholson a rebel-rouser who didn't mind getting some real words across to people with his plight, and the people he was locked up with are actually, to a basic degree, sane. Newman is, much as the title suggests, 'cool', as he really doesn't have that much dialog for most of the picture, and the system he's bucking isn't supposed to be ""helping"" him and the people he's with. They're there on the chain gang to bust ass and do the work that nobody in their right mind would do unless pointed by a gun to do so. Though on the other hand, this dynamic from Newman, amid a very good prison movie, still makes Cool Hand Luke quite memorable for its ways of bucking the system.It's also by turns an often funny movie, with the centerpiece of the 50 egg bet being one that is just sheerly, unabashedly entertaining. And it's the kind of scene that does almost remind someone of that scene in Cuckoo's Nest where they all get riled up during the 'baseball game' on TV. But sometimes the filmmakers doing Cool Hand Luke do perhaps push a wee bit much allegory on such a simple set of events, less a story, than necessary. At the end of the 50 egg sequence, Newman is basically laid out on the table- and I'm sure it's meant to be intentional- in the form of Christ. This is played up for a lot of the rest of the film, as it's perhaps really intuited that he's suffering for the other prisoner's sins, and may even perhaps someday die for it all. This side ends up becoming a little preachy, even if its meant to be subtle, which I don't think it is, and it detracts from the greater pleasures of watching a picture like this.Because really, aside from the allegory, this is just good old prison picture, and one that pushes the boundaries of the prisoner-escape angle, such as that Newman's Luke escapes for the whole second half of the movie! It's also kind of bittersweet that the filmmakers decide not to show how Newman gets captured, but leaves it at first on the prisoners- who after getting beaten up by Oscar winning George Kennedy's rily character, and getting them to fix a road like its some competition- and then just suddenly he's caught again. At one point this even leads to the now classic line, once sampled in a Guns n Roses song, ""what we've got here is failure to communicate"" by the always great character actor Strother Martin. Though if you're not really looking for message or allegory, it's also just a really neat 'guy' movie, in the best sense of the word, with scenes like the torturous girl-washes-car-in-front-of-chain-gang scene, and of course ones that just show them acting like real guys. It's populated by a plethora of acting talent, with Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, Luke Askew, and even a guitar strumming/singing Harry Dean Stanton! (Which is a hoot if you've seen as mant Stanton films as me).And then finally there's Newman himself, definitely in one of his seminal roles even if it's not a full-on total masterwork. Here he actually does create a character out of someone who is really sort of a nobody with no real aims. He doesn't even know what do to when he breaks out of prison, even as he gets as far as Chicago. ""I never planned anything in my life"", he says at one point. That the character only has maybe 15 lines in the film isn't a problem for Newman either. He makes such a thin character, ultimately, likable and strong, and fulfills such an anti-hero very believably, especially when he's most needed to put up his acting chops towards the end of the picture. Even if you're not too much into prison movies- and this one does have in it the kind of spirit that speaks back to the films of the 30s (in a good way for the old-school fans)- it's worth it just to see what Newman does, alongside the other actors. It also holds up pretty well decades later, which is a credit not just to Newman but to the screenwriters and director Stuart Rosenberg, probably the highlight of an otherwise journeyman filmmaker career.",classic anti hero near great hollywood prison movie 1960s,i read another comment here that said that this one flew over cuckoos nest are two films which are pretty much identical while i was watching cool hand luke i did recollect other classic me still much more extraordinary guys locked up movie cuckoos nest as it did have its hero knocking authority as tough as ton bricks but theres big difference between two films cuckoos nest you had nicholson rebel rouser who didnt mind getting some real words across people with his plight people he was locked up with are actually basic degree sane newman is much as title suggests cool as he really doesnt have that much dialog most picture system hes bucking isnt supposed be helping him people hes with theyre there chain gang bust ass do work that nobody their right mind would do unless pointed by gun do so though other hand this dynamic newman amid very good prison movie still makes cool hand luke quite memorable its ways bucking system its also by turns often funny movie with centerpiece 50 egg bet being one that is just sheerly unabashedly entertaining its kind scene that does almost remind someone that scene cuckoos nest where they all get riled up during baseball game tv but sometimes filmmakers doing cool hand luke do perhaps push wee bit much allegory such simple set events less story than necessary at end 50 egg sequence newman is basically laid out table im sure its meant be intentional form christ this is played up lot rest film as its perhaps really intuited that hes suffering other prisoners sins may even perhaps someday die it all this side ends up becoming little preachy even if its meant be subtle which i dont think it is it detracts greater pleasures watching picture like this because really aside allegory this is just good old prison picture one that pushes boundaries prisoner escape angle such as that newmans luke escapes whole second half movie its also kind bittersweet that filmmakers decide not show how newman gets captured but leaves it at first prisoners who after getting beaten up by oscar winning george kennedys rily character getting them fix road like its some competition then just suddenly hes caught again at one point this even leads now classic line once sampled guns n roses song what weve got here is failure communicate by always great character actor strother martin though if youre not really looking message or allegory its also just really neat guy movie best sense word with scenes like torturous girl washes car front chain gang scene course ones that just show them acting like real guys its populated by plethora acting talent with kennedy dennis hopper luke askew even guitar strumming singing harry dean stanton which is hoot if youve seen as mant stanton films as me then finally theres newman himself definitely one his seminal roles even if its not full total masterwork here he actually does create character out someone who is really sort nobody with no real aims he doesnt even know what do when he breaks out prison even as he gets as far as chicago i never planned anything my life he says at one point that character only has maybe 15 lines film isnt problem newman either he makes such thin character ultimately likable strong fulfills such anti hero very believably especially when hes most needed put up his acting chops towards end picture even if youre not too much into prison movies this one does have it kind spirit that speaks back films 30s good way old school fans its worth it just see what newman does alongside other actors it also holds up pretty well decades later which is credit not just newman but screenwriters director stuart rosenberg probably highlight otherwise journeyman filmmaker career,0.4723818245246818,0.16898526077097498,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
