8,A Substantial Movie with All the Right Elements,"This movie was well made with nice melodious songs. What I really like about this movie was that it showed how fathers are important as well. Most movies always talk about mother as the motivation and somehow portray the dad as military style attitude or just thrown in for show but this movie was all about a dad's motivation, a dad who was living and compassionate. As for the actors: They really created magic with this movie. Surya was amazing. He really dug into the characters' role equally. His expressions and flawless Hindi and Tamil made this movie very enjoyable as well as his dual role. His attitude kept changing so it held the audience's eyes. Sameera Reddy was also wonderful. Despite the limited screen time, she really made a strong impact. Simran was also great. It has been a long time since I have seen her and her presence made the movie pleasant. Divya Spandana was not bad at all. I felt that she was thrown in but there needed to be something to make the movie going. The songs were very nice and melodious. Although it was not very fast paced, the creative sounds made it worthwhile. Only negative thought: I really wished that there were subtitles so that we could understand what Hindi words were spoken. Overall, this movie had a little bit of everything: love, violence, adventure, music and it is a definite must watch.",substantial movie with all right elements,this movie was well made with nice melodious songs what i really like about this movie was that it showed how fathers are important as well most movies always talk about mother as motivation somehow portray dad as military style attitude or just thrown show but this movie was all about dads motivation dad who was living compassionate as actors they really created magic with this movie surya was amazing he really dug into characters role equally his expressions flawless hindi tamil made this movie very enjoyable as well as his dual role his attitude kept changing so it held audiences eyes sameera reddy was also wonderful despite limited screen time she really made strong impact simran was also great it has been long time since i have seen her her presence made movie pleasant divya spandana was not bad at all i felt that she was thrown but there needed be something make movie going songs were very nice melodious although it was not very fast paced creative sounds made it worthwhile only negative thought i really wished that there were subtitles so that we could understand what hindi words were spoken overall this movie had little bit everything love violence adventure music it is definite must watch,0.5839617673992673,0.32332904075091573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.19}"

9,"Close to reality, close to heart","Gautham's Vaaaranam Aayiram may not be a masterpiece in overall, but the very fact the film dishes out few of the most momentous scenes i have ever seen in cinema justifies this rating. The film may appear slow for some, especially those who are yet to experience the lost of a loved one, or those who are yet to fall in love. Vaaranam Aayiram is about the strength of love and memories, how important they are in your life, even if your loved ones depart. The film is in no way a remake of Forest Gump and was not even for a moment intended to be so. It is rather inspired by Gautham's real life events and observations. Some of the scenes in VA are truly momentous, send a chill down the spine for any romantics. I can't remember San Francisco being shown to be so beautiful in Hollywood movies even, especially when Meghna (Sameera Reddy) confesses her feelings for Surya (Junior Surya) at the backdrop of the bridge while he is playing with a toy helicopter. Masterstroke. The scene where Surya calls his parents and cries uncontrollably about Meghna's death is certainly one of the most moving scenes ever in Tamil cinema, i can almost feel the same pain that the character feels at that time. Gautham directs the movie superbly in parts and complacently in parts, but Surya is the order of the day, as his performance as both father and son keeps the movie going, even in the parts where Gautham obviously could have done better. As a doting grandfather unable to tell stories to his grandchild, as a cancer patient meeting his end days, as a young man who is head over heels in love, as a naughty college student, as a lover struggling to get over his lover's death, a young man who's life taken over by drugs, as a man searching for himself in the mountains, as the re-discovered man who saves an abducted child, as a major, and as a son who struggles to see his daddy's sufferings, Surya is a class act in this movie. Simran too is fantastic, and this might well be her comeback card. Sameera Reddy leaves an impact in your heart that she remains etched even after the character is killed, and even makes you long for her presence. Divya Spandana does a decent job, but doesn't overshadow the impact of Sameera's character, she basically underplays her character. This is something for the personal collection.",close reality close heart,gauthams vaaaranam aayiram may not be masterpiece overall but very fact film dishes out few most momentous scenes i have ever seen cinema justifies this rating film may appear slow some especially those who are yet experience lost loved one or those who are yet fall love vaaranam aayiram is about strength love memories how important they are your life even if your loved ones depart film is no way remake forest gump was not even moment intended be so it is rather inspired by gauthams real life events observations some scenes va are truly momentous send chill down spine any romantics i cant remember san francisco being shown be so beautiful hollywood movies even especially when meghna sameera reddy confesses her feelings surya junior surya at backdrop bridge while he is playing with toy helicopter masterstroke scene where surya calls his parents cries uncontrollably about meghnas death is certainly one most moving scenes ever tamil cinema i can almost feel same pain that character feels at that time gautham directs movie superbly parts complacently parts but surya is order day as his performance as both father son keeps movie going even parts where gautham obviously could have done better as doting grandfather unable tell stories his grandchild as cancer patient meeting his end days as young man who is head over heels love as naughty college student as lover struggling get over his lovers death young man whos life taken over by drugs as man searching himself mountains as re discovered man who saves abducted child as major as son who struggles see his daddys sufferings surya is class act this movie simran too is fantastic this might well be her comeback card sameera reddy leaves impact your heart that she remains etched even after character is killed even makes you long her presence divya spandana does decent job but doesnt overshadow impact sameeras character she basically underplays her character this is something personal collection,0.5453745039682539,0.2043092757936508,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10,Good movie for Surya,"Now all the movies in Tamil is fully action oriented film and all of the actors are stuck with that one, this movie is for the persons who are tired watching those films. This is a visual treat for audience gave by Surya and Sameera Reddy. It is very sad to see Sameera Reddy dying at a blast and Surya's song after retuning to Chennai is mixture of both folk and western which is an audio and visual treat. Harris Jeyaraj has given his best in music, it is the tougher job for both cameraman and director to give the visuals as best as possible. But they did it very correctly. Especially 'Adiye Kolluthey' is getting a new and fresh look on San Francisco, no one showed both the city and Surya and sameera reddy as beautiful this. Hats off for Cinematographer Rathnavelu 'Ava Enna' song proves that Surya can dance good when he gets a good choreographer, and finally 'Nenjukkul' song is a pure visual treat. The story is more sentimental in most of the situations, I think no one can do the role better than Surya in this movie, but Divya can be given more chance to act, her presence made to less by the beauty and importance of role given to Sameera Reddy. The father and son relationship can be showed more deeply than this, because it has chosen a plot of romantic sentiment film. On the whole term this movie is best to watch Surya for his performance and Sammera Reddy for her beauty.",good movie surya,now all movies tamil is fully action oriented film all actors are stuck with that one this movie is persons who are tired watching those films this is visual treat audience gave by surya sameera reddy it is very sad see sameera reddy dying at blast suryas song after retuning chennai is mixture both folk western which is audio visual treat harris jeyaraj has given his best music it is tougher job both cameraman director give visuals as best as possible but they did it very correctly especially adiye kolluthey is getting new fresh look san francisco no one showed both city surya sameera reddy as beautiful this hats off cinematographer rathnavelu ava enna song proves that surya can dance good when he gets good choreographer finally nenjukkul song is pure visual treat story is more sentimental most situations i think no one can do role better than surya this movie but divya can be given more chance act her presence made less by beauty importance role given sameera reddy father son relationship can be showed more deeply than this because it has chosen plot romantic sentiment film whole term this movie is best watch surya his performance sammera reddy her beauty,0.4725378787878788,0.2635619588744589,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,Gowtham Menon & Surya go to the next level !,"What a film ! Went to see this flick today morning at 8:30 @ Abirami - Chennai and was drawn in to it from the first scene ! What a film !! WOW! Gowtham Vasudev Menon had certainly gone to the next level. Every shot, every scene is like a wonderfully carved out statue or a beautifully written poem. This is how the incidents will unfold in a normal family. There is absolutely NO exaggeration whatsoever and it has a lot for the ordinary masala genre (Vijay, Ajith, perarasu, Hari sort of guys) to learn. Guys - this is the new age Tamil film, for the international world.The direction is flawless. The screenplay is clever. The dialogs are natural and short. For the first time, I noticed (rather, heard) Harris Jeyaraj doing a commendable job at the background score. Usually, he tends to be jarring, but here, he has subtly underplayed. Especially, the 'anal mele' whistle which comes mostly during the last 45 minutes or something. Well done Harris! Simran - has given a good performance. Samira reddy - Surprise ! She acts well! All credit goes to Gowtham menon. Divya Spandana too, has rendered a nice performance. Well, guys - U've guessed it rite. Whatever I point out in this movie tend to be great! Surya ! Dude - you've certainly matured to be a fantastic actor. I don't like to compare Surya with Kamal or anyone, but he is spontaneous. Be it the school kid, or the middle aged father, or the young son, or the drunkard, or the military officer or the old ailing father - he is juz marvelous! I was amazed when he came out as a school kid in this movie. Well, how many guyz can do it, that too, he and Vijay are of the same age! Imagine any other actor doing the school boy role . . . People would've smacked him ! I'm giving ten out of ten for this great film - both hands raised! I'm gonna see it again shortly :) . . To summarize, this is one of the great films I have seen this year! Hats off to Gowtham Menon for making Vaaranam Aayiram - his best so far (according to me)!",gowtham menon surya go next level,what film went see this flick today morning at 8 30 abirami chennai was drawn it first scene what film wow gowtham vasudev menon had certainly gone next level every shot every scene is like wonderfully carved out statue or beautifully written poem this is how incidents will unfold normal family there is absolutely no exaggeration whatsoever it has lot ordinary masala genre vijay ajith perarasu hari sort guys learn guys this is new age tamil film international world direction is flawless screenplay is clever dialogs are natural short first time i noticed rather heard harris jeyaraj doing commendable job at background score usually he tends be jarring but here he has subtly underplayed especially anal mele whistle which comes mostly during last 45 minutes or something well done harris simran has given good performance samira reddy surprise she acts well all credit goes gowtham menon divya spandana too has rendered nice performance well guys uve guessed it rite whatever i point out this movie tend be great surya dude youve certainly matured be fantastic actor i dont like compare surya with kamal or anyone but he is spontaneous be it school kid or middle aged father or young son or drunkard or military officer or old ailing father he is juz marvelous i was amazed when he came out as school kid this movie well how many guyz can do it that too he vijay are same age imagine any other actor doing school boy role people wouldve smacked him im giving ten out ten this great film both hands raised im gonna see it again shortly summarize this is one great films i have seen this year hats off gowtham menon making vaaranam aayiram his best so far according me,0.5116833923652105,0.2539379181424636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9,Eternity and Divinity,"""Whatever happens life has to go on"" an important phrase in the film Vaaram Aayiram written and directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon. The film is about a Father- Son relationship where Suriya (the protagonist) organize all his memories at the moment when he is on a mission (an army mission) while he heard about the demise of his father. Suriya went back through the times which he had spent with his father. It also welcomes you into the world of love; the eternity and divinity of that wonderful feeling.",eternity divinity,whatever happens life has go important phrase film vaaram aayiram written directed by gautham vasudev menon film is about father son relationship where suriya protagonist organize all his memories at moment when he is mission army mission while he heard about demise his father suriya went back through times which he had spent with his father it also welcomes you into world love eternity divinity that wonderful feeling,0.54,0.36,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.64}"
9,A Touching and Inspiring Film,"From the first scene to the very last bit, everything was well crafted in excellence. The real magic in this movie is definitely Surya's acting. At first I was wondering why is he casted again as a double role acting, he has done that several times like the one in Vel. However, I was amazed at his abilities in creating distinctive traits to each of these character; the father and son. You would find his fatherly acting is similar to the late Raghuvaran, another great actor. Despite being involved in two roles, he managed to create different personalities as he grew up as a child to adulthood. In short, you don't need to create 10 characters (rings the bell) to portray your talents in acting, the important things is to be the role itself and how the audiences are impacted.The songs are superb. Plainly one of Harris Jeyaraj's classics after Minnale. It is a disappointment that Gautham and Harris have ended their ties, as their duo seem to come up with masterpieces. Not forgetting cinematography, you don't get much of boring static shots; it's either dramatic, or simply keeps you wanting to know more about the next scene.Though a little draggy ( the flaw ) , overall this a Tamil movie you shouldn't miss. Every single character has brought out their role well, Simran as Surya's mum played her character too neatly and well, leaving you praising her performance at the end of the movie.After watching this movie, it won't really leave you for a few days most a week. That much impact.Watch it, you may find the usual Tamil movie clichés, but it will leave you satisfied as you step out the theater or living room.",touching inspiring film,first scene very last bit everything was well crafted excellence real magic this movie is definitely suryas acting at first i was wondering why is he casted again as double role acting he has done that several times like one vel however i was amazed at his abilities creating distinctive traits each these character father son you would find his fatherly acting is similar late raghuvaran another great actor despite being involved two roles he managed create different personalities as he grew up as child adulthood short you dont need create 10 characters rings bell portray your talents acting important things is be role itself how audiences are impacted songs are superb plainly one harris jeyarajs classics after minnale it is disappointment that gautham harris have ended their ties as their duo seem come up with masterpieces not forgetting cinematography you dont get much boring static shots its either dramatic or simply keeps you wanting know more about next scene though little draggy flaw overall this tamil movie you shouldnt miss every single character has brought out their role well simran as suryas mum played her character too neatly well leaving you praising her performance at end movie after watching this movie it wont really leave you few days most week that much impact watch it you may find usual tamil movie clich s but it will leave you satisfied as you step out theater or living room,0.41842985842985836,0.09712033462033463,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"

Simran to being with, played her role beautifully and with much demure. It was really nice to see Simran acting again and yeah dancing on screen. I just so missed her absence. Loved the way how Gautham has used her in this movie. Sameera and Divya were both at the best and no one can say they are mediocre performers or just plain dumb blonds after this movie. They played their roles up to perfection and left a lasting impression in our minds.

9,A true masterpiece for Tamil Cinema,"""Vaaranam Aayiram"" is a true and an honest attempt at making a realistic and meaningful Tamil film. The screenplay revolves around the most famous middle class in the world conversing in fluent English and it has all the elements that are most common within this group; studying MS in USA for instance. The direction is outstanding in some places and mostly good at other times. Gautam's conception of the Train scenes between Surya and Sameera Reddy is extremely refreshing. Harris Jeyaraj's music is of utmost quality, especially in the ""Adiye Kolluthey"" and ""Nenjukkul Peidhidum"" songs and that is evident from the fact that ""Adiye Kolluthey"" song was the first Tamil song to be played on V Channel.Simran is perfect as a charming girl from the 70's and very gracious and respectable mother of the 90's. Sameera Reddy shows a lot of signs of good acting skills in addition to the oomph factor. Divya comes across as a very sensible lady expressing her thoughts with subtle emotions. The art director shows his brilliance when he brings to life the streets of 70's and 90's and the beauty of San Francisco bridge.The actor, who eclipses everybody else with ease including the director, is Surya. Nobody would believe if he is the same actor after watching him in ""Nerukku Ner"" in 1998. He is growing by leaps and bounds in every movie and stands now as one of the real acting talents of the current generation in line with Vikram. He is extremely honorable as a father (except for some makeup goof-ups) and a truly pitiable young man having lost the love of his life. Not many actors can transform themselves completely to look like a teenager in such an incredibly realistic manner. Not stopping there, Surya has also taken extreme measures to build six packs and look like an Army Major that would even make some of the real military personnel feel ashamed. His dedication and acting abilities seem to be a serious contender for Kamal's ingenious work seen recently in Dasavathaaram.",true masterpiece tamil cinema,vaaranam aayiram is true honest attempt at making realistic meaningful tamil film screenplay revolves around most famous middle class world conversing fluent english it has all elements that are most common within this group studying ms usa instance direction is outstanding some places mostly good at other times gautams conception train scenes between surya sameera reddy is extremely refreshing harris jeyarajs music is utmost quality especially adiye kolluthey nenjukkul peidhidum songs that is evident fact that adiye kolluthey song was first tamil song be played v channel simran is perfect as charming girl 70s very gracious respectable mother 90s sameera reddy shows lot signs good acting skills addition oomph factor divya comes across as very sensible lady expressing her thoughts with subtle emotions art director shows his brilliance when he brings life streets 70s 90s beauty san francisco bridge actor who eclipses everybody else with ease including director is surya nobody would believe if he is same actor after watching him nerukku ner 1998 he is growing by leaps bounds every movie stands now as one real acting talents current generation line with vikram he is extremely honorable as father except some makeup goof ups truly pitiable young man having lost love his life not many actors can transform themselves completely look like teenager such incredibly realistic manner not stopping there surya has also taken extreme measures build six packs look like army major that would even make some real military personnel feel ashamed his dedication acting abilities seem be serious contender kamals ingenious work seen recently dasavathaaram,0.5114341085271318,0.20125968992248053,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10,"Beautifully Filmed, well acted Tamil Cinema","I have never reviewed a film on IMDb before, but Varnam Ayiurm deserves some special recognition. I was absolutely enthralled from beginning to end. Varanam Ayiurm is loosely based on Tom Hank's Forest Gump, as Surya travels the world and undertakes different adventures to find and secure his love. Of course his path is full of twists and turns that push him to his mental and physical extremes. This story is beautifully displayed through breathtaking cinematography. Each scene was shot with care and diligence which makes a modest budget film, look like a billion bucks. Glad to see that the money was well used instead of ravishing over gold necklaces and over-the-top song sequences like Sankar's Shivagi and Annyian. Surya's is at the top of his game with another riveting performance. He is definitely one of the best in the business! The one criticism I do have about this movie;this might sound weird, but I believe the movie was hampered in its feel and realism with the overuse of the English language. The English words drained passion from the dialogue, especially the ""I made love to her...Daddy"" line. What was supposed to be a very emotional moment almost made me laugh! Other than that, this movie is a 10/10 in my books and a definite must see to all movie goers!",beautifully filmed well acted tamil cinema,i have never reviewed film imdb before but varnam ayiurm deserves some special recognition i was absolutely enthralled beginning end varanam ayiurm is loosely based tom hanks forest gump as surya travels world undertakes different adventures find secure his love course his path is full twists turns that push him his mental physical extremes this story is beautifully displayed through breathtaking cinematography each scene was shot with care diligence which makes modest budget film look like billion bucks glad see that money was well used instead ravishing over gold necklaces over top song sequences like sankars shivagi annyian suryas is at top his game with another riveting performance he is definitely one best business one criticism i do have about this movie this might sound weird but i believe movie was hampered its feel realism with overuse english language english words drained passion dialogue especially i made love her daddy line what was supposed be very emotional moment almost made me laugh other than that this movie is 10 10 my books definite must see all movie goers,0.5784505494505495,0.253507326007326,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10,Surya: A gem in Tamil Cinema,"This movie is definitely a justified triumph for Surya and Gautham Menon. The whole movie doesn't drag AT ALL except A BIT in the last. Sameera looks really pretty with the work of the make up artists. The Camera Men also have worked extremely hard and hats off to Aascar films for producing this film. But the main part of the cast and crew who steal the show Surya and Gautham Menon and Harris Jayaraj whose melodies and rock are worth their weight in Gold. The songs, Adiyae Kolluthae and Nenjukkul Peidhidhum are worth listening a hundred times a day and so are Mundhinam and Oh! Shanti. Ana Mene and Ava Enna pictured after Surya loses his love are also excellently made except the background which could have been adjusted. Surya looks so smart in the army uniform and classy too! But Divya Spandana is not pretty at all but I guess this is her best...Other than that, the movie is worth 10 on 10 as a whole........Cheers to everyone!",surya gem tamil cinema,this movie is definitely justified triumph surya gautham menon whole movie doesnt drag at all except bit last sameera looks really pretty with work make up artists camera men also have worked extremely hard hats off aascar films producing this film but main part cast crew who steal show surya gautham menon harris jayaraj whose melodies rock are worth their weight gold songs adiyae kolluthae nenjukkul peidhidhum are worth listening hundred times day so are mundhinam oh shanti ana mene ava enna pictured after surya loses his love are also excellently made except background which could have been adjusted surya looks so smart army uniform classy too but divya spandana is not pretty at all but i guess this is her best other than that movie is worth 10 10 as whole cheers everyone,0.4700187969924812,0.2099624060150376,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"

The way she is expressing on seeing Surya's expression in that Train Journey is simply superb. Also the way Surya is proposing to Sameera in that Train is great to watch.Divya is doing her best. She is somewhat looking too romantic over Surya and that expresses her love on him.Father Surya is superb. He is exactly resembling an Old man's mannerism.

10,Above Average,"Gautham Vasudev Menon is back with a film straight from the heart. The director, who believes in meaningful cinema, is trying to push the cinematic envelope with Vaaranam Aayiram.The film is clearly meant for niche audiences, and not for mass viewing. It is a tribute to the director's dad, who passed away last year. The treatment and narration are purely autobiographical with most of it taken from real life incidents laced with cinematic liberties.In a nutshell, the film is personal and deals with the deep bonding between a loving and devoted father and his son who is trying to discover himself. Menon's life story may be woefully long and meandering with a great first half, but post Interval, it lags. Still it works and grabs us where it matters and leaves a lump in your throat.The film demands great patience to sit through and is an overdose of emotions. If the film holds on, it is because of its music and superb performance of Surya. On the whole, the film is optimistic, fresh and emotionally honest. But how mature are our audiences, is the million dollar question?",above average,gautham vasudev menon is back with film straight heart director who believes meaningful cinema is trying push cinematic envelope with vaaranam aayiram film is clearly meant niche audiences not mass viewing it is tribute directors dad who passed away last year treatment narration are purely autobiographical with most it taken real life incidents laced with cinematic liberties nutshell film is personal deals with deep bonding between loving devoted father his son who is trying discover himself menons life story may be woefully long meandering with great first half but post interval it lags still it works grabs us where it matters leaves lump your throat film demands great patience sit through is overdose emotions if film holds it is because its music superb performance surya whole film is optimistic fresh emotionally honest but how mature are our audiences is million dollar question,0.4,0.23133333333333328,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.48}"
8,One time watch,"Due to prolonged delays in the release of the movie, the element of surprise in the plot is really lost.A movie as now evident to most of us, revolves a full circle on both the lives of a father and son (both donned by Surya) First scene - We see a visibly dying, older Surya. His slow but painful death is informed to his army son (Again Surya) who is in the middle of a rescue mission.The story is then told in flash-back with a voice-over from the mourning son - its starts from the early life of his father and continues onto his life - childhood, adolescence, Love, loss, drugs, rehab, and finally in the army.His love for his father is told time and again in the way he says ""Daddy"".The movie has no great depth in plot, but the sentimental factor is on a high. I could see most of the women in the hall, weeping bitterly.Love in all forms is expressed in a very subtle but warm manner.If you want to know the trophy of the movie.....its got to be Surya....This must be one of his finest performances....Be it the father, as a total cool-head or his son, as a clichéd young blood.Also the six-pack would make all the girls scream their hearts out.The gracefully older looking Simran too puts up a fine act...Sameera surprisingly looks pretty and Ramya is wasted...Music is a fine blend - another great composition from Harris. Except that 7 songs makes the already 3+ hours of runtime seem much longer.Reco: Movie of a plain-types, but definitely worth a watch, if you can afford to ignore some, out of the place action scenes; like that of a kidnap and rescue et al.",one time watch,due prolonged delays release movie element surprise plot is really lost movie as now evident most us revolves full circle both lives father son both donned by surya first scene we see visibly dying older surya his slow but painful death is informed his army son again surya who is middle rescue mission story is then told flash back with voice over mourning son its starts early life his father continues onto his life childhood adolescence love loss drugs rehab finally army his love his father is told time again way he says daddy movie has no great depth plot but sentimental factor is high i could see most women hall weeping bitterly love all forms is expressed very subtle but warm manner if you want know trophy movie its got be surya this must be one his finest performances be it father as total cool head or his son as clich d young blood also six pack would make all girls scream their hearts out gracefully older looking simran too puts up fine act sameera surprisingly looks pretty ramya is wasted music is fine blend another great composition harris except that 7 songs makes already 3 hours runtime seem much longer reco movie plain types but definitely worth watch if you can afford ignore some out place action scenes like that kidnap rescue et al,0.4756150793650794,0.15983465608465605,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.42}"
