9.0,I hated this movie,"The first time I saw it. After one of my buddies claimed it was the greatest movie every made. I mean, what could live up to that hype.Then, over the course of 20+ years I discovered a much wider world of films beyond what CBC and CTV showed late at night to pay the bills. We rented every B&W movie the video store had on tape. TCM came along. I discovered film noir. I drove Interstate 5 through California in the midst of a terrible multi-year drought. I visited Los Angeles. I discovered Arts & Crafts homes.Then I watched this movie again tonight. And I realized my buddy may have been right.It has Jack Nicholson before he became a caricature of himself. John Huston showing he was as good an actor as he was a director. And Faye Dunaway, my goodness, was she on fire for a decade or what. When she's trying to explain things to Nicholson in the third act and she's breaking down while doing so, if that doesn't get you, you have no heart.But you know what else? If you know the ending, the movie is more riveting. Because then you understand why the characters are addressing the things they do, and you're watching the characters act and react, which is where the magic lies.This is a superlative film. I feel like a dope for taking 20 years to properly appreciate it. I only wish my friend were still alive so I could tell him he was right.",i hated this movie,first time i saw it after one my buddies claimed it was greatest movie every made i mean what could live up that hype then over course 20 years i discovered much wider world films beyond what cbc ctv showed late at night pay bills we rented every b w movie video store had tape tcm came along i discovered film noir i drove interstate 5 through california midst terrible multi year drought i visited los angeles i discovered arts crafts homes then i watched this movie again tonight i realized my buddy may have been right it has jack nicholson before he became caricature himself john huston showing he was as good actor as he was director faye dunaway my goodness was she fire decade or what when shes trying explain things nicholson third act shes breaking down while doing so if that doesnt get you you have no heart but you know what else if you know ending movie is more riveting because then you understand why characters are addressing things they do youre watching characters act react which is where magic lies this is superlative film i feel like dope taking 20 years properly appreciate it i only wish my friend were still alive so i could tell him he was right,0.577955304928989,0.09419666590719222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.24}"
,"A very classy, consistently engaging and dark detective story","Jake Gittes is a former cop turned private detective. When he is contracted by a Mrs Mulwray to find out if her husband is having an affair, he takes to trailing Water Company Executive Hollis Mulwray. Mulwray appears to only have water and a dry riverbed on his mind but eventually they catch him with a young woman, although almost immediately the news gets leaked to the papers and Mulwray goes missing, only to turn up dead. At this point the real Mrs Mulwray comes to Gittes threatening to sue him for his involvement and Jake realises that he had been set up to set up the Mulwrays. He continues his investigation into the murder only to find a conspiracy involving thousands of gallons of water being wasted during a drought and the mysterious presence of Mrs Mulwray's father, Noah Cross.As a fan of film noir and tough detective movies, I am too often put off by modern entries into the genre that try to replace atmosphere and intelligence by just having nudity and swearing; the genre managed atmosphere without these in the forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to rely on them. With Chinatown however, everything works well as a homage to the best years of the genre and, as such, is very well set in the period and is of suitable presentation even if the material and tone is darker and harder than would have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it is just a copy and paste from better films because it isn't and indeed stands out as one of the best detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is always going to be the most important thing and it gets it spot on throughout, doing the proper thing of starting with a simple story and continually building it more and more complex as it goes. Unlike some other ""classics"" of the genre, Chinatown manages to do this without ever losing the audience and I found the plot to be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy to follow.Needless to say, things are very dark and the script is convincingly dark and miserable, leading to an ending that is as depressing as I've seen - not so much in what actually happens but also in the wider implications for the characters that the credits prevent us from seeing. Director Polanski does a great job of putting this story in a lush setting that produces a real strong sense of period but also manages to always be showing us the darkness coming through subtly throughout the movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this role and, if I had to pick one film to act as an introduction to Nicholson then it would be this one. He is tough yet damaged, upright but seedy and he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and manages to ooze menace while also coming across as a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine but really the film belongs to these three, with Nicholson being the stand out role.Overall this is a very classy film that has stood up very well to become a well-deserved classic. The story is complex, mysterious yet simple to follow; it is dark and seedy without relying on swearing or nudity to set the atmosphere. The direction is great, with a real atmosphere and sense of time and place that is matched by a great collection of performances delivering a great script.",very classy consistently engaging dark detective story,jake gittes is former cop turned private detective when he is contracted by mrs mulwray find out if her husband is having affair he takes trailing water company executive hollis mulwray mulwray appears only have water dry riverbed his mind but eventually they catch him with young woman although almost immediately news gets leaked papers mulwray goes missing only turn up dead at this point real mrs mulwray comes gittes threatening sue him his involvement jake realises that he had been set up set up mulwrays he continues his investigation into murder only find conspiracy involving thousands gallons water being wasted during drought mysterious presence mrs mulwrays father noah cross as fan film noir tough detective movies i am too often put off by modern entries into genre that try replace atmosphere intelligence by just having nudity swearing genre managed atmosphere without these forties fifties but yet modern films seem rely them with chinatown however everything works well as homage best years genre as such is very well set period is suitable presentation even if material tone is darker harder than would have been allowed years ago this is not say it is just copy paste better films because it isnt indeed stands out as one best detective noirs i have seen ages plot is always going be most important thing it gets it spot throughout doing proper thing starting with simple story continually building it more more complex as it goes unlike some other classics genre chinatown manages do this without ever losing audience i found plot be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy follow needless say things are very dark script is convincingly dark miserable leading ending that is as depressing as ive seen not so much what actually happens but also wider implications characters that credits prevent us seeing director polanski does great job putting this story lush setting that produces real strong sense period but also manages always be showing us darkness coming through subtly throughout movie course it helps that he also has great cast work with jack nicholson is iconic this role if i had pick one film act as introduction nicholson then it would be this one he is tough yet damaged upright but seedy he brings out his complex character well dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with similarly dark role huston adds class manages ooze menace while also coming across as harmless old man support cast are all fine but really film belongs these three with nicholson being stand out role overall this is very classy film that has stood up very well become well deserved classic story is complex mysterious yet simple follow it is dark seedy without relying swearing or nudity set atmosphere direction is great with real atmosphere sense time place that is matched by great collection performances delivering great script,0.5033469387755101,0.12203174603174602,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Capturing the True Spirit of Film-noir,"The seventies were the last years of great (American) films. I say films because when we speak of movies nowadays, we allude to blockbusters that generate hundreds of millions of dollars, the least amount of controversy, and are mostly inane crowd pleasers with tacked-on endings.Consider the output of influential film makers Allen during that time: Coppola, Scorsese, Altman, Lumet, Ashby, Bogdanovich, to name a few Americans, not to mention European directors Fellini, Bergman, Wertmuller, Truffaut, Argento, Saura, and Bunuel -- all household names in those days. Before Spielberg and Lucas came along, not a single one of these made movies appealing to the ""summer blockbuster tradition,"" and unlike Spielberg or Lucas, they have a body of work filled in high artistic quality with minimum special effects and a lasting mark on future generations.Polanski is another one of these directors, and with ""Chinatown,"" he reaches his directorial peak amidst the scandals which seemed to taint everything except his art. One can only imagine him in the forties, living his scandals, and transmuting this into high art -- when film-noir was at its darkest. Thankfully he lived in a time which did not demand the ""happy ending"" or re-shoots in order to be politically correct -- else ""Chinatown"" would have lost its devastating punch and conformed to the norm.A departure from the horror genre which brought Polanski to stardom, he re-creates an equally grim genre with his jaded view of 1930s Los Angeles down to the choice of the color palette, and using the acting powers of Dunaway and Nicholson to a fantastic effect, he creates haunting characters who can't be easily dismissed as film-noir archetypes without looking very closely at their reactions, listening to their words, and following their progressive involvement in a plot which threatens to swallow them whole, and ultimately does. And having Huston play Noah Cross -- who virtually took noir to its heights with ""The Maltese Falcon"" -- Polanski hits the mark dead center, because Huston is the hardened heart of the corruption in ""Chinatown."" In brief scenes he creates a character almost unbearably evil with a hint of madness just underneath, and how he affects the characters around him will pervade the viewer long after the credits have rolled -- after all, he is the person who tells Nicholson he has no idea what he's getting himself into.I doubt this movie could be made today for reasons stated above. I'm thankful Polanski's vision prevailed, and not Towne's. Film-noir is a genre about human darkness, and here, the envelope is pushed all the way through, making this film, in my opinion, rank second to ""The Maltese Falcon.""",capturing true spirit film noir,seventies were last years great american films i say films because when we speak movies nowadays we allude blockbusters that generate hundreds millions dollars least amount controversy are mostly inane crowd pleasers with tacked endings consider output influential film makers allen during that time coppola scorsese altman lumet ashby bogdanovich name few americans not mention european directors fellini bergman wertmuller truffaut argento saura bunuel all household names those days before spielberg lucas came along not single one these made movies appealing summer blockbuster tradition unlike spielberg or lucas they have body work filled high artistic quality with minimum special effects lasting mark future generations polanski is another one these directors with chinatown he reaches his directorial peak amidst scandals which seemed taint everything except his art one can only imagine him forties living his scandals transmuting this into high art when film noir was at its darkest thankfully he lived time which did not demand happy ending or re shoots order be politically correct else chinatown would have lost its devastating punch conformed norm departure horror genre which brought polanski stardom he re creates equally grim genre with his jaded view 1930s los angeles down choice color palette using acting powers dunaway nicholson fantastic effect he creates haunting characters who cant be easily dismissed as film noir archetypes without looking very closely at their reactions listening their words following their progressive involvement plot which threatens swallow them whole ultimately does having huston play noah cross who virtually took noir its heights with maltese falcon polanski hits mark dead center because huston is hardened heart corruption chinatown brief scenes he creates character almost unbearably evil with hint madness just underneath how he affects characters around him will pervade viewer long after credits have rolled after all he is person who tells nicholson he has no idea what hes getting himself into i doubt this movie could be made today reasons stated above im thankful polanskis vision prevailed not townes film noir is genre about human darkness here envelope is pushed all way through making this film my opinion rank second maltese falcon,0.45282341269841275,0.020599206349206377,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Marvelous,"There is a word, impossible to spell, that describes the alignment of solar bodies like the planets when they all fall into place together. A similar word would describe this film. Everything about it is right. Polanski never directed a better movie. The performers, down to the lowest atmosphere person, are superb. The editing, the score, the sound, the decor, the dialog, all are just about flawless. The photography is peerless. The white garden apartments, the terra cotta roof tiles, the palms and desert sand are all painted with a faint gold, faintly ripe with false promise, like the oranges that bounce from Gittes' desperately speeding car in the northwest Valley. Polanski deserves much of the credit. When Gittes surprises Evelyn Mulwray in her car, after he follows her to her daughter's house, her face slumps forward and beeps the horn briefly. Then, so faintly, we hear a few dogs bark in the background. Not only is the scene itself exquisitely done but it prefigures the ending, as does Gittes' remark earlier to Evelyn that she has a flaw in her iris. The movie is too good to deserve much dissecting. It stands repeated watching. If there is anything wrong with it, it is the serious and tragic ending that Polanski always insists on tacking on. Robert Towne was right and Polanski wrong in this case. Everything came together on this film. It's not only the best detective movie ever made; it's one of the best movies ever made -- period. A marvelous job by everyone concerned.I have to add (6/27/05) that the word I mentioned in the first sentence is spelled ""syzygy."" Man, did I get enlightening email on that. I might as well add two other impressive features of this movie. (1) Polanksi takes his time. Example: Gittes sneaks into Hollis Mulwray's office and begins to go through the drawers of his old-fashioned wooden desk. As he slides each drawer out, Polanksi gives us a shot of their humdrum contents (checkbooks, magnifying glass, and so forth) and we can almost smell the heat and the odor of shellac and sawdust emanating from the wooden containers. The contents reveal nothing of importance in this case. But (2) sometimes irrelevant information crops up that resonates later in the film with its own echo. The detail might be just a word (""applecore"") or an ordinary object (a pair of spectacles found in a pond, immediately after Gittes imitates the Japanese gardener's remark that the water is bad for the ""glass."") Some of the references may be so consistent as to constitute a theme (water). None of this hits you over the head with its significance. It's all very neatly stitched together.",marvelous,there is word impossible spell that describes alignment solar bodies like planets when they all fall into place together similar word would describe this film everything about it is right polanski never directed better movie performers down lowest atmosphere person are superb editing score sound decor dialog all are just about flawless photography is peerless white garden apartments terra cotta roof tiles palms desert sand are all painted with faint gold faintly ripe with false promise like oranges that bounce gittes desperately speeding car northwest valley polanski deserves much credit when gittes surprises evelyn mulwray her car after he follows her her daughters house her face slumps forward beeps horn briefly then so faintly we hear few dogs bark background not only is scene itself exquisitely done but it prefigures ending as does gittes remark earlier evelyn that she has flaw her iris movie is too good deserve much dissecting it stands repeated watching if there is anything wrong with it it is serious tragic ending that polanski always insists tacking robert towne was right polanski wrong this case everything came together this film its not only best detective movie ever made its one best movies ever made period marvelous job by everyone concerned i have add 6 27 05 that word i mentioned first sentence is spelled syzygy man did i get enlightening email that i might as well add two other impressive features this movie 1 polanksi takes his time example gittes sneaks into hollis mulwrays office begins go through drawers his old fashioned wooden desk as he slides each drawer out polanksi gives us shot their humdrum contents checkbooks magnifying glass so forth we can almost smell heat odor shellac sawdust emanating wooden containers contents reveal nothing importance this case but 2 sometimes irrelevant information crops up that resonates later film with its own echo detail might be just word applecore or ordinary object pair spectacles found pond immediately after gittes imitates japanese gardeners remark that water is bad glass some references may be so consistent as constitute theme water none this hits you over head with its significance its all very neatly stitched together,0.5752195204322863,0.10831644714623437,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,As coolly intense and exceptionally-staged as any detective story/film-noir of the 40's & 50's,"Chinatown is a tremendous collaborative effort that produced one of the most memorable Hollywood pictures of the 1970's. Director Roman Polanski (his last film in America, and the first he made in America after the murder of Sharon Tate), stars Jack Nicholson & Faye Dunaway, and writer Robert Towne, all come together to create a detective story classic. At times it slows its pace down so the viewer can think along with Nicholson's character, to take in the environment as well as the situation he's in (i.e. when he goes to the empty reservoir, when he visits Noah Crosses house the first time). And the script has the perfect sense of drawing us into a story, fueled by curiosity, grit, and cynicism, and engages the viewer by its realistic dialog between the characters.J.J. Gittes (Nicholson, in one of his best 70's performances) is in Los Angeles circa 1933 in the line of private investigator, usually dealing with people who may or may not believe that their significant other is having an affair. Evelyn Mulwray feels this may be the case with her husband Hollis, and Gittes decides to take the case. However, this draws him into a deeper case involving the city's loss of water once Hollis- a major player in the water supply controversy in the city- is found murdered. This eventually leads him to Noah Cross (John Huston), a big businessman and who also happens to be Evelyn's father. Intrigue starts to develop, as Jake's own life begins to be at risk.As a intricate, detailed detective story the film is an above-average work, with Towne's script containing the maturity, and wicked sense of humor, of a James M. Cain or Raymond Chandler novel. When the thrills come they come as being striking. And when humanity and compassion get thrown into the mix, the film reaches a whole other plane of intelligence. The last third of the film could turn off some of the audience (depending on one's own level of belief), but it holds strong thanks to the performances. Nicholson doesn't over-step his bounds in any scene, finding the right notes in suggestive conversations. Dunaway is better than expected (though I'm not sure if it's an great performance). And Huston's Noah Cross is one of the more disturbing villains of that period in movies. Add to it some good cameos (Burt Young as a driver, Polanski playing the little guy in the infamous 'knife' scene), and a smooth soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, Chinatown comes out as strong piece of movie-making, and arguably one of the greatest in the crime/mystery genre.",as coolly intense exceptionally staged as any detective story film noir 40s 50s,chinatown is tremendous collaborative effort that produced one most memorable hollywood pictures 1970s director roman polanski his last film america first he made america after murder sharon tate stars jack nicholson faye dunaway writer robert towne all come together create detective story classic at times it slows its pace down so viewer can think along with nicholsons character take environment as well as situation hes i e when he goes empty reservoir when he visits noah crosses house first time script has perfect sense drawing us into story fueled by curiosity grit cynicism engages viewer by its realistic dialog between characters j j gittes nicholson one his best 70s performances is los angeles circa 1933 line private investigator usually dealing with people who may or may not believe that their significant other is having affair evelyn mulwray feels this may be case with her husband hollis gittes decides take case however this draws him into deeper case involving citys loss water once hollis major player water supply controversy city is found murdered this eventually leads him noah cross john huston big businessman who also happens be evelyns father intrigue starts develop as jakes own life begins be at risk as intricate detailed detective story film is above average work with townes script containing maturity wicked sense humor james m cain or raymond chandler novel when thrills come they come as being striking when humanity compassion get thrown into mix film reaches whole other plane intelligence last third film could turn off some audience depending ones own level belief but it holds strong thanks performances nicholson doesnt over step his bounds any scene finding right notes suggestive conversations dunaway is better than expected though im not sure if its great performance hustons noah cross is one more disturbing villains that period movies add it some good cameos burt young as driver polanski playing little guy infamous knife scene smooth soundtrack by jerry goldsmith chinatown comes out as strong piece movie making arguably one greatest crime mystery genre,0.5297949735449735,0.22250330687830688,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,This movie got it all: perfectly paced study of human darkness,"I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that's why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn't really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.In a recent New York Times piece, they called CHINATOWN ""a meditation on evil"", which is spot-on. Set in 1937, this movie is just all-round perfect, first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie, that is rich in themes (water, evil, trust, guilt, greed) and even richer in suspense, as the audience—just like our protagonist—tries to find out what is happening. The story is ""complex"" for sure, but it's not ""complicated"". Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.Besides the impeccable screenplay, everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway's stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful, the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic! So, if you're ready to delve deep into a richly layered exploration of the dark side of humanity—enjoy the ride. But don't expect to come back unscathed.",this movie got it all perfectly paced study human darkness,i knew chinatown was hailed as paragon film noir thats why i finally got down watching it however despite having known about movie quite while i wasnt really prepared just how dark it could be movie starts slowly with private detective taking what looks like routine case but soon he finds himself enmeshed web conspiracy murder lies deceit plot is like perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards final resolution that is truly epic truly soul wrenching recent new york times piece they called chinatown meditation evil which is spot set 1937 this movie is just all round perfect first foremost how everything is connected within grand structure movie that is rich themes water evil trust guilt greed even richer suspense as audience just like our protagonist tries find out what is happening story is complex sure but its not complicated everything makes sense end complexity pays off big time besides impeccable screenplay everything else about this movie is perfect as well jack nicholson faye dunaway carry movie with sophistication dignity dunaways stunning performance particular fills every scene with aura mystery as you are trying find out what her motives are set pieces are beautiful score is compelling camera work editing could not be any better there is reason this one is called classic so if youre ready delve deep into richly layered exploration dark side humanity enjoy ride but dont expect come back unscathed,0.5907860657860657,0.1836959336959337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Great 'modern' film noir,"Set in late '30s Los Angeles this 1974 film opens with a woman, identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray, asking private detective Jake Gettes to find out whether her husband, chief engineer of the LA Water and Power Company, is having an affair. He follows him and ultimately photographs him with another woman. Somehow these pictures end up in the papers and he is approached by another woman who it turns out is the real wife of Mulwray... and she intends to sue. He continues to investigate Mulwray and suspects some odd goings on at Water and Power... then Mulwray turns up dead; drowned during a severe drought. His continued investigation brings him closer to the real Evelyn as well as into real danger as he learns the truth about Water and Power's activities which could make some people very rich at the expense of other, poorer, people.This film may have been made about a quarter of a century after the classic era for film noir but it perfectly captures the feel of those films. It has morally ambiguous characters inhabiting a murky world that contrasts with the bright Los Angeles sunshine. The story has many twists and turns without feeling unnecessarily complex or confusing. The cast does a great job; especially Jack Nicholson who is in every scene so that the viewer doesn't know anything Gettes doesn't know. Faye Dunaway is solid as Evelyn Mulwray and John Huston is suitably menacing as her father; a man standing to make a lot of money with many dark secrets. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good mystery or fans of film noir.",great modern film noir,set late 30s los angeles this 1974 film opens with woman identifying herself as evelyn mulwray asking private detective jake gettes find out whether her husband chief engineer la water power company is having affair he follows him ultimately photographs him with another woman somehow these pictures end up papers he is approached by another woman who it turns out is real wife mulwray she intends sue he continues investigate mulwray suspects some odd goings at water power then mulwray turns up dead drowned during severe drought his continued investigation brings him closer real evelyn as well as into real danger as he learns truth about water powers activities which could make some people very rich at expense other poorer people this film may have been made about quarter century after classic era film noir but it perfectly captures feel those films it has morally ambiguous characters inhabiting murky world that contrasts with bright los angeles sunshine story has many twists turns without feeling unnecessarily complex or confusing cast does great job especially jack nicholson who is every scene so that viewer doesnt know anything gettes doesnt know faye dunaway is solid as evelyn mulwray john huston is suitably menacing as her father man standing make lot money with many dark secrets overall id definitely recommend this anybody wanting good mystery or fans film noir,0.49626436781609196,0.1314655172413793,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"A noir masterpiece, possibly even a timeless classic...","While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction(maybe I'll grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I can't deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that he'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there's not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10",noir masterpiece possibly even timeless classic,while i dont care too much roman polanskis style direction maybe ill grow like it eventually maybe not i cant deny that this is truly great film jack nicholson really shines through his role his acting this film perfectly fits character his shark smile his voice his tone all it perfect i always thought when watching films with nicholson that hed make great lead noir film so when i found this film discovered that it was indeed noir i naturally saw it as soon as possible i found film have slightly slower pace than what i would have preferred or expected but apart that minor detail it was flawless plot is great thoroughly interesting involving pacing while not fast all time is more than acceptable there are sequences that are really intense exciting acting is great like i said earlier nicholson shines through really takes this character makes him his own characters are well written credible special effects are well done still hold up pretty well dialog is very well written memorable there are quite few quotable lines as well cinematography is good even when plot doesnt move lot polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles sequences i liked that there was often something subtle going background while were focusing whats directly front us while polanski certainly doesnt possess attention detail that kubrick does he manages put good bit detail into many shots there is fairly little left coincidence or chance much like kubrick film has few twists that are quite good they come as surprises i dont think i really saw them coming i doubt anyone would be able course some might not find twists be that impressive but story stands its own nicely as well this is great movie which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it its more than just casually adult nature even though theres not that much violence or sex it i recommend this film anyone who enjoys film noir watching jack nicholson perfect shape role that was tailor made him good mystery roman polanskis direction just good movie with more adult tone that many others 10 10,0.5572772657450078,0.3475902457757296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,Polanski & Nicholson's Finest Work. A Top 20 Greatest Film,"Chinatown sits securely at the pinnacle of the Neo Noir genre. Fueled by Polanski-Nicholson synergy, anchored by one of greatest-ever original screenplays (written by Los Angeles native Robert Towne), brought to movie-life via PanaVision by brilliant cinematographer John Alonzo, and produced by the industry icon Robert Evans, this is one of film's greatest works of art, and being imo one of the top 20 greatest films ever made - it is a must-see movie.Chinatown represents the art of film-making in its finest form, exceeding expectations in every reel.This was Polanski's last film he made in the USA, and the best and last opportunity to see Nicholson's brilliant acting prowess before his characterization method became (to a large degree) a caricature of himself (albeit doing so perhaps better than any other icon-level movie-star).Often, this much talent on one set becomes a disappointment. Not this time.Like many successful collaborations, there were major style differences between Evans, Polanski and Towne - Such ""manageable stress"" can sink a film, but instead served as a positive catalyst in raising the bar of production and execution.For those who haven't seen the film, it is ""required"" viewing. For those who haven't seen it in a while, cue it up, and enjoy - like most great films, it just seems to get better with age.Polanski's style of film making utilizes a classic Noir movie-making ""complete-the-scene"" method before moving on - similar to live theatre (Act I, Scene 1, etc) The benefit is fulfilling each scene's importance to the story and film as a whole - this style works well in Noir films, and his set-up, detailing, and execution is brilliant.The immaculately detailed set designs, wardrobe, makeup, and authentic restored vintage cars were painstakingly orchestrated by Polanski to transport us back to atmosphere and feel of the golden age of Hollywood circa 1937.Chinatown is a must-see film.",polanski nicholsons finest work top 20 greatest film,chinatown sits securely at pinnacle neo noir genre fueled by polanski nicholson synergy anchored by one greatest ever original screenplays written by los angeles native robert towne brought movie life via panavision by brilliant cinematographer john alonzo produced by industry icon robert evans this is one films greatest works art being imo one top 20 greatest films ever made it is must see movie chinatown represents art film making its finest form exceeding expectations every reel this was polanskis last film he made usa best last opportunity see nicholsons brilliant acting prowess before his characterization method became large degree caricature himself albeit doing so perhaps better than any other icon level movie star often this much talent one set becomes disappointment not this time like many successful collaborations there were major style differences between evans polanski towne such manageable stress can sink film but instead served as positive catalyst raising bar production execution those who havent seen film it is required viewing those who havent seen it while cue it up enjoy like most great films it just seems get better with age polanskis style film making utilizes classic noir movie making complete scene method before moving similar live theatre act i scene 1 etc benefit is fulfilling each scenes importance story film as whole this style works well noir films his set up detailing execution is brilliant immaculately detailed set designs wardrobe makeup authentic restored vintage cars were painstakingly orchestrated by polanski transport us back atmosphere feel golden age hollywood circa 1937 chinatown is must see film,0.547342788790157,0.40018654591023006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"

Fay Dunaway as Mrs. Mulray and John Huston and that voice: ""Just find the girl."" There are comic scenes and Nicholson has feet of clay, but he finally puts his personal integrity on the line. He moves into darkness and sees the underside. And then there is Chinatown with its secrets, politics, incest, all of that. It is such an intelligent movies. One of the reviewers said it was compact. That says it all. Every scene is necessary. It's too bad Polanski can't work in the U.S. anymore--he still releases a treasures every so often.

9.0,Example of Masterful Film Noir!,"Over the years, people have called Chinatown one of the best movies ever. I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.As I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.This movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.This film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.Even though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.My Grade: A-",example masterful film noir,over years people have called chinatown one best movies ever i dont quite agree with that statement but there is no denying that movie is masterpiece i may not find it one best films all time but i do find it as one best films 1974 this noir film hearkens back days where similar films were produced left right but starting 1960s this genre slowly began fade away film may come across as really taking its time tell story but thriller has lots tension that builds up its climatic ending this film brought public awareness some issues people may not have really known about water is commodity human survival whoever controls water controls money this movie is complex series events surrounding control water that people can die over this issue ah wonders being human being movie is complicated follow so dont lose yourself any train thought or you might lose what will happen plot wise boasting one cinemas all time greatest screenplays by robert towne powerful lead performance by jack nicholson you are fantastic time as i mentioned briefly films plot can be complex as film will turn down completely different path heartbeat jake gittes jack nicholson is private investigator who specializes matrimonial affairs one day he gets visit woman claiming be evelyn mulwray she tells jake that her husband is cheating her she would like jake investigate her claims he does his job by taking photographs him he catches him with another woman that ensues scandal gittes is confronted by real evelyn mulwray faye dunaway when husband shows up dead gittes is led deeper deeper web deceit lies murder this movie is given its voice by variety elements such as robert townes fantastic screenplay or roman polanksis visionary directing style but lets not forget about wonderful performances including tour de force performance by screen legend jack nicholson nicholsons performance is nothing short excellent as he portrays jake gittes i loved how movie gave depth characterization this character gittes may not be nicest man world but hes man honor honesty movie is all about lies that forms rather bleak mental state gittes all we wants do is find truth move but that seems impossible do with all lies murder nicholson was nominated oscar his performance some might say he should have won who can forget that scene at river bed where he is slashed nose by this random creep faye dunaway also delivers amazing performance outside her character makes you believe she is good but she has some fishy motives about her gittes falls love with her but he cant take her sneaky lies then we have performance john huston legendary director who plays evelyns father his character noah cross is antagonist film one would say as he wants use his wealth control water that dinner scene between noah jake is quite something noah his mean beady eyes are put good use this film was directed by roman polanski before he was extradited europe could only make films there this movie has him returning back directors chair only few years after brutal murder his wife unborn child i loved his sense direction he really captured noir feeling you would find films 1940s his conflict with screenwriter robert towne became somewhat famous towne had film end with happy ending but polanksi went against that ending is not happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths wrong people but it was effective ending nonetheless no matter what robert towne written one best screenplays all time that will endure many many years into our future even though chinatown is fictional movie its based los angeles water grab 1908 this is city that formed desert it should be impossible water exist which makes control water ever more so fundamental towne did great job adding his own 1930s spin story this movie is undeniably great film pace crawls at times but content story kept me captivated this is not action thriller but its one those slow burn thrillers focused telling top rate story film fires all cylinders because its wonderful acting solid direction but we also have great but sad trumpet infused score jerry goldsmith cinematography john alonzo that captures l old very effective way lets not forget about award winning screenplay robert towne nominated 11 oscars this film is worth watch this is fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling my grade,0.5530835667600374,0.22163912231559288,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,One of the best film noir/homage films ever made!,"""Chinatown"" is so good, it's scary. Jack Nicholson is Jake Gittes, the iconic private eye hired to spy on the husband of a woman who suspects he is having an affair. What Jake soon uncovers is a vast conspiracy involving local tycoons and water - heading towards a great conclusion with a classic surprise ending.""Chinatown"" might not be the best film noir ever made but it is certainly one of the best. Like ""Indiana Jones"" it is a loving homage to its source - in this case movies of the 1930s, 40s and 50s such as ""The Maltese Falcon"" (most obviously!) and lesser-known film noirs such as ""D.O.A."" (which no one else I've seen so far has mentioned in comparison to this, but it does have its similarities).Nicholson is absolutely superb in his role, playing Jake with all the touch panache of an instant classic anti-hero. This was certainly a movie of the 1970s, with its anti-hero being the guy we come to root for.Robert Towne is a genius and I may seem to be giving ""Chinatown"" loads of fanboy praise but I can honestly say that I'm not obsessed with it in any way, in fact I've only seen it a few times. But it's just a really, really great movie that's perfect in just about every way - direction, acting, screen writing, cinematography, editing, sound...the list is endless. Polanski deserves as much praise as Towne I suppose, because his direction is flawless and very noir-ish. (If that's a suitable description.)Overall, this is a classic - for good reason. After seeing this and ""L.A.

This was the movie that cemented Jack Nicholson as a bonafide superstar throughout the entire decade of the 1970's. This was the movie that started it all.Jack Nicholson graduated from star to superstar playing a gumshoe in this marvelously intricate film noir of the 70's directed by Roman Polanski,who has a memorable cameo as a sadistic hood,gives Nicholson the most famous nose job in motion picture history. Robert Towne's Oscar winning script(whom they used in some acting and writing classes as a learning tool in some colleges)brilliantly depicts 1940's Los Angeles as a glittering cesspool of murder,incest,and corrupt land deals. Faye Dunaway steals the picture with a haunting performance as the film's alluring female fatale,and John Huston,as her creepy millionaire father,will make your skin crawl. The stunning finale still packs an emotional wallop. ""Chinatown"" was the apex of what the cinema of the 1970's was about to become,and this was the prime factor of that as well.The film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture and won three for Best Original Score(Jerry Goldsmith),Best Screenplay(Robert Towne),and Best Supporting Actor(John Huston).",one top 100 films all time,year 1974 was very memorable that year several films were successes which consisted francis coppulas godfather part ii alan pakulas political thriller parallex view robert aldrichs longest yard not mention disaster epics day irwin allens towering inferno mark robsons earthquake not mention films conversation great gatsby lenny blazing saddles name few but one film particular stood out all rest it shows why that was one afis 100 top films all time year was 1974 motion picture is chinatown this was movie that cemented jack nicholson as bonafide superstar throughout entire decade 1970s this was movie that started it all jack nicholson graduated star superstar playing gumshoe this marvelously intricate film noir 70s directed by roman polanski who has memorable cameo as sadistic hood gives nicholson most famous nose job motion picture history robert townes oscar winning script whom they used some acting writing classes as learning tool some colleges brilliantly depicts 1940s los angeles as glittering cesspool murder incest corrupt land deals faye dunaway steals picture with haunting performance as films alluring female fatale john huston as her creepy millionaire father will make your skin crawl stunning finale still packs emotional wallop chinatown was apex what cinema 1970s was about become this was prime factor that as well film was nominated 11 oscars including best picture won three best original score jerry goldsmith best screenplay robert towne best supporting actor john huston,0.5620370370370371,0.3867283950617284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,An excellent piece of filmmaking.,"If it wasn't for the fact that most of the cast would have been too young or not born yet, this movie could have been made in the 1930's or 1940's. It reminds one of the film noirs that Hollywood used to make during that time period. It is a superb example of film making, certainly among the 20 best movies I have ever seen. Jack Nicholson is private detective Jake Gitties, who can be as hard-boiled as Humphrey Bogart's Phil Marlowe. But Gitties is different: He is intelligent, dresses well and has associates whom work with him. Gitties is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate into an extra-martial affair she believes her husband is having. However, the investigation leads into bigger things involving the water supply of Los Angeles, which is in the middle of a drought. A series of double-crosses, murders and plot twists all lead into a climatic showdown in Chinatown which has a surprising conclusion. If the saying `They don't make them like they used to' was ever more true, it was with this movie. Sex is only suggested between the Nicholson and Dunaway characters, yet it is convincing enough. And although Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman, we never see frontal nudity of her (Directors today would do just the opposite). Some of the plot twists also would not be possibly made today, especially the ending (Which, if you haven't seen the movie, I cannot reveal). Nicholson is a tour de force in his role as Gitties, but the rest of the supporting cast (Including John Huston as Mulwray's deceptive father) is equally superb. As to how Nicholson could loose the Best Actor Oscar to Art Carney in Harry and Toto is beyond me. Faye Dunaway was also nominated for Best Actress, only to loose to Ellen Burstyn for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Fortunately, Nicholson and Duanway have both won Oscars since. In addition, the film itself received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Roman Polanski (Who has a cameo in the movie as the knife-welding thug who cuts Nicholson's nose), but those Oscars would be lost to The Godfather, Part II. The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay, which is today considered the model for film writing. After watching the movie, one will know why.

9.0,Proves it's not just a noir poser; superb thriller,"For my money, Jerry Goldsmith's ""Main Theme"" for CHINATOWN is one of the all-time great pieces of film music. Both seductive and melancholy, it instantly evokes the period setting of the film and the ridiculously bleak nature of the story. And it is one hell of a story; a grade-A film noir with a unique Water & Power angle that serves as a red herring to the real narrative substance. It's well-written and proves John A. Alonzo was one of the great cinematographers (there's some brilliant shot composition here). But it really comes down to the core cast. Nicholson fits into the PI mold well, both educated and crude around women, while John Huston, playing a monumental scumbag, brings the affable charm to really highlight the menace. Faye Dunaway ably pulls off the femme fatale component, until we realize that she's the film's heroine . . . unbelievably tragic though that is. It's the kind of movie that gets under your skin and stays there. Both the ending and final line are a testament to '70s filmmaking, with the balls to forego a happy epilogue for all involved.

9.0,"First-rate, classy detective drama","'Chinatown' is one of the best films of the 70s and without doubt one of the most memorable in the crime/detective genre. This is a first-rate picture all round with very few faults, if any. It's an intelligent mystery, complex yet relatively easy to follow, and has no difficulty in holding your attention from start to finish.Part of what makes 'Chinatown' so memorable is just how perfect it is in appearance. The cinematography is on another level to anything else I've seen from the 70s - each and every scene is crafted in such a stylish and elegant way. The script is also brilliant and gives us some classic lines, including of course the famous last line of the film, 'Forget it, Jake.

10.0,Patience and attention demanding ... getting better after each viewing ...,"First time I saw ""Chinatown"", it looked good and I liked it, the second time, it was even better, and so on and so forth, but there was always a little something that couldn't get me totally 'into the film'. Yesterday, I decided not to 'watch' ""Chinatown"" but to 'pay attention to it', and I finally got why it is regarded as one of the greatest American films.As soon as Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score starts, a genre is resurrecting, a private-eye whose cigarette smoke harmoniously draws the hair of a femme-fatale, and a title announcing a haunting presence. Roman Polanski adapted the film-noir genre with a more modern touch : the first frames featuring pictures of very explicit sexual poses show how far we are from the Hayes Code, and the photographer is not the archetypal private eye, laconic, full of debts and booze. Jack Nicholson plays the role of J.J. aka Jake Gittes, a man who made 'private eye' his métier, perfectly organized, with two associates and a secretary, ironically earning his respectable money from the depraved lifestyle of the pre-war Los Angeles.Strangely, the first client almost disappoints as she's too unbelievably stereotypical. She's apparently a rich woman pretending to be Mrs. Evelyn Mullray, with an exaggerated aristocratic look. She suspects her husband, the Chief Engineer of Water and Power, of cheating her. We're finally reassured when the real Evelyn makes her appearance, but pay attention to the details: she had to trick J.J. and makes him admit that he's never seen her, what could have been compromised if the two associates had warned him when he came. The script needed Jakes to enter with such enthusiasm he wouldn't let anyone talk, hence the hilarious Chinaman joke, and its embarrassing aftermath.Every detail, every originality, plays a significant role. Jakes takes one card from Mr. Yellburton of the Water and Power office and uses it later, to enter a protected zone. Even the details that are not plot significant, like when Gittes deliberately annoys Yellburton's secretary or asks a snotty office worker for a ruler, so he can tear a piece of paper and cover it with a loud cough, give an extraordinary sense of reality. The film doesn't even deal with an exotic statuette or a jewel heist, but the control of water, an unlikely subject that brilliantly comforted the 'mystery' element of the film as when a Chinese man tells Gittes that the water is ""bad for glass"", and it takes a second meaning when you hear it again. Everything looks natural and unforced, but the perfectionism demands a concentration from the viewer, for a rewarding pay-off.The script is renowned for having been written by Robert Towne with Jack Nicholson in mind. Indeed, who else could have embodied such a cynical and apathetic attitude with this appeal, the way Gittes evokes his professionalism makes him even more charismatic as it justifies his insistence to solve the mystery, as stated in Polanski's favorite moment, when Jake and Evelyn appears in profile, face to face, with the famous bandage on Nicholson's nose and the priceless line ""I like my nose. I like breathing through it"". Faye Dunaway is also perfect as the black widow whose sophisticated mannerisms, finely traced eyebrows and bright red lips, give her a misleading femme-fatale appearance, that couldn't let you guess that she's actually the heroine as the character with the most selfless motives. The whole film is full of illusions and contradictions illustrated by the perfect casting of John Huston as Noah Cross, the powerful mastermind, whose evil scheme is hidden behind his elegant courtesy and the funny way he always call Jakes 'Mr. Gitts'. A perfect casting that also includes Polanski as the 'Kitty Cat' midget.But behind Polanski's inside joke cameo, Gittes keeping this big bandage in his nose is the unforgettable trademark of the film, an ironic punishment and the warning to a man whose nosiness might cause bigger damages. And that's the power of ""Chinatown"", the constant feeling of an imminent danger, embodied by this word : ""Chinatown"". Towne, the Oscar winning writer of the script, asked a policeman what he did in Chinatown, he replied : ""As little as possible"". If you wonder what kind of law enforcement that is, just listen to Gittes explaining that sometimes during Chinese gang quarrels, with so many different dialects, you never knew when you prevented a crime from happening, or when you were causing one, so the best thing was to do 'as little as possible' and visibly, there is a wound in Gittes' past, as he tried to help a girl, who was finally 'hurt', an obvious euphemism.""Chinatown"" resonates as a resurgence of Gittes' past, with another woman he wants to protect, and the tragic irony is that we get the meaning when it's too late. And this is where I'm glad the movie was made during the 70's when directors were allowed to shock you with a dark ending. Polanski rightfully insisted that the movie needed to end tragically to be memorable and meaningful, he who lost Sharon Tate, in a savage massacre in that very town of Los Angeles. And the fact that Cross doesn't get his comeuppance makes him even more a creepier villain. The tragic ending was foreshadowed by many details that look even more symbolic after several viewings, Evelyn's strange spot in her eye, the moment where her falls on the horn, so we're prepared when he hear the sound again. It's those little details that make the difference.The movie ends brutally, but thanks to the perfection of Towne's script, Polanki's masterful direction and final personal touch, and a top-notch acting based on Nicholson-Dunaway-Huston triangular force, we understand the significance of ""Chinatown"", and sure after such an event, Gittes' would probably become more cynical and more apathetic, but will he really forget another Chinatown? We sure won't ...",patience attention demanding getting better after each viewing,first time i saw chinatown it looked good i liked it second time it was even better so so forth but there was always

,Very impressive,"So I finally watched one of the most iconic films ever made. The mystery and suspense in Chinatown is fully-blown as a neo-noir film. It perfectly captures the time period in which it takes place, and its central story is very well-written. The performances are fantastic, the highlight being Faye Dunaway, whose only other performance I have seen is Network and she plays both characters with such precise distinction and force. The cinematography, art direction, and music give it the right mood as well, and the ending is quite brilliant, in fact, perfect. Overall, I don't know if I would say I loved it, but this is a film I can see revisiting in the future no doubt about it.",very impressive,so i finally watched one most iconic films ever made mystery suspense chinatown is fully blown as neo noir film it perfectly captures time period which it takes place its central story is very well written performances are fantastic highlight being faye dunaway whose only other performance i have seen is network she plays both characters with such precise distinction force cinematography art direction music give it right mood as well ending is quite brilliant fact perfect overall i dont know if i would say i loved it but this is film i can see revisiting future no doubt about it,0.6436507936507937,0.3755952380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,"More multifariously tricky, you die.","This film is a masterpiece because it is nothing but what we expect and we expect something different at every single moment of it, so that we are disappointed and surprised and held breathless every fifteen minutes when one of our expectations goes down the chute. At first we think it is one more private eye's business or investigation in some kind of affair with some married man. But it does not fit at all with the professional dedication of the suspected unfaithful man. He is obviously looking for something fishy in the water supply of Los Angeles he is responsible for. But then he does meet with a girl, doesn't he after all. And yet there is something fishy in that water supply. So it might be a big embezzlement case. Let Los Angeles pay for the water they will never get and then let Los Angeles get to the water where it will be, and let them pay again. The point is it does not explain everything, and especially why the thieving contractor is so keen on getting the hooker his son in law was seeing. Too keen to be honest. Is she a hooker after all? And we go on doubting, hoping, being disappointed and never getting to the truth of the business. Who the killer really is? Who the police really work for? Who the police tries to protect and cover? Why do the police do that unprofessional act? There is just no good enough answer, and even at the end, when the tycoon contracting embezzler gets the last word we know we are off the point and losing all footing in too deep water. That's probably the best part of this film. You just have to accept the situation the way it is and do nothing just because some people are big enough, rich enough or powerful enough to do exactly what they want and everyone else has only one choice, die or say yes-sir-mister-master-sir-boss. Even killing his own child is not a no-go option for such a greedy person. Remember, change we can, but change these tycoons cannot. So better change them than expect them to change. Why not send them on a perpetual vacation in some desert island that has absolutely no connection with the outside world, But dummy, that's just the point, such a place does not exist. So better put them to death, put them to sleep or deep freeze them if you don't want to deep fry them, which stinks a little bit. But any other way will let them go on with their shaggy and dirty business. But gosh it reaps a lot of profit in.

Hollis is the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Chief Engineer, who is refusing to create a new water reservoir that he considers unsafe. Soon Gittes sees Hollis with a girl and photographs them. Then he follows Hollis, and he sees water being released from the reservoir during the night. On the next morning, his photos of Hollis are published on a newspaper but when he returns to his office, he meets the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) with her lawyer to sue him. Gittes realizes that he was deceived by someone that wanted to harm Hollis Mulwray, but soon he finds that the chief engineer was drowned in the reservoir. His further investigation shows that the water supply is disrupted to the local farmers and someone is buying the cheap lands to profit in the near future.""Chinatown"" is a neo-noir directed by Roman Polanski with a complex story of corruption and murder based on the California Water Wars that happened in the beginning of the 20th Century.

9.0,A Bit Confusing But Always Fascinating,"No sense going into a detailed review describing what this film is about because there are enough reviews already. I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on. It's not an easy to story to follow. It's also unusual: a crime story dealing with rights to water. To many people, that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California.There is nothing confusing about how this film looks. It's a treat for one's eyes, especially if you love that 1940s look, which I do. This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere: a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail.What stands out in most people's memory of this film is another odd thing: a man's nose getting sliced. Here, it's Jack Nicholson getting a ""nose job"" courtesy of some thugs. Jack, playing ""Jake Gittes,"" will forever be known (among wild roles) as the guy with a bandage on his nose, thanks to this movie. As interesting as he is, along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here.
