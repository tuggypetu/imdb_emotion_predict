10,A Masterpiece!!,"If I have to say in one word then it'd be MASTERPIECE. It can very well be a classic...a cult classic like Border. This movie doesn't portray blatant Jingoism but strikes the right chords of patriotism with maintaining the right balance. It is so well done that you'd crave for more even if it ends. Everyone performed very well and Vicky Kaushal was stunning. The movie is very inspiring and everyone especially the young generation should watch it to know what the army men do for them. The movie is not political at all but yellow media will try to demean it for 'certain' reasons. I still can't get over the top notch screenplay, direction, background scores, visuals and performances. A straight 9.5/10 (or may be 10/10 if I don't be skeptical) from me.",masterpiece,if i have say one word then itd be masterpiece it can very well be classic cult classic like border this movie doesnt portray blatant jingoism but strikes right chords patriotism with maintaining right balance it is so well done that youd crave more even if it ends everyone performed very well vicky kaushal was stunning movie is very inspiring everyone especially young generation should watch it know what army men do them movie is not political at all but yellow media will try demean it certain reasons i still cant get over top notch screenplay direction background scores visuals performances straight 9 5 10 or may be 10 10 if i dont be skeptical me,0.4633053221288515,0.1805322128851541,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.4}"

7,Thrilling and a Gripping narrative which instills patriotism without getting jingoistic.,"------Uri: The Surgical Strike Movie Review: Vicky Kaushals Sterling Performance Adds To The High Josh!Debutant director Aditya Dhar needs to be patted on his back for his well-researched work before transferring his vision on the big screen. In reality, while India and Pakistan's version of this 'surgical strike' have always differed, the film-maker mixes fiction with the facts available in public domain to present a gripping narrative about this covert operation. Without resorting to forced patriotism, the emotions flow naturally in the film.On the flip-side, the film-maker spends a little too much time in building up the drama to establish a personal connect with the characters in the first half of the film. This tends to slow down the pace of the narrative leaving you a bit dry as you eagerly wait for the action to begin.Vicky Kaushal is in a terrific form as the man in uniform and proves yet again why he is one of the best from the current crop of Gen-X actors.Mohit Raina (Mahadev-shiv) makes an impressive transition to the big screen and has a commendable screen presence.Yami Gautam's character begins on an interesting note. However, Aditya Dhar fails to explore more sides to it....yami's role is dull..!!Cinematography is neat and leaves you at the edge of your seats especially in the last 20 minutes of the film.Stefan Richter's action sequences are top-notch and well-choreographed.Every time, Vicky Kaushal's Vihaan screams, 'How's the Josh?' to his battalion of soldiers, you feel the adrenaline rush as you hear, 'Very high, Sir.'Uri manages to make your heart swell with pride for the armed forces who are always ready to sacrifice their lives for the nation.",thrilling gripping narrative which instills patriotism without getting jingoistic,uri surgical strike movie review vicky kaushals sterling performance adds high josh debutant director aditya dhar needs be patted his back his well researched work before transferring his vision big screen reality while india pakistans version this surgical strike have always differed film maker mixes fiction with facts available public domain present gripping narrative about this covert operation without resorting forced patriotism emotions flow naturally film flip side film maker spends little too much time building up drama establish personal connect with characters first half film this tends slow down pace narrative leaving you bit dry as you eagerly wait action begin vicky kaushal is terrific form as man uniform proves yet again why he is one best current crop gen x actors mohit raina mahadev shiv makes impressive transition big screen has commendable screen presence yami gautams character begins interesting note however aditya dhar fails explore more sides it yamis role is dull cinematography is neat leaves you at edge your seats especially last 20 minutes film stefan richters action sequences are top notch well choreographed every time vicky kaushals vihaan screams hows josh his battalion soldiers you feel adrenaline rush as you hear very high sir uri manages make your heart swell with pride armed forces who are always ready sacrifice their lives nation,0.40373968253968257,0.13714126984126984,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"

6,How's the Film? Okay Sir.,"Cinematically flawed yet a praiseworthy attempt to depict an event previously unheard in India's military history. Vicky Kaushal portrays the lead perfectly. Our films do project over emotional or chest thumping Army Officers but Vicky's character is a perfect blend of suppressed emotion coated with a sense of duty. His performance undoubtedly is the greatest asset of the film. Paresh Rawal's character which is based on the lines of NIA chief Ajit Doval keeps the story moving forward. Although I feel certain dialogues like ""Surgical Strike karte hain"" in a closed door meeting with the PM and other top notches or ""Halke halke badhate rahiyega"" could have been better conceived. The Drone selection scene where an intern makes the DRDO chief look like a fool and earn Paresh's compliment ""Son you may have just won us the War"" seemed to be an attempt of comic relief. But only an actor of the calibre of Paresh Rawal could have pulled it off and he did it with a natural candour.There were other plot loopholes. The main mission was made too easy. The strikes were picturesque but the climax lacked nail biting sequences. You are in the enemy's territory furtively and wiping out a selected bunch of dreaded terrorists!!! This is where a Black Hawk Down or a Hurt Locker scores. In the end the resolute of one who decided to overstay to kill the last man standing proved that after all it's Bollywood.Apart from Vicky and Rawal's performance, casting and cinematography deserves a thundering applause. Army thrillers tend to be multistarrers and hence there's always a pressure on the script to accommodate everyone's heroics. Uri is free from this defect and therefore the actors successfully become characters in the plot. Coming to the photogenic part, Uri is visually brilliant. The long range shots of valley, the stretches of Baramulla, the night scenes were wonderfully shot.Overall, definitely a one time watch.",hows film okay sir,cinematically flawed yet praiseworthy attempt depict event previously unheard indias military history vicky kaushal portrays lead perfectly our films do project over emotional or chest thumping army officers but vickys character is perfect blend suppressed emotion coated with sense duty his performance undoubtedly is greatest asset film paresh rawals character which is based lines nia chief ajit doval keeps story moving forward although i feel certain dialogues like surgical strike karte hain closed door meeting with pm other top notches or halke halke badhate rahiyega could have been better conceived drone selection scene where intern makes drdo chief look like fool earn pareshs compliment son you may have just won us war seemed be attempt comic relief but only actor calibre paresh rawal could have pulled it off he did it with natural candour there were other plot loopholes main mission was made too easy strikes were picturesque but climax lacked nail biting sequences you are enemys territory furtively wiping out selected bunch dreaded terrorists this is where black hawk down or hurt locker scores end resolute one who decided overstay kill last man standing proved that after all its bollywood apart vicky rawals performance casting cinematography deserves thundering applause army thrillers tend be multistarrers hence theres always pressure script accommodate everyones heroics uri is free this defect therefore actors successfully become characters plot coming photogenic part uri is visually brilliant long range shots valley stretches baramulla night scenes were wonderfully shot overall definitely one time watch,0.5447883597883598,0.23751322751322756,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.49}"
