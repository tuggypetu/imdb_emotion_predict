10.0,One of the Best Comedies of the Cinema History,"In 1929, in Chicago, the musicians and friends Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) flees from the night-club where they are playing during a police raid. Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the ""Saint Valentine's Day Massacre"" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.Yesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch ""Some Like it Hot"" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype.

8.0,Two musicians dressed as women join an all-girl band to escape the mobsters' vendetta,"Legendary comedy masterpiece from filmmaker Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond that Won Oscar and another 13 wins & 8 nominations . Immensely charming comedy set among Chicago and Miami , being starred by an all-star-cast . When two unemployed musicians witness a mob hit , the St Valentine massacre in Chicago carried out by mobster chief (George Raft) they flee the state in an all female band disguised as women and headed for Florida , but further complications set in. There appears a gorgeous singer , Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) , who is object of pursuit by the musicians (Jack Lemmon , Tony Curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters' retaliation . Rightly enjoyable and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun , laughters and smiles . Mordantly funny , though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however , is todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Paramount happy , the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists , including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨Running wild¨, ¨I'm through with love¨ and the immortal ¨I wanna be loved you¨. Magnificent performances from Jack Lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational Tony Curtis as a philander young , playing his Gary Gray Grant impression . Furthermore , a splendid secondary cast , a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as Pat O'Brien , George Raft , Mike Mazurski , Nehemia Persoff and , of course, smitten Joe E Brown , including his now-classic closing line . The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Some like hot¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same .",two musicians dressed as women join all girl band escape mobsters vendetta,legendary comedy masterpiece filmmaker billy wilder ial diamond that won oscar another 13 wins 8 nominations immensely charming comedy set among chicago miami being starred by all star cast when two unemployed musicians witness mob hit st valentine massacre chicago carried out by mobster chief george raft they flee state all female band disguised as women headed florida but further complications set there appears gorgeous singer sugar kane marilyn monroe who is object pursuit by musicians jack lemmon tony curtis who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women order getaway killer gangsters retaliation rightly enjoyable fun filled milestone comedy which neatly combines humor mirth entertaining situations amusement this noisy comedy is intelligently pleasingly written gives us lots fun laughters smiles mordantly funny though by time premiere was rated as bad taste some discomfort however is todays considered real classic movie billy wilder kept studio paramount happy picture consistently made money was hit at box office flawless comedy with trio sensational protagonists including unforgettable marilyn who parades sexily at her best more relaxed enticing than ever hit show is undoubtedly fetching marilyn monroe who gives one best screen acting sings marvelous songs as running wild im through with love immortal i wanna be loved you magnificent performances jack lemmon as angst ridden musician dressed drag sensational tony curtis as philander young playing his gary gray grant impression furthermore splendid secondary cast variety notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as pat obrien george raft mike mazurski nehemia persoff course smitten joe e brown including his now classic closing line motion picture was very well directed by billy wilder who includes several punchlines billy was one best directors history 1939 started partnership with charles bracket such movies as ninotchka ball fire making their film debut as such with major minor sunset boulevard was their last picture together before they split up later billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter ial diamond both them won academy award stalag 17 dealing with pow camp starred by william holden after that they wrote produced directed such classics as ace hole touching romantic comedy sabrina hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game witness prosecution two movies with great star marilyn monroe warmth seven year itch this some like hot all them include screenplays that sizzle with wit but their biggest success highpoint resulted be sour fun apartment subsequently 60s 70s duo fell headlong into pit they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as buddy buddy fedora front page secret life sherlock holmes though agreeable avanti slowed decline team had almost disappeared beneath wave bad reviews failures some like hot rating above average essential indispensable watching extremely funny riveting film completely entertaining it justly deserves its place among best comedy ever made one very funniest films all time see see again its kind movie where you know whats coming but because treatment enjoy it all same,0.5413851351351351,0.3276463963963964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,What's Not To Like?,"Some people still say this is the greatest comedy ever made in Hollywood. Who am I to argue? Even after 45 years, it's still very funny and not the least bit dated. It is one of the true classics in the history of film.I know one thing: Marilyn Monroe never looked hotter!The film is a wonderful combination of comedy, action, suspense and romance with great old-time gangster scenes played out first in Chicago and then in Miami Beach. George Raft and Nehimiah Persoff are just great as gangsters.The stars, though, are Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis but you can also enjoy performances from famous known actors like Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown. The action scenes are in the beginning and end. In the middle, the bulk of the film, is the main story featuring comedy and romance. Lemmon has the best lines in the film and his facial expressions alone evoke lots of laughter.This film is so famous that there is no need going into detail, but for some younger person reading this, don't worry about this being an old-fashioned, boring black-and-white film your parents or grandparents liked but you would find boring.

9.0,A Legendary Comedy,"With Billy Wilder's steady direction, the great casting, and Wilder/Diamond's sparkling script Some Like It Hot has become one of the most enjoyed comedies of cinema history. The story itself is pure comedy gold; the unhappy jazz-musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are witness to the St. Valentine massacre in 1929 and flees from Chicago with an all-girl-band who's headed for Miami, dressed up as ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"". Soon both are hooked on Sugar Kane (Marylin Monroe), the band's lead singer - but things gets more complicated when arrived in Miami, Daphne attracts a elderly playboy and the gangster of Chicago arrives at the Floria-hotel to have a mafia-meeting.The work of the three participants in center is truly great; Marylin Monroe is at her most sexy and charming, Tony Curtis' brilliant control and Jack Lemmon is truly priceless at his peak. The movie paces fantastically throughout opening scenes of Chicago, onto the train-ride (features fantastically funny moments of brilliant comedy timing) and arriving at the hotel in Florida, and the situations that occurs with the band, with playboy Osgood Fielding III, Marylin Monroe and the mafia. And Billy Wilder shows his talent with keeping such a sparkling screenplay brilliantly paced and edited, never rushing itself - and Wilder sneaks in some fine moments of noir with the Chicago-gangsters brutality and cruelness. And the movie is a altogether different experience as a comedy than anything before it, the absurdity and quirkiness of Curtis and Lemmon in a transvestite-comedy is fantastically funny, and the final dialog between Osgood Fielding and Daphne/Jerry seemingly came out of the blue, and surprised me just as much today as it did back in 1959.

9.0,Marilyn Monroe. Enough said.,"""Movies should be like amusement parks"" filmmaker Billy Wilder once said ""People should go to them to have fun"". So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you'll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it's hilarious! After playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of' Josephine' and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for 'Daphne'.Some Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder's directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that's not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that's the very reason it's so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it's so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! But you can't talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full's of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. Some Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!",marilyn monroe enough said,movies should be like amusement parks filmmaker billy wilder once said people should go them have fun so if some like it hot was amusement park it would thorpe park mixed with legoland added with dash disney land some like it hot is granddaddy comedies godfather laughs mike tyson punch lines heck watching this film is like getting into ring with muhammad ali as youre constantly hit with fast paced gags even when youre least expecting it youre hit with punch line so funny it leaves your side aching or piece slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running even fade out line has been regarded as funniest most famous history once you hear it youll guarantee never ever ever forget it trust me its hilarious after playing witness routine gangland shooting two penniless chicago musicians joe jerry decide it is perfect opportunity remain safe get paid easy buck when they decide take up residence all girl band heading florida crossed dressed as josephine tony curtis daphne jack lemmon but with only simple aim getting paid avoiding mob things soon get little more tricky when ditsy singer named sugar marilyn monroe captures heart josephine eccentric playboy millionaire falls daphne some like it hot is one those rare occasions where everyone involved is at very peak their powers billy wilders directing is subtle but instrumental loading every scene with comedic material ready pop out like wound up jack box writing is excellent it constantly moves at furious pace imagine usain bolt roller blades with jet pack attached his back still thats not even as fast as how dialogue rips through every scene people may say that comedy is too high concept but me thats very reason its so damn funny as well begin genius because it means that jokes will stand test time span all generations because its so easy understand anyway who likes having jokes explained them no one but you cant talk about some like it hot without mentioning tony curtis jack lemmon who were absolutely perfect their roles each adding feeling assuredness theirs as well as bucket fulls originality with every facial expression as well as every line initially i was not convinced by marilyn monroe as i felt she was slightly overrated but her role as sugar she brings lot composure role adding balance high energy tony jack but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able deliverer every air headed line with great delivery timing whilst still being able remain sweet helpless innocent even as she plunges picks into solid cube ice with great fury as she talks about her weakness saxophone players some like it hot it like magician comedy you never know what expect next as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece comedic magic it will pull out its sleeve me some like it hot is funniest comedy film i have ever seen even though it is almost 55 years old its comedy is still so accessible funny too,0.5846286169970382,0.2576408825093036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,"Billy Wilder's screwball masterpiece with Curtis, Lemmon and the immortal Marilyn handed the best comedy roles of their careers.","Admittedly biased, ""Some Like It Hot"" can certainly stand on its own merit with or without my thunderous round of applause. More than a decade ago, I had the privilege of performing both the Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon roles in ""Sugar,"" the musical adaptation of ""Some Like It Hot"" which originally starred Tony Roberts, Robert Morse and Elaine Joyce on Broadway in the 70s. Though it hardly compares to the film's original (how could it???), the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences. I can't remember ever having a better time on stage than I did with ""Sugar,"" and it's all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated it all.In the 1959 classic, Curtis and Lemmon play two ragtag musicians scraping to make ends meet in Prohibition-era Chicago during the dead of winter who accidentally eyewitness a major gangland rubout (aka the St. Valentine's Day Massacre). Barely escaping with their lives (their instruments aren't quite as lucky), our panicky twosome is forced to take it on the lam. Scared out of their shoes (sorry), the boys don heels and dresses after they connect with an all-girl orchestra tour headed for sunny Florida. Killing two birds with one stone, they figure why not go south for the winter while dodging the mob? Once they hit the coast, they'll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits. Enter a major detour in the form of luscious Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane, given one of the sexiest (yet innocent) entrances ever afforded a star. Snugly fit in flashy 'Jazz Age' threads, a blast from the locomotive's engine taunts her incredible hour-glass figure as she rushes to catch her train to Florida. The boys, stopped dead in their high-heeled tracks by this gorgeous vision, decide maybe the gig might not be so bad after all. As the totally unreliable but engagingly free-spirited vocalist/ukelele player for the band, Sugar gets instantly chummy with the ""girls"" when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze. As things progress, complications naturally set in - playboy Curtis falls for Monroe but has his ""Josephine"" guise to contend with, while Lemmon's ""Daphne"" has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire. What results is an uproarious Marx Brothers-like farce with mistaken identities, burlesque-styled antics, and a madcap chase finale, all under the exact supervision of director Billy Wilder, who also co-wrote the script. Lemmon and Curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team, you almost wish THEY ended up together! Curtis does a dead-on Cary Grant imitation while posing as a Shell Oil millionaire to impress Marilyn; Lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous Joe E. Brown (who also gets to deliver the film's blue-ribbon closing line). As for the immortal Monroe, she is at her zenith here as the bubbly, vacuous, zowie-looking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places. Despite her gold-digging instincts, Monroe's Sugar is cozy, vulnerable and altogether loveable, getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots, which include the kinetic ""Running Wild,"" the torchy ""I'm Through With Love,"" and her classic ""boop-boop-a-doop"" signature song, ""I Wanna Be Loved by You.""The film is dotted with fun, atmospheric characters.  Pat O'Brien and George Raft both get to spoof their Warner Bros. stereotypes as cop vs. gangster, Joan Shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the by-the-rules bandleader Sweet Sue, Mike Mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dim-bulbed henchman, and, if I'm not mistaken, I think that's young Billy Gray of ""Father Knows Best"" fame (the role is not listed in the credits) playing a snappy, pint-sized bellhop who comes on strong with the ""girls.""For those headscratchers who can't figure out why the so-called ""mild"" humor of ""Some Like It Hot"" is considered such a classic today, I can only presume that they have been brought up on, or excessively numbed by, the graphic, mindless toilet humor of present-day ""comedies."" There was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity - it relied on wit, timing, inventiveness and suggestion - not shock or gross-out value. It's the difference between Sid Caesar and Andrew ""Dice"" Clay; between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Chris Farley and David Spade; between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Married With Children""; between Lemmon's novel use of maracas in the hilarious ""engagement"" sequence, and Cameron Diaz's use of hair gel in a scene that ANYBODY could have made funny. Jack Lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props. While ""Some Like It Hot"" bristles with clever sexual innuendo, today's ""insult"" comedies are inundated with in-your-face sexual assault which, after awhile, gets quite tiresome -- lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. I still have hope...Having ultimate faith in my fellow film devotees, THAT is why ""Some Like It Hot"" will (and should be) considered one of THE screwball classics of all time, and why most of today's attempts will (and should be) yesterday's news.",billy wilders screwball masterpiece with curtis lemmon immortal marilyn handed best comedy roles their careers,admittedly biased some like it hot can certainly stand its own merit with or without my thunderous round applause more than decade ago i had privilege performing both tony curtis jack lemmon roles sugar musical adaptation some like it hot which originally starred tony roberts robert morse elaine joyce broadway 70s though it hardly compares films original how could it musical nevertheless is still big hit with live audiences i cant remember ever having better time stage than i did with sugar its all due irrepressible talents that instigated it all 1959 classic curtis lemmon play two ragtag musicians scraping make ends meet prohibition era chicago during dead winter who accidentally eyewitness major gangland rubout aka st valentines day massacre barely escaping with their lives their instruments arent quite as lucky our panicky twosome is forced take it lam scared out their shoes sorry boys don heels dresses after they connect with all girl orchestra tour headed sunny florida killing two birds with one stone they figure why not go south winter while dodging mob once they hit coast theyll ditch both band their humiliating outfits enter major detour form luscious marilyn monroe as sugar kane given one sexiest yet innocent entrances ever afforded star snugly fit flashy jazz age threads blast locomotives engine taunts her incredible hour glass figure as she rushes catch her train florida boys stopped dead their high heeled tracks by this gorgeous vision decide maybe gig might not be so bad after all as totally unreliable but engagingly free spirited vocalist ukelele player band sugar gets instantly chummy with girls when they cover her after getting caught with flask booze as things progress complications naturally set playboy curtis falls monroe but has his josephine guise contend with while lemmons daphne has deal with persistently amorous attentions handsy older millionaire what results is uproarious marx brothers like farce with mistaken identities burlesque styled antics madcap chase finale all under exact supervision director billy wilder who also co wrote script lemmon curtis pull off silly shenanigans with customary flair are such great team you almost wish they ended up together curtis does dead cary grant imitation while posing as shell oil millionaire impress marilyn lemmon induces campy hilarity his scenes with lecherous joe e brown who also gets deliver films blue ribbon closing line as immortal monroe she is at her zenith here as bubbly vacuous zowie looking flapper looking love all wrong places despite her gold digging instincts monroes sugar is cozy vulnerable altogether loveable getting lot mileage too out her solo singing spots which include kinetic running wild torchy im through with love her classic boop boop doop signature song i wanna be loved by you film is dotted with fun atmospheric characters pat obrien george raft both get spoof their warner bros stereotypes as cop vs gangster joan shawlee shows off bit her stinger as by rules bandleader sweet sue mike mazurki overplays delightfully archetypal dim bulbed henchman if im not mistaken i think thats young billy gray father knows best fame role is not listed credits playing snappy pint sized bellhop who comes strong with girls those headscratchers who cant figure out why so called mild humor some like it hot is considered such classic today i can only presume that they have been brought up or excessively numbed by graphic mindless toilet humor present day comedies there was time when going laugh had subtlety purity it relied wit timing inventiveness suggestion not shock or gross out value its difference between sid caesar andrew dice clay between tony curtis jack lemmon chris farley david spade between i love lucy married with children between lemmons novel use maracas hilarious engagement sequence cameron diazs use hair gel scene that anybody could have made funny jack lemmon could do more with pair maracas than most actors today could do with whole roomful props while some like it hot bristles with clever sexual innuendo todays insult comedies are inundated with your face sexual assault which after awhile gets quite tiresome lacking any kind finesse leaving absolutely nothing imagination i still have hope having ultimate faith my fellow film devotees that is why some like it hot will should be considered one screwball classics all time why most todays attempts will should be yesterdays news,0.5531133540372671,0.16506140598531902,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Many have tried but few have succeeded in coming close to matching it.,"There are four Oscar worthy performances in this Billy Wilder comedy classic. Marilyn, Jack, Tony and Joe all shine in the beaches of Florida where sweet Sue and her band, featuring luscious Miss Monroe and two real dogs perform in an all female band.

Everything in this gem of a movie had been thought so cleverly and as it turned out so prophetically, that the world of our three characters, a world of prohibition and gang wars could be today and more than likely will be tomorrow.

10.0,An outrageous and hilarious comedy.,"Billy Wilder goes the limits in this outrageous and very funny comedy about two musicians going undercover as women to avoid the mob. It is a ridiculous premise, but Wilder and Diamond's script perfectly balances the comedy with scenes of love and romance. Curtis and Monroe have great chemistry together, and Lemmon is superb as the comedy relief in the ""serious"" scenes with George Raft. Even these are something to laugh at, but the film is not to be taken seriously; just to be laughed at. It has been almost fifty years since it was released and people still laugh at it. I have seen it three or four times and it is still as funny as seeing it for the first time. That is the true test of a comedy and Some Like It Hot passes with flying colors.

8.0,Jell-O on Springs,"Greetings again from the darkness. Billy Wilder's classic was the latest in the comedy series sponsored by Dallas Film Society and Dallas Morning News. It is almost always ranked as one of the top comedy films of all-time, and often the best ever. While that's a bit higher than I would rank it, there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place in cinematic history. To fully understand the impact of the film, it helps to remind yourself of the times ... it was filmed more than 50 years ago. What we might call tame today, was incredibly risqué and daring for the times.What really stands out while watching the film is just what an incredible screen presence Marilyn Monroe possessed. It is quite challenging to take your eyes off her during any of her scenes. I am at a loss to come up with any other actor or actress who even comes close to this level of camera-cornering. Greta Garbo and Marlon Brando were great, but Marilyn is transcendent while on screen. Of course, the reports of her personal issues are legendary. Supposedly on this film, she was constantly 2-3 hours late, couldn't remember her lines and had to be coddled by all involved. Still, the final product is stunning and director Billy Wilder understood that no other actress could be substituted. Sadly, Marilyn only made two more films and was dead 3 years after this film was released.As wonderful as Marilyn is, this is really the story of Joe and Jerry, or Josephine and Daphne, or even Junior. Those five characters are all played with crackling comedy timing by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. Lemmon, as Daphne, is especially terrific as he tango's the night away with Osgood Fielding III (played by Joe E Brown). Curtis is at his best when courting Marilyn's Sugar Kane while sporting his Cary Grant impersonation and driving the boat backwards.There are so many classic comedy moments in this film, and though it is based on a 1935 French farce titled Fanfare d'Amour, Wilder and his co-writer and frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond made it their own by adding the gangster story line. Seeing notorious movie bad guy George Raft tied to the 1929 Chicago St Valentine's Day Massacre adds a dimension that many writers/directors would be unable to handle. Instead, Wilder adds his frenetic dialogue and mixes in some wild double-entendre's, a touch of Marx Brothers, and the sensuous singing of Marilyn to deliver a world class comedy.The Florida scenes were filmed at the historical Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, which remains a very popular resort location even today. Marilyn sings ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" and ""I'm Through With Love"" in such a way that her character's naivety adds a dimension that breaks the heart of Joe (Curtis) and mesmerizes the viewer. Billy Wilder is certainly one of the Hollywood giants and delivered such classics as Sunset Blvd, The Apartment, Irma laDouce, and Witness for the Prosecution. His excellence spans numerous film genres, and we admire his patience and proficiency in juggling the issues required to pull off Some Like it Hot ... and avoid the fuzzy end of the lollipop.",jell o springs,greetings again darkness billy wilders classic was latest comedy series sponsored by dallas film society dallas morning news it is almost always ranked as one top comedy films all time often best ever while thats bit higher than i would rank it there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place cinematic history fully understand impact film it helps remind yourself times it was filmed more than 50 years ago what we might call tame today was incredibly risqu daring times what really stands out while watching film is just what incredible screen presence marilyn monroe possessed it is quite challenging take your eyes off her during any her scenes i am at loss come up with any other actor or actress who even comes close this level camera cornering greta garbo marlon brando were great but marilyn is transcendent while screen course reports her personal issues are legendary supposedly this film she was constantly 2 3 hours late couldnt remember her lines had be coddled by all involved still final product is stunning director billy wilder understood that no other actress could be substituted sadly marilyn only made two more films was dead 3 years after this film was released as wonderful as marilyn is this is really story joe jerry or josephine daphne or even junior those five characters are all played with crackling comedy timing by tony curtis jack lemmon lemmon as daphne is especially terrific as he tangos night away with osgood fielding iii played by joe e brown curtis is at his best when courting marilyns sugar kane while sporting his cary grant impersonation driving boat backwards there are so many classic comedy moments this film though it is based 1935 french farce titled fanfare damour wilder his co writer frequent collaborator i l diamond made it their own by adding gangster story line seeing notorious movie bad guy george raft tied 1929 chicago st valentines day massacre adds dimension that many writers directors would be unable handle instead wilder adds his frenetic dialogue mixes some wild double entendres touch marx brothers sensuous singing marilyn deliver world class comedy florida scenes were filmed at historical hotel del coronado san diego which remains very popular resort location even today marilyn sings i wanna be loved by you im through with love such way that her characters naivety adds dimension that breaks heart joe curtis mesmerizes viewer billy wilder is certainly one hollywood giants delivered such classics as sunset blvd apartment irma ladouce witness prosecution his excellence spans numerous film genres we admire his patience proficiency juggling issues required pull off some like it hot avoid fuzzy end lollipop,0.5621848739495799,0.21492063492063487,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,The funniest movie ever made?,"One of the all time great screen comedies, Some Like It Hot stars Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon at their best. Billy Wilder, one of the all time great directors, co-wrote and directed this fantastic movie.Set in 1929, Lemmon and Curtis are out of work musicians who witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Fleeing for their lives, they disguise themselves as female musicians in order to get to Florida and away from the mob. This is where the fun begins.Renamed ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" they try their best to keep their secret. But when ""Josephine""(Curtis) meets sexy ukulele player Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) you know he's going to blow his cover somehow. While Curtis tries to woo Monroe by pretending to be her dream man as she has told him, Lemmon is courted by Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown). Curtis adapts a Cary Grant accent and pretends to be frigid in the movie's funniest scenes. Lemmon seems to forget he's a boy and has so much fun with Fielding and adores the things he buys him. Between the cases of mistaken and pretend identities, the mobsters come to Florida for their Opera Lovers Meeting. It all winds up with a hilarious ending.This movie is a gem from start to finish. Curtis, Monroe, and Brown are great in their parts. Monroe brings a funny and sexy vulnerability to Sugar and Curtis is great with his performance as ""Josephine"" and the stuffy millionaire who talks just like Cary Grant. Lemmon really steals the movie here. He invests Daphne with such enthusiasm that we can understand why he's falling for Osgood. He's having way too much fun and it's great to watch him.

8.0,Some Like It Hot - The Classical Comedy,"There is always a thing about Classics, even before you absorb the first frame; you are burdened with huge expectations. But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.I feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.I am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.The manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.Some Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back.",some like it hot classical comedy,there is always thing about classics even before you absorb first frame you are burdened with huge expectations but some like it hot is one those jet planes where you got tight your seat belt forget everything else enjoy joyride or you would fall off your seat i feel casting movie is one most under discussed elements movie making amongst general public but it plays very significant role success movie slih is prime example it apart jack lemmon none protagonists were known their superior acting skills they would not have made cut billy wilder piece but retrospect who other than tony curtis who had boyish look at same time possessed sharp features could have played saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress be part woman band you can only get flawless performance bad actor only if he she is playing himself herself that is exact reason why marilyn monroe wows you every scene some like it hot she is playing dumb vivacious vulnerable damsel who can sing doesnt mind sleeping with charming guy whenever she gets chance then dips herself whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself jack lemmon with broad muscular jawline was surely one who had better chance getting caught as someone not right clothes but that is very small price pay as actor his caliber was indispensable cause slih he has amazing sense timing when it comes humor he is almost chaplinesque when it comes expressions confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at top stack i am not sure when was concept black humor introduced world cinema but slih has be one better examples old times where black humor is integrated comedy black humor is there only make its presence felt nothing more other than that slih is fun filled journey gerald lemmon joseph curtis two musicians run dangerous chicago gangsters who are after their lives they find their safe house all woman band that is off florida string performances this is where they meet gorgeous sugar marilyn try their luck flattering her it is all about how joseph manages get ahead race gerald like true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by joseph this is what makes slih sweet necessary salt is added movie by little moments like women having party train sugar hiding whiskey her stocking fielding joe brown hitting dalphe gerald disguised as woman further complications that set because these what makes this classical comedy special is fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using chaos technique when it doesnt make you laugh it makes you smile most importantly movie stays with you manner which movie begins it suddenly makes you wonder thats too much real car chasing shooting black white movie 40s then you realize its done 1959 movie was intentionally produced black white first scene itself is cracker will create cocktail emotions with words like liquor crime party death music all floating around at same time there are plenty scenes where camera pans out one object another capturing multiple things with different moods complexion same scene that is technique which i guess wasnt used quite frequently back then make up job curtis lemmon is too good those times it would have been so important that have been correctly done as that is absolutely central whole plot marilyns costumes are way modern she carries them effortlessly some like it hot is without any doubt classic but probably no other movie would have last line played such important role as this finishing frames where joe brown utters unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised i am sure it would have had far better impact audience 50 years back,0.5104014690982774,0.16015704154002025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,A lot of fun and one of the best final lines in film history...,"This is a wonderfully entertaining film that has to have one of the best final scenes in movie history--seeing Joe E. Brown and Jack Lemmon in this scene is truly delightful. However, I do wonder if perhaps, maybe, the film is a tiny bit overrated--especially since it is now ranked relatively high on IMDb's Top 250 list. It's an exceptional film...I just don't see it as quite THAT exceptional.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon stumble upon a mob hit. And, since mobsters really DON'T like witnesses, they know they'd better hide--and quick. So they hit upon the idea of hiding in an all-ladies' band, as they, too, are musicians. There, Tony falls in love with Marilyn Monroe--and it's hard for him to balance his female persona with the bookish guy he also pretends to be to impress her. As for Jack, he becomes the focus of a rich older man's attentions (Joe E. Brown). So how do they both balance these relationships with a strong desire NOT to be killed by the mob? The film has some nice supporting acting by George Raft and Pat O'Brien-and it's nice to see them return to films. As for the acting, it's generally very good, though I think Curtis' acting is a bit broad at times--but oddly charming as well.Overall, there's a lot to enjoy and it's fun throughout.",lot fun one best final lines film history,this is wonderfully entertaining film that has have one best final scenes movie history seeing joe e brown jack lemmon this scene is truly delightful however i do wonder if perhaps maybe film is tiny bit overrated especially since it is now ranked relatively high imdbs top 250 list its exceptional film i just dont see it as quite that exceptional tony curtis jack lemmon stumble upon mob hit since mobsters really dont like witnesses they know theyd better hide quick so they hit upon idea hiding all ladies band as they too are musicians there tony falls love with marilyn monroe its hard him balance his female persona with bookish guy he also pretends be impress her as jack he becomes focus rich older mans attentions joe e brown so how do they both balance these relationships with strong desire not be killed by mob film has some nice supporting acting by george raft pat obrien its nice see them return films as acting its generally very good though i think curtis acting is bit broad at times but oddly charming as well overall theres lot enjoy its fun throughout,0.5140972222222221,0.32173611111111117,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,A gender-bending comedy ahead of its time,"What Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis do in ""Some Like it Hot"" would be par for the course in modern movies  every other month, similar fish-out-of-water movies premiere with men posing as women (""Tootsie""), women posing as men (""The Associate""), black people posing as white people (""White Chicks""), and on and on. What makes ""Some Like it Hot"" different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.Lemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, ""Junior"", in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).Tying the pair's story into the Chicago Valentine's Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).The movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women's jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis' and Lemmon's identities. The movie's surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie's creation.

8.0,Had me in stitches,"This is the first Marilyn Monroe movie that I have seen and I must say that I thought it was quite funny. Monroe, though, doesn't have the screen presence that most people seem to claim that she has. In fact, I wasn't really sure if it was her when she first appeared. Okay, this movie is more focused on Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, and they actually have more presence than she does, but she does stand out.Lemmon and Curtis play a couple of musicians, Joe and Jerry, who watch a gangland killing, and after escaping with their lives, they dress up as women, becoming Josephine and Daphne, and join a band going to Miami. On the way Joe falls in love with the singer, Sugar Kane, (Monroe) and Daphne ends up gaining the unwanted attention of a dizzy millionaire.The comedy in this movie actually has a lot of sexual innuendos, and in my opinion, is far superior to that of Tootsie. In a way the plot is similar, and the problems that the characters in both movies encounter are also the same, but the difference is that I feel that the comedy in Some Like it Hot is executed much better than it was in Tootsie. In a way, Tootsie seemed to be a comedy with a message that became far too preachy, while Some Like it Hot is a farcical romp in which two men try to hide the fact that they are not women from a lot of other people.",had me stitches,this is first marilyn monroe movie that i have seen i must say that i thought it was quite funny monroe though doesnt have screen presence that most people seem claim that she has fact i wasnt really sure if it was her when she first appeared okay this movie is more focused jack lemmon tony curtis they actually have more presence than she does but she does stand out lemmon curtis play couple musicians joe jerry who watch gangland killing after escaping with their lives they dress up as women becoming josephine daphne join band going miami way joe falls love with singer sugar kane monroe daphne ends up gaining unwanted attention dizzy millionaire comedy this movie actually has lot sexual innuendos my opinion is far superior that tootsie way plot is similar problems that characters both movies encounter are also same but difference is that i feel that comedy some like it hot is executed much better than it was tootsie way tootsie seemed be comedy with message that became far too preachy while some like it hot is farcical romp which two men try hide fact that they are not women lot other people,0.5724537037037037,0.24479166666666663,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,An Archetype... That's Pretty Great,"""Some Like It Hot"" is hard to explain. The film, if you've never seen it, is going to feel like something you've seen a hundred times before. And you probably have, but they did it first. To be successful, two guys dress up as women, and then one falls for a woman (Marilyn Monroe) -- so how does he tell her without her hating him for keeping the secret? We have seen plenty of films where guys get close to women because of some trick -- usually innocently -- and then have to inevitably reveal the truth. And sometimes this involves cross-dressing. I think it's safe to say that ""Some Like it Hot"" was the first film to play this plot, especially with the cross-dressing.This film is funny, to be sure, and has a very nice innocence to it in that it seems pretty obvious to the audience that the women are men. The broad shoulders, the weird bumps while wearing a swimsuit? How the girls don't catch on is beyond me. And then to not recognize the guys while in male clothing... wow.",archetype thats pretty great,some like it hot is hard explain film if youve never seen it is going feel like something youve seen hundred times before you probably have but they did it first be successful two guys dress up as women then one falls woman marilyn monroe so how does he tell her without her hating him keeping secret we have seen plenty films where guys get close women because some trick usually innocently then have inevitably reveal truth sometimes this involves cross dressing i think its safe say that some like it hot was first film play this plot especially with cross dressing this film is funny be sure has very nice innocence it that it seems pretty obvious audience that women are men broad shoulders weird bumps while wearing swimsuit how girls dont catch is beyond me then not recognize guys while male clothing wow,0.6795717592592593,0.18961805555555555,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Still fresh after almost sixty years,"Opening in 1929 in Chicago musicians Joe and Jerry witness a mob assassination, committed by Spats Colombo, so have to go on the run. There are jobs with a band that is heading to Miami... there is just one catch; they are all girls. By the time the train is ready to head south Joe and Jerry have become Josephine and Daphne. On the journey they get to know the other girls and as Joe talks to singer Sugar and learns how she hopes to meet a bespectacled millionaire with a yacht rather than the usual succession on no-good saxophone players (Joe plays the Sax). Once in Miami sets about becoming just that man while a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III, is attracted to Jerry's 'Daphne'! If that weren't enough Spats is in in town for a mob conference.This film may be in black and white and almost sixty years old but don't let that put you off; it is still fresh and very funny. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great as 'Josephine' and 'Daphne'; they may not be the most beautiful of women but they do at least look feminine enough that one can believe they would be mistaken for women. Marilyn Monroe is on top form as Sugar; particularly in the scenes were she is wooed by Joe's 'Shell Oil Jnr' persona. The laughs come thick and fast combining elements of farce and slapstick. One might worry that 'fifties morality' would be a problem but the attitudes are far more modern than one might expect. Overall I'd definitely say this film is a must see.",still fresh after almost sixty years,opening 1929 chicago musicians joe jerry witness mob assassination committed by spats colombo so have go run there are jobs with band that is heading miami there is just one catch they are all girls by time train is ready head south joe jerry have become josephine daphne journey they get know other girls as joe talks singer sugar learns how she hopes meet bespectacled millionaire with yacht rather than usual succession no good saxophone players joe plays sax once miami sets about becoming just that man while real millionaire osgood fielding iii is attracted jerrys daphne if that werent enough spats is town mob conference this film may be black white almost sixty years old but dont let that put you off it is still fresh very funny tony curtis jack lemmon are great as josephine daphne they may not be most beautiful women but they do at least look feminine enough that one can believe they would be mistaken women marilyn monroe is top form as sugar particularly scenes were she is wooed by joes shell oil jnr persona laughs come thick fast combining elements farce slapstick one might worry that fifties morality would be problem but attitudes are far more modern than one might expect overall id definitely say this film is must see,0.49523809523809526,0.13571428571428573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,legendary comedy genius,"SPOILERS Each year a television executive ponders how to fill an evening's television. Rather than putting original thought into the process, one idea that he constantly comes back to is the ""Top 10"" list. Spending hours upon hours discussing the best horrors, the best musicals, the best number ones of the 1980s, these lists vary amongst a million different ideas. One of the most popular though is the Top 100 Films of All Time. This list tends to contain some of the all time greats and all too often it sadly has ""Star Wars"" at number one. One film which always features though, and remains perhaps the funniest comedy of all time is Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"". With magical performances and some of the greatest comedy moments of all time, it remains as fresh today as it did upon it's release.Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) are down and broke musicians in alcohol free Chicago. As the Mafia continue to fight between themselves, life goes on for our two heroes. That is until they witness a Gangland killing. Now on the run, they disguise themselves as women and hide in a female band troop. Relocated to Florida, the two spend their time keeping themselves hidden and talking to the beautiful, yet ""not too smart"" Sugar Cane (Marilyn Monroe).Unlucky to have been released at the same time as the Epic ""Ben Hur"", it might be one of the biggest travesties in Oscar history that ""Some Like It Hot"" never received a Best Picture nomination. It did however receives nods for Wilder's direction and Lemmon's acting. Lemmon in particular is superb as Jerry/Daphne, the more emotional of the two men, who finds himself being chased by the dozy Osgood Fielding III (Joe E Brown). With some of the best lines in the film, Lemmon thrives, and on a personal note, he's only outperformed this performance with ""Avanti"" and ""The Odd Couple"", the first of which being another Wilder creation.This film also has another treasure about it. In a time where Hollywood starlets are making a bit of a reappearance, it's amusing that one or two of them (most notably Scarlett Johansson) model their appearance on the biggest starlet of them all. Whilst noticeably more built up during this film (being pregnant at the time), Marilyn Monroe is beautiful from the first scene on the train station through to the end. Monroe simply oozes beauty and thrives in a role which she wasn't originally the choice for.Perhaps the crucial thing about ""Some Like It Hot"" is just how good the script is. With lines which just smack of sexual referencing, it causes belly laughs throughout. It never resorts to the sort of lowbrow humour of most of our modern comedy, and it demonstrates how light hearted comedy should be done. It's perhaps the finest comedy film of all time, and it should be mandatory viewing for any film fan.",legendary comedy genius,spoilers each year television executive ponders how fill evenings television rather than putting original thought into process one idea that he constantly comes back is top 10 list spending hours upon hours discussing best horrors best musicals best number ones 1980s these lists vary amongst million different ideas one most popular though is top 100 films all time this list tends contain some all time greats all too often it sadly has star wars at number one one film which always features though remains perhaps funniest comedy all time is billy wilders some like it hot with magical performances some greatest comedy moments all time it remains as fresh today as it did upon its release joe jerry tony curtis jack lemmon are down broke musicians alcohol free chicago as mafia continue fight between themselves life goes our two heroes that is until they witness gangland killing now run they disguise themselves as women hide female band troop relocated florida two spend their time keeping themselves hidden talking beautiful yet not too smart sugar cane marilyn monroe unlucky have been released at same time as epic ben hur it might be one biggest travesties oscar history that some like it hot never received best picture nomination it did however receives nods wilders direction lemmons acting lemmon particular is superb as jerry daphne more emotional two men who finds himself being chased by dozy osgood fielding iii joe e brown with some best lines film lemmon thrives personal note hes only outperformed this performance with avanti odd couple first which being another wilder creation this film also has another treasure about it time where hollywood starlets are making bit reappearance its amusing that one or two them most notably scarlett johansson model their appearance biggest starlet them all whilst noticeably more built up during this film being pregnant at time marilyn monroe is beautiful first scene train station through end monroe simply oozes beauty thrives role which she wasnt originally choice perhaps crucial thing about some like it hot is just how good script is with lines which just smack sexual referencing it causes belly laughs throughout it never resorts sort lowbrow humour most our modern comedy it demonstrates how light hearted comedy should be done its perhaps finest comedy film all time it should be mandatory viewing any film fan,0.5655360886492963,0.36840371368673247,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Snappy and hilarious,"It isn't the first time men were in drag on the screen and certainly not the last, but surely it must be the funniest example.I'll skip the plot and just make a few offhand observations. One is that the writers put a near-perfect polish on this script. They didn't simply throw gags and comic situations into the story hoping they would all add up to a funny movie. Instead they worked running gags into the dialog. Some of them are so utterly without symbolic -- or even sensible -- content that they become in themselves sidesplitting. ""Type O blood."" It must come up half a dozen times in outrageously irrelevant contexts.And one that took me at least ten viewings to catch. I will now spell it out in case anyone out there is as dull as I've been. Near the beginning, when Joe and Jerry are still Joe and Jerry, Joe pitches some woo to Nellie Wymeyer in order to borrow her car, a Hupmobile 1929. An hour into the film, long after this brief exchange has been forgotten, Josephine has cornered Sugar on ""his"" yacht and explains to her the origin of his impotence. It's an imaginative and tragic tale. It seems he met his only true love at the Grand Canyon. She was as blind as he was. They stood together on the edge of the highest cliff. He took off his glasses. She took off her glasses. He took a step towards her. She took a step towards him. ""Oh, no!"" cries Sugar. ""Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up -- by mule."" That's not the running gag though. The running gag is that while Josephine is improvising this blatantly phony yarn, making it up as he goes along, free associating, he mentions that the girl he loved was named Nellie and that her father was president of Hupmobile. Absolutely nothing more is made of the connection between Nellie Wymeyer's Hupmobile and this baloney Josephine is slicing -- in fact he skips rather blithely over it.I don't think I'll give away any other gags, which means I can't really describe the movie in any detail.But mention should be made of the score and the arrangements of the contemporary tunes, for which I guess Adolph Deutsch is responsible. They're wacky when that's called for and sweet in an old-fashioned way when ballads are required. ""Stairway to the Stars"" has never sounded so romantic, and ""I'm Through With Love"" more wistful. (Catch the key change after Monroe finishes singing.) The underscore is remarkable too -- a frenetic combination of bass and tenor saxophone. (What else?) Monroe seems a bit thick waisted but it doesn't detract from her sex appeal because she's so Hollywood gorgeous. That transparent dress she almost has on during her love scene with Tony Curtis doesn't dampen her appeal either.The two male leads give unimpeachable performances. I know Tony Curtis has often been criticized for his ""mannerisms"" and his accent but they fit his character well enough in the Bing Crosby part, while Jack Lemon couldn't be improved upon in the Bob Hope part of the continually hoodwinked, constantly cackling breathlessly. All the supports are just about right too. Sid Polyakoff -- ""Spielt mit der PhilharMONic!"" And where on this planet did casting find all those goons who play George Raft's companions. ""These are my lawyers. All Harvard men."" Those FACES.I can't find anything bad to say about the movie. It's funny from beginning to end.

9.0,Marilyn Monroe and her bosom companions!,"''Some Like It Hot'' is the best movie with Marilyn Monroe already made! When I was deciding which movie from Marilyn's box I was going to watch, ''Some Like it Hot'' was the one which I payed less attention of them: the cover is not beautiful as ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes '' or ''How to Marry a Millionaire'' and the fact that the movie was black and white made it less appealing to me. Anyway, I decided to watch and I don't regret it at all: I had a lot of fun with the story!:) ( And by the way, I saw how handsome Jamie Lee Curtis' father, Tony Curtis, was.)Joe and Jerry are friends and musicians. They two are broke and needing to pay their bills, so they go to almost all opportunities of a job they can get. One day, when they decided to take a job in a very distant place, they become witnesses of a massacre,leaded by Spats Colombo, a guy from the Italian Mafia. The problem is that Spats and his gang noticed that Jerry and Joe were there, and now they are hunting both musicians to kill them. Needing to hide, Joe and Jerry decided to cover their identity, and they both dress up like women: Joe becomes Josephine and Jerry becomes Daphne, and they get a job in a women's band. Once they arrive in Miami, many problems and confusions starts to happen, since Joe is using two identities (one as ''shell junior', the millionaire, to make Sugar fall for him)and Jerry is having problems with a rich old man who is in love with ''Daphne''.To make things worst, the mafia came to Miami as well.",marilyn monroe her bosom companions,some like it hot is best movie with marilyn monroe already made when i was deciding which movie marilyns box i was going watch some like it hot was one which i payed less attention them cover is not beautiful as gentlemen prefer blondes or how marry millionaire fact that movie was black white made it less appealing me anyway i decided watch i dont regret it at all i had lot fun with story by way i saw how handsome jamie lee curtis father tony curtis was joe jerry are friends musicians they two are broke needing pay their bills so they go almost all opportunities job they can get one day when they decided take job very distant place they become witnesses massacre leaded by spats colombo guy italian mafia problem is that spats his gang noticed that jerry joe were there now they are hunting both musicians kill them needing hide joe jerry decided cover their identity they both dress up like women joe becomes josephine jerry becomes daphne they get job womens band once they arrive miami many problems confusions starts happen since joe is using two identities one as shell junior millionaire make sugar fall him jerry is having problems with rich old man who is love with daphne make things worst mafia came miami as well,0.4873148148148148,0.12333333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
