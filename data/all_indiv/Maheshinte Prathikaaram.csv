8.0,A Delightful Work Of Art. ♦ Grade B+,"This is the first Malayalam film after Drishyam (2013) where some of the audience got up and applauded during the end credits. And the another great thing about this sweet little dramedy is that an evening show in the cinema theater (INOX) was houseful, which is a rare occurrence in Mumbai.Mahesh (Faasil) is a small-time photographer who lives with his aging father in a town located in the hilly district of Idukki in Kerala. In love with a girl (Anusree) whom he wishes to marry and settle down with, things are going generally good for Mahesh until when he fatefully gets involved in an unrelated street fight, ultimately gifting him a black eye and several bruises along with ounces of shame for having been beaten up by a nobody in front of his own people in the middle of the town where his studio sits. What follows is an unabashed intention of seeking vengeance, but has Mahesh got the balls?The most interesting element about the film is inarguably the butterfly effect which causes the street fight. And watching it unfold is the most delightful thing you will see in a Malayalam film all year. How Mahesh gathers courage to find the guy who beat him up and to retaliate just to show that he's a man with dignity. Aggressive as it may sound, the screenplay is nothing but comic. The humor timing is perfect, and with the characters delivering one crispy dialogue after another, you will surely roll down the aisle laughing. The first act is full of genuine and creative comedy, while the second act takes a virulent turn but still keeping us hooked. By virulent, do not visualize gore or violence, but Mahesh's audacity to challenge his nemesis as he prepares to fight him and settle scores.The film even teaches you two or more things about love and photography (or any profession for that matter), educating you that if you move forward with your heart and wait for the right time, things WILL happen in your favor.What a person goes through when life turns upside down and when reality hits that one is nothing but a loser in life is the central theme of the film. How Mahesh bounces back is a pleasure to watch. Faasil is fantastic as he plays the typecast role with great finesse. Happy to see Anusree climbing up the ladder, and lesser-known Aparna Balamurali doing a good job. However, it is not because of the performance of one or two cast members that the film ejects pleasure bulbs, but because of how well the supporting cast have been directed. Soubin Shahir is amazing, no doubt.The use of silence between and during the sequences is another highlight of the film as the story maneuvers between comedy, drama, romance, and thrills. Nicely composed songs and fine camera work drives the 2-hour long film into a palpable work of art. Special mention for the titles and a sorta ambiguous ending, providing the audience a sugary taste in the mouth to relish the whole subject later.BOTTOM LINE: Débutante Dileesh Pothan's Maheshinte Prathikaaram is a highly entertaining comedy drama that will make you rave about it to your friends just because you can go watch it again with them. Worth the ticket price.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",delightful work art grade b,this is first malayalam film after drishyam 2013 where some audience got up applauded during end credits another great thing about this sweet little dramedy is that evening show cinema theater inox was houseful which is rare occurrence mumbai mahesh faasil is small time photographer who lives with his aging father town located hilly district idukki kerala love with girl anusree whom he wishes marry settle down with things are going generally good mahesh until when he fatefully gets involved unrelated street fight ultimately gifting him black eye several bruises along with ounces shame having been beaten up by nobody front his own people middle town where his studio sits what follows is unabashed intention seeking vengeance but has mahesh got balls most interesting element about film is inarguably butterfly effect which causes street fight watching it unfold is most delightful thing you will see malayalam film all year how mahesh gathers courage find guy who beat him up retaliate just show that hes man with dignity aggressive as it may sound screenplay is nothing but comic humor timing is perfect with characters delivering one crispy dialogue after another you will surely roll down aisle laughing first act is full genuine creative comedy while second act takes virulent turn but still keeping us hooked by virulent do not visualize gore or violence but maheshs audacity challenge his nemesis as he prepares fight him settle scores film even teaches you two or more things about love photography or any profession that matter educating you that if you move forward with your heart wait right time things will happen your favor what person goes through when life turns upside down when reality hits that one is nothing but loser life is central theme film how mahesh bounces back is pleasure watch faasil is fantastic as he plays typecast role with great finesse happy see anusree climbing up ladder lesser known aparna balamurali doing good job however it is not because performance one or two cast members that film ejects pleasure bulbs but because how well supporting cast have been directed soubin shahir is amazing no doubt use silence between during sequences is another highlight film as story maneuvers between comedy drama romance thrills nicely composed songs fine camera work drives 2 hour long film into palpable work art special mention titles sorta ambiguous ending providing audience sugary taste mouth relish whole subject later bottom line d butante dileesh pothans maheshinte prathikaaram is highly entertaining comedy drama that will make you rave about it your friends just because you can go watch it again with them worth ticket price can be watched with typical indian family yes,0.5376609763402216,0.3095350404312669,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,A perfect movie experience,"""Maheshinte Prathikaaram"", what else could fit for a revenge drama other than this title? Maheshinte Prathikaaram is a portrait of Mahesh and everything related to Mahesh. A place playing a prominent role in a movie is something rare. And only few directors tried to do so, like Rajiv Ravi did in ""Annayum Rasoolum"" and "" Njan Steve Lopez"". Here, director Dhileesh Pothan also presented ""Idukki"" as a main Character.The primary aim of Maheshinte Prathikaaram is to make people laugh. Comedy is the main ingredient here. But, sometimes it is romantic. Sometimes very thrilling. The makers didn't used anything artificial to make us laugh, all the comedies were very realistic and situational. I felt a freshness in the presentation of this film. All the technical departments raced in the same pace. Shyju Khalid's photography, Bijibal's music and Saiju Sreedharan's editing, all these acted with mutual understanding and mutual respect. 100 marks for these departments.I have no more words to praise the performance of the cast. Fahadh Faasil played the lead character Mahesh with such an ease. No doubt he's the best actor among the youngsters in the industry. He's an actor with tremendous potential. The Soubin - Alancier combo just made the theater hall crazy. Anusree also did a great job. All the actors in this film just rocked.Maheshinte Prathikaaram is the best Malayalam movie released this year so far.",perfect movie experience,maheshinte prathikaaram what else could fit revenge drama other than this title maheshinte prathikaaram is portrait mahesh everything related mahesh place playing prominent role movie is something rare only few directors tried do so like rajiv ravi did annayum rasoolum njan steve lopez here director dhileesh pothan also presented idukki as main character primary aim maheshinte prathikaaram is make people laugh comedy is main ingredient here but sometimes it is romantic sometimes very thrilling makers didnt used anything artificial make us laugh all comedies were very realistic situational i felt freshness presentation this film all technical departments raced same pace shyju khalids photography bijibals music saiju sreedharans editing all these acted with mutual understanding mutual respect 100 marks these departments i have no more words praise performance cast fahadh faasil played lead character mahesh with such ease no doubt hes best actor among youngsters industry hes actor with tremendous potential soubin alancier combo just made theater hall crazy anusree also did great job all actors this film just rocked maheshinte prathikaaram is best malayalam movie released this year so far,0.5696428571428572,0.19761904761904758,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.49}"
,"The simple life, as you like it","A veritable breath of fresh air, this has to be one of the more hilarious movies I've seen in a long time, especially one that does not think you have to make things dumb in order to make your audience laugh. Thematically speaking, this has more to do with something of a butterfly effect, where the director actually shows something like that in motion for the audience to get used to how he plans to use it to propel the movie forward, and then goes and does it. Kind of dumbing-down a concept, but that's not the sound of me complaining, especially since the 1st instance of that is a veritable laugh-riot (many bouts of unexpected humor help too - especially the one with the flash mob, and the background conversations....hilarious!). While the 1st instance of said effect is on play, the makers also take the time to gradually setup the lives and real-time situation of the main characters, almost placing us within their lives, allowing us to begin caring for their fates. There is remarkable consistency, and looping back into previous instances, in a deceptively not all that engrossing fashion, but end up taking almost center-stage later in the movie. Kinda forces us to keep everything that's unfolding in perspective. Fahaadh Faasil, of 'Iyobinte pusthakam', 'Annayum Rasoolum', 'Bangalore days', '22, female, Kottayam' and many more, does a bang- up job, as always, with his natural responses to occurring stimuli, ably supported by everyone around him, especially Soubin Shahir ('Premam'), Aparna Balamurli (kudos to doing away with makeup), Aparna and Lijo Mol Jose (as also the actors who play his friend/business+home-neighbor) and father, respectively. The makers have taken care in fleshing out almost every character that surrounds our leads, and the actors are definitely lucky to get that on their drawing boards, getting actually mea that they can build upon. The cinematography deserves special mention, and I'm always fond of actual location work dictating the product and set designs, that Malayalam movies (other than the likes of something like '2 countries', which, for all its strengths, does not do well in this department) do so well. Both the background score and the songs are relevant and appropriate (courtesy Bijibal, somewhat of a legend like Rajesh Murugesan or Shaan Rehman), and this is an album worth listening to, on repeat mode. The fight choreography goes for something more realistic (albeit simple) that something mainstream Indian audiences are used to viewing, and though it is not in the league of 'Iyobinte Pusthakam', it definitely passes muster, and almost gets the tone that (I suspect) 'Action hero Biju' aspired to (but ultimately did not get, succumbing to finally using wire-fu). Not to be missed, and perhaps worth multiple viewings, at a large screen cinema close by...",simple life as you like it,veritable breath fresh air this has be one more hilarious movies ive seen long time especially one that does not think you have make things dumb order make your audience laugh thematically speaking this has more do with something butterfly effect where director actually shows something like that motion audience get used how he plans use it propel movie forward then goes does it kind dumbing down concept but thats not sound me complaining especially since 1st instance that is veritable laugh riot many bouts unexpected humor help too especially one with flash mob background conversations hilarious while 1st instance said effect is play makers also take time gradually setup lives real time situation main characters almost placing us within their lives allowing us begin caring their fates there is remarkable consistency looping back into previous instances deceptively not all that engrossing fashion but end up taking almost center stage later movie kinda forces us keep everything thats unfolding perspective fahaadh faasil iyobinte pusthakam annayum rasoolum bangalore days 22 female kottayam many more does bang up job as always with his natural responses occurring stimuli ably supported by everyone around him especially soubin shahir premam aparna balamurli kudos doing away with makeup aparna lijo mol jose as also actors who play his friend business home neighbor father respectively makers have taken care fleshing out almost every character that surrounds our leads actors are definitely lucky get that their drawing boards getting actually mea that they can build upon cinematography deserves special mention im always fond actual location work dictating product set designs that malayalam movies other than likes something like 2 countries which all its strengths does not do well this department do so well both background score songs are relevant appropriate courtesy bijibal somewhat legend like rajesh murugesan or shaan rehman this is album worth listening repeat mode fight choreography goes something more realistic albeit simple that something mainstream indian audiences are used viewing though it is not league iyobinte pusthakam it definitely passes muster almost gets tone that i suspect action hero biju aspired but ultimately did not get succumbing finally using wire fu not be missed perhaps worth multiple viewings at large screen cinema close by,0.47281746031746036,0.18107448107448104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Maheshinte Prathikaaram: A Different Take on life,Maheshinte Prathikaaram.. A different sort of a film when you compare it to the movies Fahad Faasil has done. The studio photographer Mahesh is a simple person without any high ambitions in life. His dad.. The most silent person you would see in that film.. But conveying his message through his silence beautifully. Mahesh likes a girl called Sowmya who is his childhood friend and the same applies to her. Unexpected turn of events leads to Mahesh engaging in a fight with a thug called Jimson who ends up beating Mahesh in front of the crowd. Mahesh gets all embarrassed in front of everyone. The following events that occur in Mahesh's life have been put together really well and is presented to you by Dileesh Pothan in a very good manner. Soubin's timely appearance along with the evergreen music of Bijibal make the film an absolute treat to watch. Special credits to Fahad Faasil for bringing out Mahesh so well.

Her books are never about just the central character but about the towns in Ireland, their people, culture and how all the characters are interwoven seamlessly to one another. MP is more than Mahesh's sweet revenge. It's about Idukki and its people. This is probably not a movie that I'd recommend to a non Malayali as the essence of the movie would be lost to them. This is one of my all time favourite movies of all time. Yes, it's slow paced and the plot is thin but this is a movie that one must savour like an exquisite wine. What a beautiful movie!!

7.0,Powerhouse Fahadh Faasil in the decent but messy story of dignitarial revenge.,"Maheshinte Prathikaaram (2016) : Brief Review -Powerhouse Fahadh Faasil in the decent but messy story of dignitarial revenge. Maheshinte Prathikaaram is unexpectedly pretty much entertaining film, quite nice and humourous break from intense filmography of Faasil. Although, it doesn't surpass those high level expectations, the normal hype is easily matched by the film. Mahesh, a studio photographer and studio owner gets into a fight and loses his dignity in front of village. He ends up taking revenge which leads to certain realizations in his life. The film has its flaws and too many to be excluded. First, the love story, sorry love stories, there are two so. The first one looks quite dumb even for the rural standards, i mean naturally one cannot expect an intellectual lovestory of urban zone from the film set in village, right? The second is better though, however, the external behavior doens't really suit the characters. The girl looks like a college girl of around 18-19 years old and Faasil on the other side looks a man of 30+ age. It doesn't look happening and convincing somehow. Gladly, the film gas got powerhouse like Fahadh Faasil to have quality in at least one department otherwise the screenplay had messed it like a spring. Till the interval point film does not come to point and wastes those 50 minutes in telling useless stuff. From the beginning till the interval there are hardly 10 minutes which are related to the essence, and for rest 40 minutes, one has no clue what's going on. There is a scene when Mahesh sees his love interest for the first in the film in funeral scene and he's clicking picture. Can you believe, the girl who is supposed to be unhappy and sorrowful is smiling while posing beside the dead body. How? What the hell was that? Anyways, its a good one time flick but please don't expect anything classy except for performances of all the actors.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",powerhouse fahadh faasil decent but messy story dignitarial revenge,maheshinte prathikaaram 2016 brief review powerhouse fahadh faasil decent but messy story dignitarial revenge maheshinte prathikaaram is unexpectedly pretty much entertaining film quite nice humourous break intense filmography faasil although it doesnt surpass those high level expectations normal hype is easily matched by film mahesh studio photographer studio owner gets into fight loses his dignity front village he ends up taking revenge which leads certain realizations his life film has its flaws too many be excluded first love story sorry love stories there are two so first one looks quite dumb even rural standards i mean naturally one cannot expect intellectual lovestory urban zone film set village right second is better though however external behavior doenst really suit characters girl looks like college girl around 18 19 years old faasil other side looks man 30 age it doesnt look happening convincing somehow gladly film gas got powerhouse like fahadh faasil have quality at least one department otherwise screenplay had messed it like spring till interval point film does not come point wastes those 50 minutes telling useless stuff beginning till interval there are hardly 10 minutes which are related essence rest 40 minutes one has no clue whats going there is scene when mahesh sees his love interest first film funeral scene hes clicking picture can you believe girl who is supposed be unhappy sorrowful is smiling while posing beside dead body how what hell was that anyways its good one time flick but please dont expect anything classy except performances all actors rating 7 10 by,0.5087241200828156,0.10374999999999998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,The audience clapped when the film ended .....,"Dear Dileesh Pothan,I enjoyed Maheshinte Prathikaram. Everyone else in the movie theater also seemed to enjoy it. They clapped when the film ended.I liked the film's plot. A lovable and devote loser called Mahesh lives with his senile father. He goes through a bad patch in his life when he is beaten up in public, ditched by his girlfriend and criticized for being bad at his job (as a photographer). Mahesh seeks a revival in his life. He refuses to wear sandals until he takes revenge on the person who beat him up in public. It reminded me of Warren Oates vow of silence after his chicken is killed in a cockfight in Monte Hellman's Cockfighter.The film works as a character study with the upwardly mobile Christian community of Idukki as a background.Fahadh Fazil as Mahesh turns in a very respectable performance as usual. I hope he finally scores a hit with this one. Soubin Shahir had some of the best dialogs in the film. He really stole the show as Fahad's sidekick. Aparna Balamurali as the feisty and flirtatious young Christian girl is the perfect foil for the sober and humble Mahesh. Alancier Lay and Jaffer Idukki were decent without being spectacular. The actor who played Jimson had great body language, he brought back memories of Salim Ghose the villain in Bharathan's Thazhvaram.Dileesh, I would not have made the film the way you did. You did have some good ideas. But Mahesh's desperate attempts at regaining his confidence and masculinity could have been more interesting. But you seemed to be intent on making a feel good film without lingering for too long in the dark side. Why does every new Malaylam film have to eventually turn into a feel good film?Anyway I am glad that people like yourself are making films about some of the interesting people living in Kerala's villages and small towns. While the films made by some of you new generation filmmakers are not masterpieces, they are a lot better than the superhero films of Mammooty/Lalettan/Sureshgopi or the mediocre slapstick films of Jayram and Dileep.I also noticed that you and writer Sham Pushkaran adhered to the the ""New-gen directors manifesto"" containing the golden rules for New-gen filmmakers:1) Your film must contain one or more references to Lalettan or Mammukka or some film of theirs.2) Your film must contain a few scenes where the characters consume alcohol. 3) Your film must have a few scenes related to food - usually meen/fish curry or some obscure ""appam"" eaten by the people of that area and not known to people living in other parts of Kerala.4) Your film must portray extreme religiosity (like carrying a wooden cross to the top of Malayatoor Mala) as exotica.5) The hero must live in an extremely run down and dirty house with a dirty kitchen. You may use lighting or clever cinematography to take attention away the basic squalor of the house/kitchen. This would help in strengthening your ghetto credentials.I look forward to your next film.

9.0,Received a standing ovation when the film ended..........,"I went with my family to the theater on the 75th day of Maheshinte Prathikaram. Though I went with high expectations I was welcomed with a huge crowd in the hall (The day was also the release of Batman V Superman) I clearly doubted that it must be the viewers of BvS but surprisingly most of the youngsters and families were in the line for Maheshinte Prathikaram. I went on to watch the film with this in mind.First Half : The film starts with the 8 size lunar's chappal, introduced as symbolic of his coming revenge. the first half was mostly interesting. It revolved around Mahesh, his friends, family, love and Idukki. The Song 'idukki' gave the spectators a glimpse of the life and beauty of Idukki. The director had done well to indulge deep into the characters, but failed to cast a thrilling sensation between the fight. The audience became silent when the fight began, but I found one or two still laughing at the previous frame's joke. The first half ended with hilarious jokes and Mahesh's vow for revenge.Second Half : I saw in the first half one of the most well scripted story and I would definitely say that this film breached my expectations far beyond(better than Premam I would say). The second half did not lose its momentum but slightly lost its balance during the middle of the second half. The film mainly concentrated on comedy. But the first half love failure was also cast as a comedic genre.The second half, as I said was a bit laggy. I felt that most of my near spectators were becoming sleepy.But the film carried on, Fahadh's and Soubin's performance's being the most enjoyed. Babykuttan portrayed by Alancier Lay was the most laughed at character. The female lead roles's performance, was not up to the mark, I would say. The second half sparks in to life (nearing the end) when Mahesh (after learning Kung Fu and investigating about his avenger) returns to take his revenge. The Fight choreography and cinematography was superb, full marks for them. Breaking out of traditional fights, this film concentrated on realism and hand-held visuals.The fight was about 7 to 8 Min's, but that was worth it, Mahesh surely and splendidly avenged him. The film's climax and ending was a bit surprising for everyone. But I expected it to end any time, considering that it is a drama genre. I am not spoiling everything for you, left some twists and turns for you, the romantic scenes and of course his father.Verdict : One Of The Most Dramatic Films Released In Malayalam Ever.8 / 10",received standing ovation when film ended,i went with my family theater 75th day maheshinte prathikaram though i went with high expectations i was welcomed with huge crowd hall day was also release batman v superman i clearly doubted that it must be viewers bvs but surprisingly most youngsters families were line maheshinte prathikaram i went watch film with this mind first half film starts with 8 size lunars chappal introduced as symbolic his coming revenge first half was mostly interesting it revolved around mahesh his friends family love idukki song idukki gave spectators glimpse life beauty idukki director had done well indulge deep into characters but failed cast thrilling sensation between fight audience became silent when fight began but i found one or two still laughing at previous frames joke first half ended with hilarious jokes maheshs vow revenge second half i saw first half one most well scripted story i would definitely say that this film breached my expectations far beyond better than premam i would say second half did not lose its momentum but slightly lost its balance during middle second half film mainly concentrated comedy but first half love failure was also cast as comedic genre second half as i said was bit laggy i felt that most my near spectators were becoming sleepy but film carried fahadhs soubins performances being most enjoyed babykuttan portrayed by alancier lay was most laughed at character female lead roless performance was not up mark i would say second half sparks life nearing end when mahesh after learning kung fu investigating about his avenger returns take his revenge fight choreography cinematography was superb full marks them breaking out traditional fights this film concentrated realism hand held visuals fight was about 7 8 mins but that was worth it mahesh surely splendidly avenged him films climax ending was bit surprising everyone but i expected it end any time considering that it is drama genre i am not spoiling everything you left some twists turns you romantic scenes course his father verdict one most dramatic films released malayalam ever 8 10,0.38900000000000007,0.1585,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,a simple plot with an amazing script,The movie revolves around a simple story which is portrayed amazingly by fahad fazil. He has done an amazing job of his role and the comedy contained in this film is different from the usually seen type of jokes. The movie does an excellent job of telling a simple story in an interesting way which does not get the viewer bored. It is my belief that it is difficult for a director to keep the audience interested without any twists or turns which this film lacks. Still the film provides a visual treat which in itself is amazing. Cudos to the team behind the film. I also loved the perfectly normal way in which mahesh was portrayed.

10.0,Simple and realistic,"Mahesh(Fahad faasil) is a photographer in kattappana living with his aging father. He has a love interest soumya(Anusree). Mahesh's simple life takes a turn when he is publicly beaten up by a guy jimson(sujith shankar) leaving mahesh in embarrassment and his self respect getting hurt. Later, soumya ditches him when she gets a proposal from a canadian nurse. Mahesh swears revenge to beat up jimson publicly the same way he was beaten and without achieving that he would be barefooted. But jimson leaves to gulf, making mahesh's wait for revenge extended. By that time, mahesh trains for martial arts and falls in love with a girl jimsy(aparna balamurali) without knowing that she is jimson's sister. Will mahesh take his revenge despite jimson being his future brother in law? To know that watch maheshinte prathikaram. When this movie was announced, I wondered it would be an intense revenge film like badlapur because of the title. But to my surprise, its a light hearted film with loads of humor. Story is very simple but the treatment is fresh and realistic. Dileesh pothan makes his directorial debut with a bang. With his first film itself he turns into one of the best filmmakers of malayalam. The sequences he built which leads to the conflict point itself shows his brilliance. Bijibal's songs are another highlight with idukki song being the best. Shyju khalid's cinematography is a delight to your eyes. Coming to the performances everyone has given their best, where most of the characters having a cult following like mahesh, artist baby, crispin, soumya, vincent bhavana, jimsy, jimson, eldho etc. Only issue I had is how jimson didn't know about mahesh's revenge after returning from gulf since mahesh publicly sweared revenge. But that's just my doubt and not a big deal. Before maheshinte prathikaram released, fahad had a bit bad time at the box office. But after the release of maheshinte prathikaram, fahad didn't need to turn back and became every malayalees favorite.",simple realistic,mahesh fahad faasil is photographer kattappana living with his aging father he has love interest soumya anusree maheshs simple life takes turn when he is publicly beaten up by guy jimson sujith shankar leaving mahesh embarrassment his self respect getting hurt later soumya ditches him when she gets proposal canadian nurse mahesh swears revenge beat up jimson publicly same way he was beaten without achieving that he would be barefooted but jimson leaves gulf making maheshs wait revenge extended by that time mahesh trains martial arts falls love with girl jimsy aparna balamurali without knowing that she is jimsons sister will mahesh take his revenge despite jimson being his future brother law know that watch maheshinte prathikaram when this movie was announced i wondered it would be intense revenge film like badlapur because title but my surprise its light hearted film with loads humor story is very simple but treatment is fresh realistic dileesh pothan makes his directorial debut with bang with his first film itself he turns into one best filmmakers malayalam sequences he built which leads conflict point itself shows his brilliance bijibals songs are another highlight with idukki song being best shyju khalids cinematography is delight your eyes coming performances everyone has given their best where most characters having cult following like mahesh artist baby crispin soumya vincent bhavana jimsy jimson eldho etc only issue i had is how jimson didnt know about maheshs revenge after returning gulf since mahesh publicly sweared revenge but thats just my doubt not big deal before maheshinte prathikaram released fahad had bit bad time at box office but after release maheshinte prathikaram fahad didnt need turn back became every malayalees favorite,0.37883597883597875,0.2141975308641975,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,Makes you notice your little town a little more,"Malayalam film industry has this gifted sense of taking a day out of life, draining all the noise around it, write a screenplay and make a masterpiece. Like the industry, the actors also don't need to put any extra effort into impressing the viewers, they basically live the characters they are given. Fahad, Soubin, Alencier ..you name anyone in this movie..they would be the people you would randomly meet in Kerala. What actually grabs the first place in my opinion is the cinematography. I go to the hilly regions in Kerala every year when I was a kid, and this movie just brought the little things I used to remember. Such lovely frames that capture Idukki and moss clothed town.The story is about how Mahesh Bhavana, the portrait photographer avenges the shame of getting beaten up while coping with his break up, realizing how he could be much more than a studio photographer and finding love, only to find that it is his brother-in-law that beat him up. Comic elements are elicited naturally, romance is heartfelt and the little things like Mahesh clutching his father's fingers are heartwarming. The pup was a metaphor of hope- to me at least. The background score never lets you know that it exists yet pushing you to the moments it want you to. There is literally no make-up except where Aparna applies some in the studio or thats how less it is was used. At the time of writing this review, I've listened to the opening song atleast a 50 times in the last week and would continue to do so.People from anywhere can watch this movie and they should. It is a quiet acceptance and gleeful celebration of all simple things in life without all the drama.",makes you notice your little town little more,malayalam film industry has this gifted sense taking day out life draining all noise around it write screenplay make masterpiece like industry actors also dont need put any extra effort into impressing viewers they basically live characters they are given fahad soubin alencier you name anyone this movie they would be people you would randomly meet kerala what actually grabs first place my opinion is cinematography i go hilly regions kerala every year when i was kid this movie just brought little things i used remember such lovely frames that capture idukki moss clothed town story is about how mahesh bhavana portrait photographer avenges shame getting beaten up while coping with his break up realizing how he could be much more than studio photographer finding love only find that it is his brother law that beat him up comic elements are elicited naturally romance is heartfelt little things like mahesh clutching his fathers fingers are heartwarming pup was metaphor hope me at least background score never lets you know that it exists yet pushing you moments it want you there is literally no make up except where aparna applies some studio or thats how less it is was used at time writing this review ive listened opening song atleast 50 times last week would continue do so people anywhere can watch this movie they should it is quiet acceptance gleeful celebration all simple things life without all drama,0.47946428571428573,0.06332070707070707,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"

The realism in even the smallest of things, like Mahesh cleaning his slippers in the beginning or his daily routine or every single relationships in the movie, is mind- boggling.

We don't see him as an actor or a star, but the character living a life and going through real life experiences.His dedication and commitment as an actor is there to be seen in every scene.Alencier Ley Lopez is hilarious and gave awesome performance.Anusree and Aparna Balamurali, who play the leading ladies have got solidity of writing in their characters which give their characters complexity and depth that is rarely found these days. They illuminate the film with their performances.2)Second half: Second half of the film is very good and engaging.The love story between Mahesh and Jimsy is different and shot brilliantly with good humor.Climax is very good and shapes a perfect end.3)Interval: The scene where Mahesh gets beaten up followed with Interval twist is so engaging.It is the only highlight of first half,4)Cinematography: You will definitely fall in love with Idukki place after watching this movie.It is so beautiful and a treat for nature lovers.Idukki Dam is one place one should definitely visit.Its scenery is breathtaking.5)Duration: Movie is just 2hr long.A perfect duration.Minus Points:1)First half: First half is mostly filled with unnecessary scenes except love story of Mahesh and Interval.Except few moments most of the first half is uninteresting and filled with messed up scenes.So,Maheshinte Prathikaaram is a decent entertainer with brilliant performances,exotic locations,nice second half and striking Interval bang.Sloppy First half is a major drawback.My rating 6.5/10",maheshinte prathikaaram is decent entertainer with brilliant performances exotic locations nice second half striking interval bang sloppy first half is major drawback,maheshinte prathikaaram 2016 malayalam movies are mostly known their simplicity natural feel they have lot exotic locations which is major attraction even dumbest films brilliant masterpieces maheshinte prathikaaram revenge mahesh is comedy drama starring fahadh faasil which got rave reviews considered as one best malayalam films 2016 so how is it plot mahesh bhavana idukki runs photo studio leads happy contented life living along with his aging father his darling pet dog his friends his lady love with whom he maintains long distance relationship one fine day his rosy life is turned upside down when he fatefully gets involved unrelated street fight where he is severely beaten up front his own people village he swears that he will wear his slippers only when his revenge is fulfilled so how did he fulfilled his revenge forms rest story plus points 1 performances fahadh faasil is brilliant his role as mahesh we dont see him as actor or star but character living life going through real life experiences his dedication commitment as actor is there be seen every scene alencier ley lopez is hilarious gave awesome performance anusree aparna balamurali who play leading ladies have got solidity writing their characters which give their characters complexity depth that is rarely found these days they illuminate film with their performances 2 second half second half film is very good engaging love story between mahesh jimsy is different shot brilliantly with good humor climax is very good shapes perfect end 3 interval scene where mahesh gets beaten up followed with interval twist is so engaging it is only highlight first half 4 cinematography you will definitely fall love with idukki place after watching this movie it is so beautiful treat nature lovers idukki dam is one place one should definitely visit its scenery is breathtaking 5 duration movie is just 2hr long perfect duration minus points 1 first half first half is mostly filled with unnecessary scenes except love story mahesh interval except few moments most first half is uninteresting filled with messed up scenes so maheshinte prathikaaram is decent entertainer with brilliant performances exotic locations nice second half striking interval bang sloppy first half is major drawback my rating 6 5 10,0.5914327485380116,0.29805190058479525,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.37}"
