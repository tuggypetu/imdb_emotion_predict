10.0,Near perfect adaptation of a fantasy benchmark,"Director Peter Jackson and wife Fran Walsh have successfully created an epic movie in both look and feel to equal J. R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of ""book of the century""), bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.Visually the film is stunning, and Jackson's decision to shoot it entirely in New Zealand is one that pays off. From the incredibly lush green opening scenes of the Shire, to the enchanting elvish woods, to the imposing mountains and plains, it really is a great film to look at and enjoy the backdrop. Even the computer-generated images, like that of Mount Doom, are pretty realistic. Jackson's fluid camera leads to some great sweeping shots through orc-infested mines, huge towers, cameras in places you've never dreamed of. The soundtrack is also perfect, with Howard Shore's suspenseful, exciting, and emotional score a real plus, especially with the cool chanting that fills the Mines of Moria sequence. On top of this, great stuff is done with sound effects - in particular one scene involving a horn suddenly blowing had me jumping in my seat with its realism.I don't really need to examine the story, because it sticks closely to the book with so few minor changes that it's impeccable. The script is intelligent and well-written, the characters charismatic and believable in the situations they encounter. Despite a three hour running time, the film never drags, even in some of the slower sequences - I just didn't want it to be over while I was watching it. The costumes, sets and appearances - down to the hobbits' hairy feet - are all exactly as you would picture them in the book. Jackson's bizarre, arty depiction of life in the ""netherworld"" when Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible is as good as it could ever have been - spooky, supernatural and utterly weird. Lighting, pacing, suspense, tension, and the rest - it's all here and done 100% correctly for an overall brilliant effect.Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice to me for the lead role, but I immediately fell in love with his character. Through his acting he creates an emotional, weak in body but strong in spirit hero, a real centre piece for the film to evolve around, and the film makes great use of the actor's slightly odd eyes (especially in the sequence in which he nearly becomes a wraith). Ian McKellen is also excellent as Gandalf and seems to have been perfectly cast in the role, making it his own. Then there's the fellowship itself - Viggo Mortensen excels as the proud and just Strider (later Aragorn), especially in the action stakes where he fights with such fierce determination that he's a presence to behold. Orlando Bloom is fine as the elf warrior Legolas, and moves as fast with his bow as he does in the book. Screen stalwart John Rhys-Davies IS Gimli the dwarf, and couldn't be better. Then there's Sean Astin - lovable as the dopey but loyal Sam Gamgee, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan in slight comic relief roles as hobbit buddies Pip and Merry. Finally, kudos to Sean Bean, for creating in Boromir a flawed but deeply likable and understandable character, with a sympathetic performance that eclipses all of the actor's previous work - bravo.The action sequences are magnificent and really get the heart going - they put you into the middle of the action with all the blood, sweat and clanging steel, and are edge-of-the-seat stuff. Highlights include Strider fighting the ring-wraiths with his burning brand on Weathertop and the final assault by orcs on the fellowship, which leads to one of the most noble deaths ever in a film. And what of the special effects? In a film dominated by CGI work, I'm happy to say that most are unnoticeable. The digital manipulation to create four-foot hobbits is sometimes dodgy but most of the time you don't notice. The backdrops and effects are great, expensive looking but solid and real at the same time - whoever said they look ""cartoony"" just got it wrong.My favourite scene in the movie is the Mines of Moria sequence - a fantasy fan's dream come true, and the best on screen depiction of a Dungeons & Dragons game so far. The lurker in the lake is a Lovecraftian monster par excellence and the spooky and atmospheric trip through the corpse-strewn deserted mines exceptionally eerie stuff. Then follows a fantastic battle with a cave troll, thankfully on screen for a fair amount of time so we get to admire the fluid and superb effects, and then a truly gob-smacking encounter with the fiery Balrog, just as you imagine it from the book. This half an hour is probably the best film sequence I've ever seen, flawless and perfect in its depiction - amazing. A highlight of what is an impressive and epic film throughout, and a must see for any film fan worth their salt - I can't recommend this film highly enough, and plan to watch it again before the cinema run expires. In my opinion this is better than any STAR WARS movie or HARRY POTTER - and easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made, although it has to be said the competition isn't exactly stiff.

10.0,"First, And Still The Best Of LOTR","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",first still best lotr,here is one film that lived up its hype by time i saw it after it had arrived at video stores i had heard read ton things about it seen all awards it had received expected lot my surprise it did not disappoint now several years later after having watched all three these rings films twice each i still think this first movie trilogy is best it is truly spectacular adventure story all way through probably best ever put film first three hours it is extra special following two films were very good be sure but this first had better mixture story second third movies were almost entirely frodo his allies long journey but first half this movie also gives good bit interesting introductory material including number scenes at shire before long adventure starts if you watch all three these films consecutively action wears you down by midway through final episode it almost becomes just too much that never gets chance happen with fellowship film anyway fellowship stunned me visuals alone i cant recall any film that has so many jaw dropping scenes one after other three straight hours some are beyond description i dont care if they are computer generated so what fact is they are awesome view both beauty staggering action scenes that feature incredible looking monsters other mythical characters story covers all kinds terrain too lush shire hobbits harsh neighboring landscapes each couple minutes as two movies that followed scenes radically change calmness action adventure romance sweet lovable characters hideous monsters its incredible movie experience,0.4159892949427833,0.28592838685861943,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,"The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension","The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",fellowship ring not just movie but door another dimension,first part lord rings trilogy fellowship rings opened door whole new world me id never read any tolkiens books when i saw film first time at theatre now that ive read them retrospect i think being neophyte mythology made my lotr movie experience all more miraculous i loved two towers return king almost as much as fotr but not quite because seeing fellowship first time was like taking journey fabulous new place meeting incredible new friends that you dont want leave ive never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked me it was akin being child again with that tireless sense wonder enjoyment each every moment maybe because as child you are discovering your surroundings whatever age you are when you watch fellowship ring you are rendered awe upon being introduced purity beauty middle earth darkly enthralled by majesty eisengard saruman sauron all their mighty malice one things that makes this movie so special there are so many is that you fall love not only with good characters but also with evil ones example christopher lee was amazing as saruman i cant imagine movie without him some films that might be comparable lord rings trilogy are fifth element star wars trilogy parts iv v vi forget newer prequels matrix trilogy especially first part interview with vampire legend sleepy hollow with johnny depp logans run island they are all excellent movies works art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound entranced duration their runtime but after seeing fellowship ring i knew i had found movie by which i would judge all other movies based j r r tolkiens beloved books peter jackson has set new standard industry cinema one that i honestly think has not wont be surpassed at least not my lifetime not even by pj himself it is truly instant classic that will stand test time be loved by generations come god bless tolkien jackson everyone involved conception making this film creating world that is at my fingertips only takes touch button go whenever i want makes me forget everything else lotr trilogy is undoubtedly my precious non plus ultra all movies,0.5924897470950102,0.2722174755069491,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better,"I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.",i dont know if they could do it much better,i am not fanatic though i have read books couple times my interest j r r tolkien goes his knowledge history language as well as his work fantasy ive seen some bad animation that was done using his work i always assumed that this would be only vehicle that could be used bring these works screen now with new generation special effects masters we have work art like world has never seen granted there can never be definitive work that matches depth poetry books but this captures charm wonder amazing epic see shire presented first scenes party home bilbo as creatures this amazing fantasy are exposed is one those incredible moments story is set up ultimate adventure as frodo paddles out onto that lake not knowing what has been set motion i will leave real reviews others my first thought upon seeing this was i just hope i survive see it its conclusion,0.6470933828076688,0.238821892393321,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,"""Remember what Bilbo used to say, it's dangerous business Frodo, going out the door.""","When I first read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy back in the early 1970's, I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. ""Star Wars"" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien, it was simply best left to the imagination.Well, imagination has found life in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy, just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release, I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth, as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example, when the Black Riders appear for the first time, it's difficult to grasp what they're all about, other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men, neither alive nor dead, who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear, can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves, dwarfs, hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world, for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel ""The Hobbit"", you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in, and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land, people, and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.",remember what bilbo used say its dangerous business frodo going out door,when i first read hobbit lord rings trilogy back early 1970s i recall saying myself that story would make wonderful movie star wars still hadnt come out yet realizing that available technology could not do justice fantastic world presented by j r r tolkien it was simply best left imagination well imagination has found life fellowship ring truly profound epic that sets standard film fantasy just as books did written word upon first seeing it during its initial release i couldnt have been happier with amount detail it offered while remaining true original adventure everyone imagines what story characters look like their own mind it was as if peter jackson tapped great cosmic consciousness deliver tale that captured tone pacing novel dead i feel that readers trilogy have leg up characters locations middle earth as they are revealed film quickly with nominal explanation example when black riders appear first time its difficult grasp what theyre all about other than fact that theyre after ring striders explanation nazgul is perfect ring wraiths who were once men neither alive nor dead who always feel power ring coming movie with that understanding ahead time helps viewer have greater appreciation action taking place real magic movie me is seamless manner which various races coexist interact with each other though levels unfamiliarity distrust appear can anyone coming out movie doubt that elves dwarfs hobbits wizards actually exist even orcs evil uruk hai have place this world without danger they pose there is no triumph if movie captures your imagination you havent read trilogy or its prequel hobbit youll be doing yourself favor do so there even more exquisite detail are nuances such as elvish poetry additional characters that provide more depth color world middle earth its world easy get lost makes one appreciate writer legendary proportion who invented land people language all his own that can now be shared with everyone,0.5196969696969697,0.2263257575757575,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,An absolutely incredible film!,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect.

10.0,The Fantasy Motion Picture to Rule Them All...,"Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.",fantasy motion picture rule them all,barely ever hearing lord rings i went see this film theaters consecutive friday it was released not only be flabbergasted at its greatness but wanting more since then i devoted myself seeing following two films first day release promise i kept peter jacksons take tolkiens fantasy masterpiece not only carries great deal text full film fruition but shows power film proving that nothing is impossible jacksons vision is continuous never seems loose grasp story that is being told using artistry john howe alan lee fellowship ring gleams with beautiful dark atmosphere length detail that makes it seem like everyone everything has its own history full wondrous images one could never imagine acting is superb with complex script each actor has transformed these characters into 3 d people with deep back story people that we feel compassion this is one extraordinary ensemble cast each actor is that character making it seem impossible imagine anyone else fill that persons shoe their stead viggo mortensen is aragorn sir ian mckellen is gandalf grey elijah wood is frodo baggins one could weep with our heroes should one fall or feel inspired when they achieve victory fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal but its completely believable never losing pace writing direction is flawless making one enthralling introduction into middle earth voice over prologue fills even most uneducated audience member with all necessary knowledge they need know order understand our heroes villains motives some things course have been omitted pacing reasons while not present theatrical cut we do see passing grey elves get brief tale beren luthien barrow wights their story is no where be seen as interesting as it is book there really is no place it this film tom bombadil is absent as well but thankfully ingeniousness writers extended edition two towers little homage is paid character omissions changes are always part adapting book film ones made by peter jackson phillipa boyens fran walsh are justifiable every way action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough breathing room plot advancement ever continuing character development each action scene is its own be it flight fjords bruinen mines moria or showdown at amon hen near end film all are greatly choreographed each stunt member actor is full energy ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others heads limbs it really is sight behold special effects are mesmerizing use cgi miniatures bigatures even clever camera angles blend make one ideal image after other soaring images barad dur or orthanc seem real when fact they only stand so many feet high argonath two figures enormous height standing before anduin river seem like 300 foot creations when fact they are about only several feet off ground simply jaw dropping imagery howard shores score fellowship ring is beautiful epic complex piece work that makes one feel like they have been entranced even when some text seems omitted screen it can be heard through powerful instrumentation conducted created by this composer use leitmotifs symbolize country race or character is stunning overall lord rings fellowship ring is visionary masterpiece allowing world see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements equaling greatness hollywoods earlier classics as first three one who has not seen these films can await next several hours their lives be changed ever,0.5142305075876505,0.17706266352694924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,"Part One: With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved","Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.",part one with help even impossible can be achieved,peter jackson set out make movies which author lord rings trilogy j r r tolkien would have endorsed all three were resounding successes though because film medium they necessarily varied tolkiens story line purists may have issues with jacksons theatrical license but as someone who has read tolkiens books several times seen films 4 5 times each i never felt that jackson went

,Wow!,"Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me, it is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.",wow,breathtaking unique captivating enchanting within minutes start this first chapter undeniably epic trilogy audience was left gasping at intensity images screen we had nearly three hours go scope tolkiens masterpiece may have eluded film makers decades but director peter jackson makes good his promise he has not only brought us tale frodo his bold companions he has brought us middle earth believe me it is big sweeping vistas hang onto your seat camera shots send us zooming through towering cities citadels tolkiens imagination but even more impressive than stunning visuals sound effects like youve never heard before are actors who breathe life into characters ian mckellens portrayal gandalf is nothing short awe inspiring elijah woods frodo is one most unexpectedly captivating performances ive seen long time despair terror determination fellowship is all there spades i left theater aching tensing every muscle during fight flight sequences breathless compelling kind we havent seen since spielberg gave us desperate charge onto d day beaches normandy those unfamiliar with tolkiens world may quickly find themselves lost it but happily so depth his creation cannot be grasped few hours it doesnt need be struggle good against evil explodes screen leaves little room complaint movie ended with stunned audience sitting edges their seats feeling somewhat bereft we were exhausted but no one wanted wait year more jacksons ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything youve seen this year george lucas chris columbus take note this is how you deliver cinematic promise everyone else dont you dare miss it,0.5916666666666667,0.2198464912280702,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Embrace the magic,"It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.",embrace magic,it is with no surprise that peter jacksons fellowship ring film has received such mixed critics many viewers refer it as being childish boring uninteresting seems me that it is bound same fate tolkiens books destined be target same type misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after its first publication having read books several years ago i went see this impossible film when it came out with many doubts my mind i really liked it but left theater with as many doubts as i had before was it perfect well maybe not but what achievement after watching it few times dvd thinking about it some time now i find myself loving this film more more let me tell you why lord rings is fairy tale myth fantasy peter jackson directed film that was considered very long time impossible make not only technical reasons narrative roots are incredibly long detailed storyline is deeply connected with creation fantastic continent time unknown called middle earth its author tolkien dedicated considerable part his life developing this continents background its mythology origins its different kinds people cultures languages therefore its geographic references are determinant unfolding story one ring peter jackson went out achieve impossible came out with recreation original that is pure true story every detail first time four hobbits meet black rider road example is absolutely faithful feeling book assault riders at weathertop is another great example it captures that feeling danger density atmosphere that are main characteristics tale jackson also took some liberties with story made some right choices along way if so called purists may not approve removal tom bombadil altogether it should be comprehensible that travel hobbiton rivendel is very long detailed one could easily make movie its own i felt more uneasy with how short council elrond was book council is where whole story rings is first explained many passages past ages middle earth are unveiled it is fascinating moment story that had be shortened obvious reasons still after some consideration i now agree with options made by peter jackson think that movie prologue narrated by galadriel was wisest choice magic is all there when gandalf shuts his eyes moment frodo stands council says i will take ring it is there at morias gate at fall boromir it is powerful film that doesnt fit rhythm standard hollywood action movie it is film that breeds that takes time unfold its tale branching every direction i could go talking about all different elements that bring this film close perfection but ill end saying that deep down this is not about action beards big monsters greatest thing about this film me is that it brought me back time when i was love with different world where everything was possible reading lord rings night after night i came understand what this thing mankind really was all about corruption absolute power importance value friendship inevitability growing up strength hope that this film could capture that magic be new bearer its message humanism is statement its greatness gandalfs words that even smallest person may change course world have part play destiny all are immortal end this is wonderful film but that doesnt mean you are going like it i cannot tell you what it is like see this film if you dont know or love book but i hope it may plant seed your heart discover great world fantasy beauty humanity i believe tolkien would have liked that,0.5542969714355257,0.1848992941462821,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A Masterpiece,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS",masterpiece,ive never been fan sword sorcery genre im surprised film companies decide make rubbish like beastmaster hawk slayer red sonja but i am aware popularity jrr tolkiens massive novel lord rings its popularity i remember survey carried out by very well known british fantasy sf magazine 1987 tolkiens book was voted greatest fantasy novel all time stand by stephen king was long way second but its novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who like fans star trek star wars insist reading subtexts that are just not there when fellowship rings shot number one imdb top 250 films i put popularity down obsessed anorakish fans who were going vote film classic no matter what stranger still i found groups as diverse as neo nazis gays enviromentalists proclaiming this is our film so when i finally sat down watch tfotr i was expecting only some average entertainment non sad person with no political axe grind after seeing film i had admit fellowship ring is masterpiece much credit must go producers i ve no idea politics about bringing story silver screen but i can imagine hollywood bigwigs sitting around commitee table saying give us tom give us nicole get harrison get leonardo no limeys limeys are slimy no limey accents were americans this is our baby which producers gave firm resounding no good them because hollywood treatment would have ruined this film cast comprised well known but not megastar actors unknowns are uniformally excellent even normally hammy lee rhys davis bland tyler are good also great see so many brits playing good guys having american actors adopting non specific british accents cast do good jobthe other production values are outstanding pride place goes andrew lesnies cinematography where camera sweeps down sky into orcs underground lair camera also shows off stunning new zealand landscapes id always believed scotland had greatest scenery earth but im willing change my mind fx are good throughout though perhaps matte backgrounds cgi are less impressive places but theyre still lot better than weve been used recently orc make up is wonderful helps them become classic cinema monsters only bad point about orcs is like stormtroopers star wars theyre too easy kill there are some minor flaws fellowship rings but this is probably down tolkiens source novel rather than film makers couple times heroes seem set suffer resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or giant eagle saves day i guess this is cancelled out by dangers adversaries also appearing nowhere theres little female perspective story women audience relate but come girls youve got viggo mortensen sean bean acting all hunky macho so you cant complain i see imdb reviewers have started backlash against fotr like they did with titanic gladiator theyre right about gawd awful rubbish that is titanic but theyre wrong about gladiator which is very good film even further wrong about fellowship ring which is cinematic masterpiece ignore their criticisms any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans book people who have never read book enviromentalists cynics like myself is worth your time watching im really looking forward two towers,0.5281216213305766,0.13926401542073186,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,A truly exceptional film,"There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing.",truly exceptional film,there is very little that can be said about lord rings that hasnt been said already many times over but what can be re iterated is that fellowship ring is outstanding piece film making where do you start when reviewing film size lord rings j r r tolkeins seminal masterwork long considered unfilmable has made it screen thanks visionary director peter jackson fellowship ring is first three books trilogy everyone has their favourite three this one is probably mine unrivalled its size scale by virtually any other film with new groundbreaking special digital effects stunning musical score universally superb acting most importantly superb story fellowship ring is first part epic trilogy that tells quest hobbit destroy evil ring power he is aided his quest by his friends other companions who accompany him protect him his journey many threats face him his long journey both world around him his companions who could be tempted by power ring he has set out destroy it is tale magic fantasy swords sorcery but it is not simply teens who enjoy dungeons dragons games it is accessible everyone by turns exciting frightening funny sad it is true masterpiece terms storytelling encompassing full spectrum emotions acting is superb entire cast it is unfathomable as how academy overlooked acting entirely all three films when dishing out awards nominations however performances ian mckellan viggo mortensen sean astin elijah wood sean bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair single any one out award film also contains some groundbreaking computer generated special effects some positively genius scale work due hobbits being only about 3 feet tall some clever scale work was needed order ensure that john rhys davies dwarf film but over 6 feet tall real life did fact look height dwarf this was done through clever use forced perspectives scale doubles giant sets blue screen filming however most impressive use computer effects lies later trilogy with appearance gollum cinemas first live action character who is completely computer generated music is also beautiful howard shore has created possibly most iconic memorable score since john williams star wars peter jackson has until lord rings been seen as director outside mainstream but his superb career defining work lord rings trilogy has seen him well truly propelled him forefront hollywood he has re defined epic film with unparalleled success created films that will definitely stand test time one day be thought with same reverence as star wars godfather trilogies major milestone cinema history trilogy would eventually gain seventeen oscars between three films lord rings is master class storytelling essential viewing,0.5291911285061969,0.18783023483365952,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10.0,From the beginning...,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision.

10.0,Excellent,"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on. All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie. The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused. I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real. All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking. The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by. The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating). It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids. Still, it's the best film of 2001.

,Middle Earth comes alive...in breathtaking detail.,"When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy. But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie. I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story. It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience. Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen. Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes. The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it. Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real. Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same. The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters. All I can say is, ""Wow."" I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least. Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable. You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits. He also cries like a little girl. But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character. The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too. Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling. Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding. He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting. Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change. In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen. Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are. Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas. Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style. He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film. Gimli was pompous and brave, as well. He is well-represented in the movie. Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong. Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior. Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond. He was noble and cold at the same time. And Gandalf. What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard? He was magnificent. He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children. Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will. His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places. Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water. Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings.""",middle earth comes alive breathtaking detail,when i first saw trailers fellowship ring i had never had any interest reading lengthy tome trilogy but seeing possibility movie i immediately went out read whole thing insisted receiving it christmas enjoyed every minute it feelings i had while reading series were heightened seeing it come life stunning movie i thought it was fabulous work art i thought that having galadriel tell what was basically prologue book was good idea as it helped those who had never read story it also immediately involved me film i felt i had insiders advantage rest audience cate blanchett has wonderfully deep emotional voice way she speaks galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as elven queen also showing last battle isildur sauron helped unfog part novel that had me trifle confused entire movie is full beautiful sets landscapes shire was almost exactly as id pictured it hobbiton is cute very whimsical mordor was frighteningly well done extremely real rivendell had little bit european tourist trap look but was beautiful all same entire backdrop movie mountains moria isengard was perfect its amazing that fellowship was filmed one country now characters all i can say is wow i was little apprehensive about casting at first id created such real images characters my imagination i almost didnt want them spoiled me however i was not disapointed least elijah wood though not one my favorite actors was believable you could tell first glimpse that frodo was special woods pale sharp features contrast sharply with more ruddy robust look rest hobbits he also cries like little girl but his weaknesses strengths make his frodo apt choice starring character rest hobbiton gang was well chosen too sean astin rudy forever me was loyal bit bumbling just like gamgee tolkiens telling pippin merry were congenial slow witted lads but very brave nonetheless viggo mortensen is outstanding he has ability make aragorn both menacing kind he physically represents strider nines with his strength virility action sequences his are very passionate exciting some may have complained about arwens character being slightly expanded i thought it good change books you have read whole trilogy then rifle through appendix return king learn history between aragorn arwen liv tyler is ethereal breathtaking but at same time displays courage magic that make elves beings they are speaking elves i cant help but gush over handsome ever so talented orlando bloom as noble legolas bloom captured archers very movements he treads lightly fights fearlessly legolass bowmanship was amazing he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine gun style he was my favorite character books his essence transcends film gimli was pompous brave as well he is well represented movie boromir was hopelessly lost but at same time valiant strong sean bean gave emotionally charged performance as tortured warrior hugo weaving was very good as elrond he was noble cold at same time gandalf what more can be said ian mckellans showcase portrayal wizard he was magnificent he could be gandalf kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics hobbit children then he could turn around stun life out you with gandalf powerful wizard facing balrog with defiance iron will his oscar nomination is well deserved peter jackson is brave soul take project that could have backfired so many places instead bringing us uninspired kitsch he serves up raw emotion graphic battles good evil chilling wonderful characters enough special effects realistic mind you make john camerons mouth water knowing that two towers was my favorite books i eagerly anticipate second helping lord rings,0.6341812997998564,0.2337390015482799,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"

10.0,To refute its importance is foolhardy!,"Released to immense critical success, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was for a long time considered a novel that could never been adapted into a motion picture. Such a perception was virtually rendered idiotic when ""The Fellowship of the Ring was released to cinemas in 2001, garnering the respect of both critics and fans alike. To this day, it seems the near perfect adaptation of a novel to a film. Frodo Baggins is tasked with setting out to destroy The One Ring, a weapon forged by Sauron during the Second Age of Middle Earth. He is accompanied by eight other companions, into a company known as The Fellowship of the Ring, to go to Mt. Doom to destroy this all powerful weapon. Jackson's abilities as a filmmaker were not too well tested prior to this near impossible project, so for New Line Cinemas to give Peter Jackson the rights to Tolkien Estate can be considered foolish. How can a director, with only two noteworthy credits in ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""The Frighteners"" exceed such a reputation to bring forth J.R.R Tolkien's vision to life? Yet, what Peter Jackson managed to do with cast and crew, is now an inspiration. For ""The Lord of the Rings"" to work as an adaptation, the casting must be near perfect. The world is foreign to many viewers, the characters often are not human characters (though they obviously possess human traits) so the cast must be able to evoke a sense of humanity into them. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo, conveying a sense of naivety but also a sense of extreme courage and determination. Sir Ian McKellen is phenomenal as Gandalf, calm and reassuring at all times, but also very kind and caring towards Frodo especially. Viggo Mortensen captures Aragorn seamlessly, his struggles with dealing with a failed bloodline and his desires to escape his duty to his people. Then there is Sean Bean, whose portrayal of Boromir is stunning. The only member of the Fellowship to be killed (and not resurrected), Boromir's presence is ever lasting during the trilogy. Virtually a broken warrior, mostly due to his father's extreme demands and the declining of Gondor as a kingdom. Sean Bean, in many scenes, perfectly captures the moral complexities the character faces. We see in his conversations with Aragorn that he desires to do good for his people, but brings himself to do it in an immoral manner. We see during the course of the film that he is further broken down in spirit, culminating in a moment where he attempts to seize the Ring by force from Frodo. Almost immediately realizing his mistake, he gives life for Merry and Pippin. He is forgiven for his wrongdoings by Aragorn, who then promises the longevity of their people. The redemption of Boromir also enforces into Aragorn a necessary responsibility he must begin to accept: he is heir to the throne of Gondor. When reading through the first two volumes of J.R.R Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" novel, there are moments throughout that feel utterly unnecessary. The major event being the hobbits meeting Tom Bombadil as the Nazgul chase the hobbits. This event constitutes an entire chapter, and in the process, diminishes from the suspense and momentum that had been established. Peter Jackson, realizing the event has little significance on the overall plot, omitted this, to the indignation of most fans of the novel. Peter Jackson, alongside Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, wrote a near perfect script that wonderfully represents the nature of the book. One of the fine little touches, that fans have enjoyed, is the quick set of events that occur after the hobbits leave town, such as ""concerning hobbits"" or ""a shortcut to mushrooms"" - chapters from Tolkien's novel are tightly condensed and converted into a cinematic medium through which they can be accessed. The cinematography to this series of films can be described as swooping, breathtaking and majestic. And it certainly is. But it also provides a means to an experience. Why many fans of the series find it an experience is due to the cinematography, as the camera is rarely static but always in motion. Contrasting this with the prequels to Lucas' ""Star Wars"", the camera is fixed and the actors are given limited space through which to act. Those films feel like a mental prison, the viewer is stuck under the confines the characters are stuck and cannot escape. Of course, this notion applies very differently when considering films like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but for fantasy/sci-fi adventures such as ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", the cinematography must be enriching. It provides an experience, rather than just a mere film. Starting with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", this series of films is certainly an experience. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" remains a defining achievement in modern cinema, it re-invented and redefined the meaning of a blockbuster and has paved the way for countless fantasy films. Arguably the greatest of its genre, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" deserves every ounce of respect it gets. It is one of a rare kind of films that is so perfect in every aspect, from music to acting, from direction to cinematography, from editing to sound design, that to refute its importance to cinema is foolish. Peter Jackson did the seemingly impossible task of adapting one of the great pieces of literature into one of the great pieces of cinema.",refute its importance is foolhardy,released immense critical success lord rings was long time considered novel that could never been adapted into motion picture such perception was virtually rendered idiotic when fellowship ring was released cinemas 2001 garnering respect both critics fans alike this day it seems near perfect adaptation novel film frodo baggins is tasked with setting out destroy one ring weapon forged by sauron during second age middle earth he is accompanied by eight other companions into company known as fellowship ring go mt doom destroy this all powerful weapon jacksons abilities as filmmaker were not too well tested prior this near impossible project so new line cinemas give peter jackson rights tolkien estate can be considered foolish how can director with only two noteworthy credits heavenly creatures frighteners exceed such reputation bring forth j r r tolkiens vision life yet what peter jackson managed do with cast crew is now inspiration lord rings work as adaptation casting must be near perfect world is foreign many viewers characters often are not human characters though they obviously possess human traits so cast must be able evoke sense humanity into them elijah wood is wonderful as frodo conveying sense naivety but also sense extreme courage determination sir ian mckellen is phenomenal as gandalf calm reassuring at all times but also very kind caring towards frodo especially viggo mortensen captures aragorn seamlessly his struggles with dealing with failed bloodline his desires escape his duty his people then there is sean bean whose portrayal boromir is stunning only member fellowship be killed not resurrected boromirs presence is ever lasting during trilogy virtually broken warrior mostly due his fathers extreme demands declining gondor as kingdom sean bean many scenes perfectly captures moral complexities character faces we see his conversations with aragorn that he desires do good his people but brings himself do it immoral manner we see during course film that he is further broken down spirit culminating moment where he attempts seize ring by force frodo almost immediately realizing his mistake he gives life merry pippin he is forgiven his wrongdoings by aragorn who then promises longevity their people redemption boromir also enforces into aragorn necessary responsibility he must begin accept he is heir throne gondor when reading through first two volumes j r r tolkiens lord rings novel there are moments throughout that feel utterly unnecessary major event being hobbits meeting tom bombadil as nazgul chase hobbits this event constitutes entire chapter process diminishes suspense momentum that had been established peter jackson realizing event has little significance overall plot omitted this indignation most fans novel peter jackson alongside fran walsh phillipa boyens wrote near perfect script that wonderfully represents nature book one fine little touches that fans have enjoyed is quick set events that occur after hobbits leave town such as concerning hobbits or shortcut mushrooms chapters tolkiens novel are tightly condensed converted into cinematic medium through which they can be accessed cinematography this series films can be described as swooping breathtaking majestic it certainly is but it also provides means experience why many fans series find it experience is due cinematography as camera is rarely static but always motion contrasting this with prequels lucas star wars camera is fixed actors are given limited space through which act those films feel like mental prison viewer is stuck under confines characters are stuck cannot escape course this notion applies very differently when considering films like shawshank redemption but fantasy sci fi adventures such as star wars lord rings cinematography must be enriching it provides experience rather than just mere film starting with fellowship ring this series films is certainly experience fellowship ring remains defining achievement modern cinema it re invented redefined meaning blockbuster has paved way countless fantasy films arguably greatest its genre fellowship ring deserves every ounce respect it gets it is one rare kind films that is so perfect every aspect music acting direction cinematography editing sound design that refute its importance cinema is foolish peter jackson did seemingly impossible task adapting one great pieces literature into one great pieces cinema,0.5408861911035824,0.16007477727586422,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching...,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.",never before my life were my cheeks more aching,but oh was i thankful it all through movie i kept having this big large smile sculpted into my face record im 25 years old ive read lord rings three times first time when i was six or seven years old ever since then i read it at least once or twice year therefore you can count me as fan i follow same cult fan procedure with hobbit silmarillion as well now onto movie gosh i saw it more than one time i keep wanting more it it just never gets boring i really enjoyed little stuff that is found throughout movie fans books map bilbos table his house comes mind it is exactly as one hobbit book that i own i also incredibly enjoyed intro sequence with re telling battle against sauron silmarillion never has ultimate evil being been so well depicted screen it truly is sauron those who argue movie cuts too many parts or that it changes story too much are totally wrong this movie could not have shown whole first time its entirety keep mind that audiobook version fellowship ring lasts well over ten hours making movie this long would well make it way too long besides how would you financially sustain such project ive read reviewer saying hed make all three books with time allowed first movie alone i think it would be very fast forwarding experience movie with alvin chimpmunks kind voices incredibly stupid say least ok so there are changes movie well this is jacksons vision it all us have our own visions books which may or may not be compatible with that jacksons but i can safely assume that nobody can say they have hundred percent same vision story as tolkien thats thing with books each reader has different vision it as me i was blown away never before have i felt so much at home movie it is as if i had taken walk town where i grew up shire rivendell moria lorien everything felt so much like home i was moved i cannot tell another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing landscape screen as changes well i found good reasons behind all them let me tell you right away i was happy that arwen saved frodo yes maybe coming fan it will look like absolute heresy but i enjoyed scene lot i did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically correct do so or that i find liv tyler be absolutely attractive it was just because i felt like even though it was big change book it was very good one indeed it makes you discover power determination courage elves fact that even elven women although great their beauty seemingly fragile appearance do not have anything envy their male counterparts beside as arwen is become queen later it was pretty good see her have great first appearance actors were great they were lot into their characters first time i saw elves as they were quick agile terrifyingly effective battle just look at how legolas dealed with hordes enemies without single hint fear his eyes these are elves as they should be gimli was great too i know people seem think many characters were not developed enough but by actions you can learn lot with gimli lot can be learned about dwarves their pride deep sense honor family their mistrust elves their love strong beer good fight against anything bigger their sheer hatred orcs likes aragorn was totally ranger character ending scene as he walked toward horde uruk hai warriors was great his attitude his clothes everything about him just cried ranger boromir was very well depicted desperate save people gondor by any mean necessary robbed all hope yet end he redeems himself by showing his true valour deep down hes willing die defeat evil when he recognizes his king aragorn his last breath i felt like watching hero die it was moving hobbits were all great frodo is deeply sad fatalist sam is just best friend everyone would like have just as it should be finally we have gandalf quite frankly he looks mighty ian is gandalf faceoff against balrog moria is memorable sequence just shows how strong he really is be able vanquish such foe i cant wait his return quite frankly i cant wait two other movies meantime ill watch this one over over again this movie has everything that good movie needs have more plus it just might bring more people actually read books that have more pages than average little 25 novel that has no value it which is great parents maybe some scenes will frighten your kids but this movie has almost no blood even though it has good share battle foes are undeniably evil plus it has good values it friendship courage responsiblity sacrifice good cause belief that anyone can help change things this is worthy tolkien this is movie that will go down history as being one best ever sure,0.561675983436853,0.20485472739820568,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,The second one is 4 hours long......Kill me.,"This movie is good actually. It's and enjoyable fantasy adventure that will give you a fun ride. It has some pacing issues at the beginning of the movie but after like 1 hour or so the movie get's better with it's pacing. The action is well done and i enjoyed it throughout the movie. But there is this one problem with the movie which i will talk about.CHARACTERS The characters are very weak. Frodo is a weak protagonist, Sam is barely there in the movie. Mary and Pippin are weak characters and pretty much all of the gang are weakly written. But i'll give it the benefit of the doubt that they will be developed on the second and third movie and this movie had clearly story driven characters cause Frodo is kind of a passive character. Frodo made about two choices in the movie. The first one that starts the adventure, that choice was so that he could survive and that the world would go under and that gandalf told him to make that choice. The second one was Frodo decided all by himself but the rest of the movie Frodo and all the other characters are let stuff happen to them which makes them passive. It's nothing wrong with that and they could do alot to change that anyways but they should have atleast gave all the characters a little more depth not a lot but just a little. And i think Frodo should have somewhat changed in the first movie like for example he is going a little bit more crazy cause of the ring but i believe that they would keep that in the sequel and i am sure that the sequel is going to be better than the first one.VERDICT Overall a solid movie with some problems but they aren't major problems and i recommend this movie",second one is 4 hours long kill me,this movie is good actually its enjoyable fantasy adventure that will give you fun ride it has some pacing issues at beginning movie but after like 1 hour or so movie gets better with its pacing action is well done i enjoyed it throughout movie but there is this one problem with movie which i will talk about characters characters are very weak frodo is weak protagonist sam is barely there movie mary pippin are weak characters pretty much all gang are weakly written but ill give it benefit doubt that they will be developed second third movie this movie had clearly story driven characters cause frodo is kind passive character frodo made about two choices movie first one that starts adventure that choice was so that he could survive that world would go under that gandalf told him make that choice second one was frodo decided all by himself but rest movie frodo all other characters are let stuff happen them which makes them passive its nothing wrong with that they could do alot change that anyways but they should have atleast gave all characters little more depth not lot but just little i think frodo should have somewhat changed first movie like example he is going little bit more crazy cause ring but i believe that they would keep that sequel i am sure that sequel is going be better than first one verdict overall solid movie with some problems but they arent major problems i recommend this movie,0.4470441595441596,0.07083333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.48}"
