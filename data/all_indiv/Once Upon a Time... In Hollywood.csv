10.0,"Best Movie I Have Seen In At Least 10 Years, Should Be Seen Twice, BIG SPOILERS","I have seen this film twice in the last two days, I probably will see it many more times.Tarantino has shocked and surprised me before, but this was the biggest shock of all. The movie is set in the Hollywood of 1969, just before the brutal Manson family murders.Leonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal's gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of ""Bounty Law"" a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen's ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series ""Lancer"" is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against ""The Mod Squad"" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the ""Lancer"" episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also.Margot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch ""The Wrecking Crew"" a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan.The film starts to turn dark when Cliff picks up a teenage girl hitchhiker who wants to be taken to Spahn Ranch, a run down movie set where he once worked. I have read nearly everything about the Manson case, so I knew where it was going now. Cliff sees a bunch of mostly hippie girls hanging around and asks if George Spahn the original owner of the ranch still lives there. The scenes at the ranch are quietly disturbing. Dakota Fanning (I did not recognize her) plays Squeaky, one of the real life Manson girls. Her vacant eyes and cold manner make for some suspenseful moments. Cliff is concerned about his old friend George and demands to see him. He finds him now old and blind (Bruce Dern in a great cameo) but at least alive. Cliff is still suspicious but leaves the ranch.The final act comes up for the biggest shock of all. Rick has returned from several months filming some spaghetti westerns in Italy.He has also gotten married to an Italian actress. It is now August 8 1969. Cliff and his faithful pit bull Brandy are staying the night at Rick's house. Sharon Tate and some of her friends arrive at her home (which is right next door to Rick) to spend the evening together. Then Manson followers Charles ""Tex"" Watson, Patricia ""Katie"" Krenwinkel, Susan ""Sadie"" Atkins and Linda Kasabian are driving up the road. I knew what was coming and was dreading this moment, I was hoping that Tarantino would not show the gruesome murders but I was preparing myself. Then Rick hears them driving up and has an angry altercation with them, then I was a bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters on a night when a horrible historic moment happened. When Rick goes into the house, the killers suddenly realize that he was the star of the TV show ""Bounty Law"". Then psycho Sadie goes on a rant about how TV showed her generation how to kill by showing murders every week on the small screen. I had heard some Manson followers had actually said this. Linda is too scared to go with the other three and takes the car keys and drives off leaving them. Another change in the real story, Linda did not participate in the murders but did stay with them, so once again I am getting bewildered. Tex, Sadie and Katie than decide to go to Rick's house rather than Sharon's. I am wondering are they now going to kill them also? Then the most surprising thing happens, Cliff, his pit bull and Rick decide to fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them to be battered and massacred. Brandy has some great scenes as one of the most heroic dogs I have seen in film. My head was reeling by this time, I kept thinking ""Are they really doing this?"" Then came the ending, Rick is now safe, Cliff injured but alive. And now Rick gets to meet his next door neighbor Sharon and her friends. I am still in shock but then for the first time we see the title on screen ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" and then I finally get it, this is a Hollywood story not real life, this is what we wish would have happened.I finally had to see the film again for a second time so I could actually enjoy that climatic scene, without the dread and confusion I had the first time. This is a phenomenal work, like nothing I have ever seen and probably never will again.",best movie i have seen at least 10 years should be seen twice big spoilers,i have seen this film twice last two days i probably will see it many more times tarantino has shocked surprised me before but this was biggest shock all movie is set hollywood 1969 just before brutal manson family murders leonard dicaprio brad pitt give career high performances dicaprio is rick dalton tv cowboy actor who longs movie stardom but has now hit skids pitt plays cliff booth his stunt double driver all around best bud they also represent doubles each other real life though dalton is angry frustrated at his failings life while booth is perfectly happy be his pals gopher handyman there is good recreations tv westerns time dalton had been star bounty law show that never existed but is clearly based steve mcqueens wanted dead or alive series dalton is now playing guest role villains tv actual series lancer is recreated here i never saw this show when it aired since it was up against mod squad late 1960s early 1970s dalton has some funny touching scenes opposite precocious 8 year old actress while doing lancer episode late luke perry has his final film appearance these scenes also margot robbie has almost magical presence playing actress sharon tate tate unfortunately is best known today as most famous manson family murder victims we see not only how beautiful she was but also how good kind she was as well one my favorite scenes is when she goes movie theater watch wrecking crew film she made 1968 with dean martin we see actual clips movie with real sharon tate cuts back her reactions she becomes delighted when audience laughs at her comedy bits applauds at her fight scene with nancy kwan film starts turn dark when cliff picks up teenage girl hitchhiker who wants be taken spahn ranch run down movie set where he once worked i have read nearly everything about manson case so i knew where it was going now cliff sees bunch mostly hippie girls hanging around asks if george spahn original owner ranch still lives there scenes at ranch are quietly disturbing dakota fanning i did not recognize her plays squeaky one real life manson girls her vacant eyes cold manner make some suspenseful moments cliff is concerned about his old friend george demands see him he finds him now old blind bruce dern great cameo but at least alive cliff is still suspicious but leaves ranch final act comes up biggest shock all rick has returned several months filming some spaghetti westerns italy he has also gotten married italian actress it is now august 8 1969 cliff his faithful pit bull brandy are staying night at ricks house sharon tate some her friends arrive at her home which is right next door rick spend evening together then manson followers charles tex watson patricia katie krenwinkel susan sadie atkins linda kasabian are driving up road i knew what was coming was dreading this moment i was hoping that tarantino would not show gruesome murders but i was preparing myself then rick hears them driving up has angry altercation with them then i was bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters night when horrible historic moment happened when rick goes into house killers suddenly realize that he was star tv show bounty law then psycho sadie goes rant about how tv showed her generation how kill by showing murders every week small screen i had heard some manson followers had actually said this linda is too scared go with other three takes car keys drives off leaving them another change real story linda did not participate murders but did stay with them so once again i am getting bewildered tex sadie katie than decide go ricks house rather than sharons i am wondering are they now going kill them also then most surprising thing happens cliff his pit bull rick decide fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them be battered massacred brandy has some great scenes as one most heroic dogs i have seen film my head was reeling by this time i kept thinking are they really doing this then came ending rick is now safe cliff injured but alive now rick gets meet his next door neighbor sharon her friends i am still shock but then first time we see title screen once upon time hollywood then i finally get it this is hollywood story not real life this is what we wish would have happened i finally had see film again second time so i could actually enjoy that climatic scene without dread confusion i had first time this is phenomenal work like nothing i have ever seen probably never will again,0.4913932980599646,0.12313291646624977,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
4.0,Do we need a tenth?,"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood has been receiving some great reviews (it's currently rated 8.3 here on IMDb), but I think it's one of Tarantino's weakest movies. For well over two hours, virtually nothing of interest happens: as much as I didn't particularly enjoy Kill Bill Pt 2, Death Proof or Jackie Brown, I can't say I was bored, but OUATIH is just that -- boring! There's none of Tarantino's sparkling dialogue, no iconic scenes, and the ending simply pulls off the same trick that the director employed in Inglourious Basterds -- changing history (only in this instance, it all seems to be in questionable taste given what really happened fifty years ago).As a fan of cult movies, Italian westerns, Bruce Lee and old TV shows, and as someone with an interest in the Manson murders, I fully expected to be enthralled by Tarantino's re-creation of 60s Hollywood, its colourful characters, and one of the darkest moments in its history, but was totally taken aback by how mundane this movie is. If you want to watch Brad Pitt feed his dog, mend a TV aerial and drive a car, then this is the movie for you; if you want to see Leonardo DiCaprio talk about books to an 8 year old and record an episode of a dull TV western (a scene that went on way too long) then have at it. I think that if this is the standard of movie that Tarantino is dishing up, he should call it quits at nine.4/10 for the face-smashing, dog-biting, flame-throwing finalé, which actually perked me up. But that's being generous.",do we need tenth,once upon time hollywood has been receiving some great reviews its currently rated 8 3 here imdb but i think its one tarantinos weakest movies well over two hours virtually nothing interest happens as much as i didnt particularly enjoy kill bill pt 2 death proof or jackie brown i cant say i was bored but ouatih is just that boring theres none tarantinos sparkling dialogue no iconic scenes ending simply pulls off same trick that director employed inglourious basterds changing history only this instance it all seems be questionable taste given what really happened fifty years ago as fan cult movies italian westerns bruce lee old tv shows as someone with interest manson murders i fully expected be enthralled by tarantinos re creation 60s hollywood its colourful characters one darkest moments its history but was totally taken aback by how mundane this movie is if you want watch brad pitt feed his dog mend tv aerial drive car then this is movie you if you want see leonardo dicaprio talk about books 8 year old record episode dull tv western scene that went way too long then have at it i think that if this is standard movie that tarantino is dishing up he should call it quits at nine 4 10 face smashing dog biting flame throwing final which actually perked me up but thats being generous,0.4478670634920634,-0.04409722222222223,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"
5.0,Mediocre and Overrated Film,"""Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood"" is one of the most overrated film released by Hollywood industry. The hype is difficult to be understood but certainly has influenced those puppets that like to read the professional reviews to have their own opinion. The screenplay is boring and the good point is the references to films and the soundtrack based on the 60's. As usual in Quentin Tarantino's films, the cast is impressive. But this time, the film is a great disappointment. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): 'Era Uma Vez em...

3.0,The Emperor with No Clothes,It reminds me of that old fable. People go to see Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in a film by Tarantino and assume it has to be great despite what they are actually seeing on the screen..

8.0,QT9 - a Hollywood fairy tale,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled ""Bounty Law"". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent ""Fosse/Verdon"" or ""The Leftovers"", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (""Lancer""). 90 year old Clu Gulager (""The Virginian"", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (""Lancer""). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to ""catch"" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone.",qt9 hollywood fairy tale,greetings again darkness hippies westerns short skirts pompadours catchy pop songs all have mostly disappeared our world back save day memories twist little history

1.0,Was I even watching the same film?,"All this critical acclaim for this film (mainly because it's a Tarantino one) is so baffling. So what's wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It's a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the 'era' - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or 'real life' characters like Sam Wannamaker's appearance - that just aren't needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?This was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones.

7.0,Just kept waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting,"I love Tarantino. I was super excited to see this. The movie started. And then it went. And I waited for the plot. And then it came and went within the last 15 minutes of the film. Then I left confused and a little disappointed.The movie just felt like Tarantino wanted to show off how much he knows about film history and how nostalgic the old Hollywood made him feel. The acting was amazing. The cinematography was amazing. The storyline just wasn't there though. I want to say I loved it so bad but it just felt so flat to me.The characters didn't really develop at all. Leo's character just kind of changed halfway through with only a narration as to why he was different. Brad Pitts character was the exact same the entire film. Margot Robbie's characters development was that she finally said like 20 words at the very end.The ending was the most enjoyable part without a doubt. That felt like a classic Tarantino scene.

5.0,Much ado about nothing.,"DiCaprio and Pitt collaborate with Tarantino once again for the directors ninth (and supposedly penultimate) feature film as writer/director. Set in 1969 Hollywood, the film follows fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his loyal stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they navigate their way through the absurdities of Hollywood life. Inbetween their exploits we follow Sharon Tate (Robbie), who gleefully indulges in all the fun and glamour that Tinseltown has to offer. I'm a big Tarantino fan, so naturally my expectations for Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood were high. What a shame it is then to report his ninth feature is an uneven, average affair that doesn't live up to the brilliance of his previous efforts.Both DiCaprio and Pitt make for a great pairing, and they both carry the film even throughout its most sluggish moments. Margot Robbie is sadly wasted in the film as Tarantino gives her practically nothing of worth to work with, resulting in what feels more like an over glorified cameo as opposed to a legitimate role worth playing. Narratively speaking, the film is uneven and at times tedious to sit through. Tarantino is known for his engaging storylines, intriguing characters and sharp dialogue, but none of that is to be found here. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood doesn't really have a cohesive storyline, emphasized largely by the elimination of chapter breakdowns, a storytelling technique Tarantino is widely known for. At its core, it's a celebration of Hollywood moviemaking during the sixties and an exploration into the relationships between actors and their stunt doubles. While there are a handful of noteworthy scenes to be found here, they aren't enough to save the film from being a pretty average affair. Technically speaking the film is very well made and contains great shot composition along with a solid soundtrack. Unfortunately, there just aren't many ideas on display worthy of hanging a feature film on, making for a disappointing outing from one of the modern masters of cinema. If this is indeed Tarantino's penultimate effort, hopefully his swansong will return to the quality of his previous works.",much ado about nothing,dicaprio pitt collaborate with tarantino once again directors ninth supposedly penultimate feature film as writer director set 1969 hollywood film follows fading actor rick dalton dicaprio his loyal stunt double cliff booth pitt as they navigate their way through absurdities hollywood life inbetween their exploits we follow sharon tate robbie who gleefully indulges all fun glamour that tinseltown has offer im big tarantino fan so naturally my expectations once upon time hollywood were high what shame it is then report his ninth feature is uneven average affair that doesnt live up brilliance his previous efforts both dicaprio pitt make great pairing they both carry film even throughout its most sluggish moments margot robbie is sadly wasted film as tarantino gives her practically nothing worth work with resulting what feels more like over glorified cameo as opposed legitimate role worth playing narratively speaking film is uneven at times tedious sit through tarantino is known his engaging storylines intriguing characters sharp dialogue but none that is be found here once upon time hollywood doesnt really have cohesive storyline emphasized largely by elimination chapter breakdowns storytelling technique tarantino is widely known at its core its celebration hollywood moviemaking during sixties exploration into relationships between actors their stunt doubles while there are handful noteworthy scenes be found here they arent enough save film being pretty average affair technically speaking film is very well made contains great shot composition along with solid soundtrack unfortunately there just arent many ideas display worthy hanging feature film making disappointing outing one modern masters cinema if this is indeed tarantinos penultimate effort hopefully his swansong will return quality his previous works,0.4311904761904762,0.10444691273638641,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.56}"
10.0,A love letter to all that is Hollywood,"Just got out of a screening. This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It's also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn't dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It's a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it's movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life.

6.0,Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is maybe proof that Quentin Tarantino ranks alongside Stanley Kubrick. Both started to make overlong movies and were lionised by critics, many who were afraid to be critical of them.This might be Tarantino's most self indulgent film so far despite being a glorious period piece.Set in Los Angeles 1969. The film is an alternate history as it focuses on Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was once a star of the hit television show Bounty Law. Now Dalton's career is fading. He drinks too much, he does not remember his lines and his regular work is guest starring as the villain of the week.Accompanying Dalton is his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) who acts as his driver and gofer. Booth is also short of work as he has a bad reputation in the stunt industry.Living next door to Dalton in LA is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) who has just moved in with her director husband Roman Polanski. Life for her is attending parties and going to the cinema to see her latest movie.Dalton wonders if he should take up a suggestion to go and work in Italy and make spaghetti westerns which could kick start his career. Booth gave a pretty hippy a lift to a ranch which is full of strange people belonging to a cult. Booth seemed to have rubbed them up the wrong way.Eventually the various people cross paths in this reimagining of what might have happened on a fateful night in 1969.There is no doubt that that DiCaprio and Pitt give their all in this film as two middle aged men fading away at an uncertain time. Tarantino seems to have given this film a conservative hue, he really dislikes the counterculture. I wonder if he is angry with the #metoo movement which destroyed his friend Harvey Weinstein and raised questions over his own conduct in the past.Clocking in at under 3 hours this film meanders until it reaches its explosive climax. Until then you wonder what exactly is the story. The movie is a series of vignettes that hints at a director/screenwriter who is past his prime and seems to be obsessed with bare feet.",once upon time hollywood,once upon time hollywood is maybe proof that quentin tarantino ranks alongside stanley kubrick both started make overlong movies were lionised by critics many who were afraid be critical them this might be tarantinos most self indulgent film so far despite being glorious period piece set los angeles 1969 film is alternate history as it focuses rick dalton leonardo dicaprio who was once star hit television show bounty law now daltons career is fading he drinks too much he does not remember his lines his regular work is guest starring as villain week accompanying dalton is his stunt double cliff booth brad pitt who acts as his driver gofer booth is also short work as he has bad reputation stunt industry living next door dalton la is actress sharon tate margot robbie who has just moved with her director husband roman polanski life her is attending parties going cinema see her latest movie dalton wonders if he should take up suggestion go work italy make spaghetti westerns which could kick start his career booth gave pretty hippy lift ranch which is full strange people belonging cult booth seemed have rubbed them up wrong way eventually various people cross paths this reimagining what might have happened fateful night 1969 there is no doubt that that dicaprio pitt give their all this film as two middle aged men fading away at uncertain time tarantino seems have given this film conservative hue he really dislikes counterculture i wonder if he is angry with movement which destroyed his friend harvey weinstein raised questions over his own conduct past clocking at under 3 hours this film meanders until it reaches its explosive climax until then you wonder what exactly is story movie is series vignettes that hints at director screenwriter who is past his prime seems be obsessed with bare feet,0.46184792219274984,0.0017241379310344866,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.2, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,A meandering masterpiece ... I didn't want it to end,"This is such an unusual movie. It doesn't really have a plot ... it's kind of like a ""day in the life of a fading Hollywood TV actor"", but still it's just fascinating to watch. The acting, cinematography and production values for capturing the late 60s (and really ... dawn of the 70s) are about as good as you'll ever see. It's just art.And when it comes the ending ... wow. Especially if you know a bit of history. It's intense and amazing and I'll just leave it at that.That said, it is a little male-biased by modern standards, but it's capturing the mentality of a different time period. DiCaprio and Pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want to keep watching to see they do next. They will quite possibly win Oscars for their performances -- and Tarantino will no doubt be up for best director, best original screenplay and best film.If you enjoy Tarantino's moviemaking style - the dialog, the visuals, the period details and, yes ... the violence ... this is a must see. It's almost 2 and 3/4 hours - but I would have gladly stayed longer.BTW, if you stay a minute into the end-credits, there's a post credit scene followed by a fun radio (audio-only) contest commercial.",meandering masterpiece i didnt want it end,this is such unusual movie it doesnt really have plot its kind like day life fading hollywood tv actor but still its just fascinating watch acting cinematography production values capturing late 60s really dawn 70s are about as good as youll ever see its just art when it comes ending wow especially if you know bit history its intense amazing ill just leave it at that that said it is little male biased by modern standards but its capturing mentality different time period dicaprio pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want keep watching see they do next they will quite possibly win oscars their performances tarantino will no doubt be up best director best original screenplay best film if you enjoy tarantinos moviemaking style dialog visuals period details yes violence this is must see its almost 2 3 4 hours but i would have gladly stayed longer btw if you stay minute into end credits theres post credit scene followed by fun radio audio only contest commercial,0.5533333333333333,0.26958333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.28}"
5.0,Why 161 minutes?,"I can't deny it ... I'm an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer, and I will probably always remain an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer. The man simply is a genius when it comes down to writing dazzling dialogues, getting the most out of stellar ensemble casts and depicting extreme but delirious violence. QT also always was the only director of whom I tolerated exaggeratedly long movies. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Inglorious Bastards"", etc, it never bothered me that they lasted two and a half hours. But since, say, ""Django Unchained"", I'm noticing an increasingly worrying trend when I watch his newest movies. They are getting too long and far too tedious. They are generally still fine films, but when re-watching, I find myself fast-forwarding the overlong dialogues and only focusing on the violent parts. In case of ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", I'm afraid I'll be skipping the full first two hours!It's interesting to watch once, perhaps, but the fan-boy fantasy tale of ""Hollywood in the Sixties"" that Tarantino penned down is honestly quite dull, repetitive and substantially void. It's literally just endlessly long sequences of Leonardi DiCaprio (a washed-up TV-western idol from the 50s) rehearsing his lines for a new show, Brad Pitt (an unemployed stunt double) feeding his dog and cruising around LA to pick up young hippie girls, and Margot Robbie (as Sharon Tate) parading around town and looking at herself on the big screen. You probably read it before in other reviews, but it's a sad truth: absolutely nothing interesting happens, and some sequences - notably when Brad Pitt ""trespasses"" into the hippie trailer park - are even downright pathetic. The last forty minutes are fabulous, though. You may regain consciousness as soon as you see the message ""6 months later"" appear on the screen. As an enormous fan of Italian exploitation of the sixties & seventies, I really adored how Tarantino sent DiCaprio's actor character to Rome and star in exhilarating trash titles like ""Nebraska Jim"", ""Shoot Ringo, said the Gringo"" or ""Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!"". When returning to their home in the Hollywood Hills, they are confronted with members of the notorious Manson Family that are out to kill Sharon Tate and her friends, but Quentin Tarantino gives history a sort of absurdly cool twist. The climax isn't so surprising or innovative if you have seen ""Inglourious Bastards"", but at least it finally provides the movie with what I had desperately been anticipating for more than two hours: sick, extreme and unhinged violence!",why 161 minutes,i cant deny it im avid quentin tarantino admirer i will probably always remain avid quentin tarantino admirer man simply is genius when it comes down writing dazzling dialogues getting most out stellar ensemble casts depicting extreme but delirious violence qt also always was only director whom i tolerated exaggeratedly long movies pulp fiction kill bill inglorious bastards etc it never bothered me that they lasted two half hours but since say django unchained im noticing increasingly worrying trend when i watch his newest movies they are getting too long far too tedious they are generally still fine films but when re watching i find myself fast forwarding overlong dialogues only focusing violent parts case once upon time hollywood im afraid ill be skipping full first two hours its interesting watch once perhaps but fan boy fantasy tale hollywood sixties that tarantino penned down is honestly quite dull repetitive substantially void its literally just endlessly long sequences leonardi dicaprio washed up tv western idol 50s rehearsing his lines new show brad pitt unemployed stunt double feeding his dog cruising around la pick up young hippie girls margot robbie as sharon tate parading around town looking at herself big screen you probably read it before other reviews but its sad truth absolutely nothing interesting happens some sequences notably when brad pitt trespasses into hippie trailer park are even downright pathetic last forty minutes are fabulous though you may regain consciousness as soon as you see message 6 months later appear screen as enormous fan italian exploitation sixties seventies i really adored how tarantino sent dicaprios actor character rome star exhilarating trash titles like nebraska jim shoot ringo said gringo or operazione dyn o mite when returning their home hollywood hills they are confronted with members notorious manson family that are out kill sharon tate her friends but quentin tarantino gives history sort absurdly cool twist climax isnt so surprising or innovative if you have seen inglourious bastards but at least it finally provides movie with what i had desperately been anticipating more than two hours sick extreme unhinged violence,0.6033620645227786,0.039183931148216854,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
5.0,Once upon a time ... in Tarantino's head.,"'Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood (2019)' is disappointing. Frankly, it's just not very good. It not only lacks substance, it lacks style. The story meanders, the characters don't change, the plot-lines don't gel and the entire thing just feels like a bit of a wasted opportunity. It doesn't seem to be about anything, really. It's as if Tarantino decided to set a film in Hollywood in the 60s, then started writing and just didn't stop until he'd ran out of paper. Don't get me wrong, the filmmaking is on relatively fine form; the camera-work is assured, the cinematography is clean, the set-design and costuming are cohesive and the performances are all pretty much perfect. It's just the storytelling that's subpar. Rather than showing any real reverence for the period, the piece appears to despise it - or, at least, have no respect for it. I mean, you just have to look at the much-discussed Bruce Lee scene to see that (seriously, what's his problem with Bruce Lee?). This would be a strange stance for any cinephile to take, let alone perhaps pop-culture's most renowned cinephile, and it does make you wonder why Tarantino even bothered to dip into the cinematic history that he has so often aped. It's not even as if it's some sort of satire, which could have had the potential to work. Instead, it honestly comes across as fodder to feed an ego; most of the time, it's either like we're directly being given a history lesson or indirectly being told what would have happened if the writer-director was around back then. The alternate-history angle is perhaps the most intriguing thing about the entire enterprise, but it's mostly squandered on childish caricatures or tired machoism. In either case, it's inconsequential outside of enabling the two core characters to exist in a more-or-less recognisable 'real world'. The biggest changes don't hold any proper 'what if' weight because their aftermath is never explored and the characters they most keenly affect aren't really characters at all. This sadly includes Sharon Tate. It's bizarre that a story which apparently started with the intent of exploring and celebrating her very real life instead ended up focusing on two entirely made-up men. Tate gets no real agency and has a limited role, mainly serving to remind the audience of the odd fact/fiction dynamic and the looming Manson threat. While I'm on the subject and without spoiling anything, it's safe to say that the picture ends in quite a bit of bloodshed - if not in the way you expect. It's arguably Tarantino's most violent - or, I suppose, 'sadistic' - piece, mainly because of its apparent realism and accompanying brutality. The thing is that it's just so unnecessary and unnecessarily gratuitous, actually feeling unjustified in its near-glamorisation. There's this uncomfortable sense of 'revenge', I guess. I'm not one to squirm at on-screen violence, either - I haven't flinched at any of Tarantino's previous efforts, for example. The strange thing is that the flick also makes a point of getting involved with the age-old 'movie violence vs real violence' debate, depicting its 'real violence' as much more disturbing than its 'movie violence' but also going out of its way to have a few characters name 'movie violence' as the inspiration for their attempts at 'real violence'. The messaging is mixed, to say the least, and will do the filmmaker no favours when it comes to journalists poking at his stance on the matter. At least, I suppose, there's an awareness of theme in this aspect, however unhelpful its conclusion may be. The rest of the picture doesn't seem to have any semblance of this, settling instead for a scene-by-scene sort of thing that never really comes together. In a way, there's a plot but there's not a narrative (loosely speaking). Some of it is quite entertaining, to be fair. It's not exactly boring but it's not exactly engaging, either. The best stuff involves Dalton shooting a guest-spot on a western TV show; these scenes are fairly enjoyable, bring out the best in DiCaprio and feature a 'film within a film' that's probably more fun than the film itself. The sequences with Booth just feel like an extended B-plot, with no real drive behind them. The feature eventually gives up and skips forward a huge chunk of time, opting to use narrated exposition to fill in the gap and then over-explain a faster-paced final third. Interestingly, the stuff that is skipped appears as if it could have made for a more-than-decent story that actively changes the core characters. The final movement moves faster but it isn't any more compelling. Plus, by the time you get there, you've not got the energy to care. Overall, the picture is unfocused and unimpressive. It has its merits, of course, and the performances really are top-notch. However, it's not particularly entertaining and it's actually rather predictable. It's quite problematic, too; it has an undercurrent of unpunished, hero-perpetrated violence against women, for example. 5/10",once upon time tarantinos head,once upon time hollywood 2019 is disappointing frankly its just not very good it not only lacks substance it lacks style story meanders characters dont change plot lines dont gel entire thing just feels like bit wasted opportunity it doesnt seem be about anything really its as if tarantino decided set film hollywood 60s then started writing just didnt stop until hed ran out paper dont get me wrong filmmaking is relatively fine form camera work is assured cinematography is clean set design costuming are cohesive performances are all pretty much perfect its just storytelling thats subpar rather than showing any real reverence period piece appears despise it or at least have no respect it i mean you just have look at much discussed bruce lee scene see that seriously whats his problem with bruce lee this would be strange stance any cinephile take let alone perhaps pop cultures most renowned cinephile it does make you wonder why tarantino even bothered dip into cinematic history that he has so often aped its not even as if its some sort satire which could have had potential work instead it honestly comes across as fodder feed ego most time its either like were directly being given history lesson or indirectly being told what would have happened if writer director was around back then alternate history angle is perhaps most intriguing thing about entire enterprise but its mostly squandered childish caricatures or tired machoism either case its inconsequential outside enabling two core characters exist more or less recognisable real world biggest changes dont hold any proper what if weight because their aftermath is never explored characters they most keenly affect arent really characters at all this sadly includes sharon tate its bizarre that story which apparently started with intent exploring celebrating her very real life instead ended up focusing two entirely made up men tate gets no real agency has limited role mainly serving remind audience odd fact fiction dynamic looming manson threat while im subject without spoiling anything its safe say that picture ends quite bit bloodshed if not way you expect its arguably tarantinos most violent or i suppose sadistic piece mainly because its apparent realism accompanying brutality thing is that its just so unnecessary unnecessarily gratuitous actually feeling unjustified its near glamorisation theres this uncomfortable sense revenge i guess im not one squirm at screen violence either i havent flinched at any tarantinos previous efforts example strange thing is that flick also makes point getting involved with age old movie violence vs real violence debate depicting its real violence as much more disturbing than its movie violence but also going out its way have few characters name movie violence as inspiration their attempts at real violence messaging is mixed say least will do filmmaker no favours when it comes journalists poking at his stance matter at least i suppose theres awareness theme this aspect however unhelpful its conclusion may be rest picture doesnt seem have any semblance this settling instead scene by scene sort thing that never really comes together way theres plot but theres not narrative loosely speaking some it is quite entertaining be fair its not exactly boring but its not exactly engaging either best stuff involves dalton shooting guest spot western tv show these scenes are fairly enjoyable bring out best dicaprio feature film within film thats probably more fun than film itself sequences with booth just feel like extended b plot with no real drive behind them feature eventually gives up skips forward huge chunk time opting use narrated exposition fill gap then over explain faster paced final third interestingly stuff that is skipped appears as if it could have made more than decent story that actively changes core characters final movement moves faster but it isnt any more compelling plus by time you get there youve not got energy care overall picture is unfocused unimpressive it has its merits course performances really are top notch however its not particularly entertaining its actually rather predictable its quite problematic too it has undercurrent unpunished hero perpetrated violence against women example 5 10,0.47296855921855935,0.08411683904330965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.42}"

4.0,"Boring, boring, boring. Self-complacent ramblings about nothing","To say that this movie is self-complacent would be a gigantic understatement. As gigantic maybe as Tarantino's memory, overloaded with scores of details that he doesn't care to sort out. So he unloads them in bulk. The result : it's like you go to a promising party but end up cornered most of the night by some drunk guy who absolutely wants to share his opinions about everything.Right from the start you get vignette after vignette, self-indulgent, overlong spoof sequences that bog down the main narrative. What with all the stuff Tarantino has learnt about movies he can't shorten exposition to clever ellipses ? Once upon a time I thought he was very good with dialogue, but I guess it is no fun to toil and write fine lines (no just snappy one-liners from time to time) when Sony will greenlight anything you want to shoot.Once upon a time in Hollywood does not have a plot. It is the New Wave auteur in Tarantino who does not think he needs a plot. He has a couple of characters, a dozen anecdotes and the rest is talent. Self-conscious talent, lazy talent, talent isolated in the middle of a creative process. More like naked skills, each trying separately to express its full potential.The hero and his sidekick are losers: how do you build a story around losers ? You need rhythm and some kind of McGuffin (wasn't it all there in Pulp Fiction?), not some vague exploration of the meaning of life. The plot is limited to the draft premise: a has-been TV actor and his stunt double cope with reality in Hollywood around the time of the Manson Family murders. The backdrop of the murders is the only narrative asset. We are teased all along, we even have an extensive reconstitution of life at the Spahn Ranch... all this just to toy around and end with the kind of ultra-violent carnival that Tarantino fans seem to revere. Clearly the challenge of mentioning the sordid Tate-LaBianca murders of August 1969 was not only above Tarantino's mental ability, but grossly using background anecdotes from it as fodder for his inspiration was within his moral scope.As always I am judging this movie on its merits from a movie enthusiast point of view. But Tarantino is much more than a movie enthusiast. He is a guttonous movie fanatic. He is a guru with followers who let themselves be impressed, just like with Charles Manson.

10.0,California Dreaming.,"There may never be another filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino. If there is, we surely are in luck. But in all likelihood, future generations will just be students of his, and thank God for that fact alone. He's a filmmaker's filmmaker. His love of cinema verges on fetishism. His mission in life, it seems, was to keep his celluloid memories alive and in the American psyche in a time long past it's expiration date. So long as there's a reel and a way, Tarantino will give you a ticket to the greatest shows on earth, filled with filthy language and splattering gore violence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is his 9th feature film. It's been announced as his second to last film. Rumor has it, if the film basks in an exponentially warm reception, this could be his last film. I pray we can all sit down one last time for the number 10, but if Quentin is seriously considering it, I'll warmly and happily accept that. The truth is, it's all been leading up to this moment. Quentin's personal crescendo, encapsulating all he has learned and all he has experienced as a man living in Hollywood and a successful filmmaker from within it. He went for it, and he did it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the best film of 2019, and easily his best film since Pulp Fiction. For me, nothing short of perfect. Everything I wanted it to be, and yet it still shocked and surprised me. I'm convinced that after the second and even third viewings, i'll still find new things to love about it. For nearly three hours in length, it grabs you up from your seat and never lets go.Here's the story. The year is 1969. We meet the dashing Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his frisky stuntman sidekick, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The dynamic duo of black and white television, and old, gunslinging cowboy movies. They were the best, they were the most handsome and they were the most talented. They were the best actors in Hollywood.. until now. After an unkindly meeting with his agent, Marvin Schwartz (played in outrageous fashion by the great Al Pacino), Rick is told in no uncertain terms that his time as a leading man is over. In other words, he's lost everything. Reduced to playing walk-on roles in late-60's TV shows, and B-grade Italian spaghetti westerns that nobody will ever see. Devastated, he returns to sulk in his luxury home in the Hollywood hills, while Cliff goes home to a dingy trailer next-door to a drive-in movie theater, to feed his loyal pit-bull Brandy. California Dreaming is not all that it seems. But wouldn't you know it, Rick Dalton has a new neighbor. One Roman Polanksi and his wife, superstar Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). The contrast doesn't get much starker. As Rick Dalton disappears into the hazy California sunset, Tate and friends are dancing in the middle of it. We begin to alternate between these two stories. Rick Dalton's personal misery in landing mediocre roles, and Sharon Tate humbly enjoying her career at it's peak. She's so humble, in fact, she attends screenings of her own movies in town to kick her feet back and laugh with the audience. But in the middle of the high and hard times of show business, evil lurks in the background, ready to attack. That evil being the Manson family. Cliff, Rick and Sharon all have individual run-ins with Charlie and the gang, dismissing them as your average dirty hippies, not realizing they are all about to make a head-on collision with Helter Skelter.From it's very beginning, Tarantino doesn't just show you how things were in 1969, he places you there right along with it. I was there with all of them. Many of the sequences here include interludes of driving with an authentic live radio blasting (not unlike K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's) the soundtrack of our film. Killer psychedelic tunes and radio ads narrate the few times where our characters stay silent, which in any Tarantino film, is brief. The first hour and a half of the film may even puzzle viewers with how little happens between the characters. But that's the point. Tarantino places the audience through multiple POVs in order to illustrate this time in Hollywood. It was a technique I didn't expect, but I adored it all the same, and if anything, I'll always remember these sequences first when I think of the film. DiCaprio lights up the screen as the manically depressed Rick Dalton who goes between arrogantly strutting on set as if he's still a hot shot, to wrecking his trailer in a fit of insecurity and rage. Brad Pitt is effortlessly cool as Cliff Booth. Dude is the suavest partner-in-crime since Paul Newman. Robbie plays Tate, and with the responsibility of playing the prime victim of one of the most gruesome and horrifying murders in American history, she needed to bring honor in this special tribute to her. Not only did she bring honor, but she also brought beauty, grace, wistful optimism and love. If she had a a song, it would probably be ""Good Morning, Starshine"", though we all know she was a Paul Revere and the Raiders fan. Tate represents here all that was good of the late 60's. That far-out, free-spirited, love your neighbor, flower power that most Californians at that time adopted.. so long as you didn't take it to the extreme. If you did, you'd turn into one of those goddamn dirty hippies.That's the other thing that Tarantino explores in 1969. If you were worried about a film about the Manson family that glorifies them as super cool anti-heroes, you best sit down and let this film do the talking. Because Tarantino clearly doesn't just hate Charles Manson, he loathes him. The man who, in his mind, killed the 1960's and the Hollywood he loved. On that note, you might be asking yourself.. this film doesn't really reenact the events of that horrible night, does it? Well, I promise you, this is a spoiler free review, but lets just say the events of August 8th 1969 don't play out here as they did in history. What results is the biggest middle finger ever given to the Manson Family in an epic finale so mindbogglingly brutal and relentless, it will make your jaw drop.I left the theater having felt like I drank a strong cocktail of Boogie Nights and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, ripped a bong and got awakened by a punch in the face. This is a movie, and a trip and an experience you won't soon forget. See this thing, right now. See it twice. See it three times. Invite in into your head and let it stay there and stew. Explore this tapestry of Americana, booze, sex, drugs, rock' n' roll and movies. You'll be exhausted, but you will be satisfied.",california dreaming,there may never be another filmmaker like quentin tarantino if there is we surely are luck but all likelihood future generations

5.0,Oh so mediocre,"After all the hype around this film I was sorely disappointed. With an A List cast, as it had, it should have been Gold. The acting was terrific by Brad Pitt, Leonardo and Margot Robbie. The storyline sadly fell short, way short. The era was captured really well however I sat through the first hour thinking it was painting the scene and that the real action would start. I kept thinking that until the last 20 minutes when things finally came together, however, that was nearly 3 hours of film to sit through before any real appearance of the film I was expecting.",oh so mediocre,after all hype around this film i was sorely disappointed with list cast as it had it should have been gold acting was terrific by brad pitt leonardo margot robbie storyline sadly fell short way short era was captured really well however i sat through first hour thinking it was painting scene that real action would start i kept thinking that until last 20 minutes when things finally came together however that was nearly 3 hours film sit through before any real appearance film i was expecting,0.4857142857142857,-0.06071428571428571,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.15}"
9.0,"The more you appreciate cinema as an art, the more you will like this film","I would like to preface this review by expressing that I didn't particularly love this film as much as I expected to. Like many others, Tarantino is one of my favorite directors. I respect his fundamental consistency and his creative license above all else, and he lets both of those aspects shine through brightly in his 9th undertaking. It was this particular flavor of storytelling that he used this time around that I wasn't fond of. There was nothing difficult to follow about it, but it just didn't want to piece itself together into any coherent arcs. I can certainly appreciate that this was the feel Tarantino was going for, but it was not one I could appreciate during my viewing. With that being said, the story wraps up into a bizarre, unique, and satisfying conclusion that reminded me why I will always be in theaters for this director. What makes Tarantino so great is that he maintains such sound film fundamentals when taking on these strange and creative projects. His actors blew their roles out of the water, his cinematographer enhanced their potent performances further, and his set/costume decorators crafted a world of immersion. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a film everyone will love, but it is a film everyone should see.",more you appreciate cinema as art more you will like this film,i would like preface this review by expressing that i didnt particularly love this film as much as i expected like many others tarantino is one my favorite directors i respect his fundamental consistency his creative license above all else he lets both those aspects shine through brightly his 9th undertaking it was this particular flavor storytelling that he used this time around that i wasnt fond there was nothing difficult follow about it but it just didnt want piece itself together into any coherent arcs i can certainly appreciate that this was feel tarantino was going but it was not one i could appreciate during my viewing with that being said story wraps up into bizarre unique satisfying conclusion that reminded me why i will always be theaters this director what makes tarantino so great is that he maintains such sound film fundamentals when taking these strange creative projects his actors blew their roles out water his cinematographer enhanced their potent performances further his set costume decorators crafted world immersion once upon time hollywood is not film everyone will love but it is film everyone should see,0.6251984126984127,0.3294146825396826,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.37, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.26}"

5.0,More self-indulgence from the most over-rated director in living memory,"Beware spoilers!Rick is a fading star of westerns and action films and TV series in the late 60s. He hangs around with his underused stunt double Cliff, who is also his buddy, driver, and general gofer. Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate have just moved in next door. Rick is experiencing insecurity as his career dwindles, while Cliff gives a cute underdressed teen a lift to the Spahn Ranch where her distinctly unsettling commune lives. 6 months later, Sharon Tate, is pregnant, and Rick returns from Italy with 4 spaghetti westerns under his belt, a new Italian wife, and insufficient resources to keep employing Cliff. They have just returned to Rick's house after a final celebration when 4 members of the Manson family turn up, ready to carry out the celebrated Sharon Tate murders. One of them runs away, the other 3 enter Rick's house where Cliff kills 2 of them, getting injured, Rick kills the other one then goes to have a cup of tea with Sharon Tate as Rick goes off to hospital.Yes, the Sharon Tate murders never happened. Would that it were so.I was not disappointed with this film because I have never subscribed to the view that Tarantino is a masterpiece-making wunderkind. He is undoubtedly hugely talented, but he also has a terrible propensity for self-indulgence which he exercises at the expense of the film he is making: the film is in service to Tarantino rather than vice versa. The labelling of this offering as ""The 9th film by Quentn Tarantino"" is arrogant and pretentious in equal measure.This film has many, many flaws. They include: 1. Lengthy shots of people driving around during which nothing happens and which serve no purpose. 2. A huge amount of time during which Tarantino shows us that he can emulate the look and feel of 60s movies. We know, Quentin. 3. Various plot elements introduced which turn out to have little or no plot relevance: the death of Cliff's wife, George Spahn, and Rick's interaction with the girl actor, to name but 3.There are enjoyable elements here - the girl is excellent - but they combine together to add at least an hour to the running time without moving the film an inch further forward. The film is vastly padded because Tarantino loves the sound of his own voice too much. There are those who will say it is his loving homage to Holywood. To which I say "" Watch Hugo, Quentin, and see how Scorsese's love story to cinema is intertwined with a proper story.""I have chosen to spoiler the absence of the Tate murders. This not because I didn't like the would-be murderers getting a comeuppance they avoided in real life - far from it. But the film trades on a real-life tragedy to put rear end on seats, and then plays Tarantino games with it. It is used as a PR trick rather being addressed in the way it deserves.Tarantino's genuine cinematic gift comes out in the scene where Cliff encounters the Family at the Spahn Ranch. The unsettling sense of unease is cleverly built up and used. I wish the rest of the film had used its time as profitably. But Tarantino's self-indulgence overpowers everything.",more self indulgence most over rated director living memory,beware spoilers rick is fading star westerns action films tv series late 60s he hangs around with his underused stunt double cliff who is also his buddy driver general gofer roman polanski sharon tate have just moved next door rick is experiencing insecurity as his career dwindles while cliff gives cute underdressed teen lift spahn ranch where her distinctly unsettling commune lives 6 months later sharon tate is pregnant rick returns italy with 4 spaghetti westerns under his belt new italian wife insufficient resources keep employing cliff they have just returned ricks house after final celebration when 4 members manson family turn up ready carry out celebrated sharon tate murders one them runs away other 3 enter ricks house where cliff kills 2 them getting injured rick kills other one then goes have cup tea with sharon tate as rick goes off hospital yes sharon tate murders never happened would that it were so i was not disappointed with this film because i have never subscribed view that tarantino is masterpiece making wunderkind he is undoubtedly hugely talented but he also has terrible propensity self indulgence which he exercises at expense film he is making film is service tarantino rather than vice versa labelling this offering as 9th film by quentn tarantino is arrogant pretentious equal measure this film has many many flaws they include 1 lengthy shots people driving around during which nothing happens which serve no purpose 2 huge amount time during which tarantino shows us that he can emulate look feel 60s movies we know quentin 3 various plot elements introduced which turn out have little or no plot relevance death cliffs wife george spahn ricks interaction with girl actor name but 3 there are enjoyable elements here girl is excellent but they combine together add at least hour running time without moving film inch further forward film is vastly padded because tarantino loves sound his own voice too much there are those who will say it is his loving homage holywood which i say watch hugo quentin see how scorseses love story cinema is intertwined with proper story i have chosen spoiler absence tate murders this not because i didnt like would be murderers getting comeuppance they avoided real life far it but film trades real life tragedy put rear end seats then plays tarantino games with it it is used as pr trick rather being addressed way it deserves tarantinos genuine cinematic gift comes out scene where cliff encounters family at spahn ranch unsettling sense unease is cleverly built up used i wish rest film had used its time as profitably but tarantinos self indulgence overpowers everything,0.5195391414141414,0.1387784090909091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"
