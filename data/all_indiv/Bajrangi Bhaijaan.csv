9.0,A Winner All The Way!,"Kabir Khan triumphs with a yet another winner with 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. Khan delivers a film thats heartwarming, emotional & extremely entertaining. And Salman is exceptional, delivering his finest performance to date in the title role. 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' Synopsis: A young mute girl from Pakistan loses herself in India with no way to head back. A devoted man with a magnanimous spirit undertakes the task to get her back to her motherland and unite her with her family.'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a heartwarming tale about love & unity. Though a subtle father-daughter story at heart, the film is also an effective commentary on the India-Pakistan conflict/relationship, that exists even today. The narrative beautifully makes space for humour, strong emotions & also poignant drama. While the first-hour, set in India warms up, with defining its characters & shifting between songs, its the second-hour that takes 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' to the epitome. The story shifts to Pakistan & the series of events that follow with its endearing protagonist & the child, are undeniably engaging & moving. And the climax, though slightly melodramatic, that too leaves an impact. Khan, V. Vijayendra Prasad, Parveez Shaikh & Asad Hussai's Screenplay is excellent. It very believably blends many emotions & also courageously comments on the long-lasting topic of India-Pakistan. But its done effectively. Barring the slightly under-whelming climax, the Writing is consistently engaging otherwise. Khan's Direction is top-notch. He has handled the film with skill. Aseem Mishra's Cinematography captures the Stunning Locales of Kashmir, superbly. Editing is mostly crisp, although the film runs for over a 155-minutes. Music by Various Artists is lovely. Art & Costume Design are satisfactory. Performance-Wise: Salman is at his best here. As Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi Bhaijaan, the Superstar enacts the god-loving, clean-hearted soul, with excellence. He's restrained, affecting & absolutely lovable, proving once again that he's much more than a box-offer thunder. He's the soul of 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. Child Artiste Harshaali Malhotra is adorable. Her on-screen chemistry with Salman, melts your heart. Kareena Kapoor Khan is charming in a brief, yet substantial role. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is top-notch, yet again! He brings the house down with his brilliant comic-timing & walks away with some of the film's best moments, as well. Om Puri shines in a cameo. Sharat Saxena is good. Others lend fair support.On the whole, 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' has its heart & soul at the right place. It wins you over completely, with its heart touching story. Strongly Recommended!",winner all way,kabir khan triumphs with yet another winner with bajrangi bhaijaan khan delivers film thats heartwarming emotional extremely entertaining salman is exceptional delivering his finest performance date title role bajrangi bhaijaan synopsis young mute girl pakistan loses herself india with no way head back devoted man with magnanimous spirit undertakes task get her back her motherland unite her with her family bajrangi bhaijaan is heartwarming tale about love unity though subtle father daughter story at heart film is also effective commentary india pakistan conflict relationship that exists even today narrative beautifully makes space humour strong emotions also poignant drama while first hour set india warms up with defining its characters shifting between songs its second hour that takes bajrangi bhaijaan epitome story shifts pakistan series events that follow with its endearing protagonist child are undeniably engaging moving climax though slightly melodramatic that too leaves impact khan v vijayendra prasad parveez shaikh asad hussais screenplay is excellent it very believably blends many emotions also courageously comments long lasting topic india pakistan but its done effectively barring slightly under whelming climax writing is consistently engaging otherwise khans direction is top notch he has handled film with skill aseem mishras cinematography captures stunning locales kashmir superbly editing is mostly crisp although film runs over 155 minutes music by various artists is lovely art costume design are satisfactory performance wise salman is at his best here as pawan kumar chaturvedi aka bajrangi bhaijaan superstar enacts god loving clean hearted soul with excellence hes restrained affecting absolutely lovable proving once again that hes much more than box offer thunder hes soul bajrangi bhaijaan child artiste harshaali malhotra is adorable her screen chemistry with salman melts your heart kareena kapoor khan is charming brief yet substantial role nawazuddin siddiqui is top notch yet again he brings house down with his brilliant comic timing walks away with some films best moments as well om puri shines cameo sharat saxena is good others lend fair support whole bajrangi bhaijaan has its heart soul at right place it wins you over completely with its heart touching story strongly recommended,0.5575543797766018,0.3752498530276308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish,"I went to see BB on the day of release with my wife and 17 year old son. I'm not Indian or Pakistani, but white British, so it was fun sat in a cinema full of Pakistanis, to watch a film that could have painted Pakistani in a negative light.Judging by the murmuring I could her there did seem to be some people during the interval that were not too impressed with the film - slow, boring, blah, blah - but by the end I think everyone left happy.From a white British guys perspective I thought it was a terrific film, and so did my wife and son. Great story, interesting characters, a ridiculously cute kid who stole the show without saying very much, excellent music, and some scenery that took your breath away.I thought Salman Kahn was great, much more three dimensional than I was expecting. Kareena Kapoor provided a massive dose of eye-candy and played her part well too, although it would have been nice for that part to have been developed more.But for me the star of the show - other than Harshaali Malthotra, the little girl - was definitely Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one of the most mesmerising actors I've ever seen. He could read the label of a sauce bottle and have everyone transfixed.In typical Bollywood style the first half was your typical setting-the-scene, which I thought was done very well, and it kept me interested throughout, but after the interval, as soon as Nawazuddin Siddiqui made his appearance, the film took off and didn't let-up until the end.All-in-all a thoroughly enjoyable film for all the family.",thoroughly enjoyable start finish,i went see bb day release with my wife 17 year old son im not indian or pakistani but white british so it was fun sat cinema full pakistanis watch film that could have painted pakistani negative light judging by murmuring i could her there did seem be some people during interval that were not too impressed with film slow boring blah blah but by end i think everyone left happy white british guys perspective i thought it was terrific film so did my wife son great story interesting characters ridiculously cute kid who stole show without saying very much excellent music some scenery that took your breath away i thought salman kahn was great much more three dimensional than i was expecting kareena kapoor provided massive dose eye candy played her part well too although it would have been nice that part have been developed more but me star show other than harshaali malthotra little girl was definitely nawazuddin siddiqui he is one most mesmerising actors ive ever seen he could read label sauce bottle have everyone transfixed typical bollywood style first half was your typical setting scene which i thought was done very well it kept me interested throughout but after interval as soon as nawazuddin siddiqui made his appearance film took off didnt let up until end all all thoroughly enjoyable film all family,0.516891891891892,0.21722972972972968,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.2}"
8.0,It feels nice to assume such cinematic liberties becoming true forgetting our ugly past for the benefit of all coming generations. Do watch it.,"After seven years of Mehreen Jabbar's Pakistani film titled RAMCHAND PAKISTANI (2008), revolving around an 8 year old kid and his father unintentionally crossing the border into Indian Territory, we now have our own BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN made on a similar kind of subject having an adorable kid girl from Pakistan lost in India, to be rescued by arguably the most popular Khan icon in India, Salman Khan.As a preview article written a day before the release, I mentioned five potential USP's of BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN other than its plot or Salman Khan as: 1. The Director – Kabir Khan 2. Harshali Malhotra (the cute little girl) 3. Journey to Pakistan (reminding you of Tara Singh of 'Gadar: Ek Prem Katha') 4. Nawazuddin Siddiqui (repeating his solid support as seen in 'Kick') 5. And above all Lord Hanuman (as the divine saviour helping in the heartfelt task invisibly)Luckily as speculated, BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN intelligently exploits the above five points only as its major strength and delivers a largely entertaining film with a decent first and an electrifying second half ending on an exaggerated yet emotionally charged note leaving a positive impact on the viewers. And all this, without any typical item number, specially focused love affair, romantic songs or overdose of action quite surprisingly.To give you the details how the above mentioned USPs are well incorporated in the film, it begins with the first 10-12 minutes completely focusing on the adorable little girl, who straight away wins your heart with her innocent looks, smile and effortless expressions.With Salman Khan being introduced as a true Bajrang Bali devotee, the 'selfie song' raises the spirits superbly. And then the film keeps progressing till the next hour as a simple but sweetly executed social family drama with all clean entertainment focusing on the cute little girl and differently innocent, immensely likable Salman Khan that was missing in all his recent blockbusters since WANTED. So the only minus to be mentioned in the first half remains a couple of average songs, particularly the 'Chicken' track that surely could have been edited out to keep the pace going. Post interval, where the film offers much more entertainment though its various sequence in Pakistan, you lost the count of creative liberties taken right from the border crossing sequence to the 'larger-than-life' climax, portrayed with all good intentions. Nawazuddin once again makes his much awaited entry with a bang, enacting a lifted sequence from a real life viral-video of a Pakistani reporter (having a similar name). Nawazuddin simply takes over from here till the end, winning hearts with his fabulous act of a kind human helping Salman and the kid girl without any hidden motives.If watched with a realistic mindset, the film does have many 'impossible situations' depicting the relationship between the neighboring countries and the way Pakistan's police/military deals with the sensitive issue of catching a spy. But after few minutes of enjoying all the pleasant insertions post interval, one begins to think that 'to hell with whether this is possible or not, lets enjoy the proceedings on screen with the trio (Salman-the Girl & Nawazuddin). As a director Kabir Khan brilliantly rediscovers himself from being an experimental director of KABUL EXPRESS to an entertaining commercial film-maker following the Raj Kumar Hirani school of thought, wherein everyone in the script has a golden heart. He extracts an extremely lovable performance from the charming Harshali Malhotra and also thankfully presents Salman Khan as the same old, big hearted, honest, childlike person hugely loved by one and all for their various reasons. In other words Salman actually acts this time with an author backed role performed well, answering all questions raised upon his recent performances strongly. On the other hand, Harshali is a real delight to watch with all perfect emotions and her scenes together with Salman remain the highlight of the film throughout, right till the last frame.So here we have a film that can easily be called as the best among Salman Khan starrers in the last decade with an equally important message for the 'not so friendly' nations along with many well- written & brightly enacted supporting acts coming from Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Om Puri, Sharat Saxena, Rajesh Sharma and more. However as far as the leading heroine of the film is concerned, Kareena Kapoor needs to be applauded for accepting this kind of (unimportant) miniscule role and making the best of her limited scenes given like a true professional.Beautifully shot capturing the breathtaking locations of Kashmir, BB has an impressive background score by Julius Packiam and enjoyable dialogues written by Kabir Khan & Kausan Munir together, that stay away from any standard jingoism or clichéd preaching. Also as a surprising fact, the film's story has been written by V. Vijayendra Prasad, the story writer of BAHUBALI, setting Indian box office on fire since the last Friday. Among the downers, we have its lackluster music unexpectedly composed by Pritam returning from a long break. In fact even the hugely famous qawaali originally sung by Sabri Brothers doesn't turn out to be that impressive in Adnan Sami's voice who is known to sing in much lower scales.In all, BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN is a thoroughly entertaining film with its five USPs intact along with a clear message for the people of both India and Pakistan. Yes, it becomes too filmy with huge cinematic liberties taken in its border crossing sequences and the epic climax that is simply not possible in the actual scenario. But at times, such films seriously make you wish that may all the cinematic liberties taken on the screen somehow become true and we learn to forget our ugly past for the benefits of the generations to come at the earliest.",it feels nice assume such cinematic liberties becoming true forgetting our ugly past benefit all coming generations do watch it,after seven years mehreen jabbars pakistani

10.0,"A LANDMARK FILM in the Hindi Film Industry!!! Kabir best ever, and one of Salman's best.","Every now and then comes a film that defines a decade. In the Hindi film industry such films as Munna Bhai, 3 Idiots, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,ZNMD are such films that define this decade as outstanding path breaking cinema that will be remembered forever. Now its time to add Bajrangi Bhaijaan to that list.Yes the film is that amazing. Its Kabir Khan's best and one of Salman Khan's best films ever. The film stuns you with its positive message of peace between Indo- Pak, but the film isn't preachy or in your face at all. It actual tugs at your heart strings. BB is a film in the Raj Kumar Hirani Mould, a film with a heart, a message, a great script and a film that you wont forget once you leave the cinema halls.And to answer another question, no this is not a regular masala potboiler from SK,its way beyond that, its a game changer, its 2015's best film to date.The films story is a simplistic tale of a mute 6 year old girl who accidentally jumped of a train that had her mother on board which was going back to Pakistan, therefore leaving her lost in India .She then finds a man named Pawan, who is a noble hearted Bajrangi devotee. He after many difficulties swears to take this girl back to Pak. Does the girl get back to Pak to her family,and if so how is what forms the crux of the film.Acting wise Salman Khan is a revelation, after many years SK has stepped out of the Mass acting mold and played a different role which required expert acting. His simplicity and honesty in the character of Pawan wins you over. He rules the film start to finish, and don't be surprised if sweeps the award shows this season he deserves all the awards and accolades for his role. The little girl in the film Harshali Malhotra is the most cutest,adorable girl i have ever seen in any film, she is the heart of film. Nawaz again steals the show, he has an amazing comic act. Kareena Kapoor is beautiful, and first rate in her limited role.Overall this SK film is path breaking, its film where the story and script came first. A story of patriotism,of true emotions, of love, and ...Peace.This is a must watch for all Indians and Pakistans, because a film like this can end, a border war almost lasting 100 years. Yes BB is that powerful but simple that every Indo- Pak can understand the message.Kabir Khan who must have been inspired by Raju Hirani's style of movie making, deserves a standing ovation, get ready for the award shows sir because you will be seeing many trophies soon.Finally the films climax is such that if you don't cry, then you must not be human.5/5* or 10/10",landmark film hindi film industry kabir best ever one salmans best,every now then comes film that defines decade hindi film industry such films as munna bhai 3 idiots bhaag milkha bhaag znmd are such films that define this decade as outstanding path breaking cinema that will be remembered forever now its time add bajrangi bhaijaan that list yes film is that amazing its kabir khans best one salman khans best films ever film stuns you with its positive message peace between indo pak but film isnt preachy or your face at all it actual tugs at your heart strings bb is film raj kumar hirani mould film with heart message great script film that you wont forget once you leave cinema halls answer another question no this is not regular masala potboiler sk its way beyond that its game changer its 2015s best film date films story is simplistic tale mute 6 year old girl who accidentally jumped train that had her mother board which was going back pakistan therefore leaving her lost india she then finds man named pawan who is noble hearted bajrangi devotee he after many difficulties swears take this girl back pak does girl get back pak her family if so how is what forms crux film acting wise salman khan is revelation after many years sk has stepped out mass acting mold played different role which required expert acting his simplicity honesty character pawan wins you over he rules film start finish dont be surprised if sweeps award shows this season he deserves all awards accolades his role little girl film harshali malhotra is most cutest adorable girl i have ever seen any film she is heart film nawaz again steals show he has amazing comic act kareena kapoor is beautiful first rate her limited role overall this sk film is path breaking its film where story script came first story patriotism true emotions love peace this is must watch all indians pakistans because film like this can end border war almost lasting 100 years yes bb is that powerful but simple that every indo pak can understand message kabir khan who must have been inspired by raju hiranis style movie making deserves standing ovation get ready award shows sir because you will be seeing many trophies soon finally films climax is such that if you dont cry then you must not be human 5 5 or 10 10,0.4483145939028292,0.25134008148714027,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.48, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.23}"

9.0,Outstanding Epic Heart Touching Bajrangi Bhaijaan,"I don't know from where to start & where to end. SALMAN KHAN has just nailed it. Pavan in reel is just mirror image of Salman Khan in real. Love, Care, Share, Being Human. Simple, sweet, innocent. His eyes and expressions are enough. Never seen image of Salman. As he has said no one clapped for his shirtless scene. HARSHALI as Munni (Shahida) is super cute. That innocence she has made our hearts to melt. Her sweetness steals the show. Without her voice she says everything. Understanding, the bonding between her & Salman is beyond perfection. NAWAZ as Pakistani Reporter Chand Nawab is mind blowing. How he helps Salman & Munni that's must watch in movie. KAREENA as Rasika is beautiful & played her part very well. Each scene is perfect. Story by V. Vijayendra Prasad is outstanding. All are just perfect in their respective characters. Or I'll say no one can do them other than Salman, Harshali & Nawaz. Perfect direction by KABIR KHAN. Aseem Mishra as DOP has shown Kashmir's true beauty.

10.0,Finally something refreshing!,"Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that ""Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't."" The movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra. It also has a relationship and emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make a hero out of a common man. :)",finally something refreshing,despite being salman fan i was not too impressed with some his recent flicks which my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction so when family member bought tickets this movie i didnt go with high expectations but you dear reader ill say go with high expectations it will not disappoint more importantly go with your heart that is all you need this 2 5 hours long film become one best youve seen years its just one those movies with such heart tugging moments highlight bond between pawan salman shahida harshali which is such delight see that you forget all about plot logic direction not say that movie lacks that perfection execution is definitely there especially second half i watched it avx theatre with at least 500 others sound it at least 75 them regardless age or gender were crying intermission onwards sometimes because it was sad other times because screenplay was just so pure unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside you there is certain level comedy throughout definitely some deep witty one liners my favourite was nawazuddin sidduiqi who played his role perfection who pointing at current state media their polarization india pakistan proclaimed that hatred sells mohabbat doesnt movie has depth message cuteness overload that is harshali malhotra it also has relationship emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make hero out common man,0.5853011204481792,0.09824229691876751,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,"A Groundbreaking, Heart Stomping Journey Which You Shouldn't Miss!","This is hands down one of the finest movies out of many I have seen this year. Simple, effective and mesmerizing. It brings all the superlative emotions out of you! (I am talking about the tears of joy). I have enjoyed previous Salman Khan movies because of their raw entertainment factor but that's just it. In more simple words they were mostly 'time pass' flicks to take your head off things. Bajrangi Bhaijaan on the other hand highlights a scenario where you just want to give most characters a tight hug as it make them seem so real! Salman Khan deserves much more attention for this film than what he has received. A splendid performance by him unlike any other movie he has done. The real winner her is Harshaali Malhotra with an impressive work. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as always was extremely natural. A righteously made movie with an important moral message for both countries and their rivalry. All in all, Kabir Khan have made up for past presentations with Bajrangi Bhaijan and it is a must watch! Salman Khan's journey to get Munni home will create wonders in your heart.

Everything about it is fantastic from the sets, the acting, cinematography, dialogues, you name it.Salman infuses healthy doses of subtle humour throughout. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is class as the small time news reporter and Harshali is the sweetest little girl one could ever imagine.At the end of the movie, one gets the overwhelming feeling that yes indeed the people of India and the people of Pakistan do have the power to overcome all the hurdles and obstacles created by our respective governments and politicians.Movie making is a business at the end of the day and the primary objective of the producers was to make a film that would generate profits.

7.0,Kabir Khan's Best Work To Date,"I have to admit, I went to watch Bajrangi Bhaijan (BB) with a lot of prejudice. I am not a big fan of Kabir Khan, have not liked Kareena Kapoor other than Jab We Met. I am not a Salman Fan either nd despite that I watch all his Eid releases on first day. I had four hypotheses before going to the theater and I had made an outline of the review I was going to write. Generally it's a set template for a Kabir Khan Salman Khan film. Nonetheless, my predetermined conclusion of BB being a mediocre film was proved wrong.1. Kareena Kapoor will be unnecessary in the film – Proved True. Not just Kareena, the entire subplot of Salman's love interest was completely unnecessary. In the first half, a good twenty minutes were spent on establishing the love story between Salman and Kareena. As the film lasted 163 minutes, cutting fifteen of those minutes and a song could have made the edit sharper and more gripping. The role could have been played by any actress. Salman could have been a married or single man in the film. It would not have had any impact on the final outcome.2. Nawazuddin Siddiui will be brilliant – Proved True. And boy he was fantastic. His intro sequence is a straight lift from Pakistan's very own Chaand Nawab and as it turns out, his character is actually called Chaand Nawab. Nawaz comes on screen only in the second half of BB and took the burden of carrying the film on his gifted shoulders. His chemistry with Salman is something seen very rarely between male leads of a film. Immaculate comic timing, perfect body language and expressive eyes. I am not gonna say more but if someone is selling T-shirts saying ""I heart Nawazudding Siddiqui"", let me know.3. Salman Khan will not be able to emote as per the requirements of the role – 50/50. Salman as an actor has limitations, we all know that. Have those precincts ever made any difference? No. Salman is not a method actor. He will never be Naseer or Aamir. I watch Salman Khan films to see whether he is better than his other films or not. In BB, the actor has put in a genuine effort to emote and get into the skin of the role. This is one of the best performances of bhai's career, if not the best. His demeanor as a simple villager is to the point, his performance towards the latter half of the film is strong. He has a very powerful scene in the first half at a brothel, where he struggled to convince on the emotions, but still did better than his other films. BB has no over the top action, or dances, or shirtless sequences or romantic songs. It is heavily dependent on the lead actor. Funnily, despite all the limitations Salman Khan has, I was unable to picture any other actor playing Bajrangi. BB did not need an actor. BB needed Salman Khan the star to deliver and he has delivered. The good thing is that Salman is not the only super star in the film. The other one is Harshaali Malhotra, the child actor playing Shahida. Super cute, super charming and super convincing. It was a challenging role with no dialogs and the kid really showed her competence despite presence of some big names in the film. Darsheel Safari level stuff.Kabir Khan is just a glorified, slightly more intelligent Farah Khan – Proved Wrong. This is where I was completely wrong. The problem I have had with other KK films is that they were on a pretense of being intelligent and logical social dramas, which in reality they were not be it New York or Ek Tha Tiger. They were more intelligent than Farah Khan, Prabhudeva and Rohit Shetty films, hence made the masses (read Salman Khan fans) feel that they are watching intellectual cinema. This strategy resulted in big commercial success for KK. That still does not mean that those films were good films. BB is different. KK has been vigilant about sense and aesthetics more than just looking into a mass appeal. This could be a new beginning for a successful director to becoming a good director. He has been helped a great deal by Vijayendra Prasad's story and a capable production design team of Rajnish Hedao. Vijayendra' a household name in South market, has brought an original story with a lot of room to attract cine- goers. Rajnish's team, well known for PK, Rockstar and Three Idiots, already has vast experience of multi- location shoots. BB spreads across various cities and weathers and production design and art direction is always tough for such films. Credit to KK for utilizing the resources at hand in the best possible way.Lastly, he has done remarkably well in treatment of the screenplay. He knew when to take creative liberty in best interest of the film (Armies of both countries being lenient on borders etc.) and knew when to make things look realistic (tunnels at the border, Samjhota express, Shahid Afridi etc.). He could have done better with the duration of the climax though by eliminating some unnecessary emotional manipulations.BB is not an Anti-Pakistan film. The filmmakers have tried being reasonable as much as they could without ruining the story requirements. They have shown good and bad on both the sides. The film also touched upon religious divide and there it has shown Muslims as the more accommodating of the two religions. What it does communicate strongly is the secular message of modern India.It's a possibility that it will be a lesser commercial success than Kick or Ek Tha Tiger. BB is not a typical Salman Khan film. BB is not a typical Kabir Khan film. BB is a good film.",kabir khans best work date,i have admit i went watch bajrangi bhaijan bb with lot prejudice i am not big fan kabir khan have not liked kareena kapoor other than jab we met i am not salman fan either nd despite that i watch all his eid releases first day i had four hypotheses before going theater i had made outline review i was going write generally its set template kabir khan salman khan film nonetheless my predetermined conclusion bb being mediocre film was proved wrong 1 kareena kapoor will be unnecessary film proved true not just kareena entire subplot salmans love interest was completely unnecessary first half good twenty minutes were spent establishing love story between salman kareena as film lasted 163 minutes cutting fifteen those minutes song could have made edit sharper more gripping role could have been played by any actress salman could have been married or single man film it would not have had any impact final outcome 2 nawazuddin siddiui will be brilliant proved true boy he was fantastic his intro sequence is straight lift pakistans very own chaand nawab as it turns out his character is actually called chaand nawab nawaz comes screen only second half bb took burden carrying film his gifted shoulders his chemistry with salman is something seen very rarely between male leads film immaculate comic timing perfect body language expressive eyes i am not gonna say more but if someone is selling t shirts saying i heart nawazudding siddiqui let me know 3 salman khan will not be able emote as per requirements role 50 50 salman as actor has limitations we all know that have those precincts ever made any difference no salman is not method actor he will never be naseer or aamir i watch salman khan films see whether he is better than his other films or not bb actor has put genuine effort emote get into skin role this is one best performances bhais career if not best his demeanor as simple villager is point his performance towards latter half film is strong he has very powerful scene first half at brothel where he struggled convince emotions but still did better than his other films bb has no over top action or dances or shirtless sequences or romantic songs it is heavily dependent lead actor funnily despite all limitations salman khan has i was unable picture any other actor playing bajrangi bb did not need actor bb needed salman khan star deliver he has delivered good thing is that salman is not only super star film other one is harshaali malhotra child actor playing shahida super cute super charming super convincing it was challenging role with no dialogs kid really showed her competence despite presence some big names film darsheel safari level stuff kabir khan is just glorified slightly more intelligent farah khan proved wrong this is where i was completely wrong problem i have had with other kk films is that they were pretense being intelligent logical social dramas which reality they were not be it new york or ek tha tiger they were more intelligent than farah khan prabhudeva rohit shetty films hence made masses read salman khan fans feel that they are watching intellectual cinema this strategy resulted big commercial success kk that still does not mean that those films were good films bb is different kk has been vigilant about sense aesthetics more than just looking into mass appeal this could be new beginning successful director becoming good director he has been helped great deal by vijayendra prasads story capable production design team rajnish hedao vijayendra household name south market has brought original story with lot room attract cine goers rajnishs team well known pk rockstar three idiots already has vast experience multi location shoots bb spreads across various cities weathers production design art direction is always tough such films credit kk utilizing resources at hand best possible way lastly he has done remarkably well treatment screenplay he knew when take creative liberty best interest film armies both countries being lenient borders etc knew when make things look realistic tunnels at border samjhota express shahid afridi etc he could have done better with duration climax though by eliminating some unnecessary emotional manipulations bb is not anti pakistan film filmmakers have tried being reasonable as much as they could without ruining story requirements they have shown good bad both sides film also touched upon religious divide there it has shown muslims as more accommodating two religions what it does communicate strongly is secular message modern india its possibility that it will be lesser commercial success than kick or ek tha tiger bb is not typical salman khan film bb is not typical kabir khan film bb is good film,0.558661726314398,0.21682183062908258,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"

7.0,a nice film......,"Years ago, I had watched ""Henna"" in which the hero enters Pakistan by crossing Indian Border in an accident. The heroine helps him to return India through the border getting herself killed across the barbed fences. The film is still remembered for its sheer beauty and a symbolic gesture on India and Pakistan relationships concluding humanity isn't confined to any border.""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" too plays with the similar theme in which Salman Khan enters the Pakistan Border illegally to take a six year old mute girl to her home who gets separated with her mother and reaches India. The Pakistani police suspects him of a detective and detains him. The rest of the story involves the attempt on crossing of the border to enter India and the support the hero receives from the Pakistanis. Just like ""Henna"" the film is a visual treat with an excellent views of Pakistani landscapes. The role of the child as a mute girl is brilliant and touches you deep. Her role far surpasses the roles of Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Nawazzadin Siddhiqui in a brief role of a reporter sparkles and give the film a leverage.But in terms of script the film falls a bit short with much of the leverage given on different religions and the support given on the superstitions following the religions, which appears a bit misleading and preachy. Salman's role was pretty unbelievable, and his response to the situations seem pretty unnatural. Overall, the film is impressive in parts with mesmerizing moments created through the six year old child in the central role and the beautiful expanses and mountains of Pakistan captured in the screen.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",nice film,years ago i had watched henna which hero enters pakistan by crossing indian border accident heroine helps him return india through border getting herself killed across barbed fences film is still remembered its sheer beauty symbolic gesture india pakistan relationships concluding humanity isnt confined any border bajrangi bhaijaan too plays with similar theme which salman khan enters pakistan border illegally take six year old mute girl her home who gets separated with her mother reaches india pakistani police suspects him detective detains him rest story involves attempt crossing border enter india support hero receives pakistanis just like henna film is visual treat with excellent views pakistani landscapes role child as mute girl is brilliant touches you deep her role far surpasses roles salman khan kareena kapoor nawazzadin siddhiqui brief role reporter sparkles give film leverage but terms script film falls bit short with much leverage given different religions support given superstitions following religions which appears bit misleading preachy salmans role was pretty unbelievable his response situations seem pretty unnatural overall film is impressive parts with mesmerizing moments created through six year old child central role beautiful expanses mountains pakistan captured screen rating 2 stars out 4,0.5474358974358974,0.17307692307692307,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8.0,Salman's super stardom and well-defined content will make it sustainable at the ticket window and has good legs to prolong its splendid run.,"Many naysayers believe that Salman Khan's films are illogical but with Bajrangi Bhaijaan, he has proved them all wrong. Yes, Bajrangi Bhaijaan does have a simple plot this time but well-executed differently in terms of direction, commendable performances and of course one and the only SALMAN KHAN's charisma.It is enthralling and has right entertainment potion from the beginning till the end.A Hanuman-god devotee and gem of a person, Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi ( Salman Khan) comes to rescue of an innocent six year old girl and swears to reunite to her parents in Pakistan.Directed by Kabir Khan ( Kabul Express , New-York, Ek Tha Tiger) Bajrangi Bhaijaan begins on a superb note capturing the exotic landscape of Kashmir and of course the grand entry of Salman ( always something to look forward to ) welcomed by whistle and clapping from the audience and what follows next is few comic scenes along with romantic track between Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Kabir Khan manages to bring out humour with each scene and chemistry between Salman and the cute girl sparkles the silver screen. If the first half is good, the second half is even better thanks to an amazing performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The supremely talented actor brings down the house with superb comic timings and you will love every moment of his acting. Hats off to Kabir Khan by keeping the movie entertaining with simple plot right from the beginning till the end. The film is thought-provoking and does not loose focus. Screenplay is crispy and will keep you engaged. Editing is loose and the film should be easily trimmed by 20 minutes. Cinematography is astounding. Art direction is convincing. Background score is amazing and gels well with the mood of the film. Music by Pritam is decent. Baring ""Selfie Le Re"", none of songs are chart bursting. Salman's fan will be surprised as the actor takes a different route to show his acting skills. The ""King Of Masses"" sheds his skin to get into the character of Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi. He is innocent, kind-hearted and yet powerful who beat up the bad guys when things go wrong. Harshaali Malhotra is an angel. The gorgeous child actor is superb with her expression. Who would have thought that this is her first film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is incredible and gives his best even in a small role. Kareena Kapoor looks gorgeous in each frame and does well with her sparkling performances.Salman's super stardom and well-defined content will make it sustainable at the ticket window and has good legs to prolong its splendid run.

9.0,The Method that works.,"Bollywood and Salman have mostly been associated with method films that guarantees success and fame almost always. But with Kabir Khan it is not same, even his perfect method films aren't really those typical ones you see every other day.""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"", this year's big Eid release, is a perfect emotional movie and makes for a perfect viewing. A god-fearing, Hanuman worshiping earnest Bajrangi who thinks even eating meat is a sin and entering mosque is taboo. The child actor Harshali Malhotra plays a mute six-year-old Pakistani citizen who accidentally strays into India and it's her character that brings out the best from Salman Khan or Pavan as he is addressed in the movie. Lost, hungry and lonely, Munni aka Shahida sticks to Pavan and unable to shake her off, Pavan takes her home not knowing anything about her. The mute one communicates all her feelings through her poignant eyes.Their bond is charming and their chemistry is mind-blowing. The innocent face of Harshali and vibrant expressions while leading him to India are some of the best moments of the movie.As the movie progresses and Pavan starts looking for her parents and while he greets the crowd with Adaab instead of Jai Shri Rama while entering the Indian soil towards the end of movie, each of the moment are soul-touching. There are few moments where the peace angle is shown, the romance between Pavan and her school teacher Rasika. But the movie mostly focuses on the relationship between Pavan and the mute child Munni. You can sit back and let the plot take you for a ride into an area in world whose existence Indians don't even acknowledge, POK. As Om Puri, playing a wise 'maulana' in the film, tells the hero: 'thoda sa Kashmir hamaare paas bhi hai'.Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the Pakistani TV scribe nearly steals the show with his story on the little girl lost in border. Flashes of Gaddar shows when Bajrangi decides to unite Munni with her parents across the border. This was highlighted much before the release of the movie. There is nothing really in the first half, the film starts in the second half when the character enters across the border. At 2 hours and 20 odd minutes, the picture is cool and entertaining. Climax is a bit stretched but the reasoning is logical and go with the flow. The movie has heart, its winsome, the picturesque scene based on POK are way too good.",method that works,bollywood salman have mostly been associated with method films that guarantees success fame almost always but with kabir khan it is not same even his perfect method films arent really those typical ones you see every other day bajrangi bhaijaan this years big eid release is perfect emotional movie makes perfect viewing god fearing hanuman worshiping earnest bajrangi who thinks even eating meat is sin entering mosque is taboo child actor harshali malhotra plays mute six year old pakistani citizen who accidentally strays into india its her character that brings out best salman khan or pavan as he is addressed movie lost hungry lonely munni aka shahida sticks pavan unable shake her off pavan takes her home not knowing anything about her mute one communicates all her feelings through her poignant eyes their bond is charming their chemistry is mind blowing innocent face harshali vibrant expressions while leading him india are some best moments movie as movie progresses pavan starts looking her parents while he greets crowd with adaab instead jai shri rama while entering indian soil towards end movie each moment are soul touching there are few moments where peace angle is shown romance between pavan her school teacher rasika but movie mostly focuses relationship between pavan mute child munni you can sit back let plot take you ride into area world whose existence indians dont even acknowledge pok as om puri playing wise maulana film tells hero thoda sa kashmir hamaare paas bhi hai nawazuddin siddiqui as pakistani tv scribe nearly steals show with his story little girl lost border flashes gaddar shows when bajrangi decides unite munni with her parents across border this was highlighted much before release movie there is nothing really first half film starts second half when character enters across border at 2 hours 20 odd minutes picture is cool entertaining climax is bit stretched but reasoning is logical go with flow movie has heart its winsome picturesque scene based pok are way too good,0.4263157894736842,0.25493421052631576,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.29}"
