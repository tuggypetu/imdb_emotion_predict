8,I enjoyed this movie,"""Padman,"" tells an important story in an engaging and entertaining way. I enjoyed this movie overall and really enjoyed Akshay Kumar's lead performance. His character is very likable has he only has the purest intentions to something good for society. The story was inspirational and pretty well put together. I do feel that the first half of the movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive and it probably could have been cut a bit shorter. The movie does bounce back with a fast-paced and resonant second half that makes the movie worthwhile. It's a good movie with a strong message and a good heart that I enjoyed.",i enjoyed this movie,padman tells important story engaging entertaining way i enjoyed this movie overall really enjoyed akshay kumars lead performance his character is very likable has he only has purest intentions something good society story was inspirational pretty well put together i do feel that first half movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive it probably could have been cut bit shorter movie does bounce back with fast paced resonant second half that makes movie worthwhile its good movie with strong message good heart that i enjoyed,0.5730769230769229,0.3211538461538461,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.57, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.13}"
9,Long Review: Padman,"There's a montage sometime in the first hour where the central character approaches women from different walks of life but finds it difficult to convince even one of them to try out his indigenous product. Reason? The touchy subject. Padman aspires to break this stigma associated with the subject of menstrual hygiene. From a delivery point of view, it is roaring succes.Akshay Kumar plays Lakshmi, a simple, uneducated man living with his mother, two sisters, and newly-wedded wife, Gayatri. A bit of an oddball in his thought processes, he makes it his life goal to produce low-cost sanitary napkins when he learns about the hard-up conditions that Gayatri and the women around him including his sisters, who have recently hit puberty live in, when it comes to menstruation. The religious aspect of the issue - where menstruating women are supposed to isolate themselves and live outside the house during the cycle (mostly in rural India) because they are considered impure - also bothers him, which is why Padman looks like it has been written with a complete contemplation of the issue. And, for a person, who has been exposed to high-octane, mindless Bollywood potboilers, this can come as a surprise.Padman, therefore, is a critique of our times when a technically developed country like India that aspires to be digital-ready struggles with something as crucial and necessary as menstrual sanitation. Lakshmi's attempts to educate the people around him and fight the stigma that is stuck like the plague is much more important than to invent a low-cost napkin that is both efficient and cheap. Despite being a little bit successful in the latter department, Lakshmi continuously struggles to remove the preconceptions about menstruation that people have and which they are not ready to talk about. This hesitance to converse about an issue that is tied to a woman's innate health is alarming, and Padman tries to preach about that. Of course, it's a preach, but a social film cannot do without it if it intends to send the point across. Considering that director R Balki is targeting rural India with this film, I am personally content and confident that it will tick.It is because of not just the construction of the sanitary pad but also the construction of the screenplay that this works. Padman excels in all departments, also giving intermediate knowledge about napkins if people don't know about it already. A well-written plot that reminds us of Shree Narayan Singh's 2017 hit drama on a similar social issue, 'Toilet - Ek Prem Katha', also starring Kumar, it moves ahead without hitting a bump. Of course, there are sequences that are sometimes cringe-worthy and sometimes impossible, but director Balki has evidently taken a lot of cinematic liberty, which is mandatory for a film that captures the entire essence of a social predicament such as this. The fact that Padman is based on the real-life story of the Indian inventor, Arunachalam Muruganantham, would make the viewer more confident and supportive of the structure. It's well-written, has good amounts of humour and drama, if not melodrama, and hits the right notes with its messages. With a score that supports the inspirational message, Padman must be viewed on the big screen and be marketed through word of mouth as it demands greater viewership.Akshay Kumar is phenomenal and looks like he came directly out of the aforementioned film's sets. He carries the whole film on his shoulders and never once shows an inkling of restfulness. If there is a character that I feel an actor has done complete justice to in any film in the past few months, it'd be that of Lakshmi. Equally enchanting is the supremely talented Radhika Apte's performance who seems to be made just for the role of the village wife, something that we previously saw her do in Kabali (2016), and Parched (2015) and Manjhi: The Mountain Man (2015) before that. There's not a single dull moment in Padman, thanks to the performances of the lad and the supporting cast. Sonam Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan grace the screen for some time and do a decent job, but it is the supporting actors that make the whole broth tastier. Similar to how we last saw in R S Prasanna's Shubh Mangal Savdhan (2017), another highlight of Padman is in its dialogues and general writing. Talking about a touchy subject like menstruation is already an exercise, but to make an entire feature film about it, without hitting the awkward and/or obscene point even once, is something of a marvel. Director-writer Balki and co-writer Swanand Kirkire need to be appreciated for the sensitivity that is visible throughout the film, which could have been turned into a vulgar mess had it been executed by some of the more energetic yesteryear Bollywood filmmakers. Padman excels for a lot of reasons, but tailoring it for a conservative audience is one of the major ones.Padman is refreshing because it serves several things on a single plate and yet manages to not overload it. Lakshmi's relentless attitude towards innovation makes this film much more than something about a social cause. Although India is known as the innovators' world, we hardly see such immaculate representation of the same on the silver screen. I don't care much more for the promotional angle of this film, courtesy the current ruling government in India, but as something that is important to mankind, Padman does deserve applause for its pure concoction and filmmaking brilliance. There couldn't be a better time to release this film that even has shades of chivalry (which, spare me the rolling eye, is no longer dead), feminism, and women empowerment. Lakshmi's dream must have taken him to a lot of places, but his underlying thought to not commercialize his invention and instead work for the greater good is something that makes Padman much more effective and deserving of attention.There's a good chance that if one can relate to the subject, tears are going to make a guest appearance at least once in the 140-minute running time. But, even if that does not happen, it will touch your heart through its warm characterization, entrepreneurship, and the sheer ability to pump your beat up. Padman is perhaps R Balki's best film so far, something that I would even go as far as to list in Kumar's filmography as well.

9,Two Extra stars just for the bravery to make such a film!,"Even before I start analysing 'PadMan' as a movie, I assume films like these have to be lauded simply because they're being made. That actors and filmmakers are using cinema as a tool to strike conversations, tickle thoughts and lift debates, itself is a alleviation; especially in a country of over one hundred crores with numerous problems, most of them neither spoken nor understood.PadMan' is purely a sworn statement of a man's adventure from not anything to contentment; totally banking upon on his very own desires of bringing about fantastic modifications and supporting them sustain. if you ignore a few exaggerations (and i worry I don't have takers for pronouncing this), it is an inspiring film and will create advantageous affects. Decently shot by p.c. Sreeram and rightly complemented with soundtracks composed by Amit Trivedi, it features great performances from each Radhika Apte and Akshay Kumar; and not to forget about, a fluent Sonam Kapoor in a brief yet pivotal role.Watch 'PadMan' to encourage greater movies that communicate about actual troubles; more real than fairytale love stories.

8,This one deserves to be in IMDB 8+ list.,"PADMAN, the movie full of motivation, is about India's one of the real Superhero. Necessity is the mother of innovation is said somewhere, here it is implemented. Padman is a movie which has romance, comedy, serious as well as heart touching moments distributed equally. This is a brave topic to come up with so hats off to Twinkle Khanna, R Balki and the entire team. Special hats off to Mr. Arunachalam Murugnatham for his extraordinary contribution to the society.The film has many moments which make us laugh naturally and its not forced humor. Chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte is also good. The problem of unhygienic sanitation habit is shown in a bold way and its seriousness can be felt while watching the film. The film has some emotional moments when Padman fails as well as when Padman comes to know that his first Pad which was tested was successful. Best part of the movie includes the scene before interval which reminds of Toilet Ek Prem Katha scene. Mr. Arunachalam is given perfect tribute also in the starting credits as well as in the end which is a good part. The machine making is shown which is a very good part. BGM is very nice. Music of the film is fairly well and justified. Flaws in the film, I found 2 flaws. This film is spanned over some 8-10 years they could have shown some age difference in the looks of the characters it felt as if everything is happening in the span of 1-2 years only. 2nd flaw is the romantic angle in the later part of the film could have been avoided nevertheless it was also justified but it was looking like extra part in the film.Talking about the performances, Akshay Kumar as Lakshmikant Chauhan is fantabulous, one of the best performance of his career. Its another feather to his collection and it should not be a surprise if this act is considered for a national award. He has nailed it in every scene may it be demonstration of his machine or monologue in the end or testing pad on himself or making of the machine. Radhika Apte, has given amazing performance, she is having some amazing emotional scenes and she has performed beautifully. She perfectly suits in a village woman role with a narrow minded thinking. Sonam Kapoor as Pari has her moments in the film. She is the hero along with Lakshmikant. She has some amazing dialogues in her account. Other performances of Lakshmi's mother and sisters as well as 2 friends and Pari's father are also remarkable. And then there is the one and only Amitabh Bachchan, R Balki's favourite in the special appearance. Its just 2-3 minutes role but he stole the show in his own style. Amazing dialogues by him in just those 2-3 minutes. There are some clap worthy and whistle-able scenes too. R Balki's direction is classic. This is his personal best along with Paa. The camerawork is awesome. Locations in the film are not much important according to film but still Maheshwar is beautiful and it captures true village environment. Editing could have been a bit better but its good there is no unnecessary nuisance in the film.Overall the film is enjoyable, entertaining yet giving a very strong message and motivation. There is no logical error in the film as a normal audience and there is no scene which makes family audience feel awkward. There is no boring moment in the film which makes us feel that when is it ending. Its a motivating film after Dangal.

9,What We Take for Granted,"For the most part a true tale w/a bit of Indian movie dramatization (i.e. a couple of song/dances; a romantic moment), about the use of female sanitary pads in India. Your first inclination on viewing this story is another boring Indian family going through issues. Wrong! When you begin to discover it's about males dealing w/the female menstrual period which is culturally an extreme no-no; it starts to get interesting, eventually really interesting. Background: At the time this story begins, the 1990s, only about 12% of Indian women used a ""sanitary"" pad, the rest you ask? Newspapers, leaves, and a continually reused rag washed most likely in unsanitary H2O. So, a husband buys pads for 55 Rupees which the wife refuses to use in part because their high cost is beyond their low income level. The husband as a low education, hands-on laborer, decides to make some for his wife. That's when the fireworks begins. The subject is a culturally stigmatized superstitious taboo - mildly put. He's shamed, ostracized beyond belief as he asks questions, and researches. His goal is to build a machine to make them for 2 Rupees all ""for the safety of women"". Read only after seeing: It took him six years. Introduced his low cost pad maker to thousands of villages. Hired abused, cast out, unemployed women (many beggars, prostitutes) to make & distribute the pads. Has exported his machine to 29 poor countries.

8,"Perfect example to describe the ""Woman's problem"" in India.","Menstrual hygiene wasn't introduced in India until later in the 21st century, a social activist from South India introduces a tool to prevent from menstrual bleeding. So basically this film focuses on the aspect of menstrual hygiene in India.So a welder named Lakshmikant Chauhan based in a village in the rural of East India gets married and lives a blissful life until he notices the women in his village are suffering periods even in his family. Due to the lack of affordability for those sanitary pads, Lakshmi decides to change that by producing napkin pads but his idea leaves the villagers in doubt and gives them the feeling of embarrassment and shame. How Lakshmi changes that is basically what this film is about?Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and now Padman. R. Balki introudces a very straight on point script with deals with subjective matters of menstrual hygiene. This kind of hygiene is very essential for women across India which does have a very high poverty rate. Balki successfully shows the empowering factors of sanitary pads in such a way that managed to keep the audience engaged throughout those 140 minutes of the film.As far as performances go, Akshay Kumar literally nails it as Lakshmi. Luckily since Airlift, he has been upping his game especially in this film. His motives on menstrual hygiene was simply outstanding and that village mentality of a dropout as surprisngly something only Kumar can pull. Radhika Apte plays Gayatri, Lakshmi's wife who is against her husband's decision. She was great and simple but some dialgoues implemented by her were a bit off and it didn't comply too much to her character even as a villager.Sonam Kapoor was outstanding in Neerja but this film, it gave the audience the feeling especially me that she went on set just to earn a big quick big. Big B's appearance was quite a surprise.Direction was quite weak and this is something very common in R.Balki's films. He is very known for adding too mnay close up shots in 80% of the scenes and zooming too much will just cover up the background.Also there was a minor issue, it is okay to put comedy and drama which were both there but the script itself was a bit too factual. it is understandable that menstrual hygiene is a concept but putting too many of those elements will probably escalate the boredom in some scenes.Amit Trivedi's album is surely a winner and Mika Singh's take on the title song is simply a treat to devour for the next 4 minutes and Aaj Se Teri sung by Arijit Singh will put you in a romantic mood.Overall, 2018 is improving quite well at the start and this film will be counted in my top 10 best films of 2018. Nicely written backed up by a narrative concept also backed by powerful performances. But the direction of the film does dissappoint quite alot with the close ups but this is a perfect film.3.75/5 - R.

10,Its not another story,"Its a rare movie that highlights the important issue every girl goes through for around 3 decades , the part where she needs to work hard the most to make an identity for herself, overcomes more obstacles than a guy , covering everything in 25 days as 5 days she is not at her 100%.

10,Badman to Padman,"First and foremost a big round of applause to every single entity (Actors ,producers,director,writer,cameraman) who are associated with this real life inspired piece of lifetime reality . Akshay kumar has acted flawlessly and setting another milestone for himself by acting as a rigid man who does not give up his dream even after multiple failures and malign and turns from a ""Badman to padman"".Being a woman it was more easier to connect to each and every action of the protagonist such as testing the pad on his own(by pumping animal blood) was the most touching scene which made me cry while watching.It gives me goosebumps while I think about the real hero Mr Lakshmikant.A jumbo hats off to him from the core of my heart and mind. Rest all have also played their part very responsibly and successfully. This piece inspires to dream about every small and untouched but inevitable needs of life associated with human being(Irrespective of caste creed and gender). I will not go very far to proof this as I always wanted to write a review on movies and this is the movie which forced me to write the review right after coming back from theatre.

7,Padman is a refreshing journey which should be lauded for its boldness and message for a cause,"There is a dialogue in the movie - ""If you are not facing problem, you are not living your life properly"". India is a huge country with diverse culture, religion and faith with its own issue and circumstances. But does all the belief and faith hold the right message ? Padman explores that ..Padman, based on one of the short story ""The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land"" written by Twinkle Khanna, tells the extraordinary story of an ordinary man , Lakshmi Prasad (Akshay Kumar), who changed the life of rural women in India by devising low-cost machine to build sanitary pads. Directed by R.Balki, who gave us some critically acclaimed films like Cheeni Kum and Paa, Padman is a bold step to explore the subject of menstruation and sanitary pads which is considered taboo in India. The film starts of very well with few scenes bringing smile on your face - Lakshmi Prasad buying the pads for his wife first time from a local medical shop, Lakshmi saving the life of his fellow-worker at the factory and even when he is trying to build the pads by using the cotton and leaves. The passion and determination of Lakshmi to know how the pad works and trying to make his wife and sisters use it will keep you glued to the screen. While the first half boast of some great scenes, the second half is a roller-coaster ride which stumbles down but picks up later in the climax. There are various reasons - the romance between Sonam Kapoor and Akshay Kumar is half-baked and out of place, the weird of Sonam Kapoor is itself does not make much impact, the lengthy pace and few unwanted scenes. Even the songs by Amit Trivedi is disappointing as none of it has chartburster touch (coming as a surprise from such a talented musician). Despite these hiccups, the impact of movie overall is a good as it helps to understand the pain what women goes through during those five days of period, especially a learning lesson for men. Though, it is okay to talk about it in Urban India, the subject is extremely sensitive in the rural India even though we are living in 21st Century. The screenplay is decent while editing is good, though trimming of few scenes and songs could have helped. Art direction is splendid while Cinematography is outstanding capturing the beautiful locations in Madhya Pradesh. Padman belongs to one and the only Akshay Kumar. The actor is just challenging himself to do good films on social cause and entertaining us with his superb performance. Though, he went overboard during one of the scene when he introduces his invention at the National Innovation Foundation conference, he will win your heart with a staggering speech at the United Nation ceremony, New York. Radhika Apte gives adequate support to her role. Sonam Kapoor, as usual, over-acted and does not justice to her character at all. I wish, the makers could have taken someone better.Padman is a refreshing journey of Arunachalam Muruganantham which should be lauded for its boldness and message for a cause.

8,We can announce confidently - India ke paas apna Superhero Pad Man hai.,"It is certainly appreciable that Indian films are choosing topics of social taboo and Pad Man is the latest one which talks about women's menstrual hygiene and their need to use sanitary pads. In our country, menstruating women are treated as outcast on these days and barred from entering temples and kitchens, it is a matter of debate, since it deals with belief system of many. So, it is a welcome change, when efforts are being made to talk about such topics of societal taboo and what best media other than a film to deal with such paradigm shift needed. Pad Man is a film which is inspired from the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social entrepreneur from Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu). He is the inventor of low-cost sanitary pad-making machine. His innovative grassroot mechanisms for generating awareness about traditional unhygienic practices around menstruation has done wonders for women in rural India. He has not commercialized his mini machines which can manufacture sanitary pads for less than a third of the cost of commercial pads, rather he has chosen to sell it to self-help groups run by women. As per Wikipedia, these mini machines have been installed in 23 of 29 states of India, and he is planning to expand the production of these machines to 106 nations. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachalam_Muruganantham) Along with many awards conferred on him, he was included in Time Magazine's list of 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2014 and also Padma Shri in 2016 by Government of India. One thing which is to be noted is that Pad Man, as it is claimed by the makers, is not the first film on Arunachalam. Amit Virmani has made a documentary 'Menstrual Man', Abhishek Saxena made Phullu (2017) and there is another unreleased film ""I-Pad"" made in 2015 by Amit Rai. Twinkle Khanna had come out with 'The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad"" - a collection of four stories in 2016, out of which one story is ""The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land"" on which Pad Man is supposed to be based on. Of course, more the films on these subjects, it is good so as to create more and more awareness amongst people and get rid of taboo. So, Pad Man by R. Balki with Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte in the lead is successful in creating the right buzz. R Balki has chosen to give fictional names to his protagonists Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte and also he has picked up the backdrop of Bhopal rather than Coimbatore. R Balki and Swanand Kirkire as writers does mention the statistics as well in the film that only 12% of women in India use sanitary pads. They have kept the tone of the film very light without making it preachy. Sensibilities of the audience is taken into consideration. The emotions of the females, the belief system of considering oneself unsacred during menstruating days, not entering Kitchen / temples, the celebration (almost like mini-wedding) when a girl matures and the confusion of male fraternity are very well captured in the screenplay. Even the medical shop person selling the sanitary pad as if he is selling something illegal is very much relatable. What could have been avoided in the film is the love dynamics explored between Sonam Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, it appeared very cliché and displaced. Lakshmikant Chauhan (Akshay) works in a welding factory. His sharp eye for details and fixing up things is evident from the very beginning of the film. He finds it very disturbing when he sees his wife Gayathri (Radhika Apte) using dirty clothes during her periods. In spite of Gayathri asking Lakshmi to stay out of ladies' problems, he does try his hand in making sanitary pads. His initial attempts fail miserably. What he finds it even more challenging is to get the pad tested. He makes desperate attempts to get the client, family, acquaintances etc. for his product but in vain. He is branded as eccentric, pervert and he ends up risking everything he has - his wife, family, home, village, social status etc. But nothing deters him from going ahead with his experimentation. It was a loner's journey for Lakshmi, but his go-getter attitude gives him slow yet steady success and that is how he invents low-cost sanitary pad-making machine. Another major challenge in front of Lakshmi was to get the buy-in for the pads from the women and that is when Pari (Sonam Kapoor), a young talented Tabla Player and MBA student, enters the scene. She not only becomes his first client but later on also becomes instrumental in creating user-base and roping in self-help groups run by women. The film has many high points be it Lakshmi's undying spirit to not accept defeat and continue with his experimentation, his genuine concern for wife and female hygiene, Lakshmi and Gayathri's chemistry, Lakshmi's efforts in managing to get the things one -by-one to invent the low-cost sanitary pad manufacturing machine, his 'Linglish speech' in United Nations, Amitabh Bachchan's cameo etc. The cast of the film perfectly fit into their respective characters very well. Akshay Kumar is effortless while playing Lakshmikant, he downplays himself wherever required. Radhika Apte is gorgeous as Gayathri and she has projected the shame associated with even discussing menstruation very well. Sonam Kapoor as Pari is good and gregarious. The best thing is writers R Bali and Swanand Kirkire has justified the presence of every character, even if it is a small role. Rakesh Chaturvedi as Professor is one such character, though has a small role, he becomes a reason for Lakshmi's shift in focus from making low-cost sanitary pads to inventing low-cost sanitary pad making machine. R. Balki's Pad Man inspired from Arunachalam Muruganantham's life showcases realistic performances from Akshay and Radhika and the film succeeds in dealing with a topic of societal taboo like menstrual hygiene with very much ease and finesse. It hits the bulls eye as far as enhancing social consciousness is concerned and it is bound to leave the ripples of cultural transformation for a very long time. Yes, we can announce confidently - India ke paas apna Superhero Pad Man hai.",we can announce confidently india ke paas apna superhero pad man hai,it is certainly appreciable that indian films are

8,An EYE OPENER CLASSIC for Sensible People.,"PADMAN REVIEW :When i saw the Trailer my First Reaction was like, 'Oh wow, someone has picked this Sensitive subject to make film. I must admire them'. I was afraid this film might lack the commercial value as the subject was Very Very Sensitive for our Male oriented society, but somewhere i was sure about Content. And Yes Padman is an EYE OPENER CLASSIC, A Sensitive but natural topic handle in a Sensible way by R Balki makes this one a MUST WATCH and also i expect some change in our Society regarding that Awkwardness about Pads.Acting- Akshay Kumar has given his Best Performance of this Decade. He's Sober, Kind Hearted yet down to earth. Radhika has done a Good Job being a typical Small town Housewife. Sonam appears after Interval but still makes her Presence feel strong with Sophisticated, educated, Bindass girl Accent.Writing- It's Strong as expected because you know it's a True Story and it's Inspiring so there shouldn't be any problem in writing a Great Script. But still few fictional material is irritating.Screenplay- When you get a Strong basic Script then you have to be very careful about screenplay and here it has hit the Right Chords. No Boring Moments, nothing to Dislike, expected Turn Arounds plus Emotional sequences. Everything is PERFECT.Music- Underwhelming. But this script actually don't need those typical Hit songs and useless chartbusters. All songs are Situational and fits properly in the film still that 'Ladki Sayani Ho Gayi' could have been removed.Direction- Balki does it again. He's always unique stories teller. But after Paa he was lost somewhere and has came back again to his Standard and delivers a Classic here. He has put enough commercial elements in the film, not making it too much overdose, doesn't lose basic Content, keeps reminding you that this is what happening in our Society and it's natural, there's nothing to be ashamed of.Final Words- Overall Padman is a Classic and will bring some change in our society regarding women's natural problem. I won't be surprised if Akshay and Balki will be called Superheroes by some Indian Women. Just go for this one, enjoy and come back home with a Grin smile on face, few tears in eyes and A Message in Mind. Padman deserves every single penny of your ticket purchase. Last but not the Least thank you so much Twinkle, Akshay and Balki for this film and Salute the real Padman. 8/10*",eye opener classic sensible people,padman review when i saw trailer my first reaction was like oh wow someone has picked this sensitive subject make film i must admire them i was afraid this film might lack commercial value as subject was very very sensitive our male oriented society but somewhere i was sure about content yes padman is eye opener classic sensitive but natural topic handle sensible way by r balki makes this one must watch also i expect some change our society regarding that awkwardness about pads acting akshay kumar has given his best performance this decade hes sober kind hearted yet down earth radhika has done good job being typical small town housewife sonam appears after interval but still makes her presence feel strong with sophisticated educated bindass girl accent writing its strong as expected because you know its true story its inspiring so there shouldnt be any problem writing great script but still few fictional material is irritating screenplay when you get strong basic script then you have be very careful about screenplay here it has hit right chords no boring moments nothing dislike expected turn arounds plus emotional sequences everything is perfect music underwhelming but this script actually dont need those typical hit songs useless chartbusters all songs are situational fits properly film still that ladki sayani ho gayi could have been removed direction balki does it again hes always unique stories teller but after paa he was lost somewhere has came back again his standard delivers classic here he has put enough commercial elements film not making it too much overdose doesnt lose basic content keeps reminding you that this is what happening our society its natural theres nothing be ashamed final words overall padman is classic will bring some change our society regarding womens natural problem i wont be surprised if akshay balki will be called superheroes by some indian women just go this one enjoy come back home with grin smile face few tears eyes message mind padman deserves every single penny your ticket purchase last but not least thank you so much twinkle akshay balki this film salute real padman 8 10,0.4494195688225539,0.12438403221985309,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.19}"
8,I never thought a movie like this would be made in India.,"Many years ago, when i had read about Arunachalam Muruganantham, if someone told me that a movie would be made on him, i would have said that's impossible, it's never going to happen. People in India are even scared of watching the advertisements of Sanitary Napkins on television, they feel shy buying it in the shops, how would they convince their family to watch a movie about it ? On top of that, the things Arunachalam did to achieve were quite bizarre, he used to pick out used sanitary pads from the dustbin and do his research on them ! How on earth would Bollywood show that in the movies ? Hollywood might have made such a biopic, but Indian Film Industry...no chance.So, in 2016 when it was announced that a film based on Arunachalam Muruganantham's life is being made, i was quite surprised, what was even more surprising was that Akshay Kumar was going to play the lead. Akshay Kumar is known to play over the top characters, or do patriotic films, he had never done a movie like this. Finally when the time came for the movie to reveal itself to the audience, i was quite certain the creators would just talk about the issue on surface level and not go too deep into it, and there was no way they were going to show the things that Arunachalam actually did. But when the movie came out, i could not believe my eyes, they had done the impossible. R. Balki (Director) showed almost everything that Arunachalam did in order to achieve his bizarre goal.'Pad Man' is a fantastic film, very well made, completely different from what you would expect from an Akshay Kumar film. This is easily the most important film of Akshay Kumar's career. Movies like these are normally made with unknown actors and on a very small budget, most people don't even get to know about it's existence. With a superstar like Akshay Kumar, this story managed to reach millions of people, making it somewhat easier for people to talk about sanitary napkins. This movie is not a documentary, it has all the entertainment that a movie needs, there is an abundance of humour throughout the film and of course it has some outstanding music by Amit Trivedi.Pad Man entertains as well as educates. People living in urban areas use sanitary napkins but don't talk about it, women in villages don't use it and most people, specially men don't even know what 'Periods' are. The easiest way of removing the tag of taboo from a topic, is to talk about it and this film does exactly that. This movie deserves to be seen by everyone.",i never thought movie like this would be made india,many years ago when i had read about arunachalam muruganantham if someone told me that movie would be made him i would have said thats impossible its never going happen people india are even scared watching advertisements sanitary napkins television they feel shy buying it shops how would they convince their family watch movie about it top that things arunachalam did achieve were quite bizarre he used pick out used sanitary pads dustbin do his research them how earth would bollywood show that movies hollywood might have made such biopic but indian film industry no chance so 2016 when it was announced that film based arunachalam murugananthams life is being made i was quite surprised what was even more surprising was that akshay kumar was going play lead akshay kumar is known play over top characters or do patriotic films he had never done movie like this finally when time came movie reveal itself audience i was quite certain creators would just talk about issue surface level not go too deep into it there was no way they were going show things that arunachalam actually did but when movie came out i could not believe my eyes they had done impossible r balki director showed almost everything that arunachalam did order achieve his bizarre goal pad man is fantastic film very well made completely different what you would expect akshay kumar film this is easily most important film akshay kumars career movies like these are normally made with unknown actors very small budget most people dont even get know about its existence with superstar like akshay kumar this story managed reach millions people making it somewhat easier people talk about sanitary napkins this movie is not documentary it has all entertainment that movie needs there is abundance humour throughout film course it has some outstanding music by amit trivedi pad man entertains as well as educates people living urban areas use sanitary napkins but dont talk about it women villages dont use it most people specially men dont even know what periods are easiest way removing tag taboo topic is talk about it this film does exactly that this movie deserves be seen by everyone,0.5625115207373272,0.1713901689708141,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
