9,Max from Dhanush & The best Story,"I am not a huge fan of TAMIL movies, but must say this is a one of the must watch movies. Parents Love, Fantasy, Smile, Faith, Sympathy, Hate, Courage, lovers love, Friendship & everything were there at the very appropriate moment. Very good effort by director ""Velraj"". Story comes with a comedy accent & turns to the romantic when Raghuvaran found Shalini & turns in to few sad minutes which realise the parent love & turns again in to the baseline of the movie. As a Mechanical Engineer I also know, how hard to find a JOB in real world. By the way, at he end, everything goes fine with Raghuvaran & he made the peace with ""Arun Subramaniom"". A Happy ending movie. :D",max dhanush best story,i am not huge fan tamil movies but must say this is one must watch movies parents love fantasy smile faith sympathy hate courage lovers love friendship everything were there at very appropriate moment very good effort by director velraj story comes with comedy accent turns romantic when raghuvaran found shalini turns few sad minutes which realise parent love turns again baseline movie as mechanical engineer i also know how hard find job real world by way at he end everything goes fine with raghuvaran he made peace with arun subramaniom happy ending movie d,0.5857291666666666,0.23656249999999995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"

10,For Mass Kick Fans,"Super movie by danush. Best Songs, Best Acting, Best Comedy, Best Punches. The kind of movie i am expecting from Tamil industry from pretty long time.In this movie Dhanush plays the role of Raghuvaran, a degree graduate who is still looking for a job, meanwhile his brother will be doing a job already and earns well.

8,Mass movie of 2014,"(V)elai (I)lla (P)attathaari.. Mass movie of 2014.Strength: 1 . Dhanush - He made the movie to come in such a way that even an old story can be a super duper hit. As far as story wise it seems to be old, but Dhanush and Velraj made it special. In some scenes he imitate Superstar which suits him well. Probably he is also now in the race of ""Who is next superstar?"" 2. Anirudh - Songs and BGM were the biggest plus point in this movie. Except amma song all songs were sung by Dhanush and Anirudh which are rocking. The BGM's after the punch dialog are really amazing which watching in theater. 3. Crew : Over all the crew has done great job. Vivek made a great comeback in this movie. 4. Dialogues and Screenplay plays a important role. Movie does not get bore at any scene. It was going very fast. Songs were placed in right place too.. Weakness: 1. Most important weak point in this movie is villain, He does not suit the character and obviously he looks like Amul baby...Over all Review : Mass movie which must be watched in theater with family.

9,"Inspiring Growth and Resilience in Character plus Martial Arts, Laughs, Inspiration","I am fond of the long establishment of character early in a film with something that causes a pivot in a story that spurs on growth and big change for characters. This story definitely does that. We see real struggles for real people embodied in our hero, here. He's buried deep in self-pity but is a good person who experiences something to inspire and motivate him. He can be silly, he can be pathetic, he can be serious, and he can be strong. The people he brings and keeps in his life embody that same energy. It's a familiar formula but is relatable enough for a person to connect and fantastical enough to inspire action.

7,Good commercial entertainer not boring at any time. Worth for 120 bucks.,"Polled as best trailer of the year, VIP aka Velai Illa Pattathari released with huge expectations among the fans. The first question would be, did the movie met the expectations ? The answer is YES. The movie clearly delivered what it has promised in the trailer.The story in the first half doesn't need to credited for the writer. Because it is the story of lakhs of Engineering Graduates ( VIPs) in the state. Even though it looks like typical Danush movie, director Velraj presented it with fresh scenes perfectly matching his expectation by handling the camera by himself. Interval block is perfect to make transition in the story. While the first portrays the reality the Second half is just opposite to it with more cinematic stuffs but packed up well. Climax is cool, ending peacefully. Every actors fits well in their respective roles. Both Amala Paul and Surabhi are looking beautiful without any glam n skin.. All the songs are merged well in the script without spoiling the flow. Anirudh's bgm is rocking as usual..No practical useful message for the VIPs.But rich-poor-suppression dialogues are raw, good n stirring. (Tats my pick in this movie)PS: Dear VIPs, with our celebrations the movie will become hit but we will be failures only if we are so proud of being VIP blaming others. Actually the govt should take the blame. Even this movie failed mention tat.
