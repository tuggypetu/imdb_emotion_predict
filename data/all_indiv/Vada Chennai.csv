10,Indian Godfather,"This movie has been in the making for a decade or more and its totally worth it and understandable! Every character, scene, dialogue means something and its so well etched that you have to accept it sets a benchmark for regional cinema. It is comparable to all the great gangster dramas that world has produced like the untouchables, godfather, and our own nayagan, satya and gangs of wasseypur. Amusing that directors find their best work in describing crime from its origin to effect.Yes, this movie describes a reluctant young man's journey through the slums surrounded by crooks eventually into a leader and ganglord and is inspired by all those movies listed above. What stood out were few things among many, how the director has given attention to detail right from cinematography to dialogue to time period it feels as if the tale is unscripted, the superb acting from all the cast led by Dhanush, the editing which deserves multiple awards for carrying out non linear story telling with aplomb, the music which is not jarring and giea with the flow and above all the direction which is a cut above the rest taking the best out if his crew Vetri maaran gives his best work here.Enjoy the intensity, political satire (for eg when a character asks if rajiv gandhi succeeded mgr as prime minister) the lawlessness, the dilemma of who or what is right and wrong, is it all by design or free will and many other uncomfortable questions.You will definitely root for the lead character and have many moments with tears in your eyes and lump in your throat!",indian godfather,this movie has been making decade or more its totally worth it understandable every character scene dialogue means something its so well etched that you have accept it sets benchmark regional cinema it is comparable all great gangster dramas that world has produced like untouchables godfather our own nayagan satya gangs wasseypur amusing that directors find their best work describing crime its origin effect yes this movie describes reluctant young mans journey through slums surrounded by crooks eventually into leader ganglord is inspired by all those movies listed above what stood out were few things among many how director has given attention detail right cinematography dialogue time period it feels as if tale is unscripted superb acting all cast led by dhanush editing which deserves multiple awards carrying out non linear story telling with aplomb music which is not jarring giea with flow above all direction which is cut above rest taking best out if his crew vetri maaran gives his best work here enjoy intensity political satire eg when character asks if rajiv gandhi succeeded mgr as prime minister lawlessness dilemma who or what is right wrong is it all by design or free will many other uncomfortable questions you will definitely root lead character have many moments with tears your eyes lump your throat,0.45701530612244895,0.3016581632653062,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.45}"

9,"This film is a massive, beautiful complexity!!!","I'm really sleepy now but could not imagine going to sleep without writing a very brief review about ""Vada Chennai"" (North Chennai). The fourth film directed by Vetrimaaran. This year has been great for Tamil Cinema. Kolamaavu kokila, Chekka chivandha vaanam (okay type), '96, pariyerum perumaal, raatchasan and Vada Chennai.When I watched Prem Kumar's debut film '96 two weeks ago, I felt that it would definitely play the role of a ""reference film"" for future directors planning on making a romantic film. For future/budding directors planning to make a gangster film this MUST be your reference. We've seen various gangster films in Tamil, but Vada Chennai is a class apart. This is a pure EPIC. Such a complex script and screenplay but at the same time understandable. If you're planning to watch this film (which I highly recommend), I suggest that you first watch the previous works of Vetrimaaran. This movie has the essence of ""POLLADHAVAN"" - an innocent lower-middle class young adult fighting gangsters who stole his bike, ""AADUKALAM"" - politics/war with a game as the base (carrom board in this one and cock-fight in the former), ""VISAARANAI"" - prison scenes. The film has such strong female characters who are not the typical female leads you see in a South Indian cinema. (Sorry feminists)Songs were so apt and perfectly placed. Although Dhanush is an amazing dancer I was surprised that he did not dance in this film which he did in both the previous films of Vetrimaran. Dhanush really deserves appreciation for not wanting to add so much weight to the story (but of course that's what the script demanded). This movie's making has demanded a detailed research on the lives of people living in Northern Madras. Their culture, dialect (""Fowder"" for powder, ""flayer"" for player, ""ports"" for sports, ""tation"" for station etc) etc captured on-screen so perfectly. Incidents such as the death of Rajiv Gandhi, death of MGR etc simply flows with the story. The last North Madras based film I enjoyed was ""MADRAS"" which was a great attempt as well. Don't think even a film maker with a North Madras Origin could make a movie as good as ""Vada Chennai"".A particular scene reminded me of ""Pudhupettai"" as well which is one of my favorite Tamil gangster films. Some vintage scenes reminded me of ""Kammattipaadam"" with people in funny hairstyles and bell bottoms riding Yezdis. In this film Dhanush plays only ONE OF THE major parts. Samuthrakani, Ameer, Kishore, Andrea, Aishwarya Rajesh and Dhanush help Vetrimaaran hold this 2.45 hrs long film so brilliantly.The reason I was looking forward to this one is the Vetrimaaran-Dhanush combo. I wouldn't be surprised if Dhanush or for that matter any of the actors win a National award once again for a Vetrimaaran's film (the previous one being Dhanush winning National award for the best actor for Aadukalam).The film is rated ""A"" and of course I noticed that the families (husband, wife and teenage kids) dint enjoy as much as the bachelors. Who knows!!!Eagerly waiting for the sequel which should be out in 2019. In the end I kept wondering ""how daring Vetrimaaran is to even think of making a film as massive as Vada Chennai. Another Vetrimaaran brilliance!!!! Dude only gets better and better every time.",this film is massive beautiful complexity,im really sleepy now but could not imagine going sleep without writing very brief review about vada chennai north chennai fourth film directed by vetrimaaran this year has been great tamil cinema kolamaavu kokila chekka chivandha vaanam okay type 96 pariyerum perumaal raatchasan vada chennai when i watched prem kumars debut film 96 two weeks ago i felt that it would definitely play role reference film future directors planning making romantic film future budding directors planning make gangster film this must be your reference weve seen various gangster films tamil but vada chennai is class apart this is pure epic such complex script screenplay but at same time understandable if youre planning watch this film which i highly recommend i suggest that you first watch previous works vetrimaaran this movie has essence polladhavan innocent lower middle class young adult fighting gangsters who stole his bike aadukalam politics war with game as base carrom board this one cock fight former visaaranai prison scenes film has such strong female characters who are not typical female leads you see south indian cinema sorry feminists songs were so apt perfectly placed although dhanush is amazing dancer i was surprised that he did not dance this film which he did both previous films vetrimaran dhanush really deserves appreciation not wanting add so much weight story but course thats what script demanded this movies making has demanded detailed research lives people living northern madras their culture dialect fowder powder flayer player ports sports tation station etc etc captured screen so perfectly incidents such as death rajiv gandhi death mgr etc simply flows with story last north madras based film i enjoyed was madras which was great attempt as well dont think even film maker with north madras origin could make movie as good as vada chennai particular scene reminded me pudhupettai as well which is one my favorite tamil gangster films some vintage scenes reminded me kammattipaadam with people funny hairstyles bell bottoms riding yezdis this film dhanush plays only one major parts samuthrakani ameer kishore andrea aishwarya rajesh dhanush help vetrimaaran hold this 2 45 hrs long film so brilliantly reason i was looking forward this one is vetrimaaran dhanush combo i wouldnt be surprised if dhanush or that matter any actors win national award once again vetrimaarans film previous one being dhanush winning national award best actor aadukalam film is rated course i noticed that families husband wife teenage kids dint enjoy as much as bachelors who knows eagerly waiting sequel which should be out 2019 end i kept wondering how daring vetrimaaran is even think making film as massive as vada chennai another vetrimaaran brilliance dude only gets better better every time,0.5177275910364145,0.20323704481792718,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9,Raw and Rusty epic that will be a cult classic,"There has been several movies about fishermen community, the slum area and the people whose lives dwell within them, the ganster and the associated politics. But what makes this movie so special is the writing - the grey shades of each and every character is highlighted at the right moment, their low and high points, intertwining plots which affects each other's lives, especially the lead character - Anbu. This qualifies the basic requirement to be an epic. VadaChennai is no less than an epic in making. While each and every person played their part well, it is quiet hard to single out one. But, to have a conclusion, the script is the king, the queen, the everything. No one outplayed their role and this gave the other characters the much needed space, in order to let their character root well into the plot. The screenplay make you feel like a salad stuffed inside a sandwich, but has enough spices that makes the outcome urging us to get one more. Santhosh Narayanan's background score, kept the mood of the film throughout the runtime. The long take shots, aerial view glide and the flight sequences were choreographed well and was captured excellently by Velraj. This epic will surely turn out to be a cult classic, just like Pudupettai and Thevar Magan.

9,Epic gangster film.,"One of the best gangster films ever to come from India. Even though it is essentially about the rise of a gangster it is not like anything seen before because it is not about a gangster but about the people who are betrayed by the system. I had started watching this before but couldn't actually watch it properly while it was playing on TV and I was confused with a lot of scenes and dialogues since the story spanning around 20 years moves so fast that too in a non-linear structure. Since I remember some scenes from the first time, I noticed a lot of small details this time that could be missed if you are not focusing. Even with all of this, the director decided to make this first part of a trilogy because of its length and there are also rumours about how much even this part has been cut. Praising any single section of people involved is pointless since each department has done such an amazing job. I really can't wait for the next part to come and I would love to watch this again before watching the next part in theatres. This was truly epic.",epic gangster film,one best gangster films ever come india even though it is essentially about rise gangster it is not like anything seen before because it is not about gangster but about people who are betrayed by system i had started watching this before but couldnt actually watch it properly while it was playing tv i was confused with lot scenes dialogues since story spanning around 20 years moves so fast that too non linear structure since i remember some scenes first time i noticed lot small details this time that could be missed if you are not focusing even with all this director decided make this first part trilogy because its length there are also rumours about how much even this part has been cut praising any single section people involved is pointless since each department has done such amazing job i really cant wait next part come i would love watch this again before watching next part theatres this was truly epic,0.35404761904761906,0.12142857142857144,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.47, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8,"""Life is simple, it gets complicated when love becomes a part of it.""","As the title reads, the characters in the movie also are complicated because of love. Love for the power, love for the people, love for status and love for money. And as the lead character name itself is Anbu(meaning love) how can his life be simpler. Part 1 is mainly focused on how 'Anbu' is dragged into the world of darkness. The Staging of scenes are done very realistically, which even more boost up the intensity of the film. Director does his best job by portraying the actual rawness of the place.Talking about the camera work for the first few minutes, the camera movement was very visible but later as film goes on, the camera movement becomes static which gives a essence of looking through the eye of the characters in the movie. The Beauty of the film is the action sequence, it is precisely choreographed. And talking about the background music, it just blends with visual. On whole the film is engaging with all the aspects of life, the love sequences of the film doesn't disturb the engaging narration, instead it makes it even more better, this is the best part of the film. More than a film about gangster, it is film about life. The cast of the film did their best work. The one reason which holds the film back is the 'A rated' certificate which keeps away many people from going to the theatre.",life is simple it gets complicated when love becomes part it,as title reads characters movie also are complicated because love love power love people love status love money as lead character name itself is anbu meaning love how can his life be simpler part 1 is mainly focused how anbu is dragged into world darkness staging scenes are done very realistically which even more boost up intensity film director does his best job by portraying actual rawness place talking about camera work first few minutes camera movement was very visible but later as film goes camera movement becomes static which gives essence looking through eye characters movie beauty film is action sequence it is precisely choreographed talking about background music it just blends with visual whole film is engaging with all aspects life love sequences film doesnt disturb engaging narration instead it makes it even more better this is best part film more than film about gangster it is film about life cast film did their best work one reason which holds film back is rated certificate which keeps away many people going theatre,0.4595238095238095,0.3269607843137255,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.56}"

5,Warning: DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE TRAIN!,"So Dhanush and Vetri Maran's latest outing, Vada Chennai is just Kaala with higher dose of romance and curse words. The movie starts off on a promising note showing us the plight of today's central prison of Chennai, where rowdies and inmates have a free flow of drugs, alcohol and their attempts to make big name in smuggling business. It also has a good atmosphere in a gangster laden part of Vada Chennai (north madras). But introduction of too many unnecessary characters makes the story lacklustre, as we lose interest in who lives and who dies. I wouldn't blame the actors on this, as all the actors have done justice to their given roles. The screenplay is extremely uninteresting and Vetri Maran's vision gets completely blurred and tossed over in later second half. Suddenly this gangster flick turns into a good guy fighting alone against all the bad guys kind of cliched story.

10,Gangster film done right!!,"Being a sucker for gangster flicks I couldn't contain my excitement to watch this film but I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy it because of my high expectations due to all the hype and the extremely positive reviews (one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy films like Kammatipadam and Angamaly Diaries the way everyone did) but fortunately, Vada Chennai was everything I wanted it to be.Right from the ""Tarantinoesque"" opening scene to the non-linear storytelling and the crisp screenplay and camerawork, one could easily say that this has every possibility to be India's answer to Goodfellas and a cult classic in the years to come if the upcoming sequels are just as good as this one or even better, which I'm pretty affirmative they would be. Vetrimaaran has successfully been able to engage the viewers right from the start with the classic story of the rise of a young prodigy into the vicious life of a mobster. The layered and intricate writing boosted by the incredible cinematography, especially the long takes make it a visual treat for the genre lovers. The casting was perfect. Even the supporting actors did a great job. Dhanush, as always, stole the show with his brutally realistic portrayal of his character ""Anbu"". Certain scenes, which I won't reveal here were phenomenal and made me gaze at the screen with awe.Unfortunately, the only other film of Vetrimaaran that I've seen is Visaranai, which is a modern masterpiece and from the looks of this first installment to a trilogy, Vada Chennai is right up there along with it.

6,Impressive but the ending is the ultimate joke !,"An impressively presented movie of criminal underworld. Shambhu, the protagonist (carrom expert) gets involved in the gang war between two factions. The carrom game plays the role of minor diversion only, while the main intention is to portray the greed, mindlessnesss, violence, revenge in the world of organized crime. It preety did well with its fast narration, though felt like Piyush mishra in Anurag Kashyaps famous masterpiece. The cinematography and Dhanush are the bright point in the movie. Story was good also, though same viz. Betrayal, revenge, corruption in politico- crime zone.The main issue is its ending. It felt like unjustified at many levels. So does the ending means , Rajan became incarnated through Shambhu for no valid reason? It needed a few plots to establish that. I mean along the Rajan-Shambhu line. Also, characters like Senthil, Bhura, Chanda remained incomplete, unjustified. They all along through rigourous violence, revenge, high profile planning simply just accept Shambhu as the Don and liberator of the poor ? Simply like that? It felt like the director realised the length will surpasss the audience patient limit. So at last minute decided to present it simply as the raw record of gang info. There remained many lose ends to be explained.But the cinematography and camera technicals are good and worth wathing if you are a proffesional technician. Actors were also good. Watch it if you like to see new crime genre movies.",impressive but ending is ultimate joke,impressively presented movie criminal underworld shambhu protagonist carrom expert gets involved gang war between two factions carrom game plays role minor diversion only while main intention is portray greed mindlessnesss violence revenge world organized crime it preety did well with its fast narration though felt like piyush mishra anurag kashyaps famous masterpiece cinematography dhanush are bright point movie story was good also though same viz betrayal revenge corruption politico crime zone main issue is its ending it felt like unjustified at many levels so does ending means rajan became incarnated through shambhu no valid reason it needed few plots establish that i mean along rajan shambhu line also characters like senthil bhura chanda remained incomplete unjustified they all along through rigourous violence revenge high profile planning simply just accept shambhu as don liberator poor simply like that it felt like director realised length will surpasss audience patient limit so at last minute decided present it simply as raw record gang info there remained many lose ends be explained but cinematography camera technicals are good worth wathing if you are proffesional technician actors were also good watch it if you like see new crime genre movies,0.5126276884035504,0.1874630254802669,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.39}"
