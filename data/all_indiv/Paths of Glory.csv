10.0,Kubrick at the height of his powers- a wonderfully atmospheric film about the First World War,"I saw this movie for the first time on television today, after being persuaded by the reviews I read beforehand praising it. Also I like Kirk Douglas. Although I am not directly familiar with Kubrick's work, a shameful admission I know. Out of what I have seen so far I loved Dr Strangelove and despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked The Shining too. Anyway back on target, Paths of Glory was brilliant in my opinion! Winston Churchill famously claimed that it was this movie that was closest to evoking the atmosphere of WW1 and the military mind. And you know what, he is right. For one thing, Paths of Glory is gorgeously filmed, with relentlessly beautiful cinematography and nice costumes and scenery. The screenplay is sometimes humorous, sometimes moving and sometimes even haunting, either way it was some fine writing. The efficiency of Kubrick's direction is proof of a great man at work.The performances were superb. As the general who orders the hopeless attack on the German position, Adolphe Menjou's character is perceived as a villain not because of being an officer adhering to the letter, but that he is seen as ""the arrogant aristocrat"" because of his fear of the working classes than his hatred of the enemy. Among the cast, Timothy Carey and Kirk Douglas especially were outstanding. And the music? That is one rousing score I can tell you. Great movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",kubrick at height his powers wonderfully atmospheric film about first world war,i saw this movie first time television today after being persuaded by reviews i read beforehand praising it also i like kirk douglas although i am not directly familiar with kubricks work shameful admission i know out what i have seen so far i loved dr strangelove despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked shining too anyway back target paths glory was brilliant my opinion winston churchill famously claimed that it was this movie that was closest evoking atmosphere ww1 military mind you know what he is right one thing paths glory is gorgeously filmed with relentlessly beautiful cinematography nice costumes scenery screenplay is sometimes humorous sometimes moving sometimes even haunting either way it was some fine writing efficiency kubricks direction is proof great man at work performances were superb as general who orders hopeless attack german position adolphe menjous character is perceived as villain not because being officer adhering letter but that he is seen as arrogant aristocrat because his fear working classes than his hatred enemy among cast timothy carey kirk douglas especially were outstanding music that is one rousing score i can tell you great movie 10 10 bethany cox,0.667095238095238,0.3805952380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,They Couldn't Take An Ant Hill,"Almost one hundred years later the concept of that static war of the trenches that was the Western front of World War I is almost unfathomable. After the French army stopped the German offensive at the Battle of the Marne, the French and British armies faced the Germans in a line of trenches that stretched from Belgium to Switzerland. About a quarter of France was occupied for four years in that time. The casualties ran into the millions in that stalemate that gains were only measured in meters.It was always just one more offensive over the top charging into automatic weapon fire that would break the other guy. Just such an offensive was planned one day in 1916 against a German stronghold dubbed the ant hill. General George MacReady, promised a promotion by his superior Adolphe Menjou, orders a beaten and tired battalion to charge the ant hill. The attack flops and MacReady looks for scapegoats. He decides after coming down from shooting 100 men to a selected three drawn by lot. The unlucky three are Joseph Turkel, Ralph Meeker, and Timothy Carey.The commander of the three Kirk Douglas asks to serve as their counsel and he makes a good show of it at the kangaroo court martial they have. But the fix is definitely in.Except for Spartacus, Kirk Douglas rarely plays straight up heroic types in film. Even his good guys have an edge to them, a dark side. But as Colonel Dax, Douglas is at his most heroic. He may be one dimensional here, but he's great. Especially in that last scene with Adolphe Menjou when he tells the man off in no uncertain terms, mainly because Menjou has misread Douglas's motives. Menjou and Macready portray two different military types. The arrogant MacReady as versus the very sly Menjou. Not very admirable either of them. Menjou was not very popular at this time in Hollywood because of the blacklist. He favored it very much, his politics were of the extreme right wing. Nevertheless he was a brilliant actor and never better than in this film, one of his last.The enlisted men are a good bunch also. They're kind of like the posse in The Oxbow Incident, just an ordinary group who become ennobled in martyrdom as they go to the firing squad for the sake of politics.Paths of Glory is one of the best anti-war films ever made. It ranks right up there with All Quiet on the Western Front which showed the war from the German point of view. Both will be classics 200, 300, a thousand years from now.",they couldnt take ant hill,almost one hundred years later concept that static war trenches that was western front world war i is almost unfathomable after french army stopped german offensive at battle marne french british armies faced germans line trenches that stretched belgium switzerland about quarter france was occupied four years that time casualties ran into millions that stalemate that gains were only measured meters it was always just one more offensive over top charging into automatic weapon fire that would break other guy just such offensive was planned one day 1916 against german stronghold dubbed ant hill general george macready promised promotion by his superior adolphe menjou orders beaten tired battalion charge ant hill attack flops macready looks scapegoats he decides after coming down shooting 100 men selected three drawn by lot unlucky three are joseph turkel ralph meeker timothy carey commander three kirk douglas asks serve as their counsel he makes good show it at kangaroo court martial they have but fix is definitely except spartacus kirk douglas rarely plays straight up heroic types film even his good guys have edge them dark side but as colonel dax douglas is at his most heroic he may be one dimensional here but hes great especially that last scene with adolphe menjou when he tells man off no uncertain terms mainly because menjou has misread douglass motives menjou macready portray two different military types arrogant macready as versus very sly menjou not very admirable either them menjou was not very popular at this time hollywood because blacklist he favored it very much his politics were extreme right wing nevertheless he was brilliant actor never better than this film one his last enlisted men are good bunch also theyre kind like posse oxbow incident just ordinary group who become ennobled martyrdom as they go firing squad sake politics paths glory is one best anti war films ever made it ranks right up there with all quiet western front which showed war german point view both will be classics 200 300 thousand years now,0.45072356062740676,0.1944571240725087,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,"""Let the men have a few minutes more""","Although Kubrick's films are marked by their massive variation of genre and tone, one theme that crops up again and again is a strong anti-war sentiment, and this was never stated more strongly than in Paths of Glory. A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.In contrast to his previous picture, The Killing, a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches, walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick's other war film, Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame, as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well, albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered, and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.The light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers' headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.The use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The pre-recorded score is almost entirely percussive  all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene, while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread, further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite  a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.The casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou, there isn't a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.Throughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving, and the final moments in the soldier's bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else  the icing on the cake. However it's quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case, he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this, to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions.",let men have few minutes more,although kubricks films are marked by their massive variation genre tone one theme that crops up again again is strong anti war sentiment this was never stated more strongly than paths glory relatively early kubrick picture despite coming before what is considered his classic period it is one his best contrast his previous picture killing definite kubrick style is beginning emerge now one notable example is scene which general mireau tours trenches walking towards audience with camera retreating away him this technique would be repeated years later kubricks other war film full metal jacket there is also something about arrangement objects frame as well tracking dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style his recurring chess motif appears as well albeit subtly at court martial floor is chequered soldiers trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about be sacrificed light contrast this picture is put good effect palatial officers headquarters is light airy with few shadows trenches are gloomy cramped kubrick was becoming real master at contrasting locations getting look place just right use music paths glory is bold brilliant pre recorded score is almost entirely percussive all rhythmic sounds with no melody weird kettle drum track is used help build tension night patrol scene while climactic scene funeral march drumming instills sense dread further heightened by having shots edited time beat emotional final scene we get complete opposite beautiful vocal melody this has all more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums rest film casting is absolutely flawless while there are no big names apart leading man kirk douglas now elderly adolphe menjou there isnt single weak performance despair resentment condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real contrast smugness fake sympathy upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed throughout his career kubrick never seemed be particularly keen blatantly emotional moments paths glory is exception later scenes are incredibly poignant moving final moments soldiers bar are what makes it masterpiece more than anything else icing cake however its quite probable that kubrick regretted this as overly sentimental approach as woolly sentimentalism was major gripe his when he worked spartacus whatever case he certainly reined stirring stuff considerably after this point where his later films became characterised by their understatement emotions,0.5099404761904761,0.169156746031746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Kubrick--a fully-formed genius in 1957.,"At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best.

9.0,Stands the Test of Time,"An arrogant French general (a superb George Macready) orders his men on a suicide mission and then has the gall to try to court marshal and execute three of them for cowardice in the face of the enemy. A former lawyer turned colonel (Kirk Douglas in his prime) is the voice of reason against gross injustice. This excellently staged and wonderfully acted production is as much an acting showcase for Douglas as it is a directorial masterstroke by a young Stanley Kubrick who adapted this to the screen from a novel based on actual accounts.Kubrick displays a great control of sound effects and camera movement in the brief but effective battle scenes that expertly depict the controlled chaos that was trench warfare during WWI. Things get juicier during the ensuing courtroom battle where the deafening disparity between the elite who propagate and profit from war and the common citizens who suffer and die in war is shown with great lucidity.Unlike later Kubrick epics, this runs at a crisp 90 minutes, though suffers briefly from a slow and awkwardly staged opening ten minutes before Douglas comes on screen. Ultimately, this holds up very well to modern scrutiny thanks to the flawlessness of Kurbick's craft, the amazing ensemble acting, and the surprising depth of its philosophical and psychological pondering. ""Paths of Glory"" is more anti-arrogance than anti-war, and is unapologetically sentimental and pro-soldier. As such, much can still be gleaned from its message.",stands test time,arrogant french general superb george macready orders his men suicide mission then has gall try court marshal execute three them cowardice face enemy former lawyer turned colonel kirk douglas his prime is voice reason against gross injustice this excellently staged wonderfully acted production is as much acting showcase douglas as it is directorial masterstroke by young stanley kubrick who adapted this screen novel based actual accounts kubrick displays great control sound effects camera movement brief but effective battle scenes that expertly depict controlled chaos that was trench warfare during wwi things get juicier during ensuing courtroom battle where deafening disparity between elite who propagate profit war common citizens who suffer die war is shown with great lucidity unlike later kubrick epics this runs at crisp 90 minutes though suffers briefly slow awkwardly staged opening ten minutes before douglas comes screen ultimately this holds up very well modern scrutiny thanks flawlessness kurbicks craft amazing ensemble acting surprising depth its philosophical psychological pondering paths glory is more anti arrogance than anti war is unapologetically sentimental pro soldier as such much can still be gleaned its message,0.4442857142857143,0.18714285714285722,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,An Anti-War Masterpiece,"In France, in the First World War, the insane and ambitious general Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready) orders Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to lead his men in a suicide attack against Germans in the unattainable Ant Hill. After a massacre of the French soldiers, Gen. Mireau orders his artillery to drop bombs between the French front line of attack and the trenches, to avoid the soldier to return to the protection of the trenches. The commander of the French artillery refuses to accomplish the order. Gen. Mireau asks his superior, Gen. George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), to send three men to Court Martial and execute them for cowardice through shooting, as an example to the other soldiers. Colonel Dax, a former lawyer, defends his men in the unfair trial. Yesterday I watched this outstanding masterpiece for the first time and certainly it is among the best movies of the cinema history. The disgusting story shows the insanity of a war, where men are treated like numbers and not as human beings. The reality of the battles scenes is amazing. The cast has a stunning performance, highlighting the trio George Macready, Adolphe Menjou and Kirk Douglas. The lack of sensibility and respect for the human life and the cynicism in the dialogs of the two generals are fantastic. Two other points that called my attention are the fancy reception for the general staff, while their subalterns are fighting in the front and the misunderstanding of the real intentions of Colonel Dax by Gen. George Broulard. A must-see movie!

8.0,Awesome movie stands as a broody statement against war and man's inhumanity to man,"Sensational antiwar treatise based on facts with a relentless and vivid denounce against the military commanding class represented by two senior Generals ( George Macready , Adolphe Menjou ) who order his men a suicidal mission . France 1916 , a upright officer Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas )must lead his soldiers against difficult enemy positions called the 'Ants Hill' . Them also is the colonel lawyer assigned to defend three ( the privates Timothy Carey , Ralph Meeker , Joe Turkel) of them when the attack is lost against charges of cowardice and submitted to eventual firing squad.This is a thought-provoking and intelligent war drama perfectly acted by strong cast and masterfully directed . Intelligent screenplay based on a Humphrey's Cobb's novel has been well adapted by Stanley Kubrick and Jim Thompson . It depicts a brooding study about futility and insanity of war , making a shattering accusation against the military ruling staff who cares on promotions more than the soldiers . Kirk Douglas is very good as compassionate French Colonel who commands his troops in some spectacular scenes on the trenches . Stunning support cast beautifully performed by notorious secondaries as Emily Meyer as the priest , Wayne Morris as the lieutenant , Richard Anderson as the Major prosecutor , Ralph Meeker , Timothy Carey and Suzanne Christian , Kubrick's wife . Special mention to the two selfish Generals exceptionally performed by George Macready and Adolph Menjou . Excellent cinematography in black and white by George Krause filmed on location in Schleissheim Palace, Munich, and Bavaria Film studios, Geiselgasteig, Grünwald, Bavaria, Germany (studio).

10.0,Gripping Anti-War Film,"Paths of Glory is one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the best ""war"" movie, period. Paths of Glory does not portray war as conflict between armies or individual soldiers arrayed against one another on the battlefield. Nor does it portray the acts of great leaders and heroes of war.

10.0,A marvelous film about the STUPIDIST war in history with a dynamic performance by Douglas,"This is a wonderful film and for those who are looking to see a Stanley Kubrick film that the average person can relate to, this is a great initiation to the director's work. Some of his films are a bit hard to understand or frankly make my head hurt (2001 is a great example), but this one is much more straight-forward and conventional than most of his other films while still being a great film.The movie is based on a real incident in WWI. When a squad of French soldiers were ordered ""over the top"" (i.e., to crawl out of the trenches and charge across the battlefield while being shot down like dogs--the standard way of fighting on the Western Front), the men were so sick of the pointless fighting that they refused. As a result, the officers (who are shown sitting many miles behind the lines sipping sherry and living a life of opulence) order that some soldiers randomly be taken out of the group to be executed as an example to the others! The complete unfairness of the punishment, the futility of the war and the fact that the leaders were a group of soul-less fiends were the focus of this intensely interesting film.The lead was played by Kirk Douglas. His job was to defend these poor men, but it soon becomes obvious that the trial is a show trial--the men are doomed from the outset. In some films, Douglas' style of acting is not very appropriate, but his bigger than life acting style and the way he ultimately explodes at his superiors is a wonderful addition to the film. He single-handedly acts like the conscience of the nation--something that was clearly lacking. A wonderful and intense performance on his part--perhaps only surpassed by his lead in the film LUST FOR LIFE.This is a wonderful film about this war--a wonderful film to be seen along with ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT.

10.0,Kubrik's First Masterwork,"""Paths of Glory"" (1957) (and this is personal opinion of course) is Stanley Kubrick's first real masterpiece in what would be a long line of subsequent masterpieces. I know that Kubrick had a reputation for making cold, unemotional films (which is a false impression, but that's the subject for another essay) but I don't believe there are many people who can deny how powerful this film is. Through the editing, camera movement, incredibly realistic dialogue, and a now more fully realized use of irony, Kubrick creates an unforgettable anti-war parable. I realize that my love for this film is incredibly obvious, but I'll try to focus on an analysis of the film rather than a review, but the movie is just so good!    Francois Truffaut once said that there is no such thing as a true anti-war film because the battle scenes make the war look exiting. ""Paths of Glory""'s scenes of battle are certainly gripping, but gripping in the way that a nightmare is gripping. There is no way a person can see these scenes and wish they were participating (like the action scenes in say, ""The Dirty Dozen""). I vividly recall the scene where three men try to sneak behind enemy lines in the middle of the night. The battlefield is cloaked in darkness. Someone shoots a flare. Silently, a brief burst of light illuminates the field, revealing several corpses strewn over the ground. Darkness quickly covers them up again. Kubrick uses silence and sparse sound effects in this scene like a musical score. Any actual music would be intrusive and rob from the moment, a flaw found in too many otherwise good films of the nineteen fifties (personal opinion of course).    Point of view is used very well in the film to illustrate the inner concerns of the major characters. We see General Mireau's Point of view when he looks through the binoculars at the ant-hill he wants his men to take. When he hands over the binoculars to Colonel Dax, we don't see his view of the ant-hill. Later however, when Dax walks through the trenches before the big battle, we do see his point of view looking at his men. This contrasts with an earlier scene when Mireau walked through the trenches and we did not see his point of view. This clearly illustrates what is important to each man. For Mireau, it is victory at all costs; for Dax, it is the welfare of his soldiers.    For me one of the most impressive things about ""Paths of Glory"" was it's realistic, yet still poetic, and sometimes even chilling dialogue. This is in sharp contrast to the clever yet purposefuly stagy dialogue of ""The Killing"".    One scene sticks out my mind where a soldier is nervously rambling about what it would be like to get shot: ""Most guys say that if they got shot they'd want to die quick. So what does that tell you? It means there not afraid of getting killed, they're afraid of getting hurt. I think if you're gonna get shot and live, it's best to get shot in the rear than in the head. Why? Because in the rear its just meat, but the head, that's pure bone. Can you imagine what it's like for a bullet to rip through pure bone?""  When I first saw this film in a theater, there was some nervous laughter in the audience during this scene. It's true, the scene's dark humour helps illustrate the insanity of the situation.    In my introduction I stated that there was great use of irony in the film. Perhaps the greatest irony is the title. In the end no one finds glory. Dax, although he nobly fights to defend his men wrongly accused of treason, loses the fight. Even though he is later offered a promotion, he turns it down because of his disgust for the army. Mireau is found out to be the cad that he is for ordering his own troops slaughter, and is court marshalled.

10.0,Glorious Integrity In Every Aspect!!,"Paths Of Glory is a masterpiece without doubt. Usually a masterpiece is the pinnacle of a directors career. However when you are talking about Stanley Kubrick, you are talking about genuine genius. This is just one of his many masterpieces, but Paths Of Glory is probably as good a film as any of Kubrick's other best works. I have seen tons of war films in my life, many great ones. Honestly, this is my favorite of them all. When I first saw this film I didn't expect it to blow me away. After all it is an early Kubrick film, however it blew me away constantly, and completely. This is not only one of the greatest war films ever made, not only one of the greatest black & white films ever made, it is simply one of the greatest films ever made bar none. The film screams integrity, in each and every way.

10.0,Scary.,"It really is a testament to the power of the story told by this film that it stars the French army and they all speak nothing but English, and yet it is still be incredibly moving and compelling. On the other hand, the movie is not really about war but about the soldiers, kind of like Full Metal Jacket. It is structured almost exactly the opposite, with the first half of the film taking place on the battlefield and the second half off. Kirk Douglas plays Col. Dax, whose platoon is ordered to take a hill called the Anthill against staggering odds, almost surely a suicide mission.As the men rush out of the trenches in an attempt to complete the mission, I was reminded of Gallipoli as they were all mowed down within feet of exiting the trenches. It becomes clear that the mission is, ahem, impossible, and is abandoned. Where the movie is truly great is in its characterizations and the complexity of their relationships with one another. Watch, for example, the roles that certain characters play at the beginning and where they end up near the end of the film, such as the General who ordered soldiers to fire on their own men and the man who abandons two of his men on a watch, resulting in one of their deaths and the subsequent court martial and trial of the other. The situations that they end up in are what make the movie powerful.Clearly, the accepted forms of punishment for failing to accomplish a mission are frightening. I have no idea how accurate they are as to French military practices at the time, but for three soldiers to be taken at random and tried and sentenced to death because their entire platoon failed in an impossible mission is scary indeed. I wonder how they would have handled a few soldiers who refused to go on a mission to deliver contaminated gasoline because the vehicles had almost no armor on them whatsoever.What is truly amazing to me is that Kubrick was able to make a movie about massive military injustice and still make the audience laugh at certain times. The cockroach scene, for example, is wonderful comic relief. You get a good laugh without losing sight of the drama and the importance of the rest of the film.It is not uncommon to read that this is the greatest anti-war film of all time, and while there are other anti-war films that I think rank right up there with Paths of Glory, this certainly is one of the greatest ever made.",scary,it really is testament power story told by this film that it stars french army they all speak nothing but english yet it is still be incredibly moving compelling other hand movie is not really about war but about soldiers kind like full metal jacket it is structured almost exactly opposite with first half film taking place battlefield second half off kirk douglas plays col dax whose platoon is ordered take hill called anthill against staggering odds almost surely suicide mission as men rush out trenches attempt complete mission i was reminded gallipoli as they were all mowed down within feet exiting trenches it becomes clear that mission is ahem impossible is abandoned where movie is truly great is its characterizations complexity their relationships with one another watch example roles that certain characters play at beginning where they end up near end film such as general who ordered soldiers fire their own men man who abandons two his men watch resulting one their deaths subsequent court martial trial other situations that they end up are what make movie powerful clearly accepted forms punishment failing accomplish mission are frightening i have no idea how accurate they are as french military practices at time but three soldiers be taken at random tried sentenced death because their entire platoon failed impossible mission is scary indeed i wonder how they would have handled few soldiers who refused go mission deliver contaminated gasoline because vehicles had almost no armor them whatsoever what is truly amazing me is that kubrick was able make movie about massive military injustice still make audience laugh at certain times cockroach scene example is wonderful comic relief you get good laugh without losing sight drama importance rest film it is not uncommon read that this is greatest anti war film all time while there are other anti war films that i think rank right up there with paths glory this certainly is one greatest ever made,0.5175766283524905,0.10054050355774492,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,An anti-war movie hitting closer to home.,"I consider Paths of Glory as one of the most memorable of Kubrick's entire output. The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the ""real"" enemy. Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the ""monsters within"" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies.",anti war movie hitting closer home,i consider paths glory as one most memorable kubricks entire output most remarkable aspect this pioneer anti war film is complete absence any persons depicting real enemy therefore significance film lay not so much its anti war message but its brilliant expose monsters within general staff superbly acted by adolphe menjou george macready message here is that enemy lurks much closer home most war films whether they glorify or condemn carnage there is rarely any venturing at all into darker side politics this film is tour de force its unabashed depiction just how misguided is quest glory as end itself portrayal leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others their own self aggrandizement truly one my all time favourite movies,0.5859375,0.39296875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"The most realistic, most emotionally draining, and most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare in WW I.","I think that Stanley Kubrick is the greatest of all film directors, and in my opinion ""Paths of Glory"" is Kubrick's best film because:1. It is FAR AND AWAY the most realistic, most emotionally draining, and most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare in WW I, which has to be considered to be one of the significant episodes in all of human history.  The story is fiction, but the events are patterned after some actual mutinies in the French army that took place in 1917.2. I first saw this film 46 years ago, and it not only made me an avid Kubrick fan for the rest of my life, it made me want to watch it over and over again -- more than 250 times over the years, and every time I see it, I cry at the end (when Kubrick's future wife, and the only woman in the film, sings ""The Faithful Hussar"", causing the audience of French soldiers to change from a jeering crowd to a hushed, teary-eyed group of lonely men).3. Everything about the movie is PERFECT!! There are no flaws in the acting, the pace of the movie, the photography, the dialogue, etc. Scene after scene is more powerful and ironic than the preceding one, building to a shattering climax. It is simply a gem.4. Try as I might to think of actors that could have been substituted in their places, I think the casting for each and every part in the movie really could not have been any better.  No one could have been better in their respective roles than George Macready, Adolphe Menjou, Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, and all of the others.  Many of these actors appear in Kubrick's other films.5. Has there ever been a better scene than the one in which one of the condemned soldiers (Ralph Meeker) stares at this cockroach and cries that tomorrow that bug will still be alive and he will be dead. Whereupon one of the other condemned men (the fatalistic Timothy Carey) squashes the cockroach and says ""Now you got the edge on him"".6. You could probably change a few things in most of Kubrick's other masterpieces to slightly improve them, but I DEFY anyone to single out anything in ""Paths of Glory"" that could be improved upon. I could go on and on raving about the beauty and pathos of this film, but I think I will stop here.",most realistic most emotionally draining most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare ww i,i think that stanley kubrick is greatest all film directors my opinion paths glory is kubricks best film because 1 it is far away most realistic most emotionally draining most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare ww i which has be considered be one significant episodes all human history story is fiction but events are patterned after some actual mutinies french army that took place 1917 2 i first saw this film 46 years ago it not only made me avid kubrick fan rest my life it made me want watch it over over again more than 250 times over years every time i see it i cry at end when kubricks future wife only woman film sings faithful hussar causing audience french soldiers change jeering crowd hushed teary eyed group lonely men 3 everything about movie is perfect there are no flaws acting pace movie photography dialogue etc scene after scene is more powerful ironic than preceding one building shattering climax it is simply gem 4 try as i might think actors that could have been substituted their places i think casting each every part movie really could not have been any better no one could have been better their respective roles than george macready adolphe menjou kirk douglas ralph meeker all others many these actors appear kubricks other films 5 has there ever been better scene than one which one condemned soldiers ralph meeker stares at this cockroach cries that tomorrow that bug will still be alive he will be dead whereupon one other condemned men fatalistic timothy carey squashes cockroach says now you got edge him 6 you could probably change few things most kubricks other masterpieces slightly improve them but i defy anyone single out anything paths glory that could be improved upon i could go raving about beauty pathos this film but i think i will stop here,0.4992311507936508,0.25406746031746036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.14}"
,A Masterpiece,"Paths of Glory (1956) **** (out of 4) Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece anti-war drama centers on a Colonel (Kirk Douglas) who led a group of soldiers on a suicide mission but when the troops refuse to leave the trenches, three of them are hand picked to be executed on grounds of cowardice. I think sometimes it's easy to forget the pure genius of Kubrick and to me this was the first of many masterpieces that he'd deliver throughout his career. On a technical level this film is flawless from start to finish and this is certainly one of the greatest movies in its genre. There are so many brilliant scenes here that it's really shocking that such a young and fresh director could come off with something like this. There are many memorable scenes in the film but I suppose to most famous ones are the tracking shots following various men inside the trenches. Kubrick keeps the camera in front of the men and tracks them as they walk and the atmosphere this effect brings to the screen hasn't been matched from any war film that I've seen. This technique really builds a strange and claustrophobic nature that puts you right there in the action and gives you a sense of how tight these quarters are. The actual battle scene is also quite beautiful because it really doesn't center on any one piece of the action going on. Instead the camera just floats as the men try to capture their target and the swooping camera really gives you a bigger feeling of the battle. This scene comes off remarkably well considering the budget Kubrick was working with. The film is incredibly powerful with its messages on war and humans and all of this comes together beautifully in the finale, which is very haunting and touching. I think what made Kubrick a genius of his craft was the fact that he had a lot of guts and it's easy to see this with the ending, which doesn't end in a typical way. The final song was something very tricky to pull off yet Kubrick does so wonderfully well and really hits a home run with the message. Finally, the film contains some of the greatest acting you're going to see in the film with Douglas leading the way as the Col. who then must turn defender to try and keep the three men alive. The restraint nature Douglas shows perfectly fits the character but when his rage finally explodes, there's really no one better at doing this type of acting. George Macredy really steals the film as the General who wants the men executed and really becomes one of the most hated villains in film history.",masterpiece,paths glory 1956 out 4 stanley kubricks masterpiece anti war drama centers colonel kirk douglas who led group soldiers suicide mission but when troops refuse leave trenches three them are hand picked be executed grounds cowardice i think sometimes its easy forget pure genius kubrick me this was first many masterpieces that hed deliver throughout his career technical level this film is flawless start finish this is certainly one greatest movies its genre there are so many brilliant scenes here that its really shocking that such young fresh director could come off with something like this there are many memorable scenes film but i suppose most famous ones are tracking shots following various men inside trenches kubrick keeps camera front men tracks them as they walk atmosphere this effect brings screen hasnt been matched any war film that ive seen this technique really builds strange claustrophobic nature that puts you right there action gives you sense how tight these quarters are actual battle scene is also quite beautiful because it really doesnt center any one piece action going instead camera just floats as men try capture their target swooping camera really gives you bigger feeling battle this scene comes off remarkably well considering budget kubrick was working with film is incredibly powerful with its messages war humans all this comes together beautifully finale which is very haunting touching i think what made kubrick genius his craft was fact that he had lot guts its easy see this with ending which doesnt end typical way final song was something very tricky pull off yet kubrick does so wonderfully well really hits home run with message finally film contains some greatest acting youre going see film with douglas leading way as col who then must turn defender try keep three men alive restraint nature douglas shows perfectly fits character but when his rage finally explodes theres really no one better at doing this type acting george macredy really steals film as general who wants men executed really becomes one most hated villains film history,0.5295399515738498,0.24213075060532682,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,"""And you can go to hell before I apologize to you""","Paths of Glory is a movie that anybody can look at the cast of and instantly tell that it's going to be worthwhile. As if being directed by the legendary Kubrick wasn't enough to persuade you, Kirk Douglas also plays the main character. The movie is set during the first world war, where huge masses of men are killed in just a matter of seconds due to new inventions like machine guns and more advanced artillery. Douglas plays a colonel in the french army named Dax. Dax's superior officer, General Mireau, is eager to kill germans, but is aware the plan to take a fortified position known as the anthill is unlikely to succeed. Mireau's boss, General Broulard, promises to promote him if the attack goes well. Mireau vows to take the position, and doesn't care how many french soldiers die in the process. The attack soon begins, and colonel Dax leads his men over the top of their trench to attack the germans. It's a disaster. None of the men reach the enemy position, and the others refuse to get out of the trench to advance because they know they'll be killed too. General Mireau watches the action unfold from a distance and is infuriated at the colonel's lack of progress. He tells artillery to fire on his own men in order to force them out into the open, but the artillery gunners refuse. Mireau now blames Dax for the attack's failure, saying he wasn't aggressive enough, and wants to court martial a number of his soldiers for being cowards. Colonel Dax decides to defend his men at the court martial, but it is nothing more than a setup. No matter what he says, the men are found guilty anyway, and sentenced to be shot. Despite Dax's pleas, the men are eventually executed, and the person who gives the order to fire is Lieutenant Roget, who served under Dax in the trenches during the attack. At the end of the movie, Dax's men are in a bar listening to a captured German girl sing a folk song. This is one of the movies that best illustrates how many lives are destroyed by the deadly game called war. The movie conveys to the viewer that while older men declare it and make the plans, plans go wrong and young soldiers die. It's happened in every conflict, and world war 1 was recent enough to make the audience understand how horrific it was to fight through. Sadly, this type of pointless assault that involved thousands of men dying one after another would be the hallmark of the first world war, and the carnage would be unmatched for years to come. As expected, Douglas is superb as the sympathetic but ruthless colonel Dax, who tries to do everything in his power to stop his men from being executed, going so far as to call one of his commanding officers a sadist. George Macready plays the sadistic General Mireau amazingly, and he really does resemble a psychopath when he orders the artillery fired at his own frontline. Just another person twisted into a maniac by his thirst for prestige. Definitely an essential ww1 movie.",you can go hell before i apologize you,paths glory is movie that anybody can look at cast instantly tell that its going be worthwhile as if being directed by legendary kubrick wasnt enough persuade you kirk douglas also plays main character movie is set during first world war where huge masses men are killed just matter seconds due new inventions like machine guns more advanced artillery douglas plays colonel french army named dax daxs superior officer general mireau is eager kill germans but is aware plan take fortified position known as anthill is unlikely succeed mireaus boss general broulard promises promote him if attack goes well mireau vows take position doesnt care how many french soldiers die process attack soon begins colonel dax leads his men over top their trench attack germans its disaster none men reach enemy position others refuse get out trench advance because they know theyll be killed too general mireau watches action unfold distance is infuriated at colonels lack progress he tells artillery fire his own men order force them out into open but artillery gunners refuse mireau now blames dax attacks failure saying he wasnt aggressive enough wants court martial number his soldiers being cowards colonel dax decides defend his men at court martial but it is nothing more than setup no matter what he says men are found guilty anyway sentenced be shot despite daxs pleas men are eventually executed person who gives order fire is lieutenant roget who served under dax trenches during attack at end movie daxs men are bar listening captured german girl sing folk song this is one movies that best illustrates how many lives are destroyed by deadly game called war movie conveys viewer that while older men declare it make plans plans go wrong young soldiers die its happened every conflict world war 1 was recent enough make audience understand how horrific it was fight through sadly this type pointless assault that involved thousands men dying one after another would be hallmark first world war carnage would be unmatched years come as expected douglas is superb as sympathetic but ruthless colonel dax who tries do everything his power stop his men being executed going so far as call one his commanding officers sadist george macready plays sadistic general mireau amazingly he really does resemble psychopath when he orders artillery fired at his own frontline just another person twisted into maniac by his thirst prestige definitely essential ww1 movie,0.5005183413078149,0.0899654439128123,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,KUBRICK'S GENUINE CLASSIC MASTERPIECE,"What to say that hasn't already been said. This astonishing cinematic work of art (no kidding) unquestionably is the GREATEST FILM EVER - bar none. I deeply and passionately LOVE this brilliant early Kubrick production. Congratulations to expert screenwriters (and unique pulp writers of the 5O's) Calder Willingham (who also penned his own excellent adaptation of ""The Strange One""; highly recommended) and Jim Thompson (""The Grifters"" ""The Killer Inside Me""; which strongly influenced Tarantino), who both present a superbly incisive script with powerfully effective dialogue that really rings more than true. If only we had more real writers and scripts like this remarkable achievement, we'd be writing far more favorable reviews. ""Paths of Glory"", alone, would serve as anyone's lifetime achievement award. I don't care how much you HATE B&W films - put this one on your MUST-SEE. Compelling cinema-verite photography creates astounding visuals from a varity of incisive angles; like the famous mobile wide-angle tracking shot of Dax (probably Kirk Douglas's most stirring and important performance) moving through the squalid and horrifying trenches as the battle begins with explosions breaking out all over. The suspense and tension is frightening, but almost beautifully eerie in the most compelling ways as Kubrick takes us through the deadly limbo of no-man's land - the 'paths of glory' which finally leads to the grave. The action, skillfully combined with powerful moral and existential themes are amazingly conveyed through the bleak yet articulately stunning visuals. THIS IS A FILMMAKER'S FILM! The moral outrage of the sadistic injustice of the military courtmartial never fails to make my blood fully boil. The hypocrisy and corruption is degradingly infuriating. If anything will make a cynic out of you, it's this appropriately pessimistic and depressing cinema chronical based on a true stupid incident in WWI. What's even worse is how POG, in many perceptive ways, serves as an allegory for all the B.S. in real life: Pig-headed leadership in the parasitic hands of the superior greed freaks, two-faced deceptive manipulations, double-standards, backstabbings, social bigotry, arm-chair warriors, egotism, corrupt politics, the militaries's abuse of too much power - and it's destructive desire at satisfying it's lust for vainglory (sounds a little like Hollywood) - Did I leave anything out? You name it, POG has it - and I'm not being sarcastic. The entire ensemble cast is superb with special mention to George Macready as the utterly pompous power-mad glory-seeking ""soldier"", General Mireuo (who thinks nothing about ordering his troops to open fire on his own men for not charging out of the trenches and dying for his ""country""; which smells a bit like ME ME ME). Don't worry, you'll throughly hate his guts. It truly is true method acting. Again, kudos to Macready, a fine actor who was always too good at playing highly unethical villians. (Incidently, this was a favorite film of a young 195O's Marlon Brando and old salty Winston Churchill, who praised Kubrick's incisive authenticity in the exciting battle scene, which does resemble news footage). Timothy Carey (also ultra-offbeat-cool in Kubrick's other exceptional early flick, ""The Killing"") is morbidly humorous and gut-wrenching as one of the poor fools coldly picked to be executed; all in the ruthless 'patriotic' name (and amoral game) of 'glory'. ARE ANY OF OUR LEADERS LISTENING? Too bad that Carey's memorable talents were so underused by Hollywood, but that always seems to be the unfortunate norm. A little like what ironically happens to him in this intriguing but downbeat story. Ralph Meeker (who was also memorable as the brutal and ruthless Mike Hammer in the 5O's cult gem ""Kiss Me Deadly"" - a complete opposite role that shows a true range of his acting abilities) delivers another wretching performance as the true brave soldier unjustly sentenced for ""Cowardice in the Face of the Enemy"". (Maybe he should have turned 'about face', but it would have still been 'damned if he did and damned if he didn't' - another grim moral theme here). His breakdown scene right before he is to be taken out and shot is terribly heartbreaking, for I felt so wanting, but helplessly unable, to come to his help. Take my word for it, everyone else is awesome; a true actor's dramatic show with dark satirical overtones. POG goes beyond the mere preaching anti-war diatribe (though it does convey that almost naturally, like going without having to say). It's a great classic morality play that will really make you stop (many, many times) and truly make you think (many many times). Airheads not allowed. Moreover, this haunting and disturbing masterpiece is top entertainment, something too many art films aren't.   > It will really make you question things about our troubled, convoluted world and how things are to often immorally and inhumanly run all in the sick name of greed and destructive power. Not too lovely, for the director pulls no punches. This film really has grown more profound (and currently pertinent) since its initial release. Also the editing is taut and concise; there isn't a single wasted moment. Count the number of films on one hand that has accomplished that miraculous feat; that most critics and user commentators are always rightfully harking on. I'll shut up now. Go see this one-of-a-kind film, then see it again - and again, etc. >",kubricks genuine classic masterpiece,what say that hasnt already been said this astonishing cinematic work art no kidding unquestionably is greatest film ever bar none i deeply passionately love this brilliant early kubrick production congratulations expert screenwriters unique pulp writers 5os calder willingham who also penned his own excellent adaptation strange one highly recommended jim thompson grifters killer inside me which strongly influenced tarantino who both present superbly incisive script with powerfully effective dialogue that really rings more than true if only we had more real writers scripts like this remarkable achievement wed be writing far more favorable reviews paths glory alone would serve as anyones lifetime achievement award i dont care how much you hate b w films put this one your must see compelling cinema verite photography creates astounding visuals varity incisive angles like famous mobile wide angle tracking shot dax probably kirk douglass most stirring important performance moving through squalid horrifying trenches as battle begins with explosions breaking out all over suspense tension is frightening but almost beautifully eerie most compelling ways as kubrick takes us through deadly limbo no mans land paths glory which finally leads grave action skillfully combined with powerful moral existential themes are amazingly conveyed through bleak yet articulately stunning visuals this is filmmakers film moral outrage sadistic injustice military courtmartial never fails make my blood fully boil hypocrisy corruption is degradingly infuriating if anything will make cynic out you its this appropriately pessimistic depressing cinema chronical based true stupid incident wwi whats even worse is how pog many perceptive ways serves as allegory all b s real life pig headed leadership parasitic hands superior greed freaks two faced deceptive manipulations double standards backstabbings social bigotry arm chair warriors egotism corrupt politics militariess abuse too much power its destructive desire at satisfying its lust vainglory sounds little like hollywood did i leave anything out you name it pog has it im not being sarcastic entire ensemble cast is superb with special mention george macready as utterly pompous power mad glory seeking soldier general mireuo who thinks nothing about ordering his troops open fire his own men not charging out trenches dying his country which smells bit like me me me dont worry youll throughly hate his guts it truly is true method acting again kudos macready fine actor who was always too good at playing highly unethical villians incidently this was favorite film young 195os marlon brando old salty winston churchill who praised kubricks incisive authenticity exciting battle scene which does resemble news footage timothy carey also ultra offbeat cool kubricks other exceptional early flick killing is morbidly humorous gut wrenching as one poor fools coldly picked be executed all ruthless patriotic name amoral game glory are any our leaders listening too bad that careys memorable talents were so underused by hollywood but that always seems be unfortunate norm little like what ironically happens him this intriguing but downbeat story ralph meeker who was also memorable as brutal ruthless mike hammer 5os cult gem kiss me deadly complete opposite role that shows true range his acting abilities delivers another wretching performance as true brave soldier unjustly sentenced cowardice face enemy maybe he should have turned about face but it would have still been damned if he did damned if he didnt another grim moral theme here his breakdown scene right before he is be taken out shot is terribly heartbreaking i felt so wanting but helplessly unable come his help take my word it everyone else is awesome true actors dramatic show with dark satirical overtones pog goes beyond mere preaching anti war diatribe though it does convey that almost naturally like going without having say its great classic morality play that will really make you stop many many times truly make you think many many times airheads not allowed moreover this haunting disturbing masterpiece is top entertainment something too many art films arent it will really make you question things about our troubled convoluted world how things are often immorally inhumanly run all sick name greed destructive power not too lovely director pulls no punches this film really has grown more profound currently pertinent since its initial release also editing is taut concise there isnt single wasted moment count number films one hand that has accomplished that miraculous feat that most critics user commentators are always rightfully harking ill shut up now go see this one kind film then see it again again etc,0.6228474246841595,0.09990119857466792,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,Hard-hitting anti-war movie,"PATHS OF GLORY is a typically powerful anti-war movie from director Stanley Kubrick, starring Kirk Douglas in one of his most mature roles.

,another point of view,"I've read some of the last comments and all I can say is that I think most of you missed the point in this film. No offense to everybody, but I've never regarded this movie as an antiwar movie or something like that. The fact, that my interpretation is not corresponding with most of the others lies in the simple truth that 50% of work is done by the ""author"" and the rest is done by the audience.Kubrick used his films as little pieces of the great image of mankind. In all his movies one can see one or multiple depictions of individuals or groups and their feelings and actions, which are not only typical for the protagonists, and antagonists, but also for the viewer.In the Paths Of Glory this special feeling is perhaps the most ordinary of all: hope. From the beginning there is no hope in this movie. The battle is lost before it even started. Those three poor creatures are sentenced to death before even the trial had started. And still the audience hopes for a happy end, that the general may stop the execution in the last second. But nothing happens. At this point the viewer is as hopeless as the figures in the movie. The following breakfast scene leaves everybody in a state of paralization, nothing changes.And then at the end. this helpless and beautiful girl begins to sing a German folk song, which none of the present soldiers knows what it's all about. But the mood of the mob changes away from hate and anger and they all begin to cry like babies. In this very moment hope is reborn and comes back to the battlefield of feelings as the glorious winner. This is when we regain our hope.Many people wrote, that the last scene didn't fit in the film at all. I would say, that without this scene the movie would have never become the classic it is now. Of course the filming and actor performances are brilliant, but this specialty of the last scene makes this movie unforgettable.",another point view,ive read some last comments all i can say is that i think most you missed point this film no offense everybody but ive never regarded this movie as antiwar movie or something like that fact that my interpretation is not corresponding with most others lies simple truth that 50 work is done by author rest is done by audience kubrick used his films as little pieces great image mankind all his movies one can see one or multiple depictions individuals or groups their feelings actions which are not only typical protagonists antagonists but also viewer paths glory this special feeling is perhaps most ordinary all hope beginning there is no hope this movie battle is lost before it even started those three poor creatures are sentenced death before even trial had started still audience hopes happy end that general may stop execution last second but nothing happens at this point viewer is as hopeless as figures movie following breakfast scene leaves everybody state paralization nothing changes then at end this helpless beautiful girl begins sing german folk song which none present soldiers knows what its all about but mood mob changes away hate anger they all begin cry like babies this very moment hope is reborn comes back battlefield feelings as glorious winner this is when we regain our hope many people wrote that last scene didnt fit film at all i would say that without this scene movie would have never become classic it is now course filming actor performances are brilliant but this specialty last scene makes this movie unforgettable,0.42537202380952377,0.15061383928571428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,An excellent war film!,"The end sequence is beautifully symbolic.The soldiers in the bar watch as a frightened German girl is brought before them. As the poor lass struggles to sing her song (it really doesn't matter what song), they begin to realize that this hapless creature is enduring what their three executed comrades had endured themselves. Their three comrades were brought before the military tribunal as a formality before their execution. Now these soldiers are the tribunal for this pitiful girl who now stands before them awaiting their judgment. But unlike the cold inhuman justice that the French military machine has dealt to their compatriots, they watch intently as this German girl strives to sing in spite of all their cat calls and hoots and hollers, realizing that she is trying her best in spite of overwhelming opposition, just as they and their three dead friends had tried in attacking the ant hill. They cry because they see themselves up there on the stage.........a poor frightened soul that finds themselves in a situation they'd rather not face but is compelled to do so. Colonel Dax realizes this and allows this brief respite of humanity to engulf the troops before they are sent back to face the horrors of the war. This film is indeed one of the best war films ever made it simply overpowers the viewer with emotion.",excellent war film,end sequence is beautifully symbolic soldiers bar watch as frightened german girl is brought before them as poor lass struggles sing her song it really doesnt matter what song they begin realize that this hapless creature is enduring what their three executed comrades had endured themselves their three comrades were brought before military tribunal as formality before their execution now these soldiers are tribunal this pitiful girl who now stands before them awaiting their judgment but unlike cold inhuman justice that french military machine has dealt their compatriots they watch intently as this german girl strives sing spite all their cat calls hoots hollers realizing that she is trying her best spite overwhelming opposition just as they their three dead friends had tried attacking ant hill they cry because they see themselves up there stage poor frightened soul that finds themselves situation theyd rather not face but is compelled do so colonel dax realizes this allows this brief respite humanity engulf troops before they are sent back face horrors war this film is indeed one best war films ever made it simply overpowers viewer with emotion,0.43634085213032575,0.11315789473684212,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8.0,One of the greatest anti-war movies,"It's 1916 France. General Georges Broulard convinces General Mireau to send his men on a suicide mission to attack the fortified Anthill. The men are worn out. General Mireau with glory in his eyes downplays the difficulties to Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas). He even threatens to relieve Dax when he gives less than full enthusiastic support. On a 3-person night patrol, drunken lieutenant Roget kills fellow soldier Lejeune and then falsifies the records despite Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker). Dax leads the attack the next morning. The first wave is wiped out and the men refuse to continue the attack. Mireau court-marshals a man from each company for cowardice. Roget sends Paris as one of those men. Dax defends them in the kangaroo court.Stanley Kubrick creates one of the classic anti-war movies of all times. Its indictment was biting at the time and finds its glory by the opposition it faced.

,Casting a Long Shadow,"How well I remember the audience of 1958 sitting in stunned silence as the daring iconoclasm of the film washed over us like a bucket of cold water at a snoozer's convention. Post-war generations had seen nothing like its brutal honesty before. Instead, Hollywood had taught us that soldiers don't bawl like babies before being shot, that chaplains aren't part of a murderous war machine, that military justice really is about justice, and that generals however far removed are ultimately good and honorable men, (and that cameras always look away from execution scenes). Sure, the movie was not about our army, but the power of its message could not be missed, and no one from that era, having seen it, could again accept Hollywood's platitudes at face value. Now, fifty years later, the film is still timely, having lost none of its power to illuminate. Thanks be to Kirk Douglas for taking a chance on an unproven Stanley Kubrick and getting Allied Artists to finance what was so clearly a non-commercial project. I suspect too, that it was at AA's insistence that Hollywood veterans be cast, even though the movie was shot to great advantage amidst the majestic settings of old Europe. Given the film's message, I think Kubrick would have preferred no-name principals, but then, who could have surpassed the oily charm of Adolphe Menjou's diabolical general, or the pathetic repulsiveness of Timothy Carey's sacrificial dog-face. (It's ironic that the part of the cowardly lieutenant went to an authentic war-hero, naval air-ace Wayne Morris, then only two years away from an untimely death.) This many decades later, I still have mixed feelings about the celebrated final scene. On one hand, it's so clearly manipulative (someone once called it a ""male weepie""), that I try to steel myself against its undeniable force; on the other, it's so superbly well done that the humming chorus of universal brotherhood never fails to move me, even after this many viewings. Researchers digging into origins of 60's counter-culture should check out themes and characterizations of the screen-play, particularly Timothy Carey's social outcast and Fred Bell's absolutely stunning thirty seconds of emotional break-down. For this is one of the few films from the conformist Eisenhower era to cast a shadow forward in time and serve as a reference point for future generations. The film's abundant cynicism may no longer be as revealing as it once was, thanks to Vietnam. Yet the emotional honesty remains as fresh and compelling as ever in its search for a gut-level depiction of real human anguish. Above all, Kubrick's anti-war classic points toward a more civilized potential amidst the barbarities and passions of combat, whether French or American, and given present political realities, still has many lessons to offer.",casting long shadow,how well i remember audience 1958 sitting stunned silence as daring iconoclasm film washed over us like bucket cold water at snoozers convention post war generations had seen nothing like its brutal honesty before instead hollywood had taught us that soldiers dont bawl like babies before being shot that chaplains arent part murderous war machine that military justice really is about justice that generals however far removed are ultimately good honorable men that cameras always look away execution scenes sure movie was not about our army but power its message could not be missed no one that era having seen it could again accept hollywoods platitudes at face value now fifty years later film is still timely having lost none its power illuminate thanks be kirk douglas taking chance unproven stanley kubrick getting allied artists finance what was so clearly non commercial project i suspect too that it was at aas insistence that hollywood veterans be cast even though movie was shot great advantage amidst majestic settings old europe given films message i think kubrick would have preferred no name principals but then who could have surpassed oily charm adolphe menjous diabolical general or pathetic repulsiveness timothy careys sacrificial dog face its ironic that part cowardly lieutenant went authentic war hero naval air ace wayne morris then only two years away untimely death this many decades later i still have mixed feelings about celebrated final scene one hand its so clearly manipulative someone once called it male weepie that i try steel myself against its undeniable force other its so superbly well done that humming chorus universal brotherhood never fails move me even after this many viewings researchers digging into origins 60s counter culture should check out themes characterizations screen play particularly timothy careys social outcast fred bells absolutely stunning thirty seconds emotional break down this is one few films conformist eisenhower era cast shadow forward time serve as reference point future generations films abundant cynicism may no longer be as revealing as it once was thanks vietnam yet emotional honesty remains as fresh compelling as ever its search gut level depiction real human anguish above all kubricks anti war classic points toward more civilized potential amidst barbarities passions combat whether french or american given present political realities still has many lessons offer,0.45656565656565656,0.11838383838383838,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8.0,"""See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.""","Stanley Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' is the ultimate anti-war film. Rather than simply showing us the horrors of warfare and declaring that 'war is hell,' this films genuinely fills us with unbridled hate and anger, revealing the sheer folly and uselessness of combat. There are heroes in war, of course  namely Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) and his brave fighting soldiers  but certainly not the generals, who sit back in their comfortable armchairs and send thousands of their men to certain death without a trace of guilt or remorse.In the treacherous front-line trenches of World War One, a regiment of soldiers is ordered on a suicidal mission to seize the German-occupied ""Anthill."" French General Mireau (George Macready) is at first hesitant about the attack, citing the unacceptably high fatality rate and his duty to his loyal soldiers, but he is very quickly swayed in his convictions when his superior, General George Broulard, (Adolphe Menjou), hints at the possibility of a promotion. And so, led by a doubtful but loyal Colonel Dax (Douglas), the soldiers  in perhaps the most realistic war combat scene this side of 'Saving Private Ryan'  proceed with the attack, suffering immense losses and ultimately being forced to retreat. Furious about the perceived ""cowardice"" of his troops, an enraged General Mireau orders his artillery to open fire on his own men, but the artillery commander refuses to obey without a confirmation of written orders.Rather than taking the blame himself for the failed attack, Mireau decides to execute three men to set an example to the soldiers. Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) is chosen for execution because his commanding officer has a personal vendetta against him; Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), one of the most courageous soldiers in his regiment, was chosen randomly; Private Ferol (Timothy Carey) was chosen because he was something of a social outcast. Colonel Lax passionately defends the actions of his men during the court-martial, but, despite the utterly ridiculous cases made against them, all three men are inevitably found guilty of ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"" and sentenced to death by firing squad.Later, in one of the most suspenseful sequences ever committed to film, accompanied by the slow steady beat of an army drum, the three condemned men are lead to their place of execution, tied to posts and shot down by the weapons of their own army. Any other film from this era would have baulked at the final moment, offering its prisoners a last-minute reprieve, and the swift persecution of every general in charge of the original attack. Kubrick reportedly toyed with this option at one point, but it is to his credit that he stood firm on his daring and controversial ending. Indeed, French authorities considered the film such an offence to their army's honour that it was banned until 1975.",see that cockroach tomorrow morning well be dead itll be alive,stanley kubricks paths glory is ultimate anti war film rather than simply showing us horrors warfare declaring that war is hell this films genuinely fills us with unbridled hate anger revealing sheer folly uselessness combat there are heroes war course namely colonel dax kirk douglas his brave fighting soldiers but certainly not generals who sit back their comfortable armchairs send thousands their men certain death without trace guilt or remorse treacherous front line trenches world war one regiment soldiers is ordered suicidal mission seize german occupied anthill french general mireau george macready is at first hesitant about attack citing unacceptably high fatality rate his duty his loyal soldiers but he is very quickly swayed his convictions when his superior general george broulard adolphe menjou hints at possibility promotion so led by doubtful but loyal colonel dax douglas soldiers perhaps most realistic war combat scene this side saving private ryan proceed with attack suffering immense losses ultimately being forced retreat furious about perceived cowardice his troops enraged general mireau orders his artillery open fire his own men but artillery commander refuses obey without confirmation written orders rather than taking blame himself failed attack mireau decides execute three men set example soldiers corporal paris ralph meeker is chosen execution because his commanding officer has personal vendetta against him private arnaud joe turkel one most courageous soldiers his regiment was chosen randomly private ferol timothy carey was chosen because he was something social outcast colonel lax passionately defends actions his men during court martial but despite utterly ridiculous cases made against them all three men are inevitably found guilty cowardice face enemy sentenced death by firing squad later one most suspenseful sequences ever committed film accompanied by slow steady beat army drum three condemned men are lead their place execution tied posts shot down by weapons their own army any other film this era would have baulked at final moment offering its prisoners last minute reprieve swift persecution every general charge original attack kubrick reportedly toyed with this option at one point but it is his credit that he stood firm his daring controversial ending indeed french authorities considered film such offence their armys honour that it was banned until 1975,0.547425925925926,0.054082010582010565,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.57}"
