10.0,Cinema has rarely been this exciting!,"Having seen Tarantino's 3 previous films, going into the cinema, my expectations for 'Kill Bill' were already over the roof. However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes, and boy - what a mix he dishes out! With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Cinema rarely gets this exciting. With 'Kill Bill', Tarantino proved once and for all that all the hype around his persona is justified: he IS the most daring, original - and entertaining! - filmmaker of his generation.

9.0,Kill Bill Is One Hell Of A Thrill,"Pros: 1. The bright colour palette does a wonderful job at highlighting the over-the-top nature of the film. 2. The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal. 3. The score envelops the movie in a pulsating lively aura, and adds reems of energy to the scenes. 4. The action and fight scenes are incredibly entertaining and brilliantly choreographed. 5. The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes. 6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly. 7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances. 8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes. 9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.Cons: 1. The slow-motion used is extremely unattractive and pointless. 2. There is annoying minor usage of stock action screams.",kill bill is one hell thrill,pros 1 bright colour palette does wonderful job at highlighting over top nature film 2 entire animated sequence o ren ishii lucy liu origin story is gorgeously animated as well as being impactful brutal 3 score envelops movie pulsating lively aura adds reems energy scenes 4 action fight scenes are incredibly entertaining brilliantly choreographed 5 editing is mostly top notch especially with quick cuts adding lot vibrancy fight scenes 6 costume set design create outlandish world perfectly 7 both uma thurman bride lucy liu deliver great performances 8 sound mixing is very crisp clean it adds so much weight action scenes 9 make up art production is off charts regards gore helps make deaths feel more potent their execution cons 1 slow motion used is extremely unattractive pointless 2 there is annoying minor usage stock action screams,0.6041666666666666,0.2593344155844156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"

7.0,Sit back and enjoy the expertly-choreographed mayhem,"Tarantino's fourth effort and what a build-up; I hadn't seen a film this hyped up and over-covered since the release of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. It's a good movie and even better for those who are fans of the same type of cinema as Tarantino: enjoy pretty much any '70s exploitation movie, from Shaw Brothers kung fu to Japanese samurai, blaxploitation and more, and you'll doubtless enjoy this one. However, this is not up to the level of Tarantino's previous offerings: the plot is wafer-thin and the dialogue is far more sparse than we're used to. His witty repartee is gone, instead replaced with plenty of black humour and more simplistic dialogue. The plot, which feels stretched (perhaps splitting the film in two wasn't such a good idea), involves Uma Thurman working her way through a hit list in a simple revenge drama. Tarantino's idea was to make just the kind of overblown trash movies he loved watching when younger, and he ably succeeded with this frenetic outing.The movie is packed with action, and very violent action along with it. Japanese cinema is referenced in excessively bloody demises, where arterial fountains are the norm and limbs are chopped off like nobody's business. Elsewhere, you can't help but cheer as Thurman batters and mutilates her way through various killers, rapists, and hired help, and it helps that the actress puts her all into the film, especially physically; I don't think many actresses would be willing to undergo the punishment and unpleasant-looking stuff that Thurman suffers here. Of the other cast members, Lucy Liu makes for an ice cold villain whilst Vivica A. Fox has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it role. Asian film fans will enjoy seeing cult cinema icons Gordon Liu and Sonny Chiba pop up in welcome cameos. Plus there's an endless slew of film references, my favourite being the music taken from MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE! The infamous House of Blue Leaves massacre is easily the highlight of the movie, a twenty-minute action set-piece of outrageous proportions. Effects are purely basic, like those used in the '70s, with thankfully no CGI, and it pays off in spades. This film looks bloody and brilliant. It's just a shame that characterisation is so thin; Thurman has a cold heart which makes it impossible to identify with her at all. It's best just to sit back and enjoy the expertly-choreographed mayhem. Oh, and keep an eye out for the excellent anime sequence which fits perfectly rather than being out of place, which I feared it would be.",sit back enjoy expertly choreographed mayhem,tarantinos fourth effort what build up i hadnt seen film this hyped up over covered since release lord rings trilogy its good movie even better those who are fans same type cinema as tarantino enjoy pretty much any 70s exploitation movie shaw brothers kung fu japanese samurai blaxploitation more youll doubtless enjoy this one however this is not up level tarantinos previous offerings plot is wafer thin dialogue is far more sparse than were used his witty repartee is gone instead replaced with plenty black humour more simplistic dialogue plot which feels stretched perhaps splitting film two wasnt such good idea involves uma thurman working her way through hit list simple revenge drama tarantinos idea was make just kind overblown trash movies he loved watching when younger he ably succeeded with this frenetic outing movie is packed with action very violent action along with it japanese cinema is referenced excessively bloody demises where arterial fountains are norm limbs are chopped off like nobodys business elsewhere you cant help but cheer as thurman batters mutilates her way through various killers rapists hired help it helps that actress puts her all into film especially physically i dont think many actresses would be willing undergo punishment unpleasant looking stuff that thurman suffers here other cast members lucy liu makes ice cold villain whilst vivica fox has blink youll miss it role asian film fans will enjoy seeing cult cinema icons gordon liu sonny chiba pop up welcome cameos plus theres endless slew film references my favourite being music taken master flying guillotine infamous house blue leaves massacre is easily highlight movie twenty minute action set piece outrageous proportions effects are purely basic like those used 70s with thankfully no cgi it pays off spades this film looks bloody brilliant its just shame that characterisation is so thin thurman has cold heart which makes it impossible identify with her at all its best just sit back enjoy expertly choreographed mayhem oh keep eye out excellent anime sequence which fits perfectly rather than being out place which i feared it would be,0.543871975019516,0.0866120218579235,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Tarantino's Blue Period is OVER!,"Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie's Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions, the intercutting between dialogue, the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS, indeed, having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic, Pulp Fiction style, but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he's lost his writing talents (as some have claimed), and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is ""poor"", or that there are ""no memorable lines"" (Empire). The kung-fu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough, but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as ""steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine"". He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride's thirst for blood, her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill, of course, is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall, a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker's tool is not his pen: it's his eye.",tarantinos blue period is over,just saw kill bill vol 1 was surprised be honest at how incredibly good this film is here is craftsman or artist if you prefer at top his game some shots are simply incredible score is most part vintage tarantino selections rza does very good job at filling blanks uma thurman is great female lead sheer presence decent acting chops even lucy liu who i expected was going re hash her charlies angel character burst scene like flaming nunchuck stringing together scenes was impeccable transitions intercutting between dialogue flashbacks i simply could not get enough tarantino is indeed having fun here he is giving us film that may not go down as classic pulp fiction style but that shows us what is yet come i doubt that hes lost his writing talents as some have claimed i actually disagree that dialogue film is poor or that there are no memorable lines empire kung fu genre has never been particularly good park display shakespearean writing virtuosisms lines work fine plot is simple enough but tarantino takes burger serves it as steak tartare with sauce au poivre asparagus terrine he basically manages cram so much information into film that plot is simply irrelevent what is relevent is brides thirst blood her primal sense vengeance our total devotion her bill course is one greatest characters ever not appear screen overall great movie example how filmmakers tool is not his pen its his eye,0.5085387488328665,0.24130718954248365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,"Instant classic, but not for all audiences.","I know it's a couple years late, but I had to write a review for some of the few people that haven't seen one of my favorite and refreshing I've seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino's short, but distinguished list.Kill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.The movie is really a combination of Tarantino's love for the 70's over-dramatized Kung-Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool-Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale's blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.There are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.I wouldn't really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantino's continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's films, you should pass on this one because it is doesn't stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works, this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And, if you just don't like Tarantino himself, and find him annoying like everybody else, I don't blame you but it's still worth your while seeing.",instant classic but not all audiences,i know its couple years late but i had write review some few people that havent seen one my favorite refreshing ive seen over last few years kill bill vol 1 is yet another quality film tarantinos short but distinguished list kill bill involves nameless woman uma thurman who is slowing seeking revenge her former hit squad viper squad her boss bill david caradine her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends family during her wedding putting her into coma while being pregnant few years later she awakens hospital without child tries track down each member squad as story progresses through this film sequel you find out who she really why bill wanted her dead fate her daughter movie is really combination tarantinos love 70s over dramatized kung fu movie era story revenge with rich dialog yes this movie is violent but cheesy way this created some controversy really had audiences stirred up failing realize it was supposed be over top without no sense realism like i said it was supposed be tribute more so than gruesome action flick with all cheesiness aside i can understand how some people could feel little woozy after seeing someone lose arm having 4 gallons kool aid red blood shoot out body like whales blow hole what really makes this movie is tarantino ability make bad mediocre actors seem like good ones smart hilarious dialog good storyline course this is what he does pretty much all his movies there are various plot holes story but we are really meant ignore them unlike most movies just like gory scenes come grips fact that most implausibilities are there just fill gaps movie movie also features couple classic tarantino showdowns including unforgettable one with japanese infamous crime lord o ren ishii lucy lui once again tarantino puts his imagination at work again his story telling by using some his old techniques like jumping timelines some new ones like adding japanese animation character backgrounds i wouldnt really recommend this film someone who is really not pulp fiction era this film is really just homage flicks that frequently appear sunday samurai showcase revenge tarantinos continuous fascination with uma thurman this film contains extreme violence sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting directing if youre not fan tarantinos films you should pass this one because it is doesnt stray far his other stuff if you like his other works this is must see due its originality quality if you just dont like tarantino himself find him annoying like everybody else i dont blame you but its still worth your while seeing,0.4584567204132421,0.0412131145826798,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,This movie was brilliant!,"Man, what a film. As a fan of 70's martial arts movies, it was great to see all of the references. I also thought the use of B&W throughout was extremely effective. The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much, but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts, but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee-era action pictures. In those movies, the stories were very similar epics of revenge, and they never had much of a budget for good ""gore"" effects. It was more or less ""throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed"" type of effects, which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies; something despicable happens to the weak hero (whole village razed, family slaughtered, etc..) and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the ""secret move"" which the master normally does not teach, except of course, in this rare instance. That move, as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2, is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.Kill Bill was a terrific modern take on those movies which were always set in ancient China. I was very impressed with Uma Thurman's swordplay, at no point did I feel that it looked scripted or fake. Even when fighting against more than 50 Crazy 8's, it replicated admirably the incredibly one-sided fights from some of the best martial arts movies made 30 years ago.All in all, a great and original film!

8.0,Well made action film,"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a unique film. I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works.

7.0,Revenge Is Never A Straight Line,"Quentin Tarantino is certainly a cinephile's director. Many of the reviews that gut this film laud his abilities and his other works. An undeniably distinctive auteur, Tarantino is often criticized for self-indulgence, but that is what makes each of his works feel like a monument to a vision.""Kill Bill"" feels like a schoolboy's dream about an unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds. Take Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"", infuse it with the stylistic sensibilities of anime, and accent it with pop culture references, especially some strong musical numbers. The result is a personal saga that is the stuff of mythology.Uma Thurman is the nameless protagonist who virtually rises from the dead to seek a vengeance of desolation and mutilation. A perfect blade is fashioned for her mission, and it amplifies her lethality. Thurman gives a multi-leveled performance full of emotion and cold determination. She faces some strong adversaries and their minions, and she suffers through the terrible toll of her quest.Stylistically, KB plays with slo-mo, bold colors, silhouettes, and ""Crouching Tiger"" physics. Tarantino uses angles and viewpoints effortlessly.In one of the film's best moments, Thurman faces off against Lucy Liu, circling to the strains of Santa Esmerelda's introduction to ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""---one of the greatest dance tracks of all time. In a less subtle scene, she takes to the dance floor in a break-dance killing frenzy to ""Nobody But Me"" by the Human Beinz.A major question for each viewer is: how much gore is too much? Tarantino never shies from depicting carnage and dismemberment. In fact, he glorifies it in this film which, for my sensibilities, is an unnecessary distraction and a tasteless extravagance. In one scene he creates a literal bloodbath (bath of blood). Consequently, this film is not for everyone.",revenge is never straight line,quentin tarantino is certainly cinephiles director many reviews that gut this film laud his abilities his other works undeniably distinctive auteur tarantino is often criticized self indulgence but that is what makes each his works feel like monument vision kill bill feels like schoolboys dream about unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds take bruce lees enter dragon infuse it with stylistic sensibilities anime accent it with pop culture references especially some strong musical numbers result is personal saga that is stuff mythology uma thurman is nameless protagonist who virtually rises dead seek vengeance desolation mutilation perfect blade is fashioned her mission it amplifies her lethality thurman gives multi leveled performance full emotion cold determination she faces some strong adversaries their minions she suffers through terrible toll her quest stylistically kb plays with slo mo bold colors silhouettes crouching tiger physics tarantino uses angles viewpoints effortlessly one films best moments thurman faces off against lucy liu circling strains santa esmereldas introduction dont let me be misunderstood one greatest dance tracks all time less subtle scene she takes dance floor break dance killing frenzy nobody but me by human beinz major question each viewer is how much gore is too much tarantino never shies depicting carnage dismemberment fact he glorifies it this film which my sensibilities is unnecessary distraction tasteless extravagance one scene he creates literal bloodbath bath blood consequently this film is not everyone,0.5891581632653059,0.015539965986394563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.48}"
9.0,A movie of visual splendor and a mixture of styles.,"This movie is a visual experience of different styles, all combined with also some trademark Tarantino elements.The movie is obviously a case of style over substance. In essence the movie is just a basic revenge flick without too much depth or meaning. This however is exactly like how Tarantino intended it to be. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is simple, straightforward, completely over-the-top but above all beautifully shot and superbly directed. The movie its story comes totally secondary, as Tarantino used this movie as an experimental tool to mix several, mostly Asian cinema, styles together and blend it into one big visual experience of violence and unusual over-the-top looking sequences. His aim was style and with that this movie most certainly does not disappoint.Always when looking at a Tarantino movie, it becomes obviously that he's a big movie buff and movie lover. Tarantino really shows his love for- and pays homage to Asian cinema and especially anime. Most notably of course in the animated segment (that is great by the way) but also in almost every action/fight sequence in the movie and its violence. It gives the movie its own unique style and an overall atmosphere of 'coolness'.The violence is definitely brutal and straightforward, as gallons of blood are spilled in this movie. But all of the violence is done in such a, deliberately, over-the-top and fake looking way, that it becomes entertaining, rather than shocking or stomach turning. It even becomes poetically beautiful to watch at times. The action sequences are definitely the best parts of the movie and they are well choreographed and shot. When things get too graphic the movie simple conveniently switches to black & white or turns to other creative cinematic solutions.The power of this movie is definitely in its visual style and overall style of directing. The movie uses different themes throughout the movie but yet the movie manages to create one big unique identity. The movie never feels incoherent or disjointed in its style or storytelling, though it all widely differs from each other at times. I think that this is mainly thanks to Tarantino's directing, who keeps the movie and different styles all on one and the same line. Visually the movie is also definitely helped by Robert Richardson fantastic cinematography, who should at least had been rewarded with an Oscar nomination for it.The movie is filled with some big name actors, though not all play a significant part in the movie yet (see ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" for that). Uma Thurman is truly superb as the Bride and I can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career. She also was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for it. Also really superb in her role was Lucy Liu. Again, also her best role yet.Not of all the trademark Tarantino elements work out well in the movie I definitely missed the typical trademark Tarantino dialog in this movie and for also for most part the trademark non-linear storytelling felled pointless and didn't really served a purpose for the story.

10.0,Fantastic,"Probably Tarantino's most universal movie to date, with a little less character dependency than most of his films and a more linear approach than usual, Kill Bill Volume 1 is a great place to start for anyone new to his movies. I don't mean to imply this is a shallow film (far from it), i simply found it easier on the mind than Tarantino's other movies.Uma Thurman, left for dead by her ex-boyfriend (Bill) doesn't die and begins her quest for vengeance, by hunting down Bill's gang members in a search for Bill. Armed with a Samurai sword and a deadly blend of martial arts skills, Uma delivers action, violence and passion as she plays out the character with beautiful precision.Need i say, this is excellently directed, brilliantly scripted and cast, and should be in everyone's Tarantino collection.10/10 Second only to Pulp Fiction.

,An adrenaline-driven coaster-ride through gratingly bold and captivating martial-arts extravaganza.,"Sure it's outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker? Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?This film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events. Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.' My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

10.0,Gorgeous!,"A lot of people have come up to me and said ""How can you love Quentin that much, he is just too extreme!"" or ""Oh come on, Kill Bill is just SO not realistic.."" Yes. No.Mr. Quentin Tarantino is rather extreme, yes, and it's lovely! And No. Kill Bill is not realistic, but it's not meant to be realistic! Just like... Lord of the Rings, that's not realistic either! But because it has clear unreal elements, like wizards, it's acceptable?You don't go to see Kill Bill, or any other Q.T-film to see ""Stepmom"", in the same way you don't go to a Marilyn Manson concert hoping that they will play some Spice Girls..Kill Bill, both volume 1 and 2, is absolutely gorgeous! The art direction is beautiful! The camera angles are perfect... just Gorgeous! The lighting, the sound, the dialogs... and of course, the details! No one works with small details the way Quentin does. I must also say that the soundtrack is brilliant and the whole film is just so well casted! Uma Thurman is perfect in the leading role, Darryl Hannah has never been this good before, ever! And Chiaki Kuriyama, even though she has a quite small role, is excellent, even better than she is in ""Battle Royale"". David Carradine is painfully perfect, Michael Madsen is ALWAYS excellent, but never as good as when he works with Tarantino. I must also say that Sonny Chiba was great. I've never been a big fan of Vivica A Fox until now, and I used to think that Lucy Liu was just your average actor but she turned out to be fierce. Pretty much everyone who is in this film is ten times better than they've ever been.But above all things, Kill Bill is artistic, beautiful...

,"Quentin's back---badder,bloodier,and better","Well,ladies and gentlemen,it's a new millennium and Quentin Tarantino has got a new movie for us. After changing the popular film landscape in the 1990's with the classics ""Reservoir Dogs"",""Pulp Fiction"",and to a much lesser extent,""Jackie Brown"",Tarantino spent a half a decade in hibernation,accompanied by little more than a television set,a movie projector,and collection of Johnny Cash records and a bong. But now he is back after a six year hiatus with ""Kill Bill"",a thrill ride with the grand style of his earlier films and a brilliant tribute to those Shaw Brothers martial arts flicks of the 1970's and the action heroes of that same decade with includs Charles Bronson,Telly Savalas,Burt Reynolds,Clint Eastwood,Fred Williamson,Steve McQueen,Jim Brown and James Coburn. ""Kill Bill"" is also a chockablock of references to bygone movies like ""Master Of The Flying Guillotine"",""The Wu"",and the television shows like ""Hattori Hanzo"". This contains many of the elements that have made his earlier films so entertaining and he continues the tradition of that to.You have the wicked wit,the funky score,the hip-retro cultural artifacts and lots of non-stop,brace in your face action that is not to be missed. Also once again,he has divided the action into chapters with voiceover narrattion to boot,plus he's even got a new trick up his sleeve in which the story is told with some fancy Japanese anime. Basically the film gives much of the screen time to actress Uma Therman and she carries the film with the assurance of a golden diva that she is. The film rises and falls with her,and Thurman pulls that off beautifully in one of the best performances of the year. Thurman plays a professional assassin,attached to a criminal group of bodacious martial arts-trained killers(Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,and Lucy Liu)who are lead by the unseen,shadowy Bill(unseen in the first installment played by David Carradine). Among the crew she was called Black Mamba,but otherwise simply known as The Bride because she was betrayed on her wedding day when they gunned her down and left her and her near-term child for dead. But she gets her revenge against the ones that tried to kill her and from there the story is a thrill ride of sorts leading up to the next so expect the unexpected. However,a lot of body parts get slashed here and some of it is very gruesome includes scenes of decapitation of heads and a half a head,a leg in severely cut off and a Achilles Tendon gets slashed,a eye and some fingers get chopped off too. This film also has brought back some really good Kung-Fu stars from the 1970's which includes Sonny Chiba,aka ""The Street Fighter"",and so many more....... I'm surprised that martial arts actress Michelle Yeoh is not in this one. And by the way,what Quentin Tarantino movie wouldn't be correct without his main man Samuel L. Jackson in the role as The Organ Man. Jackson,however was in two Tarantino films including the role he should have gotten the Oscar for in ""Pulp Fiction"",which also starred Thurman and opposite Pam Grier in ""Jackie Brown"".However,the film ends in a cliffhanger so we will have to wait for the next installment which will be out in early 2004. Be forewarned,this not for the kiddies,so use caution when seeing it. In all,one hellva thrill ride.",quentins back badder bloodier better,well ladies gentlemen its new millennium quentin tarantino has got new movie us after changing popular film landscape 1990s with classics reservoir dogs pulp fiction much lesser extent jackie brown tarantino spent half decade hibernation accompanied by little more than television set movie projector collection johnny cash records bong but now he is back after six year hiatus with kill bill thrill ride with grand style his earlier films brilliant tribute those shaw brothers martial arts flicks 1970s action heroes that same decade with includs charles bronson telly savalas burt reynolds clint eastwood fred williamson steve mcqueen jim brown james coburn kill bill is also chockablock references bygone movies like master flying guillotine wu television shows like hattori hanzo this contains many elements that have made his earlier films so entertaining he continues tradition that you have wicked wit funky score hip retro cultural artifacts lots non stop brace your face action that is not be missed also once again he has divided action into chapters with voiceover narrattion boot plus hes even got new trick up his sleeve which story is told with some fancy japanese anime basically film gives much screen time actress uma therman she carries film with assurance golden diva that she is film rises falls with her thurman pulls that off beautifully one best performances year thurman plays professional assassin attached criminal group bodacious martial arts trained killers vivica fox daryl hannah lucy liu who are lead by unseen shadowy bill unseen first installment played by david carradine among crew she was called black mamba but otherwise simply known as bride because she was betrayed her wedding day when they gunned her down left her her near term child dead but she gets her revenge against ones that tried kill her there story is thrill ride sorts leading up next so expect unexpected however lot body parts get slashed here some it is very gruesome includes scenes decapitation heads half head leg severely cut off achilles tendon gets slashed eye some fingers get chopped off too this film also has brought back some really good kung fu stars 1970s which includes sonny chiba aka street fighter so many more im surprised that martial arts actress michelle yeoh is not this one by way what quentin tarantino movie wouldnt be correct without his main man samuel l jackson role as organ man jackson however was two tarantino films including role he should have gotten oscar pulp fiction which also starred thurman opposite pam grier jackie brown however film ends cliffhanger so we will have wait next installment which will be out early 2004 be forewarned this not kiddies so use caution when seeing it all one hellva thrill ride,0.36637738571700845,0.13646607585286824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,"Kill Bill is one of the brashest, boldest and bloodiest movies I have ever seen, so look over your shoulder, because........... 'Here comes the bride, with only one thing on her mind, a roaring rampage of re","It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it. It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill: Volume 2, get here, A.S.A.P.CMRS gives 'Kill Bill: Volume 1': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)",kill bill is one brashest boldest bloodiest movies i have ever seen so look over your shoulder because here comes bride with only one thing her mind roaring rampage re,it has been six years since we have seen movie one worlds most talked about directors quentin tarantino but wait me has been worth while tarantino can now add martial arts masterpiece kill bill his resume film that left me speechless after i had seen it it certainly is one intense hateful movie containing some

harm tb bill david carradine is their leader person we only hear see hand gestures which is reminiscent marsellus wallace pulp fiction bill still has very strong presence film even though we never see him under bill are killers like o ren ishii aka cottonmouth lucy liu whose introduction via japanese animation was great under cottonmouth is her personal assistant lawyer translator sofie fatale julie dreyfus who was present at slaughtering tb when tb sees sofie once again she is pretty bitter about what sofie let have happen her what we hear has happened sofie at hands tb is truly unbelievable another cottonmouths women is little girl go go yubari chiaki kuriyama who is more deadly than she looks her school girl sound look is very interesting while her confrontation with tb highly entertaining then there is evil nurse elle driver aka californian mountain snake daryl hannah who shows very little emotion towards tb other than hate vernita green vivica fox is another woman that tb has her hit list her demise was highly entertaining say least again reminiscent pulp fiction all scenes with fighting kb are highlight me especially sword fighting as they are so fun intense with last hour movie purely exhausting with final showdown between tb cottonmouth co being terrific middle section film was also great as it tells majority kb vol 1 story although parts are pretty disturbing kill bill is another film by quentin tarantino where i have say it was exceptionally well made there is scene volume 1 which reminded me matrix reloaded now i have heard that tarantino hates matrix franchise you can see what he is making stand against films laden with sfx kb is not guilty being that violence is very graphic kb but at certain times violence was laughable as it seemed look deliberately fake but perhaps i am wrong volume 1 ended at good point setting up conclusion volume 2 beautifully so kill bill volume 2 get here s p cmrs gives kill bill volume 1 4 5 very good

9.0,You can't have one without the other,"I'm only subtracting one star because either part one or part two taken alone seems incomplete, yet satisfying nonetheless. If they could have been merged into one film it would be the perfect combination of mystery, mythology, and exposition.Uma Thurman was nominated for a Golden Globe as ""The Bride,"" a woman who seeks revenge against the group of assassins, of whom she was once a member, who turned her wedding rehearsal into a bloodbath, killing everybody else in the wedding chapel and putting her into a coma for four years and having her awaken to an empty womb - she looked about eight months pregnant when Bill shot her. In volume one, although all five of the people involved in the massacre are on The Bride's hit list, she only kills two of them.The Bride goes after Vivica Fox's now-married housewife and mother, and Lucy Liu's Yakuza boss, which requires a trip to Japan. Tarantino pays homage to Japanese samurai films and Hong Kong martial arts films to make an entertaining story with excellent editing and soundtrack. A perfect start to what's to be expected in Vol. 2., which is where all of the backstories appear.If you walk away from both parts one and two wondering if there is any symbolism in there, is what you thought you saw what you really saw, and what on earth does that last scene mean?...consider yourself in good company. And my only spoiler, why didn't Lucy Liu's character want to kill Bill as much as Uma Thurman's did?

10.0,One of my most favourite films,"When I saw Kill Bill for the first time I just fell in love with the film. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding, The Bride emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback...with a vengeance. Casting was excellent everyone did a fantastic job in their own place, Uma was the best and no other actress could of taken her place. My favourite member of the deadly viper squad is Elle driver the one with the eye patch I also liked the tune she was whistling in the hospital, I was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained in Vol 2. They never showed Bill's face in the film that kept the suspense for the sequel which was a terrific idea especially for me because I never knew what the actor looked like before. The two best scenes are: 1. The animated sequence because it was a different story from the film's which made a suitable mood for the perspective. Overall it is the best idea ever the other two films I've seen with animated sequences are Lola Rennt a German movie & Karam an Indian movie and both of them are my all time most favourite films as well as Kill Bill.2. The sword fight with the Crazy 88s just before her revenge with O-Ren-Ishi because it was so unexpected when hundreds of them jumped out of nowhere ready to fight. I thought it was going to be simple because Bill was the main target but it turned out to be more difficult.The main reason why it is one of my favourite is because I'm a huge fan of revenge movies and Kill Bill gives a very deep insight of the topic e.g. Like the Old Klingon Proverb on the screen before the film which is ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" & when Hattori Hanzo said that ""Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest and like a forest it's easy to lose your way...to get lost...to forget where you came in"". It definitely deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 and Vol 2 was also good but not better than Vol 1.",one my most favourite films,when i saw kill bill first time i just fell love with film kill bill is definitely true masterpiece with classic story about brutal betrayal epic vendetta four years after taking bullet head at her own wedding bride emerges coma decides its time payback with vengeance casting was excellent everyone did fantastic job their own place uma was best no other actress could taken her place my favourite member deadly viper squad is elle driver one with eye patch i also liked tune she was whistling hospital i was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained vol 2 they never showed bills face film that kept suspense sequel which was terrific idea especially me because i never knew what actor looked like before two best scenes are 1 animated sequence because it was different story films which made suitable mood perspective overall it is best idea ever other two films ive seen with animated sequences are lola rennt german movie karam indian movie both them are my all time most favourite films as well as kill bill 2 sword fight with crazy 88s just before her revenge with o ren ishi because it was so unexpected when hundreds them jumped out nowhere ready fight i thought it was going be simple because bill was main target but it turned out be more difficult main reason why it is one my favourite is because im huge fan revenge movies kill bill gives very deep insight topic e g like old klingon proverb screen before film which is revenge is dish best served cold when hattori hanzo said that revenge is never straight line its forest like forest its easy lose your way get lost forget where you came it definitely deserves be imdb top 250 vol 2 was also good but not better than vol 1,0.565047619047619,0.22435185185185186,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.26}"
1.0,Tarantino Can Only Make One Film,"Quentin Tarantino is the most over rated movie director ever. He basically makes the same film over and over again with a different title.

,"Calling it ""Style-over-substance"" would be a HUGE overstatement, for it's pretentious and horrid in many ways","I hate this movie a lot. I have been going on about it for a while, so I think it's time to take my anger out by making a review. I think I may have offended some people, and I apologize. So, here it goes: ""Kill Bill"" is a very bad movie. I assume that Quentin Tarintino immediately drew in fans with ""Pulp Fiction,"" because of its wit and it was high on the ""cool"" factor. I saw some of it, and I will say that it was impressive. But, it looks like Tartintino became lazy by making this and co-directing the crappy ""Sin City.""The storyline of ""Kill Bill"" is about its name. Bill attacked a woman who we know as ""The Bride."" Her name is censored when mentioned. Now, ""The Bride"" wants revenge on Bill, and members of a gang called ""The Deadly Viper Assassin Squad."" So, she goes out and finds them and attacks them. The story ends there and it does well, sort of.The story is something that was thought up in a few minutes. The Bride wants to kill people, and she does. As simple as that. ""Kill Bill Volume One"" really is just shallow characters killing each other. First, she battles some woman. I have no clue what her name is though. Then, we find some history of The Bride. After, we find that The Bride was somehow knocked out. I forgot why. When she wakes up, we experience more brutal torture of people. Then, she gets a sword and kills lots of other people. The End.I find this very similar to ""Sin City."" It's a gory, shallow and pretentious action film that was made to show off a visual style and action scenes. The only real difference is that ""Sin City"" had something close to a storyline. This one didn't.Supposedly, this is Tarintino's homage to martial-arts films. So, that makes it a masterpiece? That makes it get onto the Top 250 Movies? Is that why it's rated so highly? It has plenty of references to other martial-arts films. For example, Uma Thurman wears a suit that looks similar to the suit worn by Bruce Lee in one of his previous films.Well, ""The Ring"" has loads of homages to horror films, including ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and ""Poltergeist."" Where's that on the Top 250 movies? Well, the homages seem as a cover-up for the story's' weakness. Why does a bodyguard fight in a skirt? I know people get attacked in a number of outfits, but since when does a bodyguard decide to fight in a schoolgirl outfit? The anime scene is near pointless, and doesn't even look like anime! It looks more like an attempt at drawing realistically, and ends up looking pretty ugly.Maybe it's because of the action. Well, there are only about two or three fight scenes, and they are only a bit exciting. There are plenty of other movies, which have better action. For example, ""Ultraviolet"" (Another bad movie) had more action than ""Kill Bill"" and a number of good fight scenes with good camera angles that gave it some flair. If that had homages to other films, would that be on the Top 250? I must say, even the action in ""The Karate Kid"" seemed to have a certain wit to it.All the action in ""Kill Bill"" is meaningless. It is meant to entertain. But, with loads of blood, what fun could it be? Its fun to watch The Bride slash her way through people, but after severed limbs appear, it loses it's fun. The violence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and (I think) the violence in ""The Wild Bunch"" had purpose. But this, like ""Sin City,"" is just sick, cruel violence.With that, there are PLENTY of movies with good action such as ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" ""Princess Monoke,"" ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""The Quick and the Dead."" All of these had better storyline that ""Kill Bill"", even if ""The Quick and the Dead"" seemed a little weak in that department.Backing up to horror films, I see that this film plays out like a mix of ""Scream"" and ""Hellraiser: Bloodline."" One person repeatedly tortures victims (like Pinhead) with a blade. (Like ""Scream"") Sadly, it's not as thrilling as ""Scream."" It's as thrilling as ""Hellraiser: Bloodline."" The characters are thin. I'm not talking about thin, as in skinny, but lacking detail. Sure, ""The Bride"" gives a bit of inside info on them (The ""inside info"" is showing the character killing somebody else.) but the characters usually die after that.The action seems too unrealistic. Our main character kills plenty of people, but how? She jumps in the air and lands on her sword (It's stuck into the stairs.) but how does she do that? There are some movies with unrealistic action sequences (""House of Flying Daggers,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") but those take place in ancient China. This takes place in a modern day setting and doesn't feel like either one of those films.That's why I hate the film. I can go on and on, but why should I have to? I suppose I hate it for all these reasons. Maybe the hype killed it. Or, it could be because Dan Grant's review influenced me to hate it. Either way, I don't like it.Yet, there are some good points to this movie. The action can be fun for some. I don't think torture is necessary though. The music was excellent. I liked the ""Bang Bang"" and ""Twisted Nerve"" song. I suppose it does seem interesting at parts, like when it turns into anime (even if the scene seemed pointless) or black-and-white. (But, this was already used in MANY other movies.)But, it still stinks. To me, this is about as bad as ""Ultraviolet""; it's shallow and uses style to cover up its crappiness.2/10",calling it style over substance would be huge overstatement its pretentious horrid many ways,i hate this movie lot i have been going about it while so i think its time take my anger out by making review i think i may have offended some people i apologize so here it goes kill bill is very bad movie i assume that quentin tarintino immediately drew fans with pulp fiction because its wit it was high cool factor i saw some it i will say that it was impressive but it looks like tartintino became lazy by making this co directing crappy sin city storyline kill bill is about its name bill attacked woman who we know as bride her name is censored when mentioned now bride wants revenge bill members gang called deadly viper assassin squad so she goes out finds them attacks them story ends there it does well sort story is something that was thought up few minutes bride wants kill people she does as simple as that kill bill volume one really is just shallow characters killing each other first she battles some woman i have no clue what her name is though then we find some history bride after we find that bride was somehow knocked out i forgot why when she wakes up we experience more brutal torture people then she gets sword kills lots other people end i find this very similar sin city its gory shallow pretentious action film that was made show off visual style action scenes only real difference is that sin city had something close storyline this one didnt supposedly this is tarintinos homage martial arts films so that makes it masterpiece that makes it get onto top 250 movies is that why its rated so highly it has plenty references other martial arts films example uma thurman wears suit that looks similar suit worn by bruce lee one his previous films well ring has loads homages horror films including rosemarys baby silence lambs poltergeist wheres that top 250 movies well homages seem as cover up storys weakness why does bodyguard fight skirt i know people get attacked number outfits but since when does bodyguard decide fight schoolgirl outfit anime scene is near pointless doesnt even look like anime it looks more like attempt at drawing realistically ends up looking pretty ugly maybe its because action well there are only about two or three fight scenes they are only bit exciting there are plenty other movies which have better action example ultraviolet another bad movie had more action than kill bill number good fight scenes with good camera angles that gave it some flair if that had homages other films would that be top 250 i must say even action karate kid seemed have certain wit it all action kill bill is meaningless it is meant entertain but with loads blood what fun could it be its fun watch bride slash her way through people but after severed limbs appear it loses its fun violence saving private ryan i think violence wild bunch had purpose but this like sin city is just sick cruel violence with that there are plenty movies with good action such as terminator 2 judgment day princess monoke house flying daggers quick dead all these had better storyline that kill bill even if quick dead seemed little weak that department backing up horror films i see that this film plays out like mix scream hellraiser bloodline one person repeatedly tortures victims like pinhead with blade like scream sadly its not as thrilling as scream its as thrilling as hellraiser bloodline characters are thin im not talking about thin as skinny but lacking detail sure bride gives bit inside info them inside info is showing character killing somebody else but characters usually die after that action seems too unrealistic our main character kills plenty people but how she jumps air lands her sword its stuck into stairs but how does she do that there are some movies with unrealistic action sequences house flying daggers crouching tiger hidden dragon but those take place ancient china this takes place modern day setting doesnt feel like either one those films thats why i hate film i can go but why should i have i suppose i hate it all these reasons maybe hype killed it or it could be because dan grants review influenced me hate it either way i dont like it yet there are some good points this movie action can be fun some i dont think torture is necessary though music was excellent i liked bang bang twisted nerve song i suppose it does seem interesting at parts like when it turns into anime even if scene seemed pointless or black white but this was already used many other movies but it still stinks me this is about as bad as ultraviolet its shallow uses style cover up its crappiness 2 10,0.5177596769702033,-0.011352339181286548,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

9.0,A classic action movie that manages to do everything right.,"This is one of the best, most perfectly balanced, hilarious, action-paced and thrilling movies of the genre.I am a newcomer to Tarantino's work with this being the first of his movies that I've seen, but now I 100% want to see more. Yes, it's gory and violent, but in such an over-the-top way, it makes the movie almost cartoon-like. I am delighted to finally see a well-executed badass female lead in a movie, what with the field being dominated mostly by men, and on top of all of that it still manages to be perfectly, sarcastically funny without being annoying or cringey.Throughout the movie there was never quite a still movement. And somehow the fight sequences were just so balanced and well-choreographed - often, when I'm watching a movie, after a solid few minutes of blood and death I get kind of bored at the repetitiveness of it all. But here, especially during the climactic fight scene with the Crazy 88, I was completely enthralled.Revenge is an oft-used plot device, and can sometimes come off as clichéd just because of the sheer number of times it's been used, but Tarantino's visual style carries this film in a way that I don't think I've ever seen before. All these unique little quirks that have been incorporated in, from having all the blood-heavy action sequences shot in black and white to make it a little easier on the eyes to the animé-esque snippet in the middle, have made this a film that I will not forget in a while.Wow. Just wow.-Sasha.",classic action movie that manages do everything right,this is one best most perfectly balanced hilarious action paced thrilling movies genre i am newcomer tarantinos work with this being first his movies that ive seen but now i 100 want see more yes its gory violent but such over top way it makes movie almost cartoon like i am delighted finally see well executed badass female lead movie what with field being dominated mostly by men top all that it still manages be perfectly sarcastically funny without being annoying or cringey throughout movie there was never quite still movement somehow fight sequences were just so balanced well choreographed often when im watching movie after solid few minutes blood death i get kind bored at repetitiveness it all but here especially during climactic fight scene with crazy 88 i was completely enthralled revenge is oft used plot device can sometimes come off as clich d just because sheer number times its been used but tarantinos visual style carries this film way that i dont think ive ever seen before all these unique little quirks that have been incorporated having all blood heavy action sequences shot black white make it little easier eyes anim esque snippet middle have made this film that i will not forget while wow just wow sasha,0.5829931972789115,0.12704081632653055,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
6.0,Tarantino's Worst Film To Date,"Before you jump to any conclusions after reading the title of my review, let me clear a couple things up. One, I usually love Tarantino--his directing, writing, the films he's produced, etc.--and two, the reason I didn't like Kill Bill Volume 1 had nothing to do with not liking the fight scenes or violence/gore. I love that stuff and that's the only part of the film that I found even mildly entertaining.Instead, the problem with Kill Bill Volume 1 is that it is extremely boring, almost completely lacks suspense, has awful pacing, and makes a number of self-indulgent stylistic missteps. I say ""almost completely lacks suspense"" only because of the first, relatively short section, where Uma Thurman's character, a former ""hitperson"", fights with another of the same kind, played by Vivica A. Fox. Suspense arises here because we don't know who the characters are yet, we don't know anything about the plot, we don't know what their motives are, etc. There is a sense of venturing into the unknown, where anything could happen.However, after this, Tarantino chooses to cling too tightly to his beloved device of non-sequential story construction, and the bulk of the film concerns Uma Thurman's attempt to take down a character whom we already know she has killed. That saps all of the tension from the rest of the film and makes it plod along as a fulfillment of something we're already aware of. It has all the drama of listening to your spouse tell _that_ story for the fiftieth time, this instantiation being filled with enough detail to take up an hour or two, and you're trying to read a book while they're telling it.Yes, Tarantino references tens of other films and genres in a ""homage"" that geeky fanboys can have a party game with--the one who names the most receives a free graphic novel and a case of Hawaiian Punch. Who cares? That in itself doesn't make Kill Bill a good story any more than a pointless clipfest of those films would make a good story. There is a reason that DVD's consisting only of promotional trailers aren't usually bestsellers.Yes, there are some interesting shots and intriguingly blocked scenes in Kill Bill. However, there aren't enough of them to make the film succeed if looked at merely as a series of images rather than a story.And yes, as I mentioned, I thought the over-the-top violence/gore was entertaining. If looked at isolated from its context, Quentin almost outdoes Sam Raimi ala Evil Dead here. However, and this is a big however due to having to consider context, Raimi's gallons of blood worked much better-because they were in an engaging, suspenseful story. In Kill Bill, the violence was almost boring.In an effort to be ""retro hip"", Tarantino includes a number of elements that blend with the film as seamlessly as President Bush in an Iraqi mosque. These are ubiquitous and varied, ranging from the stilted dialogue in the kitchen scene near the beginning (and this coming from someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue), to the strained inclusion of Sonny Chiba, to the ridiculous presence of a female Japanese band who can't sing or play their instruments--even though they're only trying to play I-IV-V ""rockabilly"" (and by the way, if this is what Tarantino think counts as quality music, what was he doing as a judge on American Idol?), to the almost obligatory occurrence of an anime scene. The latter is there just because Quentin and the fanboys think it's cool. For me, however, it underscores both the problem with most anime and with Kill Bill--yes, the subject matter, the violence, the attitude, etc. are interesting, but the animation, the storytelling, the pacing, and just about everything else sucks, and there are a number of inexplicable stylistic choices (such as the Caucasian-looking, big-eyed characters in anime). 'Forced' is probably the best way to describe the plethora of references and stylistic decisions in Kill Bill. Even the foot fetish stuff didn't work for me this time around, and I share the fetish with Tarantino. I'm not usually one to recommend tempering self-indulgence, and I suppose it doesn't matter anyway, since at this point people are going to love Tarantino films just because they're Tarantino, although if this film were made by anyone else, it would have earned the reputation of the 1998 Jeremiah Chechik-directed The Avengers instead. But if this is a sign of the quality to come, if Quentin is going to make further films that amount to laundry lists of all the stuff he likes _just because he likes it_, like a mega-budget mix-tape for a new girlfriend, I'm not watching any longer.",tarantinos worst film date,before you jump any conclusions after reading title my review let me clear couple things up one i usually love tarantino his directing writing films hes produced etc two reason i didnt like kill bill volume 1 had nothing do with not liking fight scenes or violence gore i love that stuff thats only part film that i found even mildly entertaining instead problem with kill bill volume 1 is that it is extremely boring almost completely lacks suspense has awful pacing makes number self indulgent stylistic missteps i say almost completely lacks suspense only because first relatively short section where uma thurmans character former hitperson fights with another same kind played by vivica fox suspense arises here because we dont know who characters are yet we dont know anything about plot we dont know what their motives are etc there is sense venturing into unknown where anything could happen however after this tarantino chooses cling too tightly his beloved device non sequential story construction bulk film concerns uma thurmans attempt take down character whom we already know she has killed that saps all tension rest film makes it plod along as fulfillment something were already aware it has all drama listening your spouse tell that story fiftieth time this instantiation being filled with enough detail take up hour or two youre trying read book while theyre telling it yes tarantino references tens other films genres homage that geeky fanboys can have party game with one who names most receives free graphic novel case hawaiian punch who cares that itself doesnt make kill bill good story any more than pointless clipfest those films would make good story there is reason that dvds consisting only promotional trailers arent usually bestsellers yes there are some interesting shots intriguingly blocked scenes kill bill however there arent enough them make film succeed if looked at merely as series images rather than story yes as i mentioned i thought over top violence gore was entertaining if looked at isolated its context quentin almost outdoes sam raimi ala evil dead here however this is big however due having consider context raimis gallons blood worked much better because they were engaging suspenseful story kill bill violence was almost boring effort be retro hip tarantino includes number elements that blend with film as seamlessly as president bush iraqi mosque these are ubiquitous varied ranging stilted dialogue kitchen scene near beginning this coming someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue strained inclusion sonny chiba ridiculous presence female japanese band who cant sing or play their instruments even though theyre only trying play i iv v rockabilly by way if this is what tarantino think counts as quality music what was he doing as judge american idol almost obligatory occurrence anime scene latter is there just because quentin fanboys think its cool me however it underscores both problem with most anime with kill bill yes subject matter violence attitude etc are interesting but animation storytelling pacing just about everything else sucks there are number inexplicable stylistic choices such as caucasian looking big eyed characters anime forced is probably best way describe plethora references stylistic decisions kill bill even foot fetish stuff didnt work me this time around i share fetish with tarantino im not usually one recommend tempering self indulgence i suppose it doesnt matter anyway since at this point people are going love tarantino films just because theyre tarantino although if this film were made by anyone else it would have earned reputation 1998 jeremiah chechik directed avengers instead but if this is sign quality come if quentin is going make further films that amount laundry lists all stuff he likes just because he likes it like mega budget mix tape new girlfriend im not watching any longer,0.5062775372775373,0.0556964886964887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
