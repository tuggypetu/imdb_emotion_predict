9.0,Very good,"In 1991, Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel ""American Psycho"" took the world by storm - women accused it of being misogynist, sexist filth and others were understandably shaken by its brutal and graphic depictions of unprovoked violence and torture.Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people."" It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time.In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone (""I just had to kill a lot of people!"") or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' ""Fore"" album before hitting an associate over the head with an axe.Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal - he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster - complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, ""American Psycho"" is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era - sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong - and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, ""American Psycho"" hits strong and hard - this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle - it never was.The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and ""Hip to Be Square""; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein.Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role.Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co-starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home - he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.Since its release, many critics have accused ""American Psycho"" of being a watered-down version of the book, being both ""politically correct"" and ""lacking satire."" However, I don't recall the last time I saw a man beat a dog to death with the heel of his shoe in a mainstream motion picture. Or chase after a prostitute completely naked, wielding a bloodied chainsaw. Or hold a gun to a cat's head and threaten to feed it to an ATM machine.In fact, when ""American Psycho"" was previewed before the Motion Picture Association of America, they gave it an NC-17 rating - not for its violence, as one might expect, but rather for its threesome scene between Patrick and two prostitutes.Director Mary Harron cut footage from the film and finally managed to achieve an R-rating, but on a new ""Uncut Killer Collector's Edition"" DVD, you can see the film as it was intended to be seen - and it's a real fine treat. Now excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes.",very good,1991 bret easton ellis controversial novel american psycho took world by storm women accused it being misogynist sexist filth others were understandably shaken by its brutal graphic depictions unprovoked violence torture set 1980s book follows story 27 year old harvard graduate named patrick bateman who goes killing spree murders twenty maybe forty people it was originally slated circulation 1990 but random house pulled out distribution fearing backlash it was later released as part vintage series quickly sold over 250 000 copies becoming one most popular some important literary works our time movie welsh actor christian bale portrays bateman gleefully tongue cheek whether its confessing manslaughter over phone i just had kill lot people or dancing huey lewis news fore album before hitting associate over head with axe patrick is troubled guy surface he appears be normal hes wall street broker with secretary expensive apartment suite his own limo fancy business card but inside hes monster complete with insatiable blood lust lack empathy fellow human beings if he can indeed be classified as one as film novel american psycho is attack absurdities 80s yuppie era sometimes satire isnt very subtle fact its often made very clear but i liked it because movie is so eccentric over top bale is so loony maniacal satire needs be equally strong it is whether its business men drooling over each others fetishistic business cards or patrick discussing nuances modern pop music before killing more victims american psycho hits strong hard this is great overwhelming cinematic visual experience it cannot be condemned being unsubtle it never was performances are wonderful bale is superb as bateman totally embodying character as man bewildered by his environment wanting only desperately fit bateman listens genesis hip be square finally we have proof that too much phil collins huey lewis will turn you into next ed gein perhaps some fans novel will dislike bales performance at times it almost seems comical such as when he murders his coworker paul allen played by jared leto but i thought it was perfect mix introspection self hatred outer loathing lust conformity schizophrenia bale manages capture all this perfectly by end film i could not imagine anyone else role willem dafoe chloe sevigny reese witherspoon all have co starring roles but at end day it is bale who really drives this film home hes reason its worth seeing part reason it exceeds beyond typical restraints its genre since its release many critics have accused american psycho being watered down version book being both politically correct lacking satire however i dont recall last time i saw man beat dog death with heel his shoe mainstream motion picture or chase after prostitute completely naked wielding bloodied chainsaw or hold gun cats head threaten feed it atm machine fact when american psycho was previewed before motion picture association america they gave it nc 17 rating not its violence as one might expect but rather its threesome scene between patrick two prostitutes director mary harron cut footage film finally managed achieve r rating but new uncut killer collectors edition dvd you can see film as it was intended be seen its real fine treat now excuse me i have go return some videotapes,0.5237964257964257,0.18698679098679097,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Grisly black comedy with unforgettable scenes,"A controversial adaptation of the controversial Brett Easton Ellis novel, this is actually a brilliantly conceived movie that sheds new life on the disturbed world of the serial killer – and as such may be the most innovative ""psycho"" movie since, well, PSYCHO! Filmly embedded in a hilariously '80s setting, this is both a thriller and a biting satire of the decade, with tons of subtle comedy and lashings of black humour to make the grisly subject matter a lot easier to digest.It's a wonderfully shot movie with plenty of memorable scenes, such as the infamous chainsaw murder, or the bit where Jared Leto gets an axe in the face. The movie works so well thanks to the strong acting which really makes it entertaining. Christian Bale is outstanding, a wonderful and scary and believable performance as a emotionless psychopath who realises that his own murderous inclinations are evil but is unable to do anything about it. His performance never falters for a moment.Similarly, the supporting cast of quirky characters are excellent – Reese Witherspoon's dumb-as-nails bitch; Samantha Mathis's junkie; Willem Dafoe's weirdo detective, plus a vivid array of minor roles. Although the movie is violent and pretty disgusting in places, it remains watchable and entertaining throughout thanks to the quirkily playful script and Bale's engaging performance.

8.0,"""I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""","I've been letting my thoughts for this film percolate now for about twenty four hours, so before any more time goes by I'll try to get it all down here. I thought there was something up with the picture when Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his cronies were comparing business cards for the first time. I got the impression that it was all a sham, that none of them were actually Vice Presidents of Pierce and Pierce, and that they were actually role playing the position of executives in anticipation of an eventual promotion. Bateman himself never seemed to do any work, other than having his secretary line up his appointments to meet associates or clients so he could spend additional time not working some more.The bigger tip off that this was possibly all just an imaginary story was the 'Feed me a stray cat' scene. By this time it was pretty well established that Bateman was unhinged, but the question is, to what degree. Did he really engage in those prior killing sprees or did he just imagine it? Or a third possibility, was he envisioning what it would be like to go completely berserk if all bets were off and he could completely get away with it. By the time the story's over, I think you'd have to be open to all these various interpretations, because in the 'real' world, you wouldn't have a realtor showing an apartment where bodies hung in the closet just days before.Going in, I had some trepidation when the DVD opened to a menu screen suggesting a splatter flick, and if I'm not mistaken, an image of a chain saw somewhere along the way. I've seen a couple of slasher/gore films in my time, and though I'm not that squeamish (any more), that kind of stuff does nothing for me. So anticipating a chain saw scene, I could only groan at the impossibility of the physics involved in poor Jean (Chloe Sevigny) taking a direct bull's eye hit like that at the bottom of the staircase. Just one more suggestion that this wasn't really happening.And what of Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe)? What happened to him? Was this Bateman's guilt becoming manifest, either because of an actual murder or because of his own malicious thoughts? Generally I get really upset about movies like this because they tamper with one's ability to follow a coherent story and come to a reliable conclusion about what happened in it. But then again, it's got the word 'Psycho' in the title, so I guess all bets are off. Personally, twenty five dollars for a couple of drinks at a trendy New York City night club is about as psycho as I'll ever get.",i think my mask sanity is about slip,ive been letting my thoughts this film percolate now about twenty four hours so before any more time goes by ill try get it all down here i thought there was something up with picture when patrick bateman christian bale his cronies were comparing business cards first time i got impression that it was all sham that none them were actually vice presidents pierce pierce that they were actually role playing position executives anticipation eventual promotion bateman himself never seemed do any work other than having his secretary line up his appointments meet associates or clients so he could spend additional time not working some more bigger tip off that this was possibly all just imaginary story was feed me stray cat scene by this time it was pretty well established that bateman was unhinged but question is what degree did he really engage those prior killing sprees or did he just imagine it or third possibility was he envisioning what it would be like go completely berserk if all bets were off he could completely get away with it by time storys over i think youd have be open all these various interpretations because real world you wouldnt have realtor showing apartment where bodies hung closet just days before going i had some trepidation when dvd opened menu screen suggesting splatter flick if im not mistaken image chain saw somewhere along way ive seen couple slasher gore films my time though im not that squeamish any more that kind stuff does nothing me so anticipating chain saw scene i could only groan at impossibility physics involved poor jean chloe sevigny taking direct bulls eye hit like that at bottom staircase just one more suggestion that this wasnt really happening what donald kimball willem dafoe what happened him was this batemans guilt becoming manifest either because actual murder or because his own malicious thoughts generally i get really upset about movies like this because they tamper with ones ability follow coherent story come reliable conclusion about what happened it but then again its got word psycho title so i guess all bets are off personally twenty five dollars couple drinks at trendy new york city night club is about as psycho as ill ever get,0.48425704412546505,0.12252126528442317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,American Psycho is not a story about murder,"The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality. People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Feynman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despairIt's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society. Bateman's interpretation of the world is skewed by his inflated ego and his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses. Bateman is a killer, but still, he's not the killer he thinks he is, as he goes insane he can't distinguish reality from fantasy. His over the top chainsaw massacre style killings may be an aestheticized elaboration on partial truths, ultimately the film doesn't care. The more significant point of the movies absurdity is that within his society Batemans not the psycho at all he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality, secretly discontented American psychos. Bateman is surrounded by like-minded superficial people obsessed with all the wrong things like making impossible reservations at Dorsia and the tasteful thickness of their business cards. Within the homogenized upper-class elite identities blur as everyone strives after a generic yet highly specific image of success.Everyone we see in Bateman's company appears to be the same person. It's no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously and swapped throughout the film. The lawyer has mistaken Paul Allen or perhaps Batman has killed the wrong person becomes not only plausible but also an expression of the general confusion resulting from the loss of individual identity.Meanwhile, although Batman tries like the rest to fit in, the emptiness of his lifestyle also fuels a craving to stand out. To escape the conformity that he on some level despises Batman leads a second life as a killer, where he's unfettered from the bounds of society. Although he actually wants to be seen as a murderer as someone different from the rest of society Bateman is denied even the satisfaction by every self-absorbed yuppie he meets. When he's seen stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, the witness is only interested in the bag.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.",american psycho is not story about murder,film looks examine our own distorted points view or detachments reality like patrick bateman we may be trapped craving approval others denying ourselves ability distinguish fantasies our reality people are obsessed with how others perceive them likewise american psycho bateman achieves no catharsis hes trapped his own personal hell because he requires recognition other yuppies confirm his identity as murderer irony is that feynmans real crimes may as well be fantasy lack acknowledging his reality drives bateman further into madness existential despairits about yuppie culture melding identity craving stand out superficial homogenized society batemans interpretation world is skewed by his inflated ego his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses bateman is killer but still hes not killer he thinks he is as he goes insane he cant distinguish reality fantasy his over top chainsaw massacre style killings may be aestheticized elaboration partial truths ultimately film doesnt care more significant point movies absurdity is that within his society batemans not psycho at all hes just one more normal guy amidst horde uncaring detached reality secretly discontented american psychos bateman is surrounded by like minded superficial people obsessed with all wrong things like making impossible reservations at dorsia tasteful thickness their business cards within homogenized upper class elite identities blur as everyone strives after generic yet highly specific image success everyone we see batemans company appears be same person its no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously swapped throughout film lawyer has mistaken paul allen or perhaps batman has killed wrong person becomes not only plausible but also expression general confusion resulting loss individual identity meanwhile although batman tries like rest fit emptiness his lifestyle also fuels craving stand out escape conformity that he some level despises batman leads second life as killer where hes unfettered bounds society although he actually wants be seen as murderer as someone different rest society bateman is denied even satisfaction by every self absorbed yuppie he meets when hes seen stuffing body into trunk car witness is only interested bag this is great movie look subtext under dialogue,0.4691489361702127,0.029432624113475178,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Strangely satisfying,One of the weirdest movies I've seen. Saw on video tape when it came out then recently watched it again 18 years later. Forgot how fun it is to watch. The absurdity of Bale's character Patrick Bateman's shallowness and preoccupation with superficial things like how upset he gets over a colleague having a better business card than him makes this movie comedic while he's slicing up victims. Still not sure about whether or not all of the things happening were all in his head. I guess that's up for anyone's interpretation of the story. Very well done and one of Bale's best performances as if he's ever performed badly.,strangely satisfying,one weirdest movies ive seen saw video tape when it came out then recently watched it again 18 years later forgot how fun it is watch absurdity bales character patrick batemans shallowness preoccupation with superficial things like how upset he gets over colleague having better business card than him makes this movie comedic while hes slicing up victims still not sure about whether or not all things happening were all his head i guess thats up anyones interpretation story very well done one bales best performances as if hes ever performed badly,0.4561728395061728,0.17222222222222225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.48, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Yes Bateman. I'm laughing AT you.,"Your pretentiousness is over-the-top ridiculous and makes you look like a fool. Yes, your fictional, but I've seen so many of you around walking down the streets of Manhattan on my way to my office. I've even seen you in elevators that we shared, and I have to hide the laughter I'm tempted to burst out with. I may even have exchanged a glance with you in a club and rolled my eyes and turned away. In all seriousness, I've talked to people socially who have Patrick Bateman qualities (or lack of qualities as a better phrase), utilize the most pretentious of body cleaning products, but they are so much better than everybody else simply because of a label on a pair of jeans. Am I surprised that Patrick Bateman turns out to be a psychopath? Absolutely not.The performance of Christian Bale is calculatingly brilliant, and that is due to how wonderfully despicable he is from the start, and it only gets worse. The way he talks is absolutely annoying, and that makes the film hysterical from the start. His facial expressions through the eyes and the way he talks makes me instantly discus him, but there are a lot of fools around in the business world who thinks latching on to a person like that would be an aid to their career. Then there's the women in his life, a fiance (Reese Witherspoon), a mistress (Samantha Mathis), and the secretaries and other assorted acquaintances that he abuses mentally and some physically as the audience gets to see how deranged he really is.Jared Leto and Josh Lucas are among the men in his social circle, through business and personal, and as the murders begin to happen, William Dafoe joins the story as the detective on the case. It all starts when he brutally assaults and murders a homeless man, not just killing him but verbally abusing him in the minutes before he strikes. He thinks he is acting like God and a deliverer, and this scene is very hard to watch even though it is necessary to get the plot moving.I have avoided this film for years, but I did break down and go to see the short-lived Broadway musical a few years ago. Both the original movie and the musical are a slap at the ridiculous pretentiousness of the higher echelon society when it gets to be too much, focusing on pretentious meals at overpriced restaurants, getting laughs through the announcement of the daily specials. This is not going to be for all tastes, but I love how it ridicules personality types like Bateman, probably not all psychopaths, but so hateful in their uppity manner that you can't help but enjoy watching them being taken down a notch or ten.",yes bateman im laughing at you,your pretentiousness is over top ridiculous makes you look like fool yes your fictional but ive seen so many you around walking down streets manhattan my way my office ive even seen you elevators that we shared i have hide laughter im tempted burst out with i may even have exchanged glance with you club rolled my eyes turned away all seriousness ive talked people socially who have patrick bateman qualities or lack qualities as better phrase utilize most pretentious body cleaning products but they are so much better than everybody else simply because label pair jeans am i surprised that patrick bateman turns out be psychopath absolutely not performance christian bale is calculatingly brilliant that is due how wonderfully despicable he is start it only gets worse way he talks is absolutely annoying that makes film hysterical start his facial expressions through eyes way he talks makes me instantly discus him but there are lot fools around business world who thinks latching person like that would be aid their career then theres women his life fiance reese witherspoon mistress samantha mathis secretaries other assorted acquaintances that he abuses mentally some physically as audience gets see how deranged he really is jared leto josh lucas are among men his social circle through business personal as murders begin happen william dafoe joins story as detective case it all starts when he brutally assaults murders homeless man not just killing him but verbally abusing him minutes before he strikes he thinks he is acting like god deliverer this scene is very hard watch even though it is necessary get plot moving i have avoided this film years but i did break down go see short lived broadway musical few years ago both original movie musical are slap at ridiculous pretentiousness higher echelon society when it gets be too much focusing pretentious meals at overpriced restaurants getting laughs through announcement daily specials this is not going be all tastes but i love how it ridicules personality types like bateman probably not all psychopaths but so hateful their uppity manner that you cant help but enjoy watching them being taken down notch or ten,0.4733506944444444,0.013628472222222228,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Not everyone will understand what this movie is trying to say.,"The author of the novel and the director of the film both say that it wasn't in his head. All of the yuppies dress the same, act the same, have the same job position (vice president), and have the same haircuts, which is why everyone always confused Patrick with someone else. Additionally, the satire was to show that everyone at the time was extremely narcissistic and superficial.

10.0,You can always look thinner,"'American Psycho' is NOT a slasher movie. It is a depiction, a fantasy if you will, of the life of modern man and his place in society.Nothing is enough. Money, sex, social stature, there is always someone else who has more and everyone else expect from you to try harder for even more.This movie is about eliminating competition the easy way. By killing your opponents. By eating your sexual partners. By destroying everyone around you.'American Psycho' retains the balance between this psychotic state, a chilling thriller and a very funny movie.The scenes that show Patrick playing music for his guests are absolutely hilarious, as he comments very seriously on records by artists such as Whitney Houston, Phil Collins and Huey Lewis & the News. The funny thing is that he chooses the most commercial or sold out records of these artists, to explain how much better they are compared to their previous, more artistic work. Another message of the state of the receivers of commercial art.You can analyze 'American Psycho' for hours. It can be perceived both as a deep and a fun movie.

9.0,Dark Commentary on 80s Wall Street Culture,"Patrick Bateman is a heartless man with no concern for those around him. Serial killer... or capitalist? This film explains there might not be much difference and perhaps shows us why serial killers in the 1980s were more celebrated than any time before or since in popular culture.This is not a film for everyone. Some (like myself) will love every little aspect, while others might be turned off my the sex and violence... or just be really confused by the style (the directing is weird, but actually pretty straight-forward once you've read the book). I suppose that is to be expected. Even those looking for a horror film might be let down, as that isn't the real focus here.The cast of this film is amazing. Willem Defoe needs no introduction. Chloe Sevigny (one of my favorites), Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon (not my favorite but good for her role) and Gwen Turner. Even Samantha Mathis shows up. But, of course, stealing the show is Christian Bale.Bale was the perfect choice to play Bateman and I'm glad director Mary Harron would settle for no one else (turning down Ed Norton, who gets compared to Bale but remains inferior). Bale is able to be any character he wants (comapre this to ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"" and especially ""The Machinist"" and see if there's any of the same characters here). As Bateman, he is perfectly self-absorbed and also maniacally distant. The little dance during the Huey Lewis scene (one I have heard he added himself) remains for me one of the two key scenes (the other involving a chainsaw).Besides the great acting (the real reason to watch this), the music is very noteworthy. The book does a fine job of elaborating on the music of the 1980s, and I think they incorporated that well here (throwing it in to death scenes rather than as solo pieces adds an interesting twist). This film, along with the gentlemen I go to the tavern with, really got me into Huey Lewis and Phil Collins. Which is really wonderful. Not so much on the Robert Palmer or Whitney Houston...I guess I should also compliment them on the tasteful way (read: artistic) the sex and violence was done. Ax wounds, chainsaws and bite marks... threesomes and science-knows-what done with a coat hangar. But the vast majority is shot from such angles that it's almost all left to the imagination: you think you see more than you really do.Clearly, I really want you to see this film. It's possibly Bale's best, or at least the one that pushed him into the spotlight. He steals the show. You won't like it if you don't like horror, but the title is ""American Psycho"" and the cover has a man with a knife, so you know what you're getting yourself into.

10.0,Classic masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece, and it is so underrated. So many quotable moments, true perfect cult piece. Violence is measured, much milder than in the book, which is improved on. It shows the true side of Wall Street morality, of all the little Eichmanns that lived and still live in Manhattan.

8.0,The majority of those who complain probably haven't read the book...,"... because with ""American Psycho"", Mary Harron and her screen writing partner have delivered the most faithful adaptation it would be possible to release without getting the film banned or revolting audiences so much that no one comes to see it. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to take some of the most extreme sequences from the book and commit them to film. What the movie instead does is to give us an insight into the stunningly fragile and insecure mind of Patrick Bateman, and to speculate whether his unstable nature would REALLY lead him to perpetrate vile acts, or whether he just fantasises about doing so.I think it matters little in the context of this film whether Bateman's exploits are actually based in reality, because whether they are or they aren't, Bateman is still left in the grip of paranoia, brought on by the shallowness of the society that is around him. Bateman is less of a 'psycho' than a vessel for all the selfish evils of society to corrupt, and a sensible audience is more likely to be left reeling at how he has been turned into a 'robot', than by the discreet amounts of gore that do feature in the movie.""American Psycho"" is fascinating to watch because Bateman is such a complex character. We feel revulsion at his violent tendencies, amused by his complete superficiality, and pity at his crumbling sanity. In order to evoke such diverse feelings from one performance, we need a superb actor. Bale's performance is right on the money. Never does HIS mask slip as does that of Patrick Bateman. He is completely believable in all his emotions.There is NOTHING in the film that is not true to the book (although there are bits in the book that are not true to the film) Both the reading and watching experiences are valuable and rewarding ones, but what they share with each other is that while they're exploring somebody else's mental state, they are also probing that of their audience. Can we see the funny side in the fact that these murders were committed for very trivial reasons?Can we ridicule someone with the knowledge that he is also a fantastically dangerous person? The film and book are constantly pushing boundaries, and if you don't fight that, but instead surrender to it, they will take you to many interesting places. Don't be afraid to give in to your emotions and laugh when you see something funny, because the movie shows us what emotional repression has done to someone like Patrick.Kudos to Mary Harron for tackling a seriously difficult project and turning it into one of the cleverest movies of recent years. ""American Psycho"" is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is: Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does?

9.0,A film that teeters between Miracles and Mania,"Having just finished American Psycho, I came to IMDB to get some clarification on the ending. And it seems I'm not the only one left vaguely adrift by the ambiguous ending.I've browsed some of your comments, not all 400+ to be sure. But some of them. A good sampling I think, and this movie has three distinct cheering sections.Those who consider it a masterpiece, those who consider it unredeemable, boring trash, and by far the largest segment, those who see it as a flawed masterpiece.I fall into the latter category. And no, I did not read the book. But as others have stated any movie that requires you to read the book, to ""get"" the movie, is ultimately a failure as a movie.So my review is based solely on the merits of the film. And contrary to what some have said, the film does have many merits. I found it brilliantly directed, and a superbly acted examination of excess, and boredom, and evil. An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking. Even before seeing the ending, I thought how much bateman lives in people. Found myself thinking, an examination of bateman is an examination of men by the name of Reagan and Bush. How American Psycho is an examination of our times, and our modern theologies.I found the movie as a whole riveting, loved the restraint shown (and disagree with those calling for more gore, I think Mary should be applauded for her deft hand, the scenes have more power for what is not shown), and was captivated by nearly every scene, by scenes others have called boring, but I found profound.Bateman putting on his makeup, or simply trying to get a restaurant, and the near apocalyptic importance, such minutiae makes in the lives of empty men. The right card, or the right cloth, or the right table, or the right watch, how these are the signposts of an empty age and an empty soul, and how these things have more value than your fellow man... or woman.Bateman attains everything the materialistic times tells him he should want, but once he gets it he feels nothing. Emptier than before, less than before. It's only in the extremes of his addictions he begins to feel something, anything. He feeds to fill the emptiness, but the more he feeds the emptier he gets. He eats at his fellowman (woman) but in his bloodlust he eats at himself.He is the American dream, taken to its cannibalistic extremes.And never before has makeup, played such a mesmerizing part in a movie. Bateman's(Chris Bale's) face at times when he is under stress, takes on a plastic look, a glossy, sweaty sheen, and for all the world it looks like he's wearing a mask... and the mask, his mask of sanity, is beginning to run.Simply amazing use of makeup. And incredible performance by the lead actor. I wasn't familiar with him before this, but everyone will be after this.Upon first hearing about this movie, I had no desire to see it. I've grown up since the age of Hills Have Eyes and trash like The Beyond, watching people suffer no longer seems significant. I guess as we get older we ask more of our art than springer, or the WWF, or slasher flicks. We ask of our art to tell us something true. Something of ourselves, and our world.I think American Psycho under the deft hand of Mary Harron becomes more than my prejudices, and exceeds my expectations. Rises at times to dizzying heights not unlike art.Mary's restraint makes this movie. But I fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well. The ending is too ambiguous. Who is Bateman in the end. Is there a Bateman? And what did he do or did not do?In the end,the movie will nag at you. Did he or didn't he? And in the end, now that I write this I'm thinking maybe the answer doesn't really matter, maybe in the end the answer is the same. In the end a sin of thought, or a sin of action, is still a sin. In the end we are left with a man, and a nation... whose mask is slipping. I think like the first Psycho, time will prove this one.... worthy. I now add Mary Harron to the small selection of modern directors I will tiptoe through broken glass to see. Directors like Dave Fincher(Seven, Fight Club), Carl Franklin(Devil in a Blue Dress), Johnny To(Expect the Unexpected), Ringo Lam(Full Alert, Victim), M. Night Shyamalan(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), and Peter Weir(Fearless).Recommended.",film that teeters between miracles mania,having just finished american psycho i came imdb get some clarification ending it seems im not only one left vaguely adrift by ambiguous ending ive browsed some your comments not all 400 be sure but some them good sampling i think this movie has three distinct cheering sections those who consider it masterpiece those who consider it unredeemable boring trash by far largest segment those who see it as flawed masterpiece i fall into latter category no i did not read book but as others have stated any movie that requires you read book get movie is ultimately failure as movie so my review is based solely merits film contrary what some have said film does have many merits i found it brilliantly directed superbly acted examination excess boredom evil examination satire critique time type thinking even before seeing ending i thought how much bateman lives people found myself thinking examination bateman is examination men by name reagan bush how american psycho is examination our times our modern theologies i found movie as whole riveting loved restraint shown disagree with those calling more gore i think mary should be applauded her deft hand scenes have more power what is not shown was captivated by nearly every scene by scenes others have called boring but i found profound bateman putting his makeup or simply trying get restaurant near apocalyptic importance such minutiae makes lives empty men right card or right cloth or right table or right watch how these are signposts empty age empty soul how these things have more value than your fellow man or woman bateman attains everything materialistic times tells him he should want but once he gets it he feels nothing emptier than before less than before its only extremes his addictions he begins feel something anything he feeds fill emptiness but more he feeds emptier he gets he eats at his fellowman woman but his bloodlust he eats at himself he is american dream taken its cannibalistic extremes never before has makeup played such mesmerizing part movie batemans chris bales face at times when he is under stress takes plastic look glossy sweaty sheen all world it looks like hes wearing mask mask his mask sanity is beginning run simply amazing use makeup incredible performance by lead actor i wasnt familiar with him before this but everyone will be after this upon first hearing about this movie i had no desire see it ive grown up since age hills have eyes trash like beyond watching people suffer no longer seems significant i guess as we get older we ask more our art than springer or wwf or slasher flicks we ask our art tell us something true something ourselves our world i think american psycho under deft hand mary harron becomes more than my prejudices exceeds my expectations rises at times dizzying heights not unlike art marys restraint makes this movie but i fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well ending is too ambiguous who is bateman end is there bateman what did he do or did not do end movie will nag at you did he or didnt he end now that i write this im thinking maybe answer doesnt really matter maybe end answer is same end sin thought or sin action is still sin end we are left with man nation whose mask is slipping i think like first psycho time will prove this one worthy i now add mary harron small selection modern directors i will tiptoe through broken glass see directors like dave fincher seven fight club carl franklin devil blue dress johnny expect unexpected ringo lam full alert victim m night shyamalan sixth sense unbreakable peter weir fearless recommended,0.5043035993740216,0.1488430583501006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,"A movie ahead of its time, with a meaningful and really deep message, that applies very well to modern society.","Due to the recent rise of popularity on the internet of ""American Psycho"", I decided to finally watch it, and I was pleasantly surprised. I was not expecting such a deep and realistic depiction of our modern society. For sure this movie was ahead of its time, and it took years before getting noticed.First of all I had to approach this film with the right mentality: I needed to go beyond what I was watching on screen and understand the message underneath all this apparent nonsensical and over the top violence. Bateman is the pure representation of a person that, despite being already successful and lucky, wants more. As he says he wants ""to fit in"" in a world where clearly does not belong. He started to feel envy and hate for colleagues that achieved more than him. This will quickly escalate in a burst of violence that will cause several victims. This is exactly the metaphor of what is happening nowadays with people chasing success, never satisfied by their goals. The killings are just an allegory: more and more people, estraniate themselves from reality, and they become mad, they are not able to separate what is real and concrete, from what is pure delusion. This is exactly what happens to Patrick Bateman, in his attempt to reach perfection. This kind of destructive mentality has so many bad effects on the character, that in the end he becomes crazy and starts to merge reality with ideas in his head. He feels bad about the whole situation, and I think that the detective represents the guilt of feeling this way towards other people.Christian Bale as always delivered an amazing and compelling interpretation. He managed to depict the fall into madness of Bateman. The guy was clearly dedicated to the role and he always has control over the scene. He managed to be creepy and funny at the same time. He gave life to a very interesting character that deserves to be studied deeply. Happy to see Willem Defoe, even if it was just for a few scenes. The cast is composed of good actors such as Matt Ross, Jared Leto and Bill Sage, who had a pretty decent acting career, with a handful of successful movies and TV shows in their curriculum.It is not an easy watch. There are in fact many graphic scenes, nothing too strong in my opinion, but some people may feel uncomfortable. Some dialogues would never happen if this movie was made today. There is misogyny, hate speech towards other people and animal violence. So, approach with discretion. I wish more commercial movies would push boundaries in this way nowadays and be shocking. Using violence in a smart way, and not just for the sake of being gruesome.",movie ahead its time with meaningful really deep message that applies very well modern society,due recent rise popularity internet american psycho i decided finally watch it i was pleasantly surprised i was not expecting such deep realistic depiction our modern society sure this movie was ahead its time it took years before getting noticed first all i had approach this film with right mentality i needed go beyond what i was watching screen understand message underneath all this apparent nonsensical over top violence bateman is pure representation person that despite being already successful lucky wants more as he says he wants fit world where clearly does not belong he started feel envy hate colleagues that achieved more than him this will quickly escalate burst violence that will cause several victims this is exactly metaphor what is happening nowadays with people chasing success never satisfied by their goals killings are just allegory more more people estraniate themselves reality they become mad they are not able separate what is real concrete what is pure delusion this is exactly what happens patrick bateman his attempt reach perfection this kind destructive mentality has so many bad effects character that end he becomes crazy starts merge reality with ideas his head he feels bad about whole situation i think that detective represents guilt feeling this way towards other people christian bale as always delivered amazing compelling interpretation he managed depict fall into madness bateman guy was clearly dedicated role he always has control over scene he managed be creepy funny at same time he gave life very interesting character that deserves be studied deeply happy see willem defoe even if it was just few scenes cast is composed good actors such as matt ross jared leto bill sage who had pretty decent acting career with handful successful movies tv shows their curriculum it is not easy watch there are fact many graphic scenes nothing too strong my opinion but some people may feel uncomfortable some dialogues would never happen if this movie was made today there is misogyny hate speech towards other people animal violence so approach with discretion i wish more commercial movies would push boundaries this way nowadays be shocking using violence smart way not just sake being gruesome,0.5431025480367587,0.09368734335839597,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7.0,Dellusion or Real?,"In New York, the narcissist investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works in the bank of his fiancée's father and usually has dinner with his shallow coworkers at fashionable and expensive restaurants. Bateman worships notorious serial-killers, such as Ed Gein or Ted Bundy, and he is a psychopath. When his co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) shows a business card of better quality than his, Bateman plots to kill him using the name of another colleague. He murders Paul with an ax and tapes a message in his answering machine telling that Paul is travelling to London. Soon the private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) investigates Paul's disappearance and interviews Bateman. Then Bateman hires two prostitutes to spend the night with him doing kinky sex and he tortures the women. Bateman tries to kill a homosexual co-worker; murders a model; and tries to kill his own secretary.

10.0,A great visual and psychological achievement. Christian Bale delivers a knock-out performance. **** (out of four),"AMERICAN PSYCHO / (2000) **** (out of four)Patrick Bateman: I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. ---""American Psycho""	The average filmmaker would turn ""American Psycho"" into an exploitative slasher flick, but Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have adapted the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis into something unique and intriguing, a brilliant, thought-provoking social commentary thriller.Readers criticized the decade old novel because of its graphic violence, but that doesn't cause Turner and Harron to give into the controversial material. I have never read the book, but after watching ""American Psycho,"" I intend to. It's a scathing, rare film that probes our imagination and beliefs while experimenting with true psychological terror. It often makes startling switches between scenes of dark comedy and sequences that portray unsettling, graphic images. Director Mary Harron says in the film's press notes that she wanted all but one of the violent sequences to be disturbing. The amount of blood and violence here is certainly extreme, but considering the nature of the beast, not overly abundant. The film calculates every single act of violence, therefore, the victims are seldom random characters, but people we care about, which is why the scenes are so timely and effective. The best description of the film's main character, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) comes from Christopher Lehmann-Houpt of The New York Times. ""Patrick Bateman lives in a morally flat world in which clothes have more value than skin, objects are worth more than bones, and the human soul is something to be sought with knives and hatchets and drills."" Both leading actors in ""American Psycho"" have previously portrayed Jesus Christ, Willem Dafoe in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" and Christian Bale in ""Mary, Mother of Jesus."" Talk about versatility. It's probably not a coincidence that Christian Bale was the initial actor of preference for Mary Harron. If an actor can display such a fascinating performance as Jesus Christ, he's more than capable of playing a psychotic serial killer because he already knows the other side of the moral spectrum. Through the strong central character, ""American Psycho"" suggests several themes about the 1980's, including society's obsession with outer perfection, conformity, the rising threshold of material fetishism, and the strong desire of stimulation by drugs, sex, money, and power. Patrick Bateman isn't given a back story, however, and the movie doesn't offer his personal history. Bateman has no inside emotions. He reacts by inner impulse alone. He seeks gratification through the sex and drugs, but also by engaging in the homicidal behavior.  ""You could describe American Psycho' as a film about perfect surfaces and what might be lurking beneath,"" says Mary Harron. ""Inside, Bateman might want it all to stop, but for him it's a compulsion. He's like the serial killer in M, who says: You have a choice, but I can't help what I am.'""""American Psycho"" initially earned an NC-17 rating, not because of the violence but because of the graphic sexual content. The director's cut is available on videocassette and DVD, which shows the film's three-way sex scene in more disturbing, yet innovative, detail. That's a good thing, if you're not a sensitive viewer, because this film is all about details. The production design, the cinematography, the visual effects, the engaging soundtrack, the quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character, and every other aspect of the film is flush in detail. This is a movie that requires more than one viewing, to experience the surreal visual arena, and to justify what we think actually happened. Perplexingly, the film's conclusion puts the events into question. Did Bateman really kill these people, or did he just really want to? The answers don't come easy, but this is a movie that begs us to look closer",great visual psychological achievement christian bale delivers knock out performance out four,american psycho 2000 out four patrick bateman i think my mask sanity is about slip american psycho average filmmaker would turn american psycho into exploitative slasher flick but mary harron guinevere turner have adapted controversial novel by bret easton ellis into something unique intriguing brilliant thought provoking social commentary thriller readers criticized decade old novel because its graphic violence but that doesnt cause turner harron give into controversial material i have never read book but after watching american psycho i intend its scathing rare film that probes our imagination beliefs while experimenting with true psychological terror it often makes startling switches between scenes dark comedy sequences that portray unsettling graphic images director mary harron says films press notes that she wanted all but one violent sequences be disturbing amount blood violence here is certainly extreme but considering nature beast not overly abundant film calculates every single act violence therefore victims are seldom random characters but people we care about which is why scenes are so timely effective best description films main character patrick bateman christian bale comes christopher lehmann houpt new york times patrick bateman lives morally flat world which clothes have more value than skin objects are worth more than bones human soul is something be sought with knives hatchets drills both leading actors american psycho have previously portrayed jesus christ willem dafoe last temptation christ christian bale mary mother jesus talk about versatility its probably not coincidence that christian bale was initial actor preference mary harron if actor can display such fascinating performance as jesus christ hes more than capable playing psychotic serial killer because he already knows other side moral spectrum through strong central character american psycho suggests several themes about 1980s including societys obsession with outer perfection conformity rising threshold material fetishism strong desire stimulation by drugs sex money power patrick bateman isnt given back story however movie doesnt offer his personal history bateman has no inside emotions he reacts by inner impulse alone he seeks gratification through sex drugs but also by engaging homicidal behavior you could describe american psycho as film about perfect surfaces what might be lurking beneath says mary harron inside bateman might want it all stop but him its compulsion hes like serial killer m who says you have choice but i cant help what i am american psycho initially earned nc 17 rating not because violence but because graphic sexual content directors cut is available videocassette dvd which shows films three way sex scene more disturbing yet innovative detail thats good thing if youre not sensitive viewer because this film is all about details production design cinematography visual effects engaging soundtrack quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character every other aspect film is flush detail this is movie that requires more than one viewing experience surreal visual arena justify what we think actually happened perplexingly films conclusion puts events into question did bateman really kill these people or did he just really want answers dont come easy but this is movie that begs us look closer,0.42732372990993694,0.13360078618699306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"

9.0,"Businessman Bateman makes a killing, both at work and at home.","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, good-looking Wall Street businessman with his own office, a pretty PA (Chloë Sevigny), an attractive fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), a desirable Manhattan apartment, and a fine collection of sharp implements and power tools, perfect for hacking up hookers and ridding himself of pesky professional competition.American Psycho, based on the controversial cult novel by Bret Easton Ellis, is a razor-sharp satire of the yuppie lifestyle that will forever be associated with the late '80s, an era when success was often measured by how much money you earned, who you knew, what suit you wore, and which restaurants you could get reservations at.Bale's narcissistic Bateman epitomises the yuppie stereotype—self-obsessed, materialistic, power hungry, and predatory, his life is dedicated to feeling superior to all those around him, no doubt because that, secretly, he knows that he is devoid of genuine worth: his position in the company is shared by several indentikit employees (so alike that there are frequent cases of mistaken identity); his fiancé is having an affair (but then so is he); and the only person who truly likes him (apart from himself) is his secretary, who he stupidly deems unworthy of his magnificence. Deep down, he's a very insecure and confused individual.To compensate for his shallow existence, Bateman extends his lack of empathy and ruthlessness much further than most: he not only humiliates and dominates all around him, both at work and at play, but he also kills!Both the book and film have been accused of being overly violent and misogynistic, and it is true that many scenes are extremely disturbing and very gory, with extreme brutality frequently dished out casually by an emotionally disconnected Bateman; but not only is American Psycho a very unsettling affair, it is also a very funny one (particularly for those with an extremely dark sense of humour), with hilarious satirical displays of oneupmanship between the high-rolling yuppies, amusing deadpan critiques of popular music as Bateman casually prepares for more bloody mayhem, and towards the end, several scenes of sheer unbridled lunacy (try keeping a straight face as Bateman attempts to feed a cat to an ATM).In the film's closing chaotic moments, events become very confusing, with a crazed Bateman finally revealing all to his lawyer over the phone; the very next day, however, we learn that the lawyer has not only taken Bateman's confession to be a sick joke, but also seems to believe him to be someone else entirely. At face value, this all seems terribly unlikely, but it does adhere nicely to the reoccurring theme of lack of individuality; it is also a deliberate ploy by director Mary Harron to allow her audience to come to their own conclusions about Bateman's predicament. Is he free to carry on killing or has all that we have witnessed only occurred in Bateman's unhinged mind? Hell, by the closing credits, we aren't even sure if Bateman is actually who he thinks he is.Usually, I don't like ambiguous endings that much, but in such a demented, twisted, schizophrenic movie, it seems like the only satisfactory way to finish.",businessman bateman makes killing both at work at home,patrick bateman christian bale is wealthy good looking wall street businessman with his own office pretty pa chlo sevigny attractive fianc reese witherspoon desirable manhattan apartment fine collection sharp implements power tools perfect hacking up hookers ridding himself pesky professional competition american psycho based controversial cult novel by bret easton ellis is razor sharp satire yuppie lifestyle that will forever be associated with late 80s era when success was often measured by how much money you earned who you knew what suit you wore which restaurants you could get reservations at bales narcissistic bateman epitomises yuppie stereotype self obsessed materialistic power hungry predatory his life is dedicated feeling superior all those around him no doubt because that secretly he knows that he is devoid genuine worth his position company is shared by several indentikit employees so alike that there are frequent cases mistaken identity his fianc is having affair but then so is he only person who truly likes him apart himself is his secretary who he stupidly deems unworthy his magnificence deep down hes very insecure confused individual compensate his shallow existence bateman extends his lack empathy ruthlessness much further than most he not only humiliates dominates all around him both at work at play but he also kills both book film have been accused being overly violent misogynistic it is true that many scenes are extremely disturbing very gory with extreme brutality frequently dished out casually by emotionally disconnected bateman but not only is american psycho very unsettling affair it is also very funny one particularly those with extremely dark sense humour with hilarious satirical displays oneupmanship between high rolling yuppies amusing deadpan critiques popular music as bateman casually prepares more bloody mayhem towards end several scenes sheer unbridled lunacy try keeping straight face as bateman attempts feed cat atm films closing chaotic moments events become very confusing with crazed bateman finally revealing all his lawyer over phone very next day however we learn that lawyer has not only taken batemans confession be sick joke but also seems believe him be someone else entirely at face value this all seems terribly unlikely but it does adhere nicely reoccurring theme lack individuality it is also deliberate ploy by director mary harron allow her audience come their own conclusions about batemans predicament is he free carry killing or has all that we have witnessed only occurred batemans unhinged mind hell by closing credits we arent even sure if bateman is actually who he thinks he is usually i dont like ambiguous endings that much but such demented twisted schizophrenic movie it seems like only satisfactory way finish,0.6401271876271875,0.035258445258445244,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,'I simply am not there...',"Its interesting that Christian Bale's most critically acclaimed role, in this very movie, is as a cold, psychotic and shallow yuppie. He excels by playing a character who openly admits that his only identifiable emotions are 'greed' and 'disgust'.Firstly, this film should not be misinterpreted as a horror movie. Those who have read the Brett Easton Ellis novel will already be aware of this. It is more a satire, or a harsh and uncompromising commentary on the material excess of Wall Street, or indeed America as a whole (hence the title), during the mid-to-late 80's. It works on both these levels and many more.The film starts as it means to continue. Bale's character, Patrick Bateman, introduces himself, and, as in the novel, goes into absurd detail regarding his washing habits and exercise regimes. For the next hour and a half, the audience is invited into his world. A world in which vanity itself, it seems, is everything. His life is composed almost entirely of expensive meals out with his high-flying friends & disillusioned girlfriend(played adequately by Reese Witherspoon), and various random, sadistic acts of violence and mutilation.Despite all Batemans' wealth, he is emotionally bankrupt. Love and relationships are as disposable as the world he lives in. For the entire film, Bale relishes the role and never lets it slip, talking as if he's in some warped commercial for a shallow and completely hedonistic eighties lifestyle. A lifestyle which leads nowhere. Bateman's character is also loaded with contradictions and hypocrisy. In one of the opening scenes, he wastes no time describing how he believes 'in taking care of himself', but days later will be snorting cocaine in a public toilet. Later, he describes how 'we need to provide food and shelter for the homeless', which is delivered as a speech to seemingly promote Bateman's morality in front of his peers. Shortly afterwards, he stabs a tramp to death in an alleyway. This speech acts as an omen or as a warning to crimes he will commit, or will imagine committing later in the film. His references to women in particular, soon become disturbingly ironic.Authenticity is added to the movie in the form of music and reference to the AIDS epidemic, which was just starting to take hold of the American consciousness. Bateman's highly unstable and vacuous state of mind is relayed through several brilliant quotes and scenes in the movie.One example is the scene in which he examines his colleagues business cards in depth, and becomes so obsessed and frustrated by the minor differences in colour and font that his hand visibly shakes. Upon seeing Paul Allen's card he whispers to himself in genuine horror; 'oh my god...it even has a watermark.' In Bateman's world, this could well be interpreted as the reasoning behind him murdering Allen later in the film.Much of the movie is left open to interpretation by the viewer, and it should definitely be watched several times. Its often hard to draw the line between reality and Bateman's own fantasies. Indeed many, if not all, of his murderous acts, could be simply figments of his own twisted imagination. The character Donald Kimble could indeed be an illusion. He interviews Bateman several times in the movie, at times appearing oblivious to the possibility of Bateman murdering Allen, and then later effectively accusing him of it.What the film really illustrates, much like the book, is a culture and an entire way-of-life, taken too a brutal, disturbed, and even demented extreme. It is a fusion of America's most beautiful dream, and its most hideous, blood-soaked nightmare. Money is no longer a barrier for Bateman. He can have all the women, sex, narcotics, technology and expensive meals he will ever desire. There is nothing left for him or his friends to aspire too. When every line has been crossed on a daily basis, he can only find satisfaction in the most depraved and barbaric of acts, and in the end, even this isn't enough.While the book is considerably more graphic and detailed, I would have to say I prefer the film. All the important and relevant aspects of Bateman's life and psyche are featured and Bale's performance elevates it to true 'cult classic' status. His portrayal of Bateman creates, in my opinion, one of the most vivid, cruel, iconic and unforgettable characters in the history of film.",i simply am not there,its interesting that christian bales most critically acclaimed role this very movie is as cold psychotic shallow yuppie he excels by playing character who openly admits that his only identifiable emotions are greed disgust firstly this film should not be misinterpreted as horror movie those who have read brett easton ellis novel will already be aware this it is more satire or harsh uncompromising commentary material excess wall street or indeed america as whole hence title during mid late 80s it works both these levels many more film starts as it means continue bales character patrick bateman introduces himself as novel goes into absurd detail regarding his washing habits exercise regimes next hour half audience is invited into his world world which vanity itself it seems is everything his life is composed almost entirely expensive meals out with his high flying friends disillusioned girlfriend played adequately by reese witherspoon various random sadistic acts violence mutilation despite all batemans wealth he is emotionally bankrupt love relationships are as disposable as world he lives entire film bale relishes role never lets it slip talking as if hes some warped commercial shallow completely hedonistic eighties lifestyle lifestyle which leads nowhere batemans character is also loaded with contradictions hypocrisy one opening scenes he wastes no time describing how he believes taking care himself but days later will be snorting cocaine public toilet later he describes how we need provide food shelter homeless which is delivered as speech seemingly promote batemans morality front his peers shortly afterwards he stabs tramp death alleyway this speech acts as omen or as warning crimes he will commit or will imagine committing later film his references women particular soon become disturbingly ironic authenticity is added movie form music reference aids epidemic which was just starting take hold american consciousness batemans highly unstable vacuous state mind is relayed through several brilliant quotes scenes movie one example is scene which he examines his colleagues business cards depth becomes so obsessed frustrated by minor differences colour font that his hand visibly shakes upon seeing paul allens card he whispers himself genuine horror oh my god it even has watermark batemans world this could well be interpreted as reasoning behind him murdering allen later film much movie is left open interpretation by viewer it should definitely be watched several times its often hard draw line between reality batemans own fantasies indeed many if not all his murderous acts could be simply figments his own twisted imagination character donald kimble could indeed be illusion he interviews bateman several times movie at times appearing oblivious possibility bateman murdering allen then later effectively accusing him it what film really illustrates much like book is culture entire way life taken too brutal disturbed even demented extreme it is fusion americas most beautiful dream its most hideous blood soaked nightmare money is no longer barrier bateman he can have all women sex narcotics technology expensive meals he will ever desire there is nothing left him or his friends aspire too when every line has been crossed daily basis he can only find satisfaction most depraved barbaric acts end even this isnt enough while book is considerably more graphic detailed i would have say i prefer film all important relevant aspects batemans life psyche are featured bales performance elevates it true cult classic status his portrayal bateman creates my opinion one most vivid cruel iconic unforgettable characters history film,0.477220551378446,0.07056140350877195,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,Christian Bale the new Peter Cushing,"Now it all makes sense. Christian Bale was born to play horror characters. I couldn't understand why I was so , so, afraid of him even in films like ""Velvet Goldmine"" He is a poster boy for putrid souls in elegant wrapping. In ""American Psycho"" - a film that deserves much more attention than it's got - he is absolutely terrific. Totally believable. I could sense his delight in playing a monster of this kind. Interestingly enough this manicured monster seems to be asking for sympathy, imagine the nerve! But Christian Bale succeeds in showing us a face we (I) hadn't quite seen before and yet we (I) accept without question.

,Two Chainsaws Up,"Without a doubt the most underrated movie of the past decade, ""American Psycho"" is a piece of American cinema that shouldn't be missed by anyone, regardless if they do not like the violence (which does have its reasons). Christian Bale gives a flawless performance as the troubled, deep down wannabe Yuppie who has psychotic, violent impulses. This is true acting here, folks. Not phoned in Tom Crooze acting. Some people object to Patrick Bateman narrating the movie [always a weak sign in a movie] and not letting us figure his motives out on our own, but if you watch closely, Bale shows us Bateman's vulnerablity through every minute of every day of his life. The movie is at times hysterical, as his character uses dominant Alpha Monkey behavior around the opposite sex. But again, it's all for good reason. If not for Bale's performance, see it for the knife twisting satire of the '80's -- from the clothes, to the hairdos, to the music [I'll never be able to hear Phil Collins in the same way again!] The production value is rich in '80's nostalgia from the ""Black and White"" set designs to the enormous cellphones [how could we forget those?].This is a movie that major studios are too afraid to touch. This is film making. Remember film making? When films took you on a ride in someone's life and you would walk away with a piece of their mind? American Psycho doesn't have any real morals or answers, but it shows the deep psychological insecurities some men suffer everyday.
