9,"Wow, we finally have a new Christmas classic","Okay, when it comes to Christmas movies to me there was only one: It's a wonderful life by Frank Capra. The Bishop's Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don't have the same magic. This year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It's a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.The story is about this lazy and clumpsy guy, Jesper, who is the only son of the director of a Mail School. His father wants to teach him a lesson and sends him to this little snowy place called Smeerensburg. Only if he succeeds in delivering 6000 letters in a year he's allowed to come back and continue his luxery life. Of course Jesper obeys: he doesn't have a choice. But when he arrives at Smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is an almost imposible one. Two rival families are at constant war with each other and will never send each other letters. But when Jesper visits his last hope, this hermit called Klaus, something magical happens. By accident this mourning figure receives a letter from a child and wants to return this nice gesture by giving the boy a present. Suddenly all the childeren of the village want to send letters...Why does Santa always say ""Ho! Ho! Ho!?"". How did he get his reindeers? Does he really have a naughty book? Why does he travel on a sleigh? All those questions will be answered in this great tale of one man, Jesper, changing the fate of a town that once only knew anger and never friendship. The end of Klaus is actually quite moving.Forget The Polar Express or all the Christmas Carols. Klaus is the real deal! Go see it on Netflix!9/10",wow we finally have new christmas classic,okay when it comes christmas movies me there was only one its wonderful life by frank capra bishops wife love actually are also very good but they dont have same magic this year i can finally add new classic klaus its funny surprising tale how real santa claus was born i love story especially look this movie is amazing klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks computers it has astonishing lit scenes that makes journey extra special story is about this lazy clumpsy guy jesper who is only son director mail school his father wants teach him lesson sends him this little snowy place called smeerensburg only if he succeeds delivering 6000 letters year hes allowed come back continue his luxery life course jesper obeys he doesnt have choice but when he arrives at smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is almost imposible one two rival families are at constant war with each other will never send each other letters but when jesper visits his last hope this hermit called klaus something magical happens by accident this mourning figure receives letter child wants return this nice gesture by giving boy present suddenly all childeren village want send letters why does santa always say ho ho ho how did he get his reindeers does he really have naughty book why does he travel sleigh all those questions will be answered this great tale one man jesper changing fate town that once only knew anger never friendship end klaus is actually quite moving forget polar express or all christmas carols klaus is real deal go see it netflix 9 10,0.5442623023235269,0.1878034720381659,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.27}"

9,Anti-Postmodern Santa Claus,"If postmodernism is defined as a rejection of morality and human nature, then this animated story is a repudiation of that rejection, but done in a refreshingly adult and not too overly sentimental way.Thankfully, there are none of the usual Hollywood tropes; rather, the characters and situation are very grounded despite having elements of the fantastical and surrealism mixed in. It is not even Disney-esque, which is also a very good good thing.That this ""Santa Claus"" is not the only main character is moreover a good choice by the writers. By doing so, the story is able to focus on how a mythical character could conceivably come to be - and that makes for a very interesting and entertaining premise.Everything about this animated story is well done: The animation is crisp and detailed; the dialogues are convincing and at times humorous; the music fits, is modern, and used judiciously.Young children will not probably understand the deeper meanings, but everyone else will.",anti postmodern santa claus,if postmodernism is defined as rejection morality human nature then this animated story is repudiation that rejection but done refreshingly adult not too overly sentimental way thankfully there are none usual hollywood tropes rather characters situation are very grounded despite having elements fantastical surrealism mixed it is not even disney esque which is also very good good thing that this santa claus is not only main character is moreover good choice by writers by doing so story is able focus how mythical character could conceivably come be that makes very interesting entertaining premise everything about this animated story is well done animation is crisp detailed dialogues are convincing at times humorous music fits is modern used judiciously young children will not probably understand deeper meanings but everyone else will,0.555,0.2846031746031746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10,Claus.,"Whilst I was vaguely aware of the title from seeing it mentioned at the Oscar's, I became aware of Klaus from seeing a large number of fellow reviewers highly praising the film this year,which led to me meeting Klaus.View on the film:Revealing later that he had wanted to do a traditionally animated feature film, but he wanted to see how the animation would have evolved without the switch to computer-generated animation, the 20 years spent working in various other animation departments, leads to co-writer/ (with Jim Mahoney & Zach Lewis) and co-director (with Carlos Martinez Lopez )Sergio Pablos make a chart-topping Christmas number one directing debut.Developing the project for over a decade, Pablos and Lopez ultra-stylised use of volumetric lighting and texturing, (first time to be used in hand-drawn animation) gives the animation a dazzling depth of field appearance, with the detailed, expressive hand-drawn character animation seamlessly blending in with the thick texturing given to the background and buildings drawing a pop-up book elegance.Later revealed by Sergio Pablos that he had improvised 40% of the dialogue,Jason Schwartzman gives a fantastic turn as Jesper,thanks to Schwartzman voicing his distinctive kookiness with a growing can-do confidence,whilst J.K. Simmons brings a merry, towering warmth in his merry performance of Klaus.Simply having a wonderful Christmas time in a miserable town, the writers gloriously take the characteristics of Santa (such as flying reindeer)and turn them inside out with hilarious sight gags that soar with excellent drama from Jesper bonding with the locals,and Klaus coming out from the wilderness, to discover the true meaning of Christmas.",claus,whilst i was vaguely aware title seeing it mentioned at oscars i became aware klaus seeing large number fellow reviewers highly praising film this year which led me meeting klaus view film revealing later that he had wanted do traditionally animated feature film but he wanted see how animation would have evolved without switch computer generated animation 20 years spent working various other animation departments leads co writer with jim mahoney zach lewis co director with carlos martinez lopez sergio pablos make chart topping christmas number one directing debut developing project over decade pablos lopez ultra stylised use volumetric lighting texturing first time be used hand drawn animation gives animation dazzling depth field appearance with detailed expressive hand drawn character animation seamlessly blending with thick texturing given background buildings drawing pop up book elegance later revealed by sergio pablos that he had improvised 40 dialogue jason schwartzman gives fantastic turn as jesper thanks schwartzman voicing his distinctive kookiness with growing can do confidence whilst j k simmons brings merry towering warmth his merry performance klaus simply having wonderful christmas time miserable town writers gloriously take characteristics santa such as flying reindeer turn them inside out with hilarious sight gags that soar with excellent drama jesper bonding with locals klaus coming out wilderness discover true meaning christmas,0.5383619047619047,0.20397142857142853,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.5}"

10,KLAUS: The Netflix Classic for Christmas.,"I typically wouldn't mention a movie as a classic except for the two first films of Shrek. But Klaus it's amazing.Allow me to explain myself.There are so many reasons why Klaus remains as a classic.FIRST of all and the most visible one:THE ANIMATION. I'm not an animator but I love animation so I can tell when something is beautifully animated. Klaus isn't animated by computer, is hand-drawn animation which involves so much more work and it's worthy at the end because the result is so delightful. The colors, the details, the characters, the locations and every particular aspect are properly drawn, so you feel so good watching it.SECOND: You need more than looks to produce a classic and this film has a pretty good STORY. The plot is simple, a post man is sent to the unhappiest place in the world to deliver 6,000 letters, but in this place nobody delivers letters. Simple, the way that this plot seeks his way to include the origin story of Santa Claus it's amazing. Every twist is graceful and the ending is satisfactory.THIRD: animation and story are reached because of THE CHARACTERS: Every single and unique character has their own storyline developed satisfactorily.From beginning to end, the film is perfection for the Christmas holiday.",klaus netflix classic christmas,i typically wouldnt mention movie as classic except two first films shrek but klaus its amazing allow me explain myself there are so many reasons why klaus remains as classic first all most visible one animation im not animator but i love animation so i can tell when something is beautifully animated klaus isnt animated by computer is hand drawn animation which involves so much more work its worthy at end because result is so delightful colors details characters locations every particular aspect are properly drawn so you feel so good watching it second you need more than looks produce classic this film has pretty good story plot is simple post man is sent unhappiest place world deliver 6 000 letters but this place nobody delivers letters simple way that this plot seeks his way include origin story santa claus its amazing every twist is graceful ending is satisfactory third animation story are reached because characters every single unique character has their own storyline developed satisfactorily beginning end film is perfection christmas holiday,0.5031746031746032,0.32345238095238094,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10,An Absolute Delight,"Fun-spirited and an absolute delight, Klaus just may be not only the best christmas movie of the year, but also of the decade. Fit with beautiful animation, wonderful voice work, and a charming sense of direction, Klaus aims to please and does so almost irresistibly. The film, at its worst, may seem a bit formulaic, but is plenty full of many surprises without that will make you not want to look away from the screen. The film is also cleverly funny, with humor on par with that of The Emperor's New Groove and another Christmas classic of the decade, Arthur Christmas. What's so remarkable about the film however, is that, besides its ownership under Netflix, it simply isn't owned by a huge animation company. It feels small, and looks underwhelming, and like a gift of the same nature, is an absolute delight once you find what is all truly inside.

9,"An earnest, charming fairytale","This is what this film feels like: sitting around a fire and being engrossed in a story that someone remembers from long ago. Is the plot very original? Maybe not, but it is well paced and has some surprises along the way that make Klaus special. Here, we have a sincere, funny and engaging film, that doesn't rely on ironic jokes to tie in the adults, or on the integration of modern technology to hold the kids' interest. It just tells a story.The story is about a spoiled young man who is sent into the little backwater village of Smeerensburg to take over the post office. Jesper has to deliver 6000 letters by the end of a year or he'll be cut off by his wealthy father. After he meets the reclusive toymaker Klaus, Jesper starts to plot his way out of Smeerensburg by roping in the kids of the village. Along the way he makes some friends, changes some lives and, well, grows up.This is, in a way, Jesper's coming of age story, even though he is a fully grown man to begin with. But this is also Klaus' growing old story. I found this apect very touching - the old and widowed hermit finds a new purpose in his life and gets to be happy for a few years yet. You do not see that sort of plotline in animated movies very often. The subplot of the warring clans of Smeerensburg was hilarious and reminded me a little of Asterix and Obelix.Apart from the old school, but very well executed plot, it is worthwhile to talk about Klaus' technical realization. Firstly, the animation is gorgeous. The lighting is magnificent. The look is excellent. This film looks exactly as lovingly detailed as a Christmas movie should. The handdrawn animation is very effective - it gives the film a very soft and almost canvas-like feeling, while still making good use of the smooth and fast execution that CGI affords.Klaus isn't dunked in polished, on-the-nose effects, but is, you might say, warmly covered in a carefully crafted blanket of twinkling forest lights and harsh mountain snows and accompanied by a little, gruff town of crooked and funny looking houses and crooked and funny-looking people. In Klaus, we do not encounter a string of slightly altered clones, that all have the same body type and facial features (looking at you Disney) but a jumbled ensemble of big and round, tall and bent, young and middle aged and old characters, who all look and act differently from each other.The only criticism I can honestly think of is that Klaus lacks a little on female representation. Its central female characters, Ava and Márgu, felt a little sidelined to me, especially given the fact that theirs could have been the better story, if told accordingly. But given the fact that I still loved it, I can't really hold this against Klaus.So, just in time for Christmas, Klaus is a thoroughly enjoyable treat of a movie that I will probably recommend excessively over the next few weeks.",earnest charming fairytale,this is what this film feels like sitting around fire being engrossed story that someone remembers long ago is plot very original maybe not but it is well paced has some surprises along way that make klaus special here we have sincere funny engaging film that doesnt rely ironic jokes tie adults or integration modern technology hold kids interest it just tells story story is about spoiled young man who is sent into little backwater village smeerensburg take over post office jesper has deliver 6000 letters by end year or hell be cut off by his wealthy father after he meets reclusive toymaker klaus jesper starts plot his way out smeerensburg by roping kids village along way he makes some friends changes some lives well grows up this is way jespers coming age story even though he is fully grown man begin with but this is also klaus growing old story i found this apect very touching old widowed hermit finds new purpose his life gets be happy few years yet you do not see that sort plotline animated movies very often subplot warring clans smeerensburg was hilarious reminded me little asterix obelix apart old school but very well executed plot it is worthwhile talk about klaus technical realization firstly animation is gorgeous lighting is magnificent look is excellent this film looks exactly as lovingly detailed as christmas movie should handdrawn animation is very effective it gives film very soft almost canvas like feeling while still making good use smooth fast execution that cgi affords klaus isnt dunked polished nose effects but is you might say warmly covered carefully crafted blanket twinkling forest lights harsh mountain snows accompanied by little gruff town crooked funny looking houses crooked funny looking people klaus we do not encounter string slightly altered clones that all have same body type facial features looking at you disney but jumbled ensemble big round tall bent young middle aged old characters who all look act differently each other only criticism i can honestly think is that klaus lacks little female representation its central female characters ava m rgu felt little sidelined me especially given fact that theirs could have been better story if told accordingly but given fact that i still loved it i cant really hold this against klaus so just time christmas klaus is thoroughly enjoyable treat movie that i will probably recommend excessively over next few weeks,0.526656628395759,0.20017159169333085,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.23}"
