10.0,Chaplin's best--what a film!,"I've seen both version of this film--the original silent version from 1925 and the re-release by Chaplin in the 1940s. The difference is that the re-release was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies. To do this, title cards were removed--having Chaplin narrate the film. In addition, Chaplin-created music (for the most part--some were classical pieces), sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer. I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVD--it has both plus excellent DVD extras. Otherwise, there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out there--many with terrible quality prints or music or both. The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find. The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the 1942 re-release.I use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film, though I might, in the future, use it for my Psychology classes as well (I teach both) because Chaplin's genius came from his obsessive-compulsive nature. The movie reportedly had 27 times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than 60 takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century. Along the way, he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb. Suffice to say, the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch (something not true of all full-length slapstick comedies--sometimes, their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to full-length).This is a gorgeous, well-executed piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac. The musical score (arranged by Chaplin), direction, acting and cinematography all are simply perfect--making this, in my opinion, the best full-length silent comedy ever made. This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton's films!",chaplins best what film,ive seen both version this film original silent version 1925 re release by chaplin 1940s difference is that re release was designed appeal new audience that expected sound their movies do this title cards were removed having chaplin narrate film addition chaplin created music most part some were classical pieces sound effects singing were added make movie more palatable average viewer i personally like both versions one you watch is up you if you get copy warner brothers release dvd it has both plus excellent dvd extras otherwise there have been lot public domain versions video out there many with terrible quality prints or music or both warner version is most pristine beautiful silent print you can find version usually shown turner classic movies is 1942 re release i use this film my american history class when we do our unit history film though i might future use it my psychology classes as well i teach both because chaplins genius came his obsessive compulsive nature movie reportedly had 27 times more film exposed than you actually see film shoe eating segment was shot after more than 60 takes plot involves charlie going alaska gold rush at turn century along way he has series misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed other reviews here imdb suffice say supporting acting was excellent story kept excellent pace had enough slapstick make it fun watch something not true all full length slapstick comedies sometimes their pacing was negatively affected by transition shorts full length this is gorgeous well executed piece american art must any real cinemaniac musical score arranged by chaplin direction acting cinematography all are simply perfect making this my opinion best full length silent comedy ever made this is saying lot considering how much i love harold lloyd buster keatons films,0.4156995486782722,0.26017085751128294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,You just can't beat Charlie Chaplin!,"The 1898 Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh, but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious. As an unnamed prospector, Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon. Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner, the dancing roles, and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff. His companion, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplin's character to be a chicken, and before long, a bear enters their cabin. In the midst of it all, the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia (Georgia Hale).A real triumph for Charlie Chaplin!

10.0,Charlie Chaplin at his best.,"The Gold Rush is one of Chaplin's best films, as well as one of his most famous. It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by, and it's not hard to see why. Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector, a young miner during the gold rush. After getting caught in a storm, he hurries to the only shelter that he can find, a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. It turns out that it is already inhabited, and by a tough criminal named Black Larson, no less, and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim, another prospector, insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film. Charlie and Big Jim are left alone and without food when Larson goes off to face the storm looking for food (having drawn the lowest card in another amusing scene), and the scenes in the cabin are some of the best in the entire film. There is, of course, the boot eating scene, memorable not only because of its cleverness and effectiveness, but also because while making the film, Chaplin ate so much boot (which was made out of licorice) before he was satisfied with the take that he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. Another thing that was really well done was the special effects. I am still amazed every time I watch the film at how realistic it looks when there is a long shot from outside showing Charlie hanging from the door of the cabin, which is balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff. Also notice the fast paced and very effective music during this scene, the same song that is played in the best scene of the 1996 film Shine, with Geoffrey Rush. There is also a very noteworthy love element of The Gold Rush, a part of the story that Chaplin generally has much success with in his films. Charlie's amorous interests in Georgia, a dance hall girl, leads to the scene where he performs the famous dance of the dinner rolls, probably the most famous scene in the film, which was also performed very well by Johnny Depp in Benny & Joon. Charlie's relationship with Georgia is also the thing that leads to his presentation of his sympathy for the lower classes, when he meets her on the ship after having become a multi-millionaire. Chaplin's full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies, and The Gold Rush is one of the best of his full length features. A must see for any Chaplin fan, but The Gold Rush is also a film that anyone who is interested in quality comedy should watch.",charlie chaplin at his best,gold rush is one chaplins best films as well as one his most famous it has been said that it is film that he most wanted be remembered by its not hard see why chaplin plays part lone prospector young miner during gold rush after getting caught storm he hurries only shelter that he can find wood cabin middle storm it turns out that it is already inhabited by tough criminal named black larson no less scene which charlie big jim another prospector insist black larson that they are going stay is one countless memorable scenes film charlie big jim are left alone without food when larson goes off face storm looking food having drawn lowest card another amusing scene scenes cabin are some best entire film there is course boot eating scene memorable not only because its cleverness effectiveness but also because while making film chaplin ate so much boot which was made out licorice before he was satisfied with take that he had be taken hospital have his stomach pumped another thing that was really well done was special effects i am still amazed every time i watch film at how realistic it looks when there is long shot outside showing charlie hanging door cabin which is balanced precariously edge cliff also notice fast paced very effective music during this scene same song that is played best scene 1996 film shine with geoffrey rush there is also very noteworthy love element gold rush part story that chaplin generally has much success with his films charlies amorous interests georgia dance hall girl leads scene where he performs famous dance dinner rolls probably most famous scene film which was also performed very well by johnny depp benny joon charlies relationship with georgia is also thing that leads his presentation his sympathy lower classes when he meets her ship after having become multi millionaire chaplins full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies gold rush is one best his full length features must see any chaplin fan but gold rush is also film that anyone who is interested quality comedy should watch,0.5031979458450048,0.28158341114223473,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,A Worthy Silent Classic,"This silent classic has many strong points - it has a lot of humor, interesting characters, a good story and good settings. It's the kind of film that shows how much a master film-maker can communicate in a silent movie. It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion, but other than that it's a fine film.Chaplin himself plays the 'Lone Prospector', and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama. There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors' rickety cabins, plus some other good material.The version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin re-edited in the 1940's, adding his own narration and deleting the title cards, which gives it a slightly different feel. (These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who aren't used to silent films.) You can tell from Chaplin's narration how fond he must have been of ""The Gold Rush"", and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it. There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless, but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art.",worthy silent classic,this silent classic has many strong points it has lot humor interesting characters good story good settings its kind film that shows how much master film maker can communicate silent movie it overdoes sentimentality occasion but other than that its fine film chaplin himself plays lone prospector he is joined by several other interesting characters frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures drama there are some memorable scenes prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good material version this that is easiest find is one that chaplin re edited 1940s adding his own narration deleting title cards which gives it slightly different feel these revisions probably make it bit easier follow those who arent used silent films you can tell chaplins narration how fond he must have been gold rush he had lot good reasons be pleased with it there are couple his later films that might be even better more timeless but this one contains everything that defined chaplin his art,0.47638888888888886,0.31805555555555554,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.06, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Striking Gold Again and Again.,"Charles Chaplin's ""The Gold Rush"" is arguably his finest film. He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich. What he does not realize is that he may find love (in the form of Georgia Hale) instead of money. In the end that may be all right with him. ""The Gold Rush"" shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer, writer and director he was. Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the 20th Century, Chaplin showed humanity, love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career. The movie is exceptional in every way. Although I am not as well-versed with movies from the 1920s as I am with the decades following it, I would still probably call ""The Gold Rush"" the finest film of that 10-year period.

8.0,Little Tramp makes good,"Charlie Chaplin's silent film (also re-released with a narration in the early 1940s) focuses, as usual, on the Little Tramp, and in this case, his attraction to a chorus girl (Georgia Hale). This is the one where he eats a boot, along with its laces, and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rolls.The role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin, Lita Grey, but her pregnancy ruled her out. Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions. Mack Swain appears as Big Jim, who shares a cabin with the Tramp, at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and gold-runners, as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero.

10.0,Charlie of the Yukon,"THE GOLD RUSH (United Artists, 1925), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin, may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era, but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations. So proud of his achievement, Chaplin reissued this silent film in 1942 with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself, eliminating the use of title cards. Then in the summer of 1971, THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting station's 13-week series of ""The Silent Years,"" as hosted by Orson Welles, from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William Perry.THE GOLD RUSH, which is set in the turn of the century, opens with The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) coming to Alaska. A snow storm drives him into the cabin of ""Black"" Lawson (Tom Murray), an outlaw. ""Big Jim"" McKay (Mack Swain), another prospector who has found gold on his claim, is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin. After much struggle, Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests. Stranded due to the heavy storm, Larson, finds himself chosen to go out for help. While out in the storm, he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him. He gets away by stealing their dog sled, but is later killed in an avalanche. Back to the cabin, Charlie and Larson, almost in near starvation, eventually make a meal out of a large bear. When the snow storm finally subsides, the two men go about their separate ways. Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia (Georgia Hale), a dance hall girl, causing jealousy from her suitor, Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite). As for Jim, he has forgotten where his gold claim is, and locates Charlie to help him find it, separating him from Georgia. The results that follow is classic Chaplin.Aside from a large list of supporting players, which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis, ""The Gold Rush"" contains many now classic comedy supplements, including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water, and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlie's encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim, in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement. There are tender moments, too, including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Year's Eve dinner, with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming. The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for them.With THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplin's most revived and discussed movie, one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed, including THE CIRCUS (1928), CITY LIGHTS (1931), MODERN TIMES (1936) and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940). Since the advent of home video in the early 1980s, THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores, ranging from the use of piano, organ or orchestra. There are even some editions that have no music track at all, along with some copies running different time lengths, and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout. The 1942 reissue, being a shorter print with Chaplin's narration, not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics, but can also be found on Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a 1921 comedy short, PAY DAY. Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection. But in spite of numerous editions, THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics (1997-2001) and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter 1942 reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score. While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector, avid lip readers will notice that he is called ""Charlie"" by his supporting players, especially by Georgia.

10.0,"Possibly Chaplin's best film, certainly one of the greatest comedies of all time!","To see Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment. One cannot help but enjoy a film as well-done as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered, and I can see why. It is a masterful blend of comedy, drama, and romance, among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture. Like all great movies, The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments, from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain. All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramp's flawless physical comedy. He was a master of comedic timing, and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler. The film moves along at a brisk pace, following the misadventures of our hero, The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin, of course), as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska. Along his journey through the elements, the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen (Tom Murray), a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold. Fortunately, our friend also comes across a fellow prospector, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich. But the Lone Prospector's adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere. When he is forced back to civilization, he falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), the most beautiful girl in town. Of course, it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty. Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite), the handsome lady's man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia, as well. Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the ego-maniacal ""lady killer."" All of this would be too much for any one of us, but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time!

10.0,Gold is the operative word here.,"The Gold Rush is pure gold. It was Charlie Chaplin's third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp. This movie should be counted among Chaplin's best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I've also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy's immortal geniuses.Having first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college's silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen. Even so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven't even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that's also on the disc.The viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard. On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!Also, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD. But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.The first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies. And the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they've seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.I don't say this to sound pretentious. I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted. It's hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years. For example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin's first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema's potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously. Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.The joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy. This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle's aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp's grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.One pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing. When Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm. This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD. The second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn't sustain the entire film at the cabin. Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film's third act. I don't want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.Mack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat. Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid. From what I've seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show. The Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today's more sophisticated stories and special effects. The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia's true feelings for the Tramp.But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that's a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today.

10.0,"Is It Better Than City Lights, though?","The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights? There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator. There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux. But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy. As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting. As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen. But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramp's world City Lights falls short. It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what ""Charlot"" has been all about all along.

10.0,A golden treasure,"I love Charlie Chaplin and I love his films. As much as I love The Tramp(his most touching), City Lights(my personal favourite of his movies), Modern Times(has my favourite soundtrack of all the Charlie Chaplin movies, love Smile), Limelight(a beautiful film) and The Great Dictator(love the speech at the end), The Gold Rush is one of his more light-hearted films.The Gold Rush looks very nice, with lovely cinematography, sets and costumes. The story is simple, but really well-done, fast-paced and involving, while the direction is very fine. The performances are first-rate, Georgia Hale is beautiful and contemptuous but it is Chaplin's performance that holds The Gold Rush together. But I cannot not mention the comedy, there are so many wonderful moments that are well and truly hysterical including the opening sequence, the dance of the bread rolls, Chaplin and his companion hallucinating(the companion hallucinating that Chaplin is a very edible chicken), the way Chaplin ate the shoe leather, Chaplin dancing with the dog tied to his belt and the final scene in the cabin on the cliff.Overall, a golden treasure from a comedy genius. 10/10 Bethany Cox",golden treasure,i love charlie chaplin i love his films as much as i love tramp his most touching city lights my personal favourite his movies modern times has my favourite soundtrack all charlie chaplin movies love smile limelight beautiful film great dictator love speech at end gold rush is one his more light hearted films gold rush looks very nice with lovely cinematography sets costumes story is simple but really well done fast paced involving while direction is very fine performances are first rate georgia hale is beautiful contemptuous but it is chaplins performance that holds gold rush together but i cannot not mention comedy there are so many wonderful moments that are well truly hysterical including opening sequence dance bread rolls chaplin his companion hallucinating companion hallucinating that chaplin is very edible chicken way chaplin ate shoe leather chaplin dancing with dog tied his belt final scene cabin cliff overall golden treasure comedy genius 10 10 bethany cox,0.5900153609831029,0.341021505376344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.46, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,"Terrifically funny and original, even now. A small wonder.","The Gold Rush (1925)If you see this classic Charlie Chaplin movie, it better be the silent version, if only because this is the pure intention, uncompromised. The 1942 version is a little shorter and faster, but it has Chaplin giving narration instead of using the inter-titles, and he says unnecessary stuff, and it interferes.The best parts of this classic as so good, and so honestly original, and so perfectly unashamedly comic, there is nothing like it. Eating the shoe, or getting out of the tilting house? Sheer brilliance, even eighty years later. I laughed out loud and often.There is also that key ingredient to every great film (it seems), a romance, and a funny surprise twist to the plot in the last ten minutes or so. Chaplin the tramp rises above, and yet ends, by slight of hand, as the tramp, or as a rich sophisticated man pretending to be the tramp. Which is what he was.The plot has its slow points, and overly sentimental aspects (including the romance), and it is sometimes bordering on slapstick silly rather than elegantly physical and inventively funny.

What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so great.It's not just that one joke though, there are tons of laughs in this great movie.

,Blissful ignorance,"To be perfectly honest, I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to. Right down to my fundamental worldview, I am a Buster Keaton person, the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness. The world as I understand it just doesn't work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay. So wishing it did only fosters more pain.This is actually worst than The Kid in this respect. Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl, but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold. Oh, though filthy rich at that point, when in the end he falls practically in the girl's arms he is again dressed like a tramp - meaning, no doubt, he is still the same person - but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial, worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul, here he gets both. There is not even the thought of a compromise.Yet I can't help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplin's cosmology; the mysterious, elusive fates - seemingly random, but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose - that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocks.Nowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene. The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside, the reality thought to be known, understood, domesticated into order, but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void. So, every step inside, taken casually, without much thought, is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death. 'Blissful ignorance', the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabin.It is a powerful cosmologic symbol, what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma, fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life. With both gold and love, impossible love with the dream girl, as the chimeras that trick the mind.So Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level, as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside, but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate - or he does, is terrified, and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy- tale.So however well-meant, it's a dishonest, patronizing vision of bliss. Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging, but eventually benevolent whims of providence. It's all made right again, more than right.Notice how well integrated is this notion inside the film, proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the point-of-view of the tramp, who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger soul-defining mechanisms that shape his life, that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lesson.So instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance, or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill, just wait and it'll all work out in the end.

10.0,Chaplin's delightful bonhomie & innocence,"We follow ""the little fellow"" (Chaplin), in his trip to Alaska to find gold - which he ends up succeeding in, finding love at the same time. The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin, another lonesome gold seeker, and a moral-less scoundrel in a shelter, under a particularly horrendous snowstorm. There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie: Big Jim's delusion that Chaplin's is a giant (of course bearing Chaplin's manners) chicken, and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat. Then, parting their ways, begins the second half of the movie: the one-sided romance with the beautiful Georgia, met in a dance hall. How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use Tchaykovsky's...Beauy & the Beast's waltz! Bringing to tear and laughters at the same time. As Georgia plays nastily and mocks and fools Chaplin, with her friends, and secretly discovers his love, her heart swings. But Chaplin is taken away by his former colleague, Big Jim, to ""become millionaires"" (i.e. find gold). And they find it! All ends well as the little fellow & big Jim, now millionaires, leave on a ship. While dressed poorly as in his earlier gold seeker day for a photography, he falls upon Georgia, who indisputably is happy to be with him, and even more happy to find him multimillionaires, as she hears from the ship crew.

10.0,Licorice Shoes and Critical Acclaim!!!!!,"Just like Orson Wells, Marlon Brando and Katherine Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin is a classic in the movie industry!! The king of silent films is attributed with making slapstick humor one of the stellar accomplishments in the entertainment business!! Slapstick comedy is predicated on a lot of physical humor, often times, slapstick is underrated in terms of the immense amount of talent it actually requires!! Lucille Ball got her start by emulating slapstick icons such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, and later, she instilled slapstick stunts in her renowned comedy series ""I Love Lucy""... The film, ""Gold Rush"" is hilarious in it's exaggeration of calamity!! Charlie Chaplin is tremendous in engaging in a befuddled demeanor about his basic struggle for survival!! ""Gold Rush"" was listed by one movie critic's list as the best film ever!! Why do you suppose this is? I would say that it is mostly on account of the cunningly successful aspects of silliness that are incorporated in the making of this movie!! Another big reason would be the flippant approach slapstick artist Charlie Chaplin orchestrates when encountering one predicament after the other in this film!! These actions are so overdone that they are hysterically funny!! Charlie Chaplin executes all of the necessary acrobatics of chicanery very effectively!! In the case of ""Gold Rush"" Charlie Chaplin is so intense in his ludicrous actions, that he effortlessly makes ""Gold Rush"" a masterpiece!! Take into account that it is 1925, before the film goer was barraged with a bevy of special effects, and you, (being part of the movie audience) will recognize how well put together this movie really is!! The innocuous charisma of a Nicklelodian style film is often times mollified, and is discarded by many people as being cavalier in it's attempt to attain a recognizable prowess as far as being an assertively marvelous flick is concerned!! Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of the film ""Gold Rush"" This film is outstanding!! The licorice shoes were an added whimsical element to making ""Gold Rush"" funny as well!! I strongly recommend that you rent this movie and watch it!! This is without a doubt, an extremely top notch film!! It is not always rated #1 on every critic's list, but, it is always listed as one of the best movies ever made by virtually every movie expert!! The latest review list that AFI came out with ""Gold Rush"" was rated 58th out of the top 100 American films ever made!!",licorice shoes critical acclaim,just like orson wells marlon brando katherine hepburn charlie chaplin is classic movie industry king silent films is attributed with making slapstick humor one stellar accomplishments entertainment business slapstick comedy is predicated lot physical humor often times slapstick is underrated terms immense amount talent it actually requires lucille ball got her start by emulating slapstick icons such as buster keaton charlie chaplin later she instilled slapstick stunts her renowned comedy series i love lucy film gold rush is hilarious its exaggeration calamity charlie chaplin is tremendous engaging befuddled demeanor about his basic struggle survival gold rush was listed by one movie critics list as best film ever why do you suppose this is i would say that it is mostly account cunningly successful aspects silliness that are incorporated making this movie another big reason would be flippant approach slapstick artist charlie chaplin orchestrates when encountering one predicament after other this film these actions are so overdone that they are hysterically funny charlie chaplin executes all necessary acrobatics chicanery very effectively case gold rush charlie chaplin is so intense his ludicrous actions that he effortlessly makes gold rush masterpiece take into account that it is 1925 before film goer was barraged with bevy special effects you being part movie audience will recognize how well put together this movie really is innocuous charisma nicklelodian style film is often times mollified is discarded by many people as being cavalier its attempt attain recognizable prowess as far as being assertively marvelous flick is concerned nothing could be further truth case film gold rush this film is outstanding licorice shoes were added whimsical element making gold rush funny as well i strongly recommend that you rent this movie watch it this is without doubt extremely top notch film it is not always rated every critics list but it is always listed as one best movies ever made by virtually every movie expert latest review list that afi came out with gold rush was rated 58th out top 100 american films ever made,0.5734821428571428,0.28738690476190476,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"

DEATHS: H. Rider Haggard, Thomas R. Marshall.KEVIN: We now come to our second Charlie Chaplin film and quite possibly his seminal masterpiece, 1925's The Gold Rush. This movie is wonderful. I laughed really hard right from the beginning. I love the opening where the Tramp first walks on screen, still with his hat and shoes and cane even though there's snow everywhere and he really looks out of his element. I think my favorite comedic beat in the film was the scene where the cabin is teetering over the edge of the cliff. That scene is even better in the 1941 version due to the added tension of sound effects. Another great thing in this movie for me was the irresistible Georgia Hale. Every moment she's on screen everything just lights up. I hear Chaplin was quite the control freak with his films, and I'm sure even he must have been mesmerized with what she did.DOUG: In June 1925, after nearly two years of production, Charles Chaplin finally releases the film for which he is best remembered, and with good reason: The Gold Rush is not just a great comedy, but a great film. And not just because it contains some of Chaplin's best remembered scenes. The gourmet shoe-eating scene is wonderful, the way he is determined to enjoy every bit of the shoe, sucking on the nails like bones, twisting the shoe laces like spaghetti. The scene with the house teetering on the edge of the cliff is one of the greatest sustained comedy scenes ever put on film. And everyone loves when starving Big Jim hallucinates the Tramp as a giant chicken. But there's something more here. Chaplin isn't just interested in telling jokes, but there's a rather poignant story happening here in the romance between the Tramp and Georgia. The scene where he imagines Georgia and her friends enjoying his New Year's Eve party is especially poignant, as he performs the 'Oceana Roll' with a pair of rolls on forks. Interesting this is Chaplin's only silent comedy that he filmed with a complete story ready before filming; interesting too that Chaplin chose this film to redo with new sound and narration in 1942. When you watch the later version, it is cool to realize that it's really Chaplin's voice you're hearing. There were a few noticeable alterations in the two versions, one being that instead of the Tramp reading a note from Georgia that he thinks is for him, he really receives a (different) note from Georgia to him. I prefer the later version of that scene, but I prefer the ending of the earlier version where they kiss; the revised version seems to end rather abruptly.Last film: Strike (1925). Next film: Phantom of the Opera (1925).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each film before we watch the next, never reading the other's review before we finish our own. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.",movie odyssey review gold rush,013 gold rush 1925 released 6 16 1925 viewed 8 4 05 john scopes biology teacher tennessee is arrested indicted teaching darwins theory evolution class chrysler corporation is founded by walter percy chrysler charles francis jenkins makes early breakthrough with demonstration radiovision which would eventually become television births yogi berra charles chaplin jr pol pot malcolm x tony curtis barbara bush deaths h rider haggard thomas r marshall kevin we now come our second charlie chaplin film quite possibly his seminal masterpiece 1925s gold rush this movie is wonderful i laughed really hard right beginning i love opening where tramp first walks screen still with his hat shoes cane even though theres snow everywhere he really looks out his element i think my favorite comedic beat film was scene where cabin is teetering over edge cliff that scene is even better 1941 version due added tension sound effects another great thing this movie me was irresistible georgia hale every moment shes screen everything just lights up i hear chaplin was quite control freak with his films im sure even he must have been mesmerized with what she did doug june 1925 after nearly two years production charles chaplin finally releases film which he is best remembered with good reason gold rush is not just great comedy but great film not just because it contains some chaplins best remembered scenes gourmet shoe eating scene is wonderful way he is determined enjoy every bit shoe sucking nails like bones twisting shoe laces like spaghetti scene with house teetering edge cliff is one greatest sustained comedy scenes ever put film everyone loves when starving big jim hallucinates tramp as giant chicken but theres something more here chaplin isnt just interested telling jokes but theres rather poignant story happening here romance between tramp georgia scene where he imagines georgia her friends enjoying his new years eve party is especially poignant as he performs oceana roll with pair rolls forks interesting this is chaplins only silent comedy that he filmed with complete story ready before filming interesting too that chaplin chose this film redo with new sound narration 1942 when you watch later version it is cool realize that its really chaplins voice youre hearing there were few noticeable alterations two versions one being that instead tramp reading note georgia that he thinks is him he really receives different note georgia him i prefer later version that scene but i prefer ending earlier version where they kiss revised version seems end rather abruptly last film strike 1925 next film phantom opera 1925 movie odyssey is exhaustive chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible starting with d w griffiths intolerance 1916 working our way through year by year one film at time we also write short review each film before we watch next never reading others review before we finish our own this project we hope gain deeper understanding time period films era each film context while at same time just watching lot great movies most which we never would have watched otherwise,0.4964342976247738,0.2808218236789665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.28}"
