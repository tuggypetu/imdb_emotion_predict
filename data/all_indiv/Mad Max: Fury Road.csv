10.0,Pure action spectacle,"MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there's little else to get in the way. It's one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that's never been done before.Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that's not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it's pretty much my idea of a perfect film.",pure action spectacle,mad max fury road is finest piece pure action spectacle that ive watched since raid 2 john wick it feels like mad max film that george miller always wanted make many ways its virtual remake mad max 2 road warrior except with grossly inflated budget cgi effects used enhance rather than dominate now i love road warrior always will but mad max fury road truly is action film our times i know that some will hate it story here is action action alone theres little else get way its one long chase film amazing thing is how they manage sustain momentum good two hours exemplary cinematography quite wonderful direction is what makes this work with bad direction it would have been real chore sit through but instead we get tons suspense great fight scenes incredible spectacle this is kind film you watch see stuff thats never been done before tom hardy feels like obvious fit role brings some working class style charisma part as many have commented max is often supporting player his own film but charlize theron as real lead is excellent too so thats not important even nicholas hoult support is fantastic i loved way that bad guy is played by hugh keays byrne who was villain first mad max all those years ago overall though this is film not about people but namibian desert landscapes modded vehicles speed violence overall thrill chase its pretty much my idea perfect film,0.5875968992248062,0.15618770764119602,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!,"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.",finally yes finally i have seen good action film 2015 mad max fury road is finest blockbuster 2015,when i wrote this review 3 years ago i had no idea how many people hate this movie they are preferring mad max 3 over this film claming mad max beyond thunderdome third film is better film than this really better than this listen folks it has no mel gibson so what so whats your point gibson dropped out this film he wasnt interested it was development years since 2004 this movie was announced george miller did something different with this film he got hate it i hate mad max beyond thunderdome death it is rated pg 13 family film i wanted action bloody rated r film not boring stupid lame fu movie i got rated r bloody action film that i wanted mad max fury road i was entertained i enjoy it at least it wasnt so sick like was beyond thunderdome mad max fury road is my second favorite film franchise this movie did it right it correct that third film that it failed been good action film like it or hate it is your problem but my opinion it is good action violent movie i love it death i am action junkie myself mad max 2 road warrior is my number 1 favorite film all time i think mad max fury road is george millers masterpiece finally finally after 30 years fiasco mad max beyond thunderdome that completely destroyed mad max trilogy george miller finally come back fix mistake he did 30 years ago why wouldnt i love this film this film is best one series along side mad max 2 road warrior at least me it is best film it has action high explosive tom hardy been real mad max unlike mel gibson was thunderdome i am happy they made 4th movie tom hardy was bad ass mad max i didnt even noticed that we dont have mel gibson here tom hardy breaths life into max rockatansky charlize theron is excellent emotionally perfect as furiosa i love high speed pursuit road which i seriously love this thing was more similar mad max 2 road warrior but much better george miller fix it film did not copy road warrior film has it is own story all stunts action sequences are spectacular immortan joe was fantastic villain here he was really good film shows real wasteland future which i am really happy about it note dont waste your time if you have seen original hater review my reply yes i will waste my time watching this awesome action flick yes i have seen original film mad max with mel gibson so many times than you ever did i love this film much more than mad max because sometimes original is very boring film has so much drama it less action than it is fury road i wanted have apocalyptic action film like are fury road road warrior which this film fix it finally yes finally i have seen good action film 2015 it is finally finest blockbuster 2015 mad max fury road is 2015 post apocalyptic action film directed produced by george miller written by miller brendan mccarthy nico lathouris fourth installment mad max franchise it is australian american venture produced by kennedy miller mitchell ratpac dune entertainment village roadshow pictures film is set future desert wasteland where gasoline water are scarce commodities 10 10 awesome film i have seen it twice i love this film death i love it fury road would be second favorite best film franchise,0.610142021720969,0.03804615705931495,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5.0,It Never Stops,"I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned ""There needs to be a story and interesting characters"" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.",it never stops,i have say that i tried really hard like this but my old fashioned there needs be story interesting characters mode took over it took about fifteen minutes figure out who was who apparently guy with death mask tubes was seen as god that there was some religious following could be interesting i guess but what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up there were porcupine cars monster trucks guys poles dropping into vehicles there was no logic presented as why one vehicle would have spear thing thrown at it explode while others were hit with heavy artillery seemed move just fine then we have mad max who is captive with mask that looks like 1955 oldsmobile grill he is put front vehicle as all this combat goes unfortunately he has absolutely no personality whatsoever there was never any suspense this film because place they were trying get was never really our minds eye then theres short crop haired female which seems be standard these days make her look masculine she becomes more formidable anyway it is spectacular look at but when it was over i felt no emotion or satisfaction at all,0.4575396825396826,0.05952380952380952,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away,"Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10",absolutely insane action film that will blow you away,mad max fury road is george millers return franchise he started way back 1979 with mad max i will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh insane it was filled right brim with continuous over top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you edge seat just amazed at what is happening screen now this film doesnt have much plot at all but seriously youre not going into this film intense plot this is film that almost didnt even need one at all one thing i was worried about going was whether i needed have seen previous films understand this one thankfully you dont story is independent previous film which was really helpful characters were all awesome it did amazing job introduce them all almost instantly get right into action max tom hardy furiosa charlize theron were were great extremely likable characters even villain who i will just call sweet tooth was so great he wasnt anything too special but was great threat throughout film i just absolutely loved this movie intense action start finish didnt slow down at all that made it ridiculously fun watch great characters performances are awesome screen were always interesting watch if there was ever twisted metal movie this is what it would be nothing really let film down everything really worked such great time best cinema experience this year so far 10,0.5815062830687829,0.15661375661375662,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,What A Lovely Day!,"The rationale behind the success of 'Fury Road' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he's been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it's pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.",what lovely day,rationale behind success fury road predominantly lies with director george miller whose commitment love film series that hes been developing since its first outing 1979 is evident throughout its pretty obvious that he knows how craft damn fine action sequence without this passion film would have likely stooped as theres not much else way plot or character development even though theron tries her hardest give us enthralling new action heroine be revered aside aforementioned writing setbacks fury road is powerhouse technical categories with stunning contradictory cinematography john seale giving us post apocalyptic world lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones heart pounding score junkie xl exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt film oscar one six its spectacular vehicle design,0.49466089466089463,0.19696969696969693,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,Dark Yet Visually Exhilarating. Beautifully Brutal and Yet Still Visceral,"Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'—women she brought with her—into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history.",dark yet visually exhilarating beautifully brutal yet still visceral,even at beginning theres no hint mad max fury road is going stop right at very start engines are already rewing gathering furious fires vengeance redemption before audience could snap out sheer moments brutal grittiness exhilarating high octane drama they are surely already held hostage within confines post apocalyptic world where everything is horrendously scarce not that its bad thing no its not i tell you this is like being hurled into space roller coaster ride its dangerous but its also thrilling witnessing this dystopic world all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope seatbelt under your seat film shares max rockatanskys tom hardy adventures max is ex highway patrolman hes been haunted by past by family he never saved he meets imperator furiosa charlize theron who is being pursued by dictatorial wasteland leader joe furiosa reaches max help keeping five wives women she brought with her into safety as joes deranged breed warriors called war boys that are barely humans are raging across desert capture them this pursuit throws unlikely partners into whalloping dangers bloody escape suddenly sending them into game survival after rip roaring opening chase sequence max is held captive citadel city where ruthlessly totalitarian leader joe is ruling over grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip every valuable resouces across land this brings entire populace crippling under his control as max he becomes merely blood bag nux nick hoult one joes war boys who is fatal devout cause their fascist leader who has promised them glory getting into valhalla promised land everything this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur even feverish chase even dark erubescents spurred ruthless violence miller has molded world where darkness is escape stream clich s retreads surging into cinemas today its visual feast but surprisingly with sense its explosive every unimaginable ways but its not devoid human story which this case is propelled by stellar performances incredible actors movies payroll tom hardy is utterly capable as main hero but emotional spine narrative mostly runs therons character at some point there would be sense that max isnt only one playing under spotlight as it gets evident furiosa is equally as massive as his role is hardy here is singularly stunning playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required his mission transcends past his emotional torments hes never pulled himself free ghosts if his past same can be said with furiosa who is not only running joe because she wants get herself free his cut throat grip but also bring every woman into safety back freedom where they belong much movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes end end joes subjugated land while also taking surprising twists turns along way its like it doesnt know how stop if it does thats surely only allow us breathe catch up with next electrifying action setpiece theres enigmatic style miller has employed provide distinctions his fantasy world it keeps momentum tack if not ever progressing tone movie all those vividly dark colors that magically shifts something another imparts drowning experience only its enjoying looks festive eyes this makes every eye squashing spectacles take mammoth forms visual extravaganza turning all those burning combustions metal blasts endless pursuits mere technical marvels into hair raising escapade amid these sanity grabbing action sequences though is emotional streak that keeps max furiousas humanity alive this prompts them survival into carrying out their similar humane causes clinging tightly their only mission even if they get hurled into barbaric hostilities their dystopian society this turns movie into something visceral cathartic some ways that probably only small fraction audience could understand it will not be enough merit this achievement with merely splurge superlatives this needs be experienced felt forever cherished mad max fury road ignites eternal fire it will keep burning through stretches cinematic history,0.5516794042719968,-0.02277483833039387,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,"A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.","I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe indeed.... but I'll go for it... Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS. This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot. The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator 2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a grisly and dark world. I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",blockbuster that dark gritty brutal bloody right here,i was left speechless when this finished it can be hard describe indeed but ill go it sheer madness that isnt sullied by bad acting or laughable lines blockbuster that is gritty doesnt have sense humour that could be equated fluffy kitten no lets all hug sentimental bs this is seriously movie i thought id never see cgi filled blockbuster that i flat out loved stunts are so much fun fx so great it is first movie i have seen where i have thoroughly enjoyed all this type stuff probably because cinematography once doesnt suffer cos it it is all incredibly shot action is so brutal appropriately high octane i thought myself more than once i think i am loving this more than terminator 2 but other than that there wasnt time think it kicked off fast barely stopped lulls were amplified by insanity preceding them plus it is dark film which made it even better i many people do aussie accent even close well was hardy actually trying that either way he didnt talk much so it didnt really matter this is more therons movie than hardys he doesnt say much does next nothing first third or so therons furiosa is more hero is story if there were be hero such grisly dark world i dont even like this type movie but execution is everything im gonna go see this again soon 4 5 5,0.5120719351570414,0.06746200607902736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"

It's like an overly long David Bowie music video in its weirdness without Bowie's great music and great style.But it does do some things well. Yes, the action is great, but it is practically a silent film with just snippets of dialogue and relying on visual story telling. Within the first twenty minutes it is revealed that: Water is perceived as bad and is a means of control, the war boys need blood to survive and use human stragglers as a source, chrome and metal are worshipped, and different tribes in the desert have different specialties in terms of vehicular warfare.

10.0,Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre,"Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.

10.0,One of the greatest action films,"George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances.

6.0,Nothing More Than A Noisy Blockbuster,"I love post apocalyptic fiction . John Wyndham and John Christopher are amongst my favourite authors . They weave compelling stories of average everymen surround by a hostile landscape where it's every man for himself and only the cruelest and most heartless survive . George Miller's MAD MAX films are an extention of this . Low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes . And let's not forget hugely influential as well . Sadly the films' influence found itself being transplanted in nearly every post apocalypse story for the next 20 years where a brooding loner , a man of few words , drives through a desert landscape doing his best to survive in a hostile world against scavengers . Influntial but rather unimaginative and the movies probably did the sub-genre more harm than good . This reboot did capture my imagination via the trailers and so decided to give the film a chance , not least because as soon as it was released it shot to number 25 on the IMDb Top 250 If nothing else the film gets off with a bang with the eponymous Max filling us in via voice over that the world has destroyed itself and man has to fight to stay alive against his fellow man and just to prove this is more difficult than it sounds we're treated to a high octane chase sequence replete with fast camera action and editing . Have I mentioned the opening title credits haven't appeared yet ? This sets up the rest of the film that continues in mainly the same way In short if you liked MAD MAX 2 you're going to love this one because this is MAD MAX 2 on a fatal cocaine overdose which is a great thing or a disappointing thing depending on how you look on it . Sadly I'm in the second camp because I wanted more meat on the story and there's not much narrative here . Max gets used as a gimp on the front of a vehicle , manages to escape during an epic stunt sequence , teams up with some fair nymphet maidens and protects them from the baddies and that's it as far as plot goes . The first half of the film is basically one elongated noisy chase sequence full of stunts , car crashes , pyrotechnics . I's brash , noisy and spectacular , so much so that I actually felt myself getting rather bored by all this noise and bluster . Eventually the film does settle down a bit and has characters talking in normal tones without the explosions in the background but the dialogue is just basic as are the performances , Certainly MAD MAX FURY ROAD will be up for a few Oscar noms next year but only for the technical aspects and I'm slightly surprised my IMDb peers rate it so highly",nothing more than noisy blockbuster,i love post apocalyptic fiction john wyndham john christopher are amongst my favourite authors they weave compelling stories average everymen surround by hostile landscape where its every man himself only cruelest most heartless survive george millers mad max films are extention this low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes lets not forget hugely influential as well sadly films influence found itself being transplanted nearly every post apocalypse story next 20 years where brooding loner man few words drives through desert landscape doing his best survive hostile world against scavengers influntial but rather unimaginative movies probably did sub genre more harm than good this reboot did capture my imagination via trailers so decided give film chance not least because as soon as it was released it shot number 25 imdb top 250 if nothing else film gets off with bang with eponymous max filling us via voice over that world has destroyed itself man has fight stay alive against his fellow man just prove this is more difficult than it sounds were treated high octane chase sequence replete with fast camera action editing have i mentioned opening title credits havent appeared yet this sets up rest film that continues mainly same way short if you liked mad max 2 youre going love this one because this is mad max 2 fatal cocaine overdose which is great thing or disappointing thing depending how you look it sadly im second camp because i wanted more meat story theres not much narrative here max gets used as gimp front vehicle manages escape during epic stunt sequence teams up with some fair nymphet maidens protects them baddies thats it as far as plot goes first half film is basically one elongated noisy chase sequence full stunts car crashes pyrotechnics is brash noisy spectacular so much so that i actually felt myself getting rather bored by all this noise bluster eventually film does settle down bit has characters talking normal tones without explosions background but dialogue is just basic as are performances certainly mad max fury road will be up few oscar noms next year but only technical aspects im slightly surprised my imdb peers rate it so highly,0.5339463601532566,0.10772030651340993,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.49}"

5.0,Extremely Inflated,"Like the previous ""Mad Max"" movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war. What remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in war-like fortresses where few laws exist. That being the case, after being taken as a prisoner, it is to one of these harsh enclaves that ""Max"" (Tom Hardy) is subsequently forced to endure. And since life has very little value Max ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic ""War Boys"" by the name of ""Nux"" (Nicholas Hoult). It's at this same time that one of the military leaders named ""Imperator Furiosa"" (Charlize Theron) decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader, ""Immortan Joe"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of Imperator Furiosa with both Nux and his captive Max in hot pursuit and leading the charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture. However, it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else. That said, I thought the talents of both Tom Hardy--and in particular Charlize Theron--were terribly wasted. Likewise, I also believe that the current IMDb score of 8.4 (whether by chance or design) is extremely inflated as well. To that end, I would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the film's actual merits. Time will tell. In any case, while I certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like ""Gone with the Wind"", I also don't consider this to be a bad movie either. Accordingly, while my score may not be popular at this time I have rated this movie as I see it.

Meanwhile Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives a tank truck to collect gasoline for Joe. However her truly intention is to flee from the tyrannic Joe with his five women selected to breed hidden in the truck to her homeland. Immortal Joe commands a party to hunt down Furiosa and Max is chained to Nux's car. Furiosa heads the truck to a sand storm but Nux continues to pursuit her. After the storm, Max succeeds to release from the car and brings Nux chained with him. He sees Furiosa and the five wives and decides to flee in their truck; but there is a secret to operate the truck and he teams up with Furiosa, leaving Nux on the desert. When Joe's gang arrives, they retrieve Nux and follow Furiosa. Will Max and she succeed to escape from Joe's gang? ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a terrible and overrated sequel of the franchise ""Mad Max"" from the late 70's and 80's. The plot and characters are poorly developed and despite the action, the movie is totally forgettable. Tom Hardy is not charismatic and cannot be compared to the ironic Mel Gibson.

10.0,An Action Masterpiece. Ridiculous In All The Right Ways. (9.5/10),"George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.",action masterpiece ridiculous all right ways 9 5 10,george miller returns live action filmmaking with one greatest action films ever put screen mad max fury road is ridiculous all right ways those who have seen original films loved them youll fall love all over again with this film tom hardy takes reigns this time around as max man few words who has been hardened by world which he lives along with him is charlize theron as imperator furiosa woman who seeks redemption by helping five young wives escape films antagonist leading up films release many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks solid narrative motive but i am happy say that this is simply not case yes film does fill 80 its run time with action sequences but it never gets way humanity between these characters that miller has brought life there are some emotional moments specifically with therons character is story something we havent seen before not at all but film loaded with action its nice see solid narrative now how about those action sequences incredible exhilarating jaw dropping george miller has put together some greatest most memorable action set pieces ever one thing that sets action this film apart good majority mediocre action films today is that every action characters make have affect them good bad action is not pointless its motivated its glorious behold thanks use practical effects incredible stunt work stunning cinematography mad max fury road has set new standard action films its arguably greatest action film 21st century its that good george miller has brought back what we loved about 80s action films while also brining new ideas table its best time ive had theater long time i couldnt help but laugh appreciation ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes film left me feeling giddy with big smile my face,0.45974724200530676,0.23248149699762596,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.49}"

1.0,Seems Mainly Out-Takes from Fast/Furious #306,"Rule number 22 from ""The Ultmate Rules of Film Criticism"" (don't worry if you can't find the book -- I only printed 7 copies) says quite clearly ""Where there is an attempt to re-imagine or re-create a classic, and the attempt is made by the creator of the original, no blame shall accrue if the new effort is of less quality than the original."" So, as I critic, I am a little hamstrung by that rule. And wish I had never written it.I saw the original Max Max in a theatre (which sort of dates me); and I remember Mel Gibson when he was the ""next big thing"" (which definitely dates me); and I had always respected Miller for going from the ""end of the world"" to ""talking pigs"" without even pausing to catch his breath.But, for this film, George and I have a problem, as indeed I would have with anyone who gives this film a ""10"" and wonders why they are always getting carded when they try to order alcohol.The original Max Max was an attempt to impose humanistic values on a post-apocalyptic world. It had characters, plot, dialog, acting, common sense, and a bunch of other things that most of us USED TO TAKE FOR GRANTED before the arrival of this film.If you want non-stop action, go to a hockey game.If you want to see what happens when one man has many wives, go to Utah.If you want great special effects, watch the Matrix series again.If you want to see a fine film built around a tough hero, watch Chronicles of Riddick. (Which really is a ""10"") I do not overstate my case when I say that, if we reach a post-apocalyptic world in my lifetime, it will be because of the people whose sense of values considered this film to be high art.This is a very scary film.

8.0,All-out action,"Mad Max: Fury Road is non-stop, full-throttle, all-out action for a good two hours straight. If you are into that then this film is perfect for you. If you aren't, then I'd suggest that you watch something else.This is a movie you watch for the action and only the action. It is truly amazing in that aspect. The cinematography and stunts are groundbreaking and exceptional with tons of impressive sequences. I've heard that the producers utilized very little amounts of CGI; director George Miller has claimed that 90% of the movie's special effects were practical, not computer-generated. This genuinely amazed me when I was watching the movie. In general, the film delivers visually as well. It looks absolutely stunning at times with an impressive usage of colors and visual effects that look incredible. For example, there is a dust storm in which we see some shots that look truly spectacular. Mad Max: Fury Road is not only exciting to watch, but it is also beautiful.The problem with this movie is that we get little to no breaks from the action. The plot is pretty shallow and not that unique. I've seen plenty of other movies in similar settings, but with better plots. Some pauses to engage more with the characters or to explore the world would've served the movie well.While some movies may have similar settings and better plots, very few have action of the same caliber as Mad Max: Fury Road. The action is fun to watch and the acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron enhances the intensity of the action significantly. If you seek exciting action, look no further than Mad Max: Fury Road. If you seek something more than that, you'll have to keep looking.",all out action,mad max fury road is non stop full throttle all out action good two hours straight if you are into that then this film is perfect you if you arent then id suggest that you watch something else this is movie you watch action only action it is truly amazing that aspect cinematography stunts are groundbreaking exceptional with tons impressive sequences ive heard that producers utilized very little amounts cgi director george miller has claimed that 90 movies special effects were practical not computer generated this genuinely amazed me when i was watching movie general film delivers visually as well it looks absolutely stunning at times with impressive usage colors visual effects that look incredible example there is dust storm which we see some shots that look truly spectacular mad max fury road is not only exciting watch but it is also beautiful problem with this movie is that we get little no breaks action plot is pretty shallow not that unique ive seen plenty other movies similar settings but with better plots some pauses engage more with characters or explore world wouldve served movie well while some movies may have similar settings better plots very few have action same caliber as mad max fury road action is fun watch acting tom hardy charlize theron enhances intensity action significantly if you seek exciting action look no further than mad max fury road if you seek something more than that youll have keep looking,0.5572390109890111,0.19854281135531132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,It's so ridiculous!,"This film tells the story of an able fighter in a part apocalyptic world, who helps a group of women to escape from the evil and cruel king who controls water supply. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" has really good reviews, but it is completely not my cup of tea. Firstly, I wish they discovered other colours other than brown. Everything is brown, from the landscape, the vehicles, clothes and everything else. Secondly, the whole plot is quite ridiculous. If the blood bag is so important, who put him in front of the fighter vehicle, which is the most vulnerable place? In addition, there is a guy playing guitar in the battlefield, which is ridiculous. And spraying the mouth with silver paint is just weird. Actually, the whole film is so ridiculous beyond description. I didn't like it at all.",its so ridiculous,this film tells story able fighter part apocalyptic world who helps group women escape evil cruel king who controls water supply mad max fury road has really good reviews but it is completely not my cup tea firstly i wish they discovered other colours other than brown everything is brown landscape vehicles clothes everything else secondly whole plot is quite ridiculous if blood bag is so important who put him front fighter vehicle which is most vulnerable place addition there is guy playing guitar battlefield which is ridiculous spraying mouth with silver paint is just weird actually whole film is so ridiculous beyond description i didnt like it at all,0.7109649122807018,-0.13201754385964912,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.24}"
