,Superb finale to the saga,"I found Apur Sansar, the final part of the Apu Trilogy, every bit as superb as its prequels. I liked the pacing even better than its predecessors, as there was not a single moment that didn't keep me interested. Although the ending wasn't as powerful as its prequels, I thought it was a more hopeful and fitting ending for the saga. However, it did give me the feeling that I didn't want the story to end at all.Soumitra Chatterjee's debut performance as the adult Apu was truly Oscar-worthy (like Karuna Bannerjee who played his mother in the first two films) and a young Sharmila Tagore was also convincing in her debut performance as his wife. Overall, I'd say Apur Sansar is my second favourite in the Apu Trilogy, after Aparajito.Now that I've finally finished watching the Apu Trilogy, I must say this is probably the greatest film trilogy I've ever seen. Although it's a simple story about a country boy's growth to adulthood, it felt like I was watching a truly epic saga. Satyajit Ray really is one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century in my opinion.10/10",superb finale saga,i found apur sansar final part apu trilogy every bit as superb as its prequels i liked pacing even better than its predecessors as there was not single moment that didnt keep me interested although ending wasnt as powerful as its prequels i thought it was more hopeful fitting ending saga however it did give me feeling that i didnt want story end at all soumitra chatterjees debut performance as adult apu was truly oscar worthy like karuna bannerjee who played his mother first two films young sharmila tagore was also convincing her debut performance as his wife overall id say apur sansar is my second favourite apu trilogy after aparajito now that ive finally finished watching apu trilogy i must say this is probably greatest film trilogy ive ever seen although its simple story about country boys growth adulthood it felt like i was watching truly epic saga satyajit ray really is one greatest filmmakers 20th century my opinion 10 10,0.5835317460317461,0.34454365079365074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,A picture says a thousand words,"This movie is Ray at his best. Its sublime. Its distilled to perfection. You need not hear the dialogs or read the subtitles to follow and appreciate it. The visuals and background score tell the store more eloquently. The movie has a soul which will get destroyed if you make even the slightest change to the story, acting, cinematography, music etc. Ray has brought out the best in his actors. They are not experienced actors though both of the leading pair later go on achieve mega success as movie stars. If you blink an eye, you will miss out on the emotions captured. For example, when Aparna is brought to her new home, there is moment in which she matures  from a girl to a woman  while gazing out of the torn curtain. There are several such brief moments. The dialog is minimalist but enchanting. The letter from Aparna to Apu captures love in all its glory  longing, desire, concern and trust.

10.0,Breathtaking Beauty,"Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) is the stunning final chapter of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy, one of the most widely acclaimed series in film. While Pather Panchali and Aparajito, the trilogy's first two, are extremely well crafted, the lack the heart-wrenching beauty of this installment. These three films revolve around tragedy, and it has an almost predestined quality to it, which reminded me somewhat of Stanley Kubrick's excellent, ""Barry Lyndon."" That's where the similarities end of course, as this film is warm and radiates humanity, and Lyndon (as well as all of Kubrick's work) is cold and icy. Ray's rich lyrical realism breathes beauty in the mundane acts of his characters. The film opens as Apu, now a young man, attempts to eek out a living. He searches relentlessly for work, most of which is monotonous and doesn't pay well. However his pudgy friend Pulu invites him to a wedding, and Apu obliges, hoping maybe this display of love will help inspire him and the novel he is writing. In a fascinating turn of events (which I won't spoil,) Apu finds himself coming back to Calcutta married. Aparna, his new bride, is used to a life of luxury outside of the big city` but she is prepared for a life of poverty with her new husband. In one of the most beautiful sequences in film, Apu and his bride slowly begin to love and care for one another. The beauty of this is that we never see them embrace, or kiss or make love. Instead we see it in gestures, in window curtains, in little notes Aparna puts in Apu's cigarettes reminding him only to have one after every meal. Their love is like a dream of love we've had, one that's so innocent and wonderful we want to dream forever. But like all dreams, Apu must wake up. Happiness is just a fleeting emotion for Apu, one that enters his life at random points and then dissapears. Apu wanders bitterly through the Indian landscape, searching for solace and peace. The end moments cannot be explained in words, and simply must be experienced. One of the greatest films of all time. 10/10",breathtaking beauty,apur sansar world apu is stunning final chapter satyajit rays apu trilogy one most widely acclaimed series film while pather panchali aparajito trilogys first two are extremely well crafted lack heart wrenching beauty this installment these three films revolve around tragedy it has almost predestined quality it which reminded me somewhat stanley kubricks excellent barry lyndon thats where similarities end course as this film is warm radiates humanity lyndon as well as all kubricks work is cold icy rays rich lyrical realism breathes beauty mundane acts his characters film opens as apu now young man attempts eek out living he searches relentlessly work most which is monotonous doesnt pay well however his pudgy friend pulu invites him wedding apu obliges hoping maybe this display love will help inspire him novel he is writing fascinating turn events which i wont spoil apu finds himself coming back calcutta married aparna his new bride is used life luxury outside big city but she is prepared life poverty with her new husband one most beautiful sequences film apu his bride slowly begin love care one another beauty this is that we never see them embrace or kiss or make love instead we see it gestures window curtains little notes aparna puts apus cigarettes reminding him only have one after every meal their love is like dream love weve had one thats so innocent wonderful we want dream forever but like all dreams apu must wake up happiness is just fleeting emotion apu one that enters his life at random points then dissapears apu wanders bitterly through indian landscape searching solace peace end moments cannot be explained words simply must be experienced one greatest films all time 10 10,0.5866558441558442,0.2929640151515152,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,David Jeffers - The cornerstone of Indian film.,"""The World of Apu"" is a tale joy of and tragedy, unmatched in its beauty and profound emotion. Satyajit Ray's final film in the Apu trilogy ranks with King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" and Carl Theodor Dreyer's ""Ordet"" as a cinema landmark of family life. But it far exceeds those films in its visual poetry. Apu's journey with a friend and his unplanned marriage sets the stage for a story of domestic life in all its simple joy and awful despair. The serene, contented beauty of the girl is a soaring vision, matched in its humanity only by the broken heart of Apu when she dies. The pages of an unfinished novel, a life's work floating in the mountain air like the seeds of a dandelion, become the symbol of Apu's devastation. The rebirth of life and hope realized in the child illustrates a fundamental belief of Hinduism. Beautifully photographed and edited, ""The World of Apu"" is a masterpiece of film as narrative storytelling. It is the most ""Indian"" of all Indian films.",david jeffers cornerstone indian film,world apu is tale joy tragedy unmatched its beauty profound emotion satyajit rays final film apu trilogy ranks with king vidors crowd carl theodor dreyers ordet as cinema landmark family life but it far exceeds those films its visual poetry apus journey with friend his unplanned marriage sets stage story domestic life all its simple joy awful despair serene contented beauty girl is soaring vision matched its humanity only by broken heart apu when she dies pages unfinished novel lifes work floating mountain air like seeds dandelion become symbol apus devastation rebirth life hope realized child illustrates fundamental belief hinduism beautifully photographed edited world apu is masterpiece film as narrative storytelling it is most indian all indian films,0.5967032967032968,0.13333333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.58}"
10.0,The Delicate Tale of a Man,"Apu is a man with great hopes for a wonderful life. He is ready to live the life of a starving artist and write a novel. He is charming and kind and handsome. He gets away with a lot because of this. The fact is that he was always able to go his own way with little or no responsibility. One day, he is asked by a friend and workmate to come with him for the marriage of his sister. I don't know all the ins and outs of Indian weddings. It turns out that when the arranged groom arrived he had turned mad. If she doesn't marry within a short period of time, she becomes damaged goods. Because she can't marry the former man, the friend asks Apu to marry her. This seems absurd until he buckles under and agrees, much to the great joy of her family. The man she was to marry was rich, so her life now becomes much less than she had hoped for. Nevertheless, after some tough times, Apu falls deeply in love with her and she begins to love him back. When she becomes pregnant, she goes back to her family. While there, she dies in childbirth. The little boy is saved but she is gone. Apu is torn to pieces, never seeing his son and dropping into the depths of depression. While he sends money occasionally, he works manual labor, he gives up on his dreams and can't get over feeling sorry for himself. This film is wonderful, with the most incredible cinematography, closeup so to die for, and acting that is nonpareil. These three films show why Ray is the consummate director, working with concise, minimalist technique.

10.0,One of if not the best movie ever,"The first time I saw this movie was just after it was released in the United States. Ravi Shankar was becoming popular and the fact he did the score added to the movie's interest.But Satyajit Ray is really in a class by himself. The movies -- there are three in the series, this one being the last, are mostly acted by amateurs. The trilogy starts with Pather Panchali, with Apu being a child. Next, Aparajito shows Apu growing up, going to school and learning English because that was the only way to get ahead in the grinding poverty of Bengal.The last of the trilogy, the World of Apu shows Apu marrying, his wife dying, his leaving his son with his wife's parents and then going away to find himself.

8.0,A Flourishing Finale,"Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) is the concluding part of master Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray's '""Apu Trilogy"".The Indian word ""sansar"" may mean both world and family. Both meanings are relevant in the context of the film, as it traces Apu's blooming into a human being, his explorations on the way as well as the phase of his life where he gains a family, again, having already lost everyone in the family he was born into. Loss is a theme which refuses to desert Apu's life but our unvanquished hero lives and grows through, and despite, his recurring losses.Soumitra Chatterjee, later to become one of Ray's favourites, plays the adult Apu in one of his most memorable performances. Satyajit Ray is considered one of India's best ever filmmaker, if not the very best – and this film is a testimony why. Apur Sansar features several immortal scenes, each of which etches itself in the viewer's mind and any of which could serve as the North Star for a budding director as something to match and inspire. Apu's monologue with his friend Pulu as the sole audience, Aparna's (Apu's wife) discovery of her husband's abode and the final sequence deserve special mention.",flourishing finale,apur sansar world apu is concluding part master indian filmmaker satyajit rays apu trilogy indian word sansar may mean both world family both meanings are relevant context film as it traces apus blooming into human being his explorations way as well as phase his life where he gains family again having already lost everyone family he was born into loss is theme which refuses desert apus life but our unvanquished hero lives grows through despite his recurring losses soumitra chatterjee later become one rays favourites plays adult apu one his most memorable performances satyajit ray is considered one indias best ever filmmaker if not very best this film is testimony why apur sansar features several immortal scenes each which etches itself viewers mind any which could serve as north star budding director as something match inspire apus monologue with his friend pulu as sole audience aparnas apus wife discovery her husbands abode final sequence deserve special mention,0.4314069858712716,0.16143053375196234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,Great Conclusion To The 'Apu' Trilogy,"*SPOILER ALERT*WORLD OF APU (APUR SANSAR) only suffers in comparison with its' predecessors - it isn't the masterpiece that PATHER PANCHALI is, but it's still a GREAT film. Ray - early in his career - was already a master at balancing human drama and unforgettable visual stylishness, and - perhaps because of this visual sense of style - I didn't mind the slightly elevated level of melodrama seen here. The final scenes of the three films are similar - with one difference here - in WORLD OF APU, Apu is walking into the unknown, with a sense of optimism and hope (compared with the grief in the first two installments), curious as to what life will next bring, and confident that the knowledge he will gain will only make him a richer person. This film, and the entire trilogy, easily stands alongside BICYCLE THIEF or SANSHO THE BAILIFF as one of the greatest human dramas to have ever been made.There are few films that I think everyone should see at least once - the APU trilogy is near the top of my list.",great conclusion apu trilogy,spoiler alert world apu apur sansar only suffers comparison with its predecessors it isnt masterpiece that pather panchali is but its still great film ray early his career was already master at balancing human drama unforgettable visual stylishness perhaps because this visual sense style i didnt mind slightly elevated level melodrama seen here final scenes three films are similar with one difference here world apu apu is walking into unknown with sense optimism hope compared with grief first two installments curious as what life will next bring confident that knowledge he will gain will only make him richer person this film entire trilogy easily stands alongside bicycle thief or sansho bailiff as one greatest human dramas have ever been made there are few films that i think everyone should see at least once apu trilogy is near top my list,0.5104166666666667,0.09702380952380951,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,Fantastic,"Sometime a person wants freedom in the form of limited attachments to people or places because they have endured so much pain and loss in life. That's one of the themes here, and a reminder to me to be more empathetic towards people I randomly meet, each of whom may be carrying around hidden scars and damage, or doing things in their lives which may seem puzzling.The third Apu film tells a pretty simple story, but I have to say, I really didn't see its big events coming, and it's full of emotional power. The quality of filmmaking is superb, with stunning cinematography from Subrata Mitra and a soundtrack from Ravi Shankar which harmonizes with its mood perfectly.

10.0,Acceptance,"SPOILERS:""Apur Sansar"" is all about the loss of life and acceptance of a new one. In the last part of the truly great ""Apu Trilogy"" Apu loses his new wife Aparna (a strikingly beautiful Sharmila Tagore) in childbirth and therefore cannot accept his newborn son Kajal.What follows is a journey with Apu through his mind and his thoughts.Although it is a very powerful and highly crafted film (probably the most crafted and professional of the trilogy) it is my least favorite of the bunch.It doesn't have the greatness,powerful acting and surprises of especially ""Pather Panchali"" and ""Aparajito"".Still,high above average.While ""Pather Panchali"" was in some ways a little bit amateurish made,which gives also his high charm,""Apur Sansar"" has some great tricks in it.Like the scene after Apu and Aparna have seen a movie and the camera goes almost perfectly from the movie image into a taxi,or the scene in which the wedding ceremony walks by the river and then the camera focuses away from the river and on to Apu.Another very well made sequence is the one in which it seems that Apu throws himself in front of a train,the train is probably the most important symbol of the entire trilogy.Ray created a highly recommended and very well made trilogy,because of his directing and the truly brilliant acting overall but also because of the superb soundtrack by the legendary Ravi Shankar who also contributes in a big way in this last film although I prefer his score for ""Pather Panchali"". Looking at the entire trilogy Ray surpassed my wildest imaginations and I expected quite a lot.Truly cinema history and I am really eager to see more of his work.Pather Panchali 9/10 (number 52 in my all-time top 100 list)Aparajito 9/10 (number 67 in my all-time top 100 list)Apur Sansar 8/10",acceptance,spoilers apur sansar is all about loss life acceptance new one last part truly great apu trilogy apu loses his new wife aparna strikingly beautiful sharmila tagore childbirth therefore cannot accept his newborn son kajal what follows is journey with apu through his mind his thoughts although it is very powerful highly crafted film probably most crafted professional trilogy it is my least favorite bunch it doesnt have greatness powerful acting surprises especially pather panchali aparajito still high above average while pather panchali was some ways little bit amateurish made which gives also his high charm apur sansar has some great tricks it like scene after apu aparna have seen movie camera goes almost perfectly movie image into taxi or scene which wedding ceremony walks by river then camera focuses away river apu another very well made sequence is one which it seems that apu throws himself front train train is probably most important symbol entire trilogy ray created highly recommended very well made trilogy because his directing truly brilliant acting overall but also because superb soundtrack by legendary ravi shankar who also contributes big way this last film although i prefer his score pather panchali looking at entire trilogy ray surpassed my wildest imaginations i expected quite lot truly cinema history i am really eager see more his work pather panchali 9 10 number 52 my all time top 100 list aparajito 9 10 number 67 my all time top 100 list apur sansar 8 10,0.5274386724386725,0.2527435064935065,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,The World of Apu,"The World of Apu, or Apur Sansar if you want, is the third and final part of director Satyajit Ray's acclaimed Apu Trilogy, all of which features in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically Apurba 'Apu' Kumar Ray (Soumitra Chatterjee) has grown up, he is now a jobless ex-student living in Calcutta, and he has vague ambition for his future to become a writer. His old school friend Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee) suggests he attends the wedding of a cousin named Aparna (Sharmila Tagore). However on the day of the wedding it turns out that the bride groom has a serious mental disorder, and wedding must go ahead or the bride is cursed. Apu shakes his head at the idea at first, but then he agrees for the sake of the curse thing to take the place of the groom, and he returns with Aparna to Calcutta. They do actually get on really well and are excited to be having their first child together, and Apu takes up a clerical job. Their growing affection however is cut short when Aparna tragically dies giving birth to their son, Kajal, and Apu retreats blaming the child for the birth of his wife. A few years later, Apu has become a bearded recluse, travelling across parts of India, only giving money for the care of Kajal (Alok Chakravarty) living with his grandparents. He throws away the manuscript of his novel he had been working on for years, and his friend Pulu finds Kajal lonely and uncared for, so he looks for Apu, working on a quarry. He advises Apu to take up his fatherly duty properly, and after initially refusing he reunites with his son, who does not care to see him. In the end, Apu plans to leave alone, but Kajal sees him preparing, he accepts his father as a friend, and they return together to Calcutta to start life afresh. Also starring Dhiresh Majumdar as Shashinarayan, Sefalika Devi as Shashinarayan's wife and Dhiren Ghosh as Landlord.

8.0,Good final chapter. 8/10,"I have commented on both pather Panchali and Aparajito previously. After many months, I finally got to World of Apu, the final episode of the trilogy. To recap, Pather Panchali = 10/10, absolutely perfect, one of the best films ever made. Aparajito = 8/10, had a few problems, but still a thoroughly involving and beautiful film. The World of Apu I give the same rating that I did for Aparajito, 8/10. For the most part, again, it was involving and beautiful. I however have a couple of problems with the film.SPOILERSAs I complained in my review of Aparajito, when tragedies arise in this series, they tend to repeat themselves. I was most affected by the first two of these major tragedies. The third one, at the beginning of Aparajito, affected me a lot, although its power was diminished. By the fourth one, I knew it was coming from miles away, and I felt unaffected. Now the major tragedy in this film seems a bit contrived. I think the development between Apu and his wife was incredibly powerful. The situation which led them to be married lends to a lot of interesting options. The option that was chosen, to kill his wife off, was definitely the wrong one. I am actually hypothesizing that the novel had some more episodes, or at least some more fleshed-out episodes, than does the final film. The events of The World of Apu, at least after the tragedy, seem crammed into a short period of time. It never feels like five years have passed. Still, this is a great movie. Though I stick by these complaints, the film as it stands is very worth watching, since, once you have watched Pather Panchali, one of the very best films ever made, you cannot help but watch Aparajito and The World of Apu.",good final chapter 8 10,i have commented both pather panchali aparajito previously after many months i finally got world apu final episode trilogy recap pather panchali 10 10 absolutely perfect one best films ever made aparajito 8 10 had few problems but still thoroughly involving beautiful film world apu i give same rating that i did aparajito 8 10 most part again it was involving beautiful i however have couple problems with film spoilersas i complained my review aparajito when tragedies arise this series they tend repeat themselves i was most affected by first two these major tragedies third one at beginning aparajito affected me lot although its power was diminished by fourth one i knew it was coming miles away i felt unaffected now major tragedy this film seems bit contrived i think development between apu his wife was incredibly powerful situation which led them be married lends lot interesting options option that was chosen kill his wife off was definitely wrong one i am actually hypothesizing that novel had some more episodes or at least some more fleshed out episodes than does final film events world apu at least after tragedy seem crammed into short period time it never feels like five years have passed still this is great movie though i stick by these complaints film as it stands is very worth watching since once you have watched pather panchali one very best films ever made you cannot help but watch aparajito world apu,0.5081944444444444,0.2277314814814815,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Change your perception towards Movie by watching it.,"After watching 'Pather Panchali' & 'Aparajito'; the 1st and 2nd two epics of Apu Trilogy, I unable to control myself to wait for sometime to watch the third epic 'The World of Apu' directed by Academy Honorary Award winning(in 19992), the great director Satyajit Ray. Satyajit Ray paints how much covered a bitter pain that breaks someone's heart in his life. Someone means the main character Apu; which half of life is already reflected in his 1st & 2nd epic.It is seen that Apu had lost his elder sister and father before he knows the value of life. His mother struggles for his life and making him into a educated person though he should turn into a priest as his their family profession. But director have no mercy upon him. His mother had passed away when he was studying at Kolkata after 10th passing. The story ends up here and so we don't know what happened in his life after everything lost.At the 1st light of ""The World of Apu"" we have seen that Apu is grown up and become turn into a healthy young man, struggling to live without any distress of his past life. He learns to live into a new life. He lives as a tenant in a small room of Kolkata unable to give rent for several months. The story is running on and then suddenly changes the track. We are happy to see his delightful face after getting his life partner or wife suddenly after many years. Now he lives in a romantic world. But again the track changes. He losses everything. After 5 years he is ready to meet a boy named Kajal(5 years old) who always wait to see his father's face. Is Kajal Apu's son? If yes, does Kajal accept him as a father?...to know everything you should watch the movie which is easily available on torrent.There have no error in direction. You can feel a different taste. Acting is everywhere perfect. Great work is done by Soumitra Chatterjee(as Apu), Sharmila Tagore(as Aparna, wife of Apu) and other actors. Alok Chakravarty who acts in a very sort periods as the 5 years old boy touches the heart. Director is successful to reflect the story in his three trilogy. So before watching Apur Sansar(3rd part,called it in Bengali) you should watch 1st Pather Panchali and then Aparajito.

,Down and Out in West Bengal,"""Ray never screamed. He usually whispered, but when he did, it was louder than a thunderburst."" - Radha Prasad Gupta Director Satyajit Ray is today best know for ""The Apu Trilogy"", a series of films comprising ""Pather Panchali"", ""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu"". Released in 1955, ""Pather Panchali"" observed the struggles of a family living in rural India. Released in 1957, ""Aparajito"" follows the family's young son, Apu, as he attends school in Calcutta. The third film, ""The World of Apu"" (1959), finds Apu having graduated from university and struggling to live as a writer.Whilst in India to shoot ""The River"" (1951), Jean Renoir met Satyajit Ray, then a young man working in advertising. Renoir's brand of French neorealism, and the neorealism of postwar Italy and Britain, would later influence the aesthetic of Ray's early films, which were gritty, naturalistic, sympathised with the poor, and which attempted to convey their living and labour conditions. ""Every writer must take a side,"" the twenty eight year old Ray would write for a Marxist magazine in 1949, ""either for the proletariat, or against it. The day of the final battle between the camps of the progressives and the reactionaries is nigh!"" Such overt radicalism would disappear as Ray morphed into a filmmaker, replaced instead with a more soft-spoken humanism.The more autobiographical of the three films, ""The World of Apu"" opens with Apu (Apurba Kumar Roy) living in a tiny, decrepit apartment. Apu's landlord demands rent, but Apu's broke and too proud for low paying writing or teaching jobs, let alone manual labour. He sees himself as a ""novelist"", an ""artist"", and the trivial demands of society irk him to no end. Unsurprisingly, Apu depends upon the charity of friends. He looks down upon these friends – he deems them ""comformists"" – whilst they in turn view Apu as being an irresponsible dreamer, lacking in direction.Apu's shaken out of his cocoon by Aparna (Sharmila Tagore), a young woman whose superstitious family members believe that she must be married off by a certain hour. Though Apu despises arranged marriages and religious customs, he offers himself to Aparna, marrying her as a means of ""rescuing"" her from her family's beliefs. This marks one of the many interesting ironies in the picture; Apu, a ""free"", ""progressive"", unattached artist, embracing traditions, not out of fidelity to these same beliefs, but out of a more personal, moral code.And so Apu takes his bride back to his tiny apartment. Here, cute scenes watch as the duo tentatively get to know one another. Now in love, Apu resolves to get a job so as to provide for his wife. In a matter of months, the bohemian Apu has become a fairly conformist breadwinner. This domestic bliss is shattered by Aparna's sudden death during childbirth, a tragedy which sends Apu spiralling into depression.At this point, ""The World of Apu"" begins to echo ""Pather Panchali"", the first film in Ray's trilogy. In ""Pather Panchali"", we recall, Apu's father harboured dreams of becoming a writer and poet, yet spent all his time tending to jobs he despised. Apu's father was also always away from home, and seemed to return only in time to catch the horrific deaths of cousins and daughters.In ""The World of Apu"", Apu learns that he has fathered a son, Kajole. Apu abandons this son, and instead embarks upon a grief-stricken odyssey across India, a journey in which he hopes to write a novel about his life of endless suffering and loss. Unable to write, the film climaxes with Apu returning to his estranged son. As father and son embrace, Apu postpones his future novel, and so frees himself of memory's baggage, but in a sense also embraces his own lost self, and so his own childlike glee for an artist's life. Beautifully circular, and with each instalment insinuating and tragically haunting the other, the ""Apu Trilogy"" ends with father and son disappearing together, future uncertain.8.9/10 – Masterpiece.

10.0,A radical departure from the formula films of the 50's.,"About midway through Apur Sansar there is an interjection of a film in the style of typical Indian cinema. The contrast in Ray's approach with his classic trilogy is astonishing, considering the mileau in which it emerged. Filmmaking in the 1950's in Hollywood as well as India was studio-driven with light-weight stories having little connection with reality. As another commentator pointed out, this film is closer to the Italian realism films such as ""The Bicycle Thief"". Every shot is a masterpiece of composition and lighting. It does not intrude on the story, but advances it. Likewise, the music composed by Ray, is natural and integral to the scene. This ranks with the all-time greatest watershed movies.",radical departure formula films 50s,about midway through apur sansar there is interjection film style typical indian cinema contrast rays approach with his classic trilogy is astonishing considering mileau which it emerged filmmaking 1950s hollywood as well as india was studio driven with light weight stories having little connection with reality as another commentator pointed out this film is closer italian realism films such as bicycle thief every shot is masterpiece composition lighting it does not intrude story but advances it likewise music composed by ray is natural integral scene this ranks with all time greatest watershed movies,0.5296296296296296,0.2013888888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.25}"
,"Lovely, sad film about loss","Just when the hero, a twentyish Apu, proclaims his happiness at feeling free and young with all of life before him, fate plays its hand. He is nevertheless blissfully happy in his surprising marriage, and the scenes with his young wife truly touching. So much so that I knew they wouldn't last. I thought at first that Apu himself would wreck it with his need to be free and write etc. That might have taken the film to a different plane of misery and would have connected his development with something selfish we saw of him in the second part. But what happens connects instead with his other losses - sister, then parents - in preceding films, all linked mysteriously with trains coming and going and their piercing whistles. Again, images from this film will likely always stay with me - e.g. Apu closing his shutter to not be seen by a sexy girl across the way - why? What did that say about him? I liked the casting of both the child bride and the boy she bears Apu, which is almost her spitting image, and ends the film with some hope that Apu will be happier - though judging from the series as a whole, it would be a very tentative hope at best! Again, watching this, I felt I had gone to India because of the authenticity of locations, acting and music, and the lovely b/w photography.",lovely sad film about loss,just when hero twentyish apu proclaims his happiness at feeling free young with all life before him fate plays its hand he is nevertheless blissfully happy his surprising marriage scenes with his young wife truly touching so much so that i knew they wouldnt last i thought at first that apu himself would wreck it with his need be free write etc that might have taken film different plane misery would have connected his development with something selfish we saw him second part but what happens connects instead with his other losses sister then parents preceding films all linked mysteriously with trains coming going their piercing whistles again images this film will likely always stay with me e g apu closing his shutter not be seen by sexy girl across way why what did that say about him i liked casting both child bride boy she bears apu which is almost her spitting image ends film with some hope that apu will be happier though judging series as whole it would be very tentative hope at best again watching this i felt i had gone india because authenticity locations acting music lovely b w photography,0.5567307692307694,0.25096153846153846,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9.0,Full circle.,"This is the third and last entry into the Apu-trilogy and I must say that's definitely the strongest and most emotionally involving one. Things definitely get full circle in this movie, which makes the whole trilogy as a whole complete and this movie forms a fitting ending to it all.Thing that I really like and admire about this trilogy, is that all three movies basically tell a different story, even though it features the same main characters and it does very little else than simply following his life span. In the first movie he was only growing up, the second one was a coming of age story, while in this movie Apu truly becomes a man and has to start to take responsibility for his own life and that of his newly wed wife.For most part the movie is being a quite cute love-story, in which Apu and his wife truly start to fall in love with each other, only after they already got married, which had happened by pure 'chance', or faith if you will. It helps to make the movie a pleasant and emotionally involving one, in which you start to care for the characters, which was just not always the case with the previous movies. It makes the movie as a whole such a good and powerful one to follow.It's also a nicely paced movie, which is also not something I can really say about the previous movies as well. It's actually also being the shortest movie out of the trilogy, so perhaps this also has something to do with it as well. But of course you also have to give the director credit for that. When director Satyajit Ray started working on the trilogy, he was still a very inexperienced one but by the time of this movie, he had obviously gained more experience and also had the funding to back his movies up, which also must have helped him a lot.A really great ending to one fine Indian trilogy.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",full circle,this is third last entry into apu trilogy i must say thats definitely strongest most emotionally involving one things definitely get full circle this movie which makes whole trilogy as whole complete this movie forms fitting ending it all thing that i really like admire about this trilogy is that all three movies basically tell different story even though it features same main characters it does very little else than simply following his life span first movie he was only growing up second one was coming age story while this movie apu truly becomes man has start take responsibility his own life that his newly wed wife most part movie is being quite cute love story which apu his wife truly start fall love with each other only after they already got married which had happened by pure chance or faith if you will it helps make movie pleasant emotionally involving one which you start care characters which was just not always case with previous movies it makes movie as whole such good powerful one follow its also nicely paced movie which is also not something i can really say about previous movies as well its actually also being shortest movie out trilogy so perhaps this also has something do with it as well but course you also have give director credit that when director satyajit ray started working trilogy he was still very inexperienced one but by time this movie he had obviously gained more experience also had funding back his movies up which also must have helped him lot really great ending one fine indian trilogy 9 10,0.4878724747474748,0.20073401424963924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.38}"

,A Fitting Finale To Satyajit Ray's Classic Everyman Saga,"The third & final chapter of The Apu Trilogy, Apur Sansar chronicles the early adulthood of its titular character, and is yet another rich, resonant, poignant & intimate entry that concludes Satyajit Ray's classic everyman saga on a fitting note, and together with its predecessors makes for one of world cinema's most acclaimed & influential film trilogies.Combining the lyrical pacing of the first film with rich characterisation of the second, the director tackles themes of unemployment, love, loss, despair & responsibility in this second sequel, all the while keeping its universal quality in tact. The plot does wander at times and few scenes linger on for too long but Apu's life story remains gripping throughout.Adding more elegance to the film's authentic storytelling is the ethereal camerawork that provides a timeless sense to the images with its top-notch composition & lighting. Ravi Shankar's soundtrack remains an integral aspect of the emotional journey. And Soumitra Chatterjee's strong rendition in his debut role is a highlight in itself, his apt expressions articulating Apu's feelings with precision.Overall, Apur Sansar is an earnestly crafted, expertly narrated & sincerely acted drama that brings Apu's coming-of-age story to a memorable conclusion, and establishes Satyajit Ray as an auteur of achingly human storytelling. While the film's slow, meandering pace won't appease all, the ups n downs of Apu's life are so relatable & evocative that the interest is never lost.
