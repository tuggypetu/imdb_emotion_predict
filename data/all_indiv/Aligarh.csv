9.0,Challenging & Affecting!,"Hansal Mehta's 'Aligarh' is a lot of things, but firstly, its a Near-Masterpiece. Mehta's Direction captures a true-story, that causes repulsion, anger & sympathy while the narrative flows. This is indeed Powerful Storytelling.'Aligarh' is The true story of Dr. Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras, who was suspended from his job because of his sexual orientation.'Aligarh' is challenging as well as affecting. You watch the protagonist struggle for being who he is. His journey, with great support from a reporter, who befriends him, is quietly devastating. 'Aligarh' is about the devils in our society, about the bigots, the merciless that exist among us. This is an important story, that's been told sensitively.Apurva Asrani's Screenplay is excellent. Sure, its slow-moving, but the affect it leaves, is brilliant. Mehta's Direction is fabulous. 'Shahid' & now 'Aligarh', Mehta has found his voice in these true-stories & has depicted them with masterful treatment. 'Aligarh' is rested on the shoulders of Manoj Bajpai and Rajkummar Rao. And the SUPREMELY Talented Actors are dueling Brando's here. No Kidding, this is Acting in its purest form. Bajpai's portrayal of Dr. Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras, is graceful, devastating & a definition in subtlety. You watch a man broken, & his body-language, as well as his soft dialogue-delivery, left me awe-struck. Rao isn't far behind. As Journalist Deepu Sebastian, Rao gets a lesser showy role, but he delivers an effortlessly natural performance, that packs a solid punch. Bajpai & Rao are so committed in their parts, I forgot I was actually watching two actors performing parts. National-Awards, are you hearing? A Special Mention for Ashish Vidyarthi, who enacts the righteous lawyer, extraordinarily. Dr. Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras was questioned for being who is was. The late teacher was found dead in 2010. But, didn't the people around him kill him way before that? Of course, he found friend in a reporter & got further support from a lawyer who screamed for justice, but did the people who respected him for years, eventually respect him? Being Gay isn't Criminal, Being Homophobic is. 'Aligarh' painfully captures a man's secrecy being questioned, ridiculed. Are we really gonna judge people even now for their sexuality? Are we again going to stay silent when our hogwash law criminalises Homosexuality? Are we going to tolerate bigots? My Answer Is NO. What's yours?Until then, Watch 'Aligarh'.",challenging affecting,hansal mehtas aligarh is lot things but firstly its near masterpiece mehtas direction captures true story that causes repulsion anger sympathy while narrative flows this is indeed powerful storytelling aligarh is true story dr shrinivas ramchandra siras who was suspended his job because his sexual orientation aligarh is challenging as well as affecting you watch protagonist struggle being who he is his journey with great support reporter who befriends him is quietly devastating aligarh is about devils our society about bigots merciless that exist among us this is important story thats been told sensitively apurva asranis screenplay is excellent sure its slow moving but affect it leaves is brilliant mehtas direction is fabulous shahid now aligarh mehta has found his voice these true stories has depicted them with masterful treatment aligarh is rested shoulders manoj bajpai rajkummar rao supremely talented actors are dueling brandos here no kidding this is acting its purest form bajpais portrayal dr shrinivas ramchandra siras is graceful devastating definition subtlety you watch man broken his body language as well as his soft dialogue delivery left me awe struck rao isnt far behind as journalist deepu sebastian rao gets lesser showy role but he delivers effortlessly natural performance that packs solid punch bajpai rao are so committed their parts i forgot i was actually watching two actors performing parts national awards are you hearing special mention ashish vidyarthi who enacts righteous lawyer extraordinarily dr shrinivas ramchandra siras was questioned being who is was late teacher was found dead 2010 but didnt people around him kill him way before that course he found friend reporter got further support lawyer who screamed justice but did people who respected him years eventually respect him being gay isnt criminal being homophobic is aligarh painfully captures mans secrecy being questioned ridiculed are we really gonna judge people even now their sexuality are we again going stay silent when our hogwash law criminalises homosexuality are we going tolerate bigots my answer is no whats yours until then watch aligarh,0.6397748246585456,0.10481727574750824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.22}"
9.0,Aligarh: A Powerfully Sensitive Cinema Never Before Dared In Bollywood; My Oscar Nomination,"#Aligarh: Don't you dare watch this movie if homosexuality makes you laugh or mocking like 'gay' makes you feel more macho.. Aligarh is a powerfully sensitive cinema, never ever dared before on the canvas of Bollywood.. Aligarh is like that hot lava cake which will melt you with it's incredible portrayal of a person who is a homosexual, yet an outcast, he is blessed with the notion of love, yet afraid of the society, who is declared an immoral, yet teaches us lessons of morality which no book can..Manoj Bajpayee has delivered a scintillating performance of a lifetime, which I am sure very few actors can even dream of achieving.. He shivers, he cries, he shouts, he hides like a cat, he loves, he lives.. he inspires. If India should send one movie to Oscars this year, it has to be Aligarh. 5/5(Warning: This is a sensitive cinema & watch it with some sensitivity.. Some scenes are too graphic, kind of normal for an average Hollywood lover, but can be a bit shocking for an Indian movie goer.

9.0,A poignant tale,"A few years back I watched The Brokeback Mountain. Those who have seen it will surely agree with me that the film did not speak about gay rights or anything remotely related to it. Instead it was a love story where a man instead of falling in love with a woman falls in love with another man. It was a very poignant tale of love; a love that most people failed to comprehend.Aligarh made me feel the same. A common gay man tries to come to terms with after being suddenly forced out of the closet. Unlike Brokeback Mountain, this is based on a real story. But the film is like a poetry, that says a lot and leaves even more unsaid, but has a profound impact on the viewer.Please don't watch this movie if you are expecting anything salacious or controversial. Watch it because when you are old and there is no 377 scare and you see a gay couple pass you by, you would know what they feel like because Professor Siras felt the same.",poignant tale,few years back i watched brokeback mountain those who have seen it will surely agree with me that film did not speak about gay rights or anything remotely related it instead it was love story where man instead falling love with woman falls love with another man it was very poignant tale love love that most people failed comprehend aligarh made me feel same common gay man tries come terms with after being suddenly forced out closet unlike brokeback mountain this is based real story but film is like poetry that says lot leaves even more unsaid but has profound impact viewer please dont watch this movie if you are expecting anything salacious or controversial watch it because when you are old there is no 377 scare you see gay couple pass you by you would know what they feel like because professor siras felt same,0.47649572649572647,0.18397435897435901,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Excellent film,"Aligarh was chosen as the opening film of the Mumbai Film Festival and I went to see it wondering if the story, based on real life events, had been sanitized for the screen. To the screenplay writer and director's credit it has not. The sad story of 64 year old Professor Sirus, who was suspended and systematically harassed by Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) for having gay sex with a cycle-rickshaw driver, has been told here in all its poignancy. In it's time, it was a big case for gay rights in India, but Sirus was a frustratingly difficult protagonist, an unattractive personage unwillingly to face the media, unwilling to identify as gay, unable to see the larger issues at stake. Manoj Bajpayee does an excellent job in the complex role of the unhappy Sirus, with all its contradictions. He's shown drinking excessively every night, listening to maudlin Lata Mangeshkar songs. I don't know if Rajkumar Rao is based on a real-life character, but he plays a crucial role as the reporter who tries to draw Sirus out of his shell. He only party succeeds. For one, Sirus was very proud of his position as professor of Marathi at AMU and he was very loyal to AMU itself. He tells Rao he the victim of campus politics because he was promoted to chair the linguistics department, provoking petty jealousies. People knew he was homosexual and used it against him, sending two goons to break into his house to film him having sex. What followed was a downward spiral, but Hansal Mehta somehow manages to keep things from getting too depressing. One interesting scene has the now famous Professor Sirus being invited to a sophisticated gay gathering while in the city, where his newfound fans insist he sing a Marathi song. He does so, rather badly, and then collapses drunk.",excellent film,aligarh was chosen as opening film mumbai film festival i went see it wondering if story based real life events had been sanitized screen screenplay writer directors credit it has not sad story 64 year old professor sirus who was suspended systematically harassed by aligarh muslim university amu having gay sex with cycle rickshaw driver has been told here all its poignancy its time it was big case gay rights india but sirus was frustratingly difficult protagonist unattractive personage unwillingly face media unwilling identify as gay unable see larger issues at stake manoj bajpayee does excellent job complex role unhappy sirus with all its contradictions hes shown drinking excessively every night listening maudlin lata mangeshkar songs i dont know if rajkumar rao is based real life character but he plays crucial role as reporter who tries draw sirus out his shell he only party succeeds one sirus was very proud his position as professor marathi at amu he was very loyal amu itself he tells rao he victim campus politics because he was promoted chair linguistics department provoking petty jealousies people knew he was homosexual used it against him sending two goons break into his house film him having sex what followed was downward spiral but hansal mehta somehow manages keep things getting too depressing one interesting scene has now famous professor sirus being invited sophisticated gay gathering while city where his newfound fans insist he sing marathi song he does so rather badly then collapses drunk,0.6716666666666667,0.1308333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.41}"
7.0,Structured in a decent and respectful way. Could've been a wonder if gripping nature would've been maintained.,"Aligarh picks a take on all known issues and problems in the society regarding homosexuality. The best part is the decency of the storyline in which it has been structured. It has been edited well and flows respectfully. It could've been a wonder if the gripping nature would've been maintained. But often it digresses from the plot and disconnects the viewer.Wonderfully directed by Hansal Mehta, he takes his sweet time in detailing irrelevant things. Many times it makes sense but only if editing is proper. Nevertheless, the effort is fantastic in getting the whole plot together.Rajkummar Rao is just not stopping to improve himself with every movie. He has the sense of maintaining the required body language all through.

8.0,"A big thumbs up for brilliant direction, admiring performances and electrifying screenplay","Bollywood is definitely evolving experimenting on different and unique subjects. The silver lining is the untold stories of various characters and events which were lost in time is being brought back with sheer devotion and sincerity. January started with a bang releasing the story of evacuation of 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait in Airlift and February followed with a gallant story of flight attendant rescuing 359 passengers from terrorist-hijacked plane in Neerja. After giving National Award winning film Shahid, Hansal Mehta is back with yet riveting bio-pic drama Aligarh that raises the question on self-righteousness and breaking the barrier.Aligarh tells the true story in which Manoj Bajpayee plays a homosexual professor Dr Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras at the Aligarh University who is suspended from his job when he is caught in a sting operation.Last year, it was Manjhi-The Mountain Man, Bajirao Mastani followed by Airlift and Neerja. The best part of watching these biographies is the inspiring and motivating stories which has resulted to outstanding appreciation from both audience and critics. It takes courage and guts to make a film like Aligarh.The movie opens with a bang giving you goose-bumps. As the movie progress, you will be sucked into the film and the entire credit goes to Hansal Mehta for doing a fantastic research on the event which changed life of Dr. Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras. The court room- drama, friendship between Manoj Bajpai and Rajkumar Rao and even the climax sequences are definitely the highlight of the film. Screenplay is engaging. Art direction and cinematography is simple yet powerful. Manoj Bajpai has delivered a solid performance. He fits into the character as if it was tailor-made for him.

,Aligarh is a moving critique of a homophobic invasive society that tries to control the lives of others.,"In one of the moving scenes towards the end a tired old man fighting for his right and dignity sadly tells his journalist friend, ""soch raha hoon main Umrika chale jayun. Udhar mere Jase log chain Se re-he sakte hai"". That sentence takes me back to my formative years when different sexual orientations were not openly discussed & acknowledged in the society. It was a time when a slightest trait of homosexuality was ridiculed. With time and experience there's many like me who have evolved and understood what freedom is but sadly a large section of the nation are still cocooned in a regressive time wrap. Aligarh is a poignant critique of such a homophobic invasive society that tries to control the lives of others.Hansal Mehta should be appreciated for choosing a film on real-life academician Dr Ramchandra Siras who was denied his job in the Aligarh University due to his sexual orientation. They left no-stone unturned to make his life a living nightmare. The film gives a harrowing picture of the grudges of an illogical moss-back community thrown to a sensitive man who was full of love and poetry. Beyond this sensitive issue credit goes to Ishani Banerjee (story) & Apurva Asrani (screenplay) for making a heart warming commentary on loneliness and desire for love. Mehta's film has a certain pace which is in-sync with Dr Siras – calm, soft and poetic and the dialogs add on to the mood. One of my favorite dialogs is when Dr Siras calmly reacts to the word ""gay""- ""koi mere feeling KO 3 aksharon mien kaise samjah sakte hai"". Brilliant!! The courtroom sequences on the issue of moral policing deserves attention. Within my limited understanding of this medium I can confidently say that Manoj Bajpayee's portrayal of the ordeal of the real-life professor shall go down as a landmark performance in the history of Hindi cinema. What a fabulous actor!! Rajkumar Rao is another great talent who gave an able support to Bajpayee.Like last week's Neerja we got another film on a real-life hero : Dr Siras, a social martyr who fought for a cause - for individual freedom & the right to live one's life respectfully. If possible please support the film & the cause behind it..",aligarh is moving critique homophobic invasive society that tries control lives others,one moving scenes towards end tired old man fighting his right dignity sadly tells his journalist friend soch raha hoon main umrika chale jayun udhar mere jase log chain se re he sakte hai that sentence takes me back my formative years when different sexual orientations were not openly discussed acknowledged society it was time when slightest trait homosexuality was ridiculed with time experience theres many like me who have evolved understood what freedom is but sadly large section nation are still cocooned regressive time wrap aligarh is poignant critique such homophobic invasive society that tries control lives others hansal mehta should be appreciated choosing film real life academician dr ramchandra siras who was denied his job aligarh university due his sexual orientation they left no stone unturned make his life living nightmare film gives harrowing picture grudges illogical moss back community thrown sensitive man who was full love poetry beyond this sensitive issue credit goes ishani banerjee story apurva asrani screenplay making heart warming commentary loneliness desire love mehtas film has certain pace which is sync with dr siras calm soft poetic dialogs add mood one my favorite dialogs is when dr siras calmly reacts word gay koi mere feeling ko 3 aksharon mien kaise samjah sakte hai brilliant courtroom sequences issue moral policing deserves attention within my limited understanding this medium i can confidently say that manoj bajpayees portrayal ordeal real life professor shall go down as landmark performance history hindi cinema what fabulous actor rajkumar rao is another great talent who gave able support bajpayee like last weeks neerja we got another film real life hero dr siras social martyr who fought cause individual freedom right live ones life respectfully if possible please support film cause behind it,0.5212148962148961,0.14473165723165726,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.37}"
6.0,"Well directed and performed, but slow........","Homosexuality is one of the topics not much talked in Hindi Movies. But Hansal Mehta, the director has shown a full courage to portray such subject. Apart from the regular Bollywood Movies, this appears to be extremely different, well directed, and performed. The film claims to be based on the real story of a professor who is a gay and for his sexuality, is suspended from the university. The film deals with his battle to stand against his sexual orientation. The film makes a sharp statement on the issue and gives a brief on the legislation on homosexuality. The dialogues and direction have been very well done. But it's Manoj Bajpayee's performance for which the film is worth a watch. Away from the commercial angle, he puts a life to his character, as a silent professor who's uninterested in what happens around him. Few of his dialogues just put the homosexuals as a class who also want to live their lives as they want and fend for their privacy.Despite a good performance and good dialogues, the film is not an easy watch. The main reason is its extremely slow pace. The film is not more than a plain narration or a biopic and fails to present an in-depth character study. On the aspect, Oscar nominated ""Milk"" on a gay right activist was much more memorable as it has a better elaboration and conviction which extremely lacks in ""Aligarh."" Overall, the specialities of ""Aligarh"" are its setting and Bajpayi's acting. But the specialities don't outweigh its mediocrity in terms of its slow pace and lack of narrative freshness.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",well directed performed but slow,homosexuality is one topics not much talked hindi movies but hansal mehta director has shown full courage portray such subject apart regular bollywood movies this appears be extremely different well directed performed film claims be based real story professor who is gay his sexuality is suspended university film deals with his battle stand against his sexual orientation film makes sharp statement issue gives brief legislation homosexuality dialogues direction have been very well done but its manoj bajpayees performance which film is worth watch away commercial angle he puts life his character as silent professor whos uninterested what happens around him few his dialogues just put homosexuals as class who also want live their lives as they want fend their privacy despite good performance good dialogues film is not easy watch main reason is its extremely slow pace film is not more than plain narration or biopic fails present depth character study aspect oscar nominated milk gay right activist was much more memorable as it has better elaboration conviction which extremely lacks aligarh overall specialities aligarh are its setting bajpayis acting but specialities dont outweigh its mediocrity terms its slow pace lack narrative freshness rating 2 stars out 4,0.41089496089496097,0.07768807768807767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
4.0,Aligarh's an ode to love and loneliness,"Some films cease to be a story or a mere depiction of an incident or an issue. You live them. They mirror the society's mindset and in doing so, rake out your own prejudices. Aligarh is one such biographical drama that tugs at your heartstrings. While it is melancholic, the film doesn't resort to melodrama to evoke empathy. Aligarh's heart lies in the beauty of its silences and the unspoken words and unrushed emotions shared between its lead characters. While decriminalising homosexuality is an underlying message, the film essentially revolves around companionship and loneliness, reminiscent of Aparna Sen's masterpiece 36 Chowringhee Lane.Hansal Mehta captures the inner turmoil and unrest of Siras in the most understated manner. Most importantly, he gives Manoj Bajpayee the role of a lifetime and the latter infuses soul to his character. Bajpayee's tearful eyes display an array of emotions — sorrow, vulnerability, angst and fear. Scenes where he is seen reciting poetry in fluent Marathi and being immersed in Lata Mangeshkar's songs all by himself, is work of pure genius. These will go down in history as one of the most soul-stirring cinematic moments.While Bajpayee drives the film, Rao delivers an equally compelling performance. You look at Siras through his eyes as he shapes your perception of the man. Satya Rai Nagpaul's cinematography and Karan Kulkarni's background score highlight the isolation that haunts Siras. Apurva Asrani's heartfelt writing too, deserves a mention.""The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages"", this remarkable quote by Virginia Woolf pretty much sums up the film. Aligarh stays with you much after you see it, especially for Bajpayee and his nuanced portrayal of a man brutally put to shame by an intrusive and insensitive society. It's subtlety, redefined.",aligarhs ode love loneliness,some films cease be story or mere depiction incident or issue you live them they mirror societys mindset doing so rake out your own prejudices aligarh is one such biographical drama that tugs at your heartstrings while it is melancholic film doesnt resort melodrama evoke empathy aligarhs heart lies beauty its silences unspoken words unrushed emotions shared between its lead characters while decriminalising homosexuality is underlying message film essentially revolves around companionship loneliness reminiscent aparna sens masterpiece 36 chowringhee lane hansal mehta captures inner turmoil unrest siras most understated manner most importantly he gives manoj bajpayee role lifetime latter infuses soul his character bajpayees tearful eyes display array emotions sorrow vulnerability angst fear scenes where he is seen reciting poetry fluent marathi being immersed lata mangeshkars songs all by himself is work pure genius these will go down history as one most soul stirring cinematic moments while bajpayee drives film rao delivers equally compelling performance you look at siras through his eyes as he shapes your perception man satya rai nagpauls cinematography karan kulkarnis background score highlight isolation that haunts siras apurva asranis heartfelt writing too deserves mention eyes others our prisons their thoughts our cages this remarkable quote by virginia woolf pretty much sums up film aligarh stays with you much after you see it especially bajpayee his nuanced portrayal man brutally put shame by intrusive insensitive society its subtlety redefined,0.5402222222222222,0.1288037518037518,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.31}"

3.0,Over intelligently slow,"Happening in this real incident was very few. So, movie crawls. It was very easy to sum up all incidents in a half page news covering rather than being filmed because dedicating two hours specified time demands something more. Dark lighting, focus shifting and tight close ups are irritating. Story is based upon real incident. Screenplay offers nothing new, same for dialogues. Plus point of this film was the way they were handling the subject without loosing its dignity but then after interval freakily they thought to put some spice. They come up with a long kissing scene with journalist Deepu and his senior, it was long, deliberate and out of the bill, other scene when Professor Siras has been shown being very intimate with his friend otherwise they were very successful to handle this subject in sensible way. What had happened to Irffan? Writer and director don't bother to show his plight though he was also victim of the same issue but they choose to show professor hardship. I think its quite discrimination because Irfan belonged to a poor family and professor was intellectual. Another issue has been shown in pre-climax to justify the climax but that was very forceful and somehow abrupt. Performance wise Manoj Bajpeyee as professor S.M.Siras is superb. His body language, dialogue delivery and subtle expression are fantastic. The way he has moves his finger, leg and body ,when he was listening song 'Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha' proves his caliber.

6.0,Aligarh - A foul play damages it all.,"To begin with, Aligarh was released on 26 Feb in India. I get to watch the movie 3 days later. From the trailer it seemed to me the movie where the victim gains justice. Thus the thought of people protesting against the movie (AU), seemed a tough debate, if logic and wise were considered over religion. I however wondered and was against such title of course till I saw the end of the movie... where I do consider involvement of foul play.Given the circumstances of victim who is unaware of what's going on in world the movie seemed sincere. The cast of Manoj Bajpayee does justice to the main characters role, justifying above statement. However his Marathi did made me chuckle. I would say it as movie not meant for everybody, especially if you are an orthodox in nature.The poetry part where the victim conveys, the poetry is meant for the readers to take out meaning from is simply great. The English poems which were taught to me till I cleared my first board were too difficult. Even reference guides dint help much. If I can go back and tell my teacher's one thing with that regards, it would be the first line of this paragraph and inclusion of simple language.Yeah I will always stand with the weak, especially if they are right!Rating: 8.0/10.",aligarh foul play damages it all,begin with aligarh was released 26 feb india i get watch movie 3 days later trailer it seemed me movie where victim gains justice thus thought people protesting against movie au seemed tough debate if logic wise were considered over religion i however wondered was against such title course till i saw end movie where i do consider involvement foul play given circumstances victim who is unaware whats going world movie seemed sincere cast manoj bajpayee does justice main characters role justifying above statement however his marathi did made me chuckle i would say it as movie not meant everybody especially if you are orthodox nature poetry part where victim conveys poetry is meant readers take out meaning is simply great english poems which were taught me till i cleared my first board were too difficult even reference guides dint help much if i can go back tell my teachers one thing with that regards it would be first line this paragraph inclusion simple language yeah i will always stand with weak especially if they are right rating 8 0 10,0.43963293650793656,0.060978835978835966,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,"Aligarh is a masterpiece, which has the perfect synchronization of brilliant performances, direction, writing, editing, cinematography and music.","Aligarh, a biographical film by Hansal Mehta, is based on the life of a professor of Aligarh Muslim University – Dr. Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras. The year 2016 has so far seen two films Airlift and Neerja inspired from the true stories and here is another one, Aligarh. Such films really raise the bar of Bollywood films and Aligarh is no exception. It has created a lot of buzz offlate due to the intensity of the topic. Aligarh is a rare take on homophobia. We as individuals have the right to design our choices, and so, how would it be, if one is to face discrimination due to the choice he or she makes in their lives. Aligarh is based on one such true story about Professor Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras, who kept his sexual preference confidential for years, but became a victim to an undercover sting operation just before a few months short of his retirement and was suspended from his post. Aligarh is just highlighting one point that every individual born on this earth has the right to live. Yes, we are living in a country, where homosexuality is illegal. Aligarh is not an attempt to get the Section 377 repealed, but it tries to raise a very important point, we as a society shall protect the basic rights of every individual, be it LGBT, i.e. to allow them to live their lives without victimizing them for the sexual preferences they have. This film talks about just one Professor Siras, but certainly, there are umpteen Professor Siras in our country, who are suffering. The film draws our attention to the fact that how important it is for us as a society to change our attitude. We don't have any right to judge anyone on the basis of their most personal and intimate choices, can't enter anyone's bedroom to question their dignity. Yes, the taboo topic of the film i.e. homophobia can make the film an adult film, but there are enough content in this film which can make the current as well as the coming generations thoughtful. This film not only deals with an homosexual's ordeal, but also deals with other issues viz. right to live, desire to maintain dignity, redeem the maligned status, loneliness, finding solace in music and drinks to fight solitude, the very meaning of love etc. Brilliantly crafted film. The film by Hansal Mehta is a brilliant effort to depict the story of Professor Siras (Manoj Bajpayee). The film begins with Prof Siras coming home in a rikshaw and later, both Prof Siras and rikshaw puller going inside his house. And the next day newspapers headlines talk about Prof Siras being caught up in compromising position with the rikshaw puller. Lot of aggression is there amongst people, who burn his effigies in front of Aligarh University (yes, in the film, the university is called as Aligarh University, AU, shot at Bareilly). He is being suspended from his post.Deepu Sebastian (Rajkummar Rao), a journalist with Indian Post Newspaper requests Namitha (Dilnaz Irani) to allow him to cover Professor Siras' story. For Namitha, it is a 'sex scandal' story whereas for Deepu, it is a human story. Namitha is keen to give this story to someone experienced. After persistent efforts, Deepu manages to get the permission to cover Prof Siras' story. Deepu along with his cameraman colleague Tashi (Sumit Gulati –Talwar fame) travels to meet Prof Siras. How after initial reluctance, a beautiful bond of sharing develops between Deepu and Prof Siras. Prof Siras' colleague and friend Prof Sridharan gets an apology letter signed by Prof Siras to submit at college. But nothing works out in Prof Siras' favour, rather following his suspension, he is even given notice to vacate his accommodation, electricity is provided only for four hours in a day. Prof Siras is miffed up with the way world is reacting to his news. He finds solace in a peg and in Lata Mangeshkar's songs. Activists convince him to file his case against Aligarh University so as to revoke his suspension. That is where the entry of Ashish Vidyarthi as Advocate Anand Grover happens. Rest of the film is about how the court proceedings happen, how Prof Siras had to bear the brunt of coming out in open, accepting that he is a gay and fighting against his university. The film also portrays Prof Siras' life through his words. His bond with Deepu also plays a pivotal point in the film. Watch the film to know, how the story has been presented. There are not many dialogues in the film, rather a perfect combination of words and silences are used. It is the same as how Prof Siras describes poetry: ""It is in the silences. It is in the spaces between words."" One of the good aspects about the film is that plot like this is so sensitively and sensibly handled. Aligarh, a very brave and intense film by Hansal Mehta, will keep you glued to the screen. It talks about every individual's right to live, respecting one's privacy. It no way asks you to support LGBT, but definitely asks one to have compassion towards them, and to respect their constitutional rights as human beings.

7.0,An Important Addition!,"Hansal Mehta's ""Aligarh"" delineates the story of a Homosexual Man & his innermost struggle to come at terms with his sexual preferences. Amid all the altercations & judging eyes; it exhibits a humane story about passivism & certitude!""Society does not consist of individuals, but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand."" - Karl MarxNot many films are made on Homosexuality in India. So whenever such films come around; they usually become the talk of the town. Some scream their praises, others may hold onto conservativeness. Over the time, these movies do come to be quintessential in their own rights. Not only for how well the actual enactment might have been but for what it put across in the long term. Especially for the real-life persons belonging to these special communities.Keeping aside its poignant contribution to the society, storywise it's been laid out in a simplified manner. Based upon a true event, the writing leaned towards a more sensitive and considerate approach! It never gets as intense as I wanted it to be. Although this benign build-up flourished elegantly under immaculate technical prowess & puissant performances!You simply can't take your eyes off Manoj Bajpai. For the role of a Homosexual Man, he brings quaint tranquility. A soft spoken intellectual who fights against the humiliation he grievously faces on an everyday basis!

8.0,"A tragic tale of Prof. S. R Siras, who did not fear to choose (Warning: Spoilers)","'Aligarh,' the film named after Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, India, and the famous Aligarh University is a biographical tragedy of Professor S.R. Siras, a Marathi Brahmin, who is a reader specializing in Marathi and Chairperson of the Modern Indian Languages at the University. One day he is accused of having sexual relations with his male friend, a rickshaw puller. Consequently, he is assumed to be a disgrace to the society and expelled from his position. Stellar performance from Manoj Bajpai and Rajkummar Rao are the highlight of the film. They share a great camaraderie. Bajpai's portrayal of Prof. Siras is most natural. He is gentle and calm headed. He is least worried about what the lawyers are arguing about and content in reading a book in the courtroom. His recital of his Marathi poetry is the hallmark of the film.Without going into too many details of Article 377, this movie subtly delivers the message - adults have the right to choose, and anything that happens behind closed doors is nobody's business.Aligarh's pace is slow. Unlike Talvar, this film does not delve deep into the conspiracy surrounding Professor's tenure in the University and his sudden death. Some fractions of the university are jealous of Prof. Siras as he is Maharashtrian in an Urdu speaking fraternity with a top position at the University. Just under 2 hours, the film leaves you feeling sad for Prof. Siras.

10.0,"""Aligarh"" - A heart throbbing film. A must watch; in Indian context.","When I finished watching the film, I was in a great sense of despair and full of emotions. I literally cried like a child in theater hall. This film does this to me and it was painful yet hopeful to watch the story of a professor in Aligarh University (A.M.U), who is suspended by the AMU for being caught in a sting operation by a local news channel, in which he was in his bed with a rickshaw puller in intimacy position. And he was later suspended on the ground of being homosexual and doing gross conduct (According to the university rules) in the premises of AMU and later he has to evacuate his apartment given by University.Professor Siras (Played by Manoj Bajpai) is a normal person living his life teaching Marathi literature to kids, sipping alcohol at the end of the day and listening to Lata Mangeshkar songs to ignore is loneliness.He is a respectable professor and has won Language Literature award By Maharshtra Government in the year 2002 and is the only Marathi language professor in whole university campus and also the chairmen of Language board in A.M.U. Despite being playing the character of a homosexual professor -Manoj Bajpai never intimate and pretend being a ""gay"" unlike many other queer characters in many bollywood movies. Writer, director and the actor himself tried not to stereotype the character of a gay person like everyone do. After watching professor Siras on screen, everyone will understand that being gay doesn't mean you have to be gentle and sensitive in nature, or subtle in your gesture and physical appearance. They are also normal human being like us, and it has nothing to do with their subtlety and sensitivity in gesture and body moment. Manoj Bajpai portrayed Professor Siras as a person: Who loves poetry and literature, and is also a father like figure for example: (When he said the dialogue- ""You are a good boy Deepu"") in his last conversation with Deepu (Rajkumar Rao) on phone after winning the case. Writer has portrayed the characters and plot of movie so subtle and sweet that it evokes a sense of agony and anguish after watching the struggle of a homosexual person in a city like Aligarh – where in a country like India; having physical intimacy with a same sex in still penalized and considered as criminal in nature and one has to go through several difficulties because of that. RajKumar Rao Character was also very powerful. He played the role of Journalist (Dipu Sebastian) who followed the story of Professor Siras, and evoke the investigation by himself and talk to Siras about the incident happened that night. Rajkumar played Deepus role in his own way- like he use to do.The connection between Deepu(Rajkumar Rao) and Professor sirus(Manoj Bajpayi) is must to see. The written part of the characters are so originally written it look so mumble-core(as it is a real story, based on true incidents)The film illustrates the story of 'Siras' so eloquently to audience that one needs to look into the matter and talk about it.My reason for crying after finishing the movie is because I was moved by the character of the story and relation between a normal reporter and the Professor. Both are unknown but yet compassionate about the discrimination done to a homosexual person. The narrative aspect of the movie moved me so emotionally- that I cried after watching film and it took me into a feeling of despair and anger, because that's a hard reality and truth which prevail in my country, which need to be addressed to end the discrimination.One needs to watch this film- which raised such a sensitive issue. The issue of homosexuality is still considered as a taboo and an institution like AMU – who produced many scholars. Intellect and PhD holders: considered this topic as unethical and make one life hell by their self moral policing. One needs to watch this film to understand the pain and sufferings of a community, who suffer these miseries of inequality and discrimination on day to day basis.Director Hansal Mehta and Script writer Apurva M Asrani has addressed and raised this issue in public forum by making such a beautiful and remarkable film with talented leads like Manoj Bajpai and Raj Kumar Rao. Film which shines with authenticity and emotional heft, which leaves you thinking, and which says something we should all listen to, especially in these times when it has become more imperative than ever before: we can be different, but we are us. It moved me; so it will do to you.",aligarh heart throbbing film must watch indian context,when i finished watching film i was great sense despair full emotions i literally cried like child theater hall this film does this me it was painful yet hopeful watch story professor aligarh university m u who is suspended by amu being caught sting operation by local news channel which he was his bed with rickshaw puller intimacy position he was later suspended ground being homosexual doing gross conduct according university rules premises amu later he has evacuate his apartment given by university professor siras played by manoj bajpai is normal person living his life teaching marathi literature kids sipping alcohol at end day listening lata mangeshkar songs ignore is loneliness he is respectable professor has won language literature award by maharshtra government year 2002 is only marathi language professor whole university campus also chairmen language board m u despite being playing character homosexual professor manoj bajpai never intimate pretend being gay unlike many other queer characters many bollywood movies writer director actor himself tried not stereotype character gay person like everyone do after watching professor siras screen everyone will understand that being gay doesnt mean you have be gentle sensitive nature or subtle your gesture physical appearance they are also normal human being like us it has nothing do with their subtlety sensitivity gesture body moment manoj bajpai portrayed professor siras as person who loves poetry literature is also father like figure example when he said dialogue you are good boy deepu his last conversation with deepu rajkumar rao phone after winning case writer has portrayed characters plot movie so subtle sweet that it evokes sense agony anguish after watching struggle homosexual person city like aligarh where country like india having physical intimacy with same sex still penalized considered as criminal nature one has go through several difficulties because that rajkumar rao character was also very powerful he played role journalist dipu sebastian who followed story professor siras evoke investigation by himself talk siras about incident happened that night rajkumar played deepus role his own way like he use do connection between deepu rajkumar rao professor sirus manoj bajpayi is must see written part characters are so originally written it look so mumble core as it is real story based true incidents film illustrates story siras so eloquently audience that one needs look into matter talk about it my reason crying after finishing movie is because i was moved by character story relation between normal reporter professor both are unknown but yet compassionate about discrimination done homosexual person narrative aspect movie moved me so emotionally that i cried after watching film it took me into feeling despair anger because thats hard reality truth which prevail my country which need be addressed end discrimination one needs watch this film which raised such sensitive issue issue homosexuality is still considered as taboo institution like amu who produced many scholars intellect phd holders considered this topic as unethical make one life hell by their self moral policing one needs watch this film understand pain sufferings community who suffer these miseries inequality discrimination day day basis director hansal mehta script writer apurva m asrani has addressed raised this issue public forum by making such beautiful remarkable film with talented leads like manoj bajpai raj kumar rao film which shines with authenticity emotional heft which leaves you thinking which says something we should all listen especially these times when it has become more imperative than ever before we can be different but we are us it moved me so it will do you,0.5292795566502463,0.13998563218390803,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Manoj Bajpayee Gives Award Winning Performance Portraying The Late Ramchandra Siras.,"The film deals fundamentally in two areas: personal privacy and sexual orientation. This film is about the true life story of Ramchandra Siras (1948 – 7 April 2010) was an Indian linguist and author. He was a professor at the Aligarh Muslim University specializing in Marathi literature and head of the Department of Modern Indian Languages.On 8 February 2010, two men forced their way into Siras' house and caught him having consensual sex with another man. On 9 February 2010, Siras was suspended by AMU for ""gross misconduct"" after having been ambushed by a local TV channel's camera crew, while having sex with a rickshaw puller.[1] The AMU public relations officer, Rahat Abrar, stated: ""Siras was captured on camera having sex with a rickshaw-puller. It's a scandal no institution of repute can overlook. He was, therefore, placed under suspension by the order of the vice-chancellor, professor P. K. Abdul Aziz"".The film starts off with the scene where Siras is exposed by two men in the company of another man. He is soon suspended by Aligarh Muslim University(AMU). Journalist Deepu Sebastian(Rajkummar Rao), Indian Post takes interest in Siras's story and goes personally to interview him. Soon a bond is forged between Deepu and Siras. Deepu sees the real side of Siras, a humble professor who has been cruelly victimized by members of his peers. Eventually Siras goes to court to fight the AMU. He won his case against the university in Allahabad High Court on 1 April 2010, and got back his job as professor, along with his accommodation, until his retirement. The case was exacerbated by the involvement of students in the covert taping and ambush of Siras and his lover. The case was fought on the premise that Siras could not be penalised for being homosexual as Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexuality, had been declared unconstitutional by the Delhi High Court in 2009.On 7 April 2010, Siras died in his apartment in Aligarh. Police suspected suicide, and preliminary results from the autopsy showed traces of poison in his body. A case of murder was later registered and six people arrested. On 19 April, the Superintendent of Police stated that three journalists and four AMU officials were named as part of the crime. The case was closed without resolution after the police failed to find sufficient evidence.Siras was due to retire officially from academia in 6 months, and the letter officially revoking his suspension arrived at his office the day after his death.Verdict: The film is beautifully directed by Hansal Mehta, who is an Indian film director, writer, actor and producer. Mehta started his career in television with his show Khana Khazana (1993–2000) and later moved on to movies like Jayate (1999) and Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar (2000). He is best known for Shahid for which he won the 2013 National Film Award for Best Direction. He then went on to direct City Lights (2014) and Aligarh (2016). Also superb music by Karan Kulkarni and excellent cinematography by Satya Rai Nagpaul make this film really stand out.

10.0,A sad commentary on the human condition but brilliantly done,"There are many beautifully written reviews about the synopsis of the story - A Gay professor gets set up and filmed having sex and then gets suspended from his job.I just wanted to share my thoughts - the title of my review is from the movie itself where journalist Deepu Sebastian recognizes this is not a Gay story but the story about one man (with a lot of help) is tilting at some pretty huge windmills. Rajkumar Rao portrayed Deepu so well and Manoj Bajpayi was absolutely astounding showing the quiet dignity of Dr. Sirus.This seems self evident, but how can the bastions of morality violate their own code and be so cruel as they were to Dr. Sirus, even if murder wasn't proved, I will always suspect it. Look at the USA - 1% have so much money, yet the public goes along with every official who says there is no money to fix this or pay for that. I do not know why people's attitudes are so hard to change.How many of us would smell like a rose if hidden cameras were installed at home or workplace? A moving film, but still very sad. I don't think anyone else mentioned that India re-criminalized homosexuality in 2013 (per the closing credits of the movie).",sad commentary human condition but brilliantly done,there are many beautifully written reviews about synopsis story gay professor gets set up filmed having sex then gets suspended his job i just wanted share my thoughts title my review is movie itself where journalist deepu sebastian recognizes this is not gay story but story about one man with lot help is tilting at some pretty huge windmills rajkumar rao portrayed deepu so well manoj bajpayi was absolutely astounding showing quiet dignity dr sirus this seems self evident but how can bastions morality violate their own code be so cruel as they were dr sirus even if murder wasnt proved i will always suspect it look at usa 1 have so much money yet public goes along with every official who says there is no money fix this or pay that i do not know why peoples attitudes are so hard change how many us would smell like rose if hidden cameras were installed at home or workplace moving film but still very sad i dont think anyone else mentioned that india re criminalized homosexuality 2013 per closing credits movie,0.659126984126984,0.15476190476190477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.41}"
4.0,A disappointing film from what was potentially good material,"India doesn't make many films which talk about someone gay: but this is certainly not the film that comes out on top among them. That credit, out of the films that I've watched, goes to ""My Brother Nikhil"", itself a middling film. However, Bajpai, the hero of the film, insists, that you people are stuck on labels: so let's not treat the film as gay-themed. The problem is that India makes many fine films otherwise: and then this film suffers a lot by comparison. So, let's leave comparison aside and take the film in itself ...This film suffers from what I name as the ""Parzania"" syndrome, named after a much more terrible film, which was ostensibly about a socio- historical issue but which still got nice word of mouth from critics: just because they didn't want to say anything bad about a film that was seen as progressive. Similarly, ""Aligarh"", though not terrible, is a very middling film, especially considering that its director, Hansal Mehta, makes much finer films than this one. But because it is about a topic not many are comfortable with, it still wins plaudits: but art should not be about propaganda, it should be about art. And as a work of art, this film fails miserably.Why does it fail? While Bajpai gives a sufficiently good performance (can he even act badly ever?), the otherwise reliable and Mehta's favorite Rajkummar Rao is a complete misfit for the role and his mind doesn't seem to be in the film. To make things worse, the constant close-ups, especially of Bajpai's character, doesn't let the story grip the viewer: the film editing is also quite childish, with cameras panning suddenly to show the ""Marathi department"" written in Urdu script, or to show some Muslim caps bobbing up and down a bit ... Also, the city of Aligarh itself is not at all seeping into the film: why to call the city that then? And that the story is happening in a conservative city like Aligarh is important to make the viewer feel! Yes, you didn't or couldn't shoot in Aligarh, but if you did shoot in Bareilly, why am I not feeling Uttar Pradesh, at least? Where is the famous railway gate of Aligarh, people waiting there ... and even if things are better working now there, you could still add some. Be still, remember David Lean. Focusing unnecessarily on Bajpai's face while he listens to old Hindi songs doesn't give that stillness; it only makes you pretend to be artsy so those critics who don't feel films will applaud you. But what is the point of making films if you cannot make your viewer feel your story? The point of telling a story is its listener, its audience, not the critic.I had expected much more from a Manoj Bajpai film directed by Hansal Mehta. But, instead, all I got was pretensions: including two gay men kissing each other. What's the point of those repeated flashbacks? If you don't have enough plot, just set the atmosphere: that in itself is a rewarding experience that cinema can give.",disappointing film what was potentially good material,india doesnt make many films which talk about someone gay but this is certainly not film that comes out top among them that credit out films that ive watched goes my brother nikhil itself middling film however bajpai hero film insists that you people are stuck labels so lets not treat film as gay themed problem is that india makes many fine films otherwise then this film suffers lot by comparison so lets leave comparison aside take film itself this film suffers what i name as parzania syndrome named after much more terrible film which was ostensibly about socio historical issue but which still got nice word mouth critics just because they didnt want say anything bad about film that was seen as progressive similarly aligarh though not terrible is very middling film especially considering that its director hansal mehta makes much finer films than this one but because it is about topic not many are comfortable with it still wins plaudits but art should not be about propaganda it should be about art as work art this film fails miserably why does it fail while bajpai gives sufficiently good performance can he even act badly ever otherwise reliable mehtas favorite rajkummar rao is complete misfit role his mind doesnt seem be film make things worse constant close ups especially bajpais character doesnt let story grip viewer film editing is also quite childish with cameras panning suddenly show marathi department written urdu script or show some muslim caps bobbing up down bit also city aligarh itself is not at all seeping into film why call city that then that story is happening conservative city like aligarh is important make viewer feel yes you didnt or couldnt shoot aligarh but if you did shoot bareilly why am i not feeling uttar pradesh at least where is famous railway gate aligarh people waiting there even if things are better working now there you could still add some be still remember david lean focusing unnecessarily bajpais face while he listens old hindi songs doesnt give that stillness it only makes you pretend be artsy so those critics who dont feel films will applaud you but what is point making films if you cannot make your viewer feel your story point telling story is its listener its audience not critic i had expected much more manoj bajpai film directed by hansal mehta but instead all i got was pretensions including two gay men kissing each other whats point those repeated flashbacks if you dont have enough plot just set atmosphere that itself is rewarding experience that cinema can give,0.5931761593526299,0.039783691254279475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9.0,BollywoodRare:Manoj Bajpayee's performance cannot be described in one word in a movie about our outlook towards Sexual Orientation,"February 2016 Releases: Aligarh (film)‪#‎BollywoodRare‬""Manoj Bajpayee's performance cannot be described in one word in a movie about our outlook towards Sexual Orientation""There are movies that require you to be patient because waiting in a long queue isn't the only thing in this world that you require patience for. Aligarh is a perfect example of such movies & another addition to the ever growing (untold) Biopics in Bollywood.Aligarh (film)The story of Marathi Professor Siras who was suspended from his position at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) because of his sexual orientation. The movie follows the long & tiring the elderly professor had to undertake to get Justice.Starring Manoj Bajpayee, Rajkummar Rao, Ashish VidyarthiDirected by Hansal Mehta (Shahid, City Lights)Watching an actor perform out of the norm is a godsend to grace your eyes upon. And that's exactly what Bajpayee gives us in Aligarh. We all know Bajpayee for his menacing, gangster oriented flicks in which he cusses & kills people & delivers a neat dialogue in the process. But Aligarh shows us his sensitive side, which you will leave you impressed. There is a sequence in the movie that focuses on Bajpayee's Character Siras face for an entire 5 minutes. In those 5 minutes he goes from straight faced to a teary eyed man and the transformation displayed feels damn natural. And for the character he portrays, its sad to see the ordeals he had to face for enjoying the company of men. He gets suspended, power to his house gets disconnected, he is forced to vacate his flat & even the doctor refuses to meet him !! And for a person who understands loneliness, its painful to see what he goes through when everyone abandons him. The only company he gets is in the form of Journalist, Deepu Sebastian (Rajkumar Rao) who works for First Post newspaper. He approaches Siras because he feels he has been mistreated and their relationship form the lighter parts of the flick wherein they occasionally take a jab at each other. Ashish Vidyarthi plays the role of the Lawyer who represents Siras in court. The movie on the whole may seem a bit slow, but as I mentioned before patient viewing is required to enjoy this Cinematic wonder. You may even tend to yawn at times but it's Bajpayee whose dedicated take on the character that keeps you hooked. There is one dialogue that says it all: ""I will shift to America after. I have heard that life is better there for people like me"" (something along those lines). Watch Aligarh for its take on a sensitive topic & Bajpayee's ""cannot be described in a word or two"" performance.‪#‎AligarhTheMovie‬ ‪#‎ManojBajpayee‬ ‪#‎RajkummarRao‬ ‪#‎HansalMehta‬ ‪#‎AshishVidyarthi‬ ‪#‎Siras‬ ‪#‎AligarhMuslimUniversity‬ ‪#‎February2016Releases‬ ‪#‎LiveToWatchOfficial‬",bollywoodrare manoj bajpayees performance cannot be described one word movie about our outlook towards sexual orientation,february 2016 releases aligarh film bollywoodrare manoj bajpayees performance cannot be described one word movie about our outlook towards sexual orientation there are movies that require you be patient because waiting long queue isnt only thing this world that you require patience aligarh is perfect example such movies another addition ever growing untold biopics bollywood aligarh film story marathi professor siras who was suspended his position at aligarh muslim university amu because his sexual orientation movie follows long tiring elderly professor had undertake get justice starring manoj bajpayee rajkummar rao ashish vidyarthidirected by hansal mehta shahid city lights watching actor perform out norm is godsend grace your eyes upon thats exactly what bajpayee gives us aligarh we all know bajpayee his menacing gangster oriented flicks which he cusses kills people delivers neat dialogue process but aligarh shows us his sensitive side which you will leave you impressed there is sequence movie that focuses bajpayees character siras face entire 5 minutes those 5 minutes he goes straight faced teary eyed man transformation displayed feels damn natural character he portrays its sad see ordeals he had face enjoying company men he gets suspended power his house gets disconnected he is forced vacate his flat even doctor refuses meet him person who understands loneliness its painful see what he goes through when everyone abandons him only company he gets is form journalist deepu sebastian rajkumar rao who works first post newspaper he approaches siras because he feels he has been mistreated their relationship form lighter parts flick wherein they occasionally take jab at each other ashish vidyarthi plays role lawyer who represents siras court movie whole may seem bit slow but as i mentioned before patient viewing is required enjoy this cinematic wonder you may even tend yawn at times but its bajpayee whose dedicated take character that keeps you hooked there is one dialogue that says it all i will shift america after i have heard that life is better there people like me something along those lines watch aligarh its take sensitive topic bajpayees cannot be described word or two performance aligarhthemovie manojbajpayee rajkummarrao hansalmehta ashishvidyarthi siras aligarhmuslimuniversity february2016releases livetowatchofficial,0.5977777777777777,0.10166666666666672,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"
