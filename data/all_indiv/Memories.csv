8,Brilliant Work,"The Film is indeed one of the brilliant Indian thrillers made till date with a tinge of romance, drama and neo noir by director Jeethu Joseph (shares my birthday!) after giving all hit films ""Detective"" (2007), ""Mummy and Me"" (2010) and ""My Boss"" (2012) in his career which has shades of films like ""Windstruck"" (Korea/2004) and ""Talaash"" (2012) which scores full marks in it's original and taut screenplay (Joseph), the characters who are warm and humane, the brilliant editing by John Kutty which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the chills and thrills in some of the scenes brilliantly edited by him and the music score by Sejo John and Anil Johnson which is equally pivotal and instrumental as the editing in the film. The cinematography by Sujith Vaassudev is brilliant. The flaw in the film, lies in the melodrama, the dialogue scenes which could have been crisper and the visual effects which actually somewhere, look a bit awkward. In the performances, Mia George, Srijeeth Ravi and Vijayaraghavan are brilliant. The others are good and Prithviraj churns out yet another brilliant performance after a spate of his marvelous performances in films like ""Celluloid"" and 'Mumbai Police"", which has shades of Aamir Khan (Sarfarosh and Talaash), Shahrukh Khan (Devdas) and Abhay Deol (Dev D). Overall, director Joseph's narration maintains a good hold over his narration with a killer climax in the end, making the film a must watch.

7,A Subtle thriller,"Memories, is a noteworthy movie that comes from Jeethu Joseph who previously gave us the mediocre yet entertaining My Boss, Mummy & Me and Detective. It was quite unexpected for me that he's come up with a movie with such a gripping and entertaining plot. I mean I knew he had skills, evident from his other movies, but Memories turned out to be quite a welcome change from his recent flicks.Memories uncannily stands out among the recent hyped releases from Ranjith, Lal Jose and Samir Thahir, and with good reason. The lesser you know about Memories the better experience it'd be. Though in a nutshell, it's about a tragedy-stricken, alcoholic police officer named Sam Alex who's shoved into investigating a series of murder cases. The first half of the movie effectively portrays how much distress Sam was in and in the second act the narrative smoothly slides into the investigative mode.Its been marketed as a psychological thriller, it is definitely a thriller but hardly psychological (an exception being the main antagonist). The pacing was at its finest in Memories allocating equal time for character development and, in its second half, where it transitions into a good thriller. And among all that, there was barely a boring scene anywhere which keeps things intriguing. The second half was more akin to a true whodunnit mystery which keeps you guessing till its revelation in the finale.Despite the quasi-star-studded cast of the movie, the sole spotlight was on Prithviraj and he effortlessly handled his role of Alex. I wouldn't say its his best performance till date, thats still set aside to his performance as J C Daniel in Celluloid. Commendable performances from Vijayaraghavan, Suresh Krishna kept things flowing. Brownie points for the antagonist which I have no intention of revealing here. (Thank me! :P)Memories doesn't have the best cinematography or the finest score and the cg was silly and unnecessary but what it lacks there, it more than makes up for, in its intriguing narrative and direction. Its a promising thriller from director Jeethu Joseph which comes off as a plain thriller with no frills attached that never goes over-the-top neither does it fail to entertain you at any point. Watch this one at the big screen and before someone spoils it for you.",subtle thriller,memories is noteworthy movie that comes jeethu joseph who previously gave us mediocre yet entertaining my boss mummy me detective it was quite unexpected me that hes come up with movie with such gripping entertaining plot i mean i knew he had skills evident his other movies but memories turned out be quite welcome change his recent flicks memories uncannily stands out among recent hyped releases ranjith lal jose samir thahir with good reason lesser you know about memories better experience itd be though nutshell its about tragedy stricken alcoholic police officer named sam alex whos shoved into investigating series murder cases first half movie effectively portrays how much distress sam was second act narrative smoothly slides into investigative mode its been marketed as psychological thriller it is definitely thriller but hardly psychological exception being main antagonist pacing was at its finest memories allocating equal time character development its second half where it transitions into good thriller among all that there was barely boring scene anywhere which keeps things intriguing second half was more akin true whodunnit mystery which keeps you guessing till its revelation finale despite quasi star studded cast movie sole spotlight was prithviraj he effortlessly handled his role alex i wouldnt say its his best performance till date thats still set aside his performance as j c daniel celluloid commendable performances vijayaraghavan suresh krishna kept things flowing brownie points antagonist which i have no intention revealing here thank me p memories doesnt have best cinematography or finest score cg was silly unnecessary but what it lacks there it more than makes up its intriguing narrative direction its promising thriller director jeethu joseph which comes off as plain thriller with no frills attached that never goes over top neither does it fail entertain you at any point watch this one at big screen before someone spoils it you,0.44855952380952374,0.12029761904761903,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9,Before Ratsasan there was 'Memories'...,"Cinema is an art and this is proved yet another time by the master thriller story teller Jeethu Joseph. If I would have to make list of best serial killer movies in India then 'Memories' will definitely secure the 2nd spot only behind Ratsasan. The movie successfully gives you chills in many sequences throughout the movie. Although the ending could have been more gripping, the climax shot is quite intelligent one. In the first half one might get little bit irritated with the exessive drinking of the lead but there are lot more things in movie which will overshadow these aspects. Definitely a must watch for thriller lovers.",before ratsasan there was memories,cinema is art this is proved yet another time by master thriller story teller jeethu joseph if i would have make list best serial killer movies india then memories will definitely secure 2nd spot only behind ratsasan movie successfully gives you chills many sequences throughout movie although ending could have been more gripping climax shot is quite intelligent one first half one might get little bit irritated with exessive drinking lead but there are lot more things movie which will overshadow these aspects definitely must watch thriller lovers,0.5633333333333332,0.29638888888888887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
7,Jeethu Joseph's intense crime thriller towered by Prithviraj Sukumaran's superb performance.,"Memories (2013) : Brief Review -Jeethu Joseph's intense crime thriller towered by Prithviraj Sukumaran's superb performance. There have been many crime thrillers revolving around a serial killer who is set to seek a revenge for something bad happened to him in the past and it's quit watchable too. If you know how to watch a thriller set in this zone without expecting anything intellectual then Memories is a fine watch for you. Yeah, but to be frank it definitely lacks the powerful statements in the climax, such as we have seen in Korean thriller 'Memories of Murder' or for much known reference take Jeethu Joseph's own Masterpiece 'Drishyam' for instance. Memories becomes predictable by the end, anyone who have seen at least 10 crime thrillers (not 100+ i mean) would easily predict that the killer is gonna be killed while finishing up his last job and then there's The End to it. Yes, if that's enough then Memories should be considered a great thriller. Sam Alex, a drunkard ex-cop, is forced to investigate a series of murders which are committed in the same pattern. His search leads to a serial killer, and something more than what he expected. The entire narrative is intense and gripping, there are no light moments and there is no philosophy. However, there is a biblical reference used, which surely makes this revenge very interesting. Apart from that the best thing about the film is superb performance of Prithviraj Sukumaran. I don't say, he nailed it but he has done more than enough with that uninteresting character. The next and last best thing is Jeethu Joseph's direction. I still feel it could have been better because his Drishyam has set the bar very high and it is very difficult to match the same level every time and we have to understand that. Anyways, Memories is fabulous thriller overall but to be honest, we have better ones in Indian Cinem. So, it's not a must watch kind of stuff but certainly gripping enough for one time viewing.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",jeethu josephs intense crime thriller towered by prithviraj sukumarans superb performance,memories 2013 brief review jeethu josephs intense crime thriller towered by prithviraj sukumarans superb performance there have been many crime thrillers revolving around serial killer who is set seek revenge something bad happened him past its quit watchable too if you know how watch thriller set this zone without expecting anything intellectual then memories is fine watch you yeah but be frank it definitely lacks powerful statements climax such as we have seen korean thriller memories murder or much known reference take jeethu josephs own masterpiece drishyam instance memories becomes predictable by end anyone who have seen at least 10 crime thrillers not 100 i mean would easily predict that killer is gonna be killed while finishing up his last job then theres end it yes if thats enough then memories should be considered great thriller sam alex drunkard ex cop is forced investigate series murders which are committed same pattern his search leads serial killer something more than what he expected entire narrative is intense gripping there are no light moments there is no philosophy however there is biblical reference used which surely makes this revenge very interesting apart that best thing about film is superb performance prithviraj sukumaran i dont say he nailed it but he has done more than enough with that uninteresting character next last best thing is jeethu josephs direction i still feel it could have been better because his drishyam has set bar very high it is very difficult match same level every time we have understand that anyways memories is fabulous thriller overall but be honest we have better ones indian cinem so its not must watch kind stuff but certainly gripping enough one time viewing rating 7 10 by,0.5778442265795206,0.2332450980392157,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,Yet another Good Thriller from Prithviraj,"Memories _ My ReviewFinally watched the movie #Memories starring #Prithviraj , directed by #Jeethu_Joseph...When Prithvi and Jeethu, the actor and director with consecutive hit films, joined for a new venture, the expectations were already high and when the resultant movie too opened to highly positive response, naturally I was dying to watch it...I never expected that I could watch it in a theater.... First of all, thanks to the managers of Seema theatre, Pathanapuram for making me watch this flick...Coming to the film.... As I expected, Memories is really an excellent work, which can be sorted into the list of the best movies released this year....Sam Alex, who was one of the most efficient police officers, becomes a full time drunkard after the death of his wife and daughter...but his senior officer, who wants to make him right, asks Sam Alew to investigate a sensational case....The first half of Memories is filled with the memories of Sam Alex and him getting into the case, while the latter half is racy with intelligent sequences...First of all, I have to mention #Prithviraj for his excellent characterization as #SamAlex... I cannot imagine anyother actor except, Prithvi in this role.... He excelled as Drunkard.... Those mannerisms of him as a drunkard investigating and finding clues were really interesting and seemed novel to me... A diametrically opposite character from Antony Moses.... Prithvi is the man, on whose shoulders, Memories lies.... There was naturality in every scene and makes the viewer involve into the character.... The emotions of a sad man and sharpness of an intelligent cop were portaryed well by Prithvi...The next is... #Jeethu_Joseph.... The man who made Memores and Sam Alex... He wrote and directed the movie aptly without unnecessary sequences..... He directed the movie very well...those rescue operation scenes in the start and end were superb..... There was a kind of freshness in each and every scene... He has done the script of the movie too in a much interesting manner, filled with memories and findings... Those finding of clues, assumptions etc made by Sam Alex were really interesting.....kudos to Jeethu for that...There was no lag at any time and Jeethu managed to make Memories a complete thriller.....The reason behind killing the victims and the kind of killing etc, seemed to be new and refreshing....Bringing in certain elements of Christianity into the crime is really interesting....Climax, even though predictable to some context, managed to be a thrilling one, with intelligent sequences...During the chase sequence b/w Sam Alex and the killer, two men sitting near me laughed....fools, they never realise that, a full time drunkard, who is already drunk, cannot run much in the rain...Camera work of the movie is really an appreciable one.... Action sequences were also sleek... Mafia Sasi...u rock man...Coming to the musical section... there are two songs and both are worth hearing and are well picturised... The BGM was just good....even though it is matching the mood of the film, it could've been made much more impactive....The idea of placing graphics in between some scenes was very good.....The rest of the cast including Vijaya Raghavan, Vanitha, Mia, Meghna.....etc too done their parts well,. Finally, Rahul Madhav got a good film...he was also good...was matching the role as Prithvi's brotherEven though, Jeethu managed to make Memories a perfect thriller, there was no explanation for how an individual alone could commit such crimes, mainly hanging the victims in such heights......he should've made an explanation for that... Excluding that, there is nothing to be categorized as negative in the movie.....In the whole, #Memories is an excellent family thriller, blended with all elements of family, emotions and thrill....My rating: 8/10 ......EXCELLENT....... One of the best movies of 2013......don't miss it... Memories Never Die.....Thanks for reading ma review.....Any mistakes should be forgiven....",yet another good thriller prithviraj,memories my reviewfinally watched movie starring directed by when prithvi jeethu actor director with consecutive hit films joined new venture expectations were already high when resultant movie too opened highly positive response naturally i was dying watch it i never expected that i could watch it theater first all thanks managers seema theatre pathanapuram making me watch this flick coming film as i expected memories is really excellent work which can be sorted into list best movies released this year sam alex who was one most efficient police officers becomes full time drunkard after death his wife daughter but his senior officer who wants make him right asks sam alew investigate sensational case first half memories is filled with memories sam alex him getting into case while latter half is racy with intelligent sequences first all i have mention his excellent characterization as i cannot imagine anyother actor except prithvi this role he excelled as drunkard those mannerisms him as drunkard investigating finding clues were really interesting seemed novel me diametrically opposite character antony moses prithvi is man whose shoulders memories lies there was naturality every scene makes viewer involve into character emotions sad man sharpness intelligent cop were portaryed well by prithvi next is man who made memores sam alex he wrote directed movie aptly without unnecessary sequences he directed movie very well those rescue operation scenes start end were superb there was kind freshness each every scene he has done script movie too much interesting manner filled with memories findings those finding clues assumptions etc made by sam alex were really interesting kudos jeethu that there was no lag at any time jeethu managed make memories complete thriller reason behind killing victims kind killing etc seemed be new refreshing bringing certain elements christianity into crime is really interesting climax even though predictable some context managed be thrilling one with intelligent sequences during chase sequence b w sam alex killer two men sitting near me laughed fools they never realise that full time drunkard who is already drunk cannot run much rain camera work movie is really appreciable one action sequences were also sleek mafia sasi u rock man coming musical section there are two songs both are worth hearing are well picturised bgm was just good even though it is matching mood film it couldve been made much more impactive idea placing graphics between some scenes was very good rest cast including vijaya raghavan vanitha mia meghna etc too done their parts well finally rahul madhav got good film he was also good was matching role as prithvis brothereven though jeethu managed make memories perfect thriller there was no explanation how individual alone could commit such crimes mainly hanging victims such heights he shouldve made explanation that excluding that there is nothing be categorized as negative movie whole is excellent family thriller blended with all elements family emotions thrill my rating 8 10 excellent one best movies 2013 dont miss it memories never die thanks reading ma review any mistakes should be forgiven,0.5413016663701594,0.32904109589041086,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"

7,Glibly! But Let Us Appreciate The Effort! â¦ 69%,"If you are an avid movie aficionado, then you would realize how ""Memories"" loosely relates to some of the Hollywood & Bollywood mysteries. But apart from that, it was real pleasure to watch Prithviraj as the protagonist of the film, which ended quite disastrously.Jeethu Joseph is known to remake films (e.g.: My Boss). Memories is faintly like that, but if you ask me questions, I'm gonna babble. Cutting to the story, it talks about how a policeman comes out of blues to investigate serial killings. His intentions are plain as white. Vijay Raghavan & Suresh Krishna are great and together with the lead character, they manage to pull off some humor, drama, thriller & of course, suspense.The first 20 minutes is establishment period. Next 90 minutes are pure pieces of top-notch thriller, although borrowed from few classics/flops (e.g. Dhoom 2, Grand-master). As he achieves breakthrough, the killer's intentions are unfolded & that is what makes it more interesting. The melodrama involved in the climax sequence is typical Malayalam clichÃ© and was totally unnecessary, which should mean it drags to 2 hours 20 minutes.But, alas! there is one big plot-hole about the killer on how he goes on to become what he actually is. Also, the makers fail to mention few points in the first half. Cinematography is stupendous, so are the music, songs, direction & rendering. Thank goodness there's no superhero machismo here & that further helps.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended! Just because it is a glib doesn't mean it is a bad thriller. Had the climax been justified, I'd have rated it a pure 8. But this is 6.9/10. Probably a good film of 2013.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

8,Flawless? Far from it but a perfect Moody thriller,Memories talk about both protagonist and antagonist having haunting past which led to who they're now today. First half film beautifully depicts Sam alex(Prithviraj) routine life and his past and his first case after hiatus which ends with cleverly executed climax. It has its flaws few loopholes however rest of its department compensates big time. Second half is more of a thriller and it lived upto it's genre. Acting wise Prithvi was top notch excelled in both investigating and emotional roles. Other supporting actors were good too. Music placed perfectly and fits the mood. Bgm was excessive at the same time effective and added required tension throughout. Pace of the film was really good never felt yawning. Cinematography and colour shading they chosen were on par with many branded thrillers. Night chase shot was the highlight which shows the director's great vision and sujith vassudev's caliber. Editing was perfect and had a fairly engaging running time. If you're looking for a engaging thriller then go for it to say the least won't be disappointed. Almost a perfect moody thriller that you can watch alone in evening time with a rainy chilling ambience.

7,Angels and Demons Malayalam Version,"I had not seen this movie till DVD reached the stores. I saw this movie because all were hailing this is absolutely new theme and not copied from any movie. I loved the opening sequence and the theme music superbly done and executed , the frames had similarity to some PC games but well executed. The movie also starts exceptionally good. Prithviraj did justice to the character but the role of Mia was not actually required at all. I could easily predict the climax as it was associated to women and their husbands, wherein Sam Alex's brother's marriage or the fiancÃ©e is not shown at all. The hangings and execution were almost similar to Angels and Demons where the public hangings and message written in old language. Even the places where they are left forms a cross type format and this is also taken from Dan Brown's Angels And Demons. Except for the villain everything else is shown in such a way that we are able to co relate to the Dan Brown's novel. The Direction part is done well. I wrote this review just to bring into movie lover's notice that there are lots of INSPIRED(as they like to call now) portions from Dan Brown's Angels And Demons.",angels demons malayalam version,i had not seen this movie till dvd reached stores i saw this movie because all were hailing this is absolutely new theme not copied any movie i loved opening sequence theme music superbly done executed frames had similarity some pc games but well executed movie also starts exceptionally good prithviraj did justice character but role mia was not actually required at all i could easily predict climax as it was associated women their husbands wherein sam alexs brothers marriage or fianc e is not shown at all hangings execution were almost similar angels demons where public hangings message written old language even places where they are left forms cross type format this is also taken dan browns angels demons except villain everything else is shown such way that we are able co relate dan browns novel direction part is done well i wrote this review just bring into movie lovers notice that there are lots inspired as they like call now portions dan browns angels demons,0.4291958041958042,0.2745920745920746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5,I did NOT like this movie,"This is not a great movie. I can't even say that it's got its moments because it doesn't. I've felt this about Jeethu Joseph movies that the first half is more often than not a terrible drag. But it is forgivable in movies like Drishyam where the first part is used to strongly establish the lead character and the plot. It is also a pleasure when the movie takes a sudden turn from being nothing into a deep and dark thriller that makes you hold your breath till the very end. But Memories does not do that. It is clichÃ©d and boring. Prithviraj tries to pull off the role of an efficient police officer who has been salvaged from his wrecked life by a senior officer who assigns him an intriguing case. The whole attempt to garner sympathy for the lead role who is trying to drink himself to death falls so flat on its face that the viewer is left a bit annoyed at the depressed protagonist. Prithviraj who usually does police officer roles with finesse (Ah, Mumbai Police!) is not believable as an irresponsible drunkard who can magically turn himself into a Sherlock Holmes-esque investigator with almost super human instincts and intelligence. After sitting through what seems like hours of the actor alternating between being an irresponsible brat and a brilliant policeman, the killer is revealed to be an absolute nobody - but oh, not without the abused clichÃ©s of a dark past and a physical handicap. Now the movie has to fill its viewers up on why he is an absolute psychopath. More characters and plot points are introduced and the end is a desperate attempt to sew all these up in one sensible piece without the viewer going crazy. The only take-away from the movies is the skill of shooting someone in a gasoline-filled room without blowing oneself up. Just watch that scene, skip the rest.",i did not like this movie,this is not great movie i cant even say that its got its moments because it doesnt ive felt this about jeethu joseph movies that first half is more often than not terrible drag but it is forgivable movies like drishyam where first part is used strongly establish lead character plot it is also pleasure when movie takes sudden turn being nothing into deep dark thriller that makes you hold your breath till very end but memories does not do that it is clich d boring prithviraj tries pull off role efficient police officer who has been salvaged his wrecked life by senior officer who assigns him intriguing case whole attempt garner sympathy lead role who is trying drink himself death falls so flat its face that viewer is left bit annoyed at depressed protagonist prithviraj who usually does police officer roles with finesse ah mumbai police is not believable as irresponsible drunkard who can magically turn himself into sherlock holmes esque investigator with almost super human instincts intelligence after sitting through what seems like hours actor alternating between being irresponsible brat brilliant policeman killer is revealed be absolute nobody but oh not without abused clich s dark past physical handicap now movie has fill its viewers up why he is absolute psychopath more characters plot points are introduced end is desperate attempt sew all these up one sensible piece without viewer going crazy only take away movies is skill shooting someone gasoline filled room without blowing oneself up just watch that scene skip rest,0.5434863945578231,0.034999999999999996,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,Gripping! Tense! Emotional!,"What a masterclass from Jeethu Joseph! Absolutely stunning thriller! I'm just dumbfounded by the fact that I've been praising Western movies & decent Bollywood movies so much that I was insulated from the real genius much closer to home. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie and my heart kept racing. The way this movie keeps you guessing the identity of the killer is spectacular. The screenplay is the real hero here while Prithviraj Sukumaran is just the medium. He is lovable too but the writers are kings. I really enjoy the realism in these movies - the setup, the make-up, the surroundings etc. High praise all over, totally loved it.
