10.0,Fantastic,"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.",fantastic,be kind especially when you dont know whats going if only we could recognize that those who combat us life do so out hidden pain fight them with kindness if only we could accept our kids who they are say supportive things heart instead trying mold them if only we could be content with life we have set aside idea countless other lives we might have led had we made different decisions along way if only we could see that flipside life being meaningless everything ultimately being sucked into abyss is freedom that comes that that we can do anything with time weve got like first word its title this film feels like everything while watching it i thought stephanie hsu was everything too but then again so was michelle yeoh jamie lee curtis homage wong kar wai with ke huy quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary fact that james hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful i also loved how both mother daughter troubled as they were with their upbringing each found comfort kind patient partner tallie medels character was nice touch film threatens go off rails with its madcap multiverse hopping first part but its all setup second part which is incredibly powerful it was impressive that it managed be so entertaining along way with its fast paced action wild ride it takes us its one that rewards rewatch as its full little details references just great film lots fun heart,0.7204545454545455,0.22436868686868686,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,The most original film ever made. Period.,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.",most original film ever made period,everything everywhere all at once is even crazier than trailer would lead one believe its bursting with so many original weird concepts ideas that no serious storyteller their right mind would ever dare put their movie but daniels did it works with spectacularly effective results these filmmakers choose not only put every bizarre idea they could think into their movie but they ensure that every oddity adds something thought provoking emotionally resonant themes that pervade story so many angles can be explored surrounding this story emotional connection things that distract it as evelyn connects with her alternate selves alternate relatives there is both envy pity toward them that is explored its such cathartic experience watch this woman discover what she truly wants life loves about her life all beautiful themes heartwarming character moments are just tip iceberg here though this is one funniest movies i have ever seen daniels lean into absurdity world that they have created always reaching most outlandish possibilities never playing it safe it makes some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind it makes most unique viewing experience i have ever had my life this is masterpiece originality there is not nor will there ever be film quite like this one i cannot wait watch it again again again,0.5630952380952381,0.2610952380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,Felt Like I Was Seeing the Inside of My Own Mind on Screen,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).Grade: A.",felt like i was seeing inside my own mind screen,i have trouble turning off my brain anxieties worries mundane dos even positive things sometimes feel like theyre swirling around chaotic funnel cloud i would like nothing more than sit physical mental silence everything everywhere all at once felt like inside my head world non stop 24 7 news most it bad how is person like me who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly all other things that are just out there happening general over which i have no control supposed cope one answer is decide that nothing matters anyway give up caring but that means deciding that my wife doesnt matter that my kids dont matter that art nature things that bring joy my life dont matter another way is decide that some things ok maybe most things dont matter but that there are things that do those are things that make it all worth it i get decide what those things are first approach is nihilistic second approach is empowering this film explores both approaches i was sobbing mess at end i will say there were times that i was bit exhausted by this movie it throws lot screen at viewer occasionally it cant keep up with its ambitions but this was mostly home run michell yeoh does terrific work this but mvp is ke huy quan short round indiana jones movies grade,0.393460705960706,0.0984848484848485,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!,"Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year!

9.0,What a perfect title for this movie.,"It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.",what perfect title this movie,it was everything everywhere all at once sometimes too many things too many places at once you can get lost but it helps focus things obviously amazing michelle yeoh is one thing focus whole reason i myself came see this flick first place much as this movie gives you absorb it was easy keep my eyes beautiful yeoh oh kid indiana jones temple doom is this flick hes older odiously but he still sounds like kid form goonies how lucky he was he got play yeohs baby daddy this joint last definitely not least it was good see james wong this film you could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments assure 90 something year old actor can do role but thats what you do when you have legends do your flick speaking legends almost forgot about jamie lee curtis who seem like she was having fun her role fact that this movie is about multiverse i low key was expecting multiverse connection between who yeoh plays this movie her character shang shi that would have been cool its interesting that this like third movie that came out march thats about mommy daughter relationship between asian women whats even more interesting is how they go order turning red is about 13 year old her mom umma is about 18 year old her mom girl playing yeohs daughter looks like shes possibly her early 20s dont know when this became hot plot movies but i will admit i prefer how story lays out here but only because i relate more asian woman her 20s over middle schooler music this film is great movie was filmed context that story is about laundromat owner her mid life dealing with where she came where shes going but music actually fits perfectly into ideal this woman being key saving multiverse it made lot entertainment just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like im watching dune contradicting image yeoh being worn out blue collar mom spectacular i say its good its all over place it can be handle process but it has good cast concentrate,0.496875,0.30798611111111107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,"Don't do drugs, watch this instead.","If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.",dont do drugs watch this instead,if you take drugs first time imagined jackie chan was female dr strange another universe this would be it synopsis is basically asian woman trying do her taxes i thought third act movie felt little stretched out but otherwise i think its best movie ive seen all year because i havent laughed this much any recent one short time i spent china its also accurate hilarious view chinese parents cause they really do be like that i cant recommend it enough its so chaotic middle all that managed be heartfelt too i thought it was gonna be dr strange wannabe but its unique its own im glad it was released earlier so that people dont compare them it was just four people strangers cinema we were laughing our asses off it made me sad because everyone deserves see this at time when remakes reboots are common place its nice have something like this breath fresh air,0.4304597701149426,0.15129310344827587,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Near Flawless Film,"Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.",near flawless film,rarely does movie hit me hard i go along ride every moment has spectacle it even simplicity having your taxes done often silly mostly confusing but entirely entertaining it was great see short round back big screen with very glamoured down michelle yeoh as married couple brink fracturing family unit story is evelyn woman who has never really committed much life she has many interest but many where she isnt fully invested this case her family lives above laundromat that is failing they are being audited but yet she has big dreams expand her enterprise her husband fore mentioned ke huy quan waymond is kindly follower believer his wife who seems focus more bad than good pessimist if we are be formal it is chinese new year many people are invited celebrate with this family including grand father who is labeled as man set his ways wouldnt understand same sex relationship his grandaughter joy stephanie hsu what follows is grand adventure first at irs building all places eventually distant alternate universes which shows her way her life may have gone had certain things didnt take place i absolutely loved fact that jamie lee curtis plays uptight auditor who seems perfectly fine core universe which all revolve around evelyn other hand taps into her other universes gather skills needed fight fracture timelines that sneak into her mundane life yes there is message here be honest it nearly derails film itself but it was required tie meaning everything that is going that we are made experiences every universe that exists out there if you believe metaphysics that they road you didnt take through gained experiences with some that even was more enticing then present one means we would never have known our other lives children wouldnt be born love would be lost relationships move it is grand question whether or not if we got glimpse that road we didnt take would it all mean anything this case i say it almost derails because universes effect one another this story it even bridges them which some may feel like cheat however fact that i even ask this question makes it vastly interesting story that is you decide movie is exciting vibrant energetic feels absolutely unique it allows viewer slowly tie ends together perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead but doesnt let you lose yourself too much what it isnt is boring it is captivating fresh look who can hate scene people being beaten with rubber phalluses that said it is one most interesting movies 2022 hopefully stays minds awards future because it deserves bigger audience these are types fun philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need i go back ke huy quan this guy can do funny also bring tug your heart so easily its so hard imagine him as little boy indiana jones temple doom because here he shows so much range his natural charm is shown through his love evelyn he seems be suffering through fracture himself he plays many roles here as well because many universes life theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant run into regardless choices thats very romanticized view universe kudos daniels their talent joy cinema it would not surprise me if they helm larger film future perhaps they can re vamp comic book franchise into something much more unique thank you this movie,0.4862384473991617,0.18377095787810072,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"

9.0,"With its strong storyline and amazing parallel universes, this sci fi movie sets a new bar for sci fi","Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline.

10.0,The best movie of the 2020s so far,"Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was ""a woman tries to do her taxes,"" and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far.

9.0,Most accurate title ever,"This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories.

People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes.

8.0,Bonkers!,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as ""Daniels"", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.That's just about the end of the ""normal"" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel""), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as ""Big Nose"", a regular customer at the laundromat.As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8, 2022.",bonkers,greetings again darkness its bonkers i tell ya co writers co directors daniel kwan daniel scheinert known collectively by their choice as daniels follow up their farting corpse movie swiss army man 2016 with one that is somehow more bizarre more audacious more fun its one most innovative films ive seen while although i can point out influences ive yet come up with movie comparison that seems just or fair every small business owner can relate stress evelyn wang michelle yeoh is under as she attempts organize her documents preparation irs audit laundromat she owns with her husband waymond wang ke huy quan as if thats not enough her father is scheduled arrive same day she knows gong gong james hong is disappointed his daughter husband life she chose while being crushed with those two events evelyns strained relationship with her daughter joy stephanie hsu continues fracture as evelyn wants keep joys girlfriend status with becky tallie medel secret dear old conservative dad grandfather thats just about end normal part story other than waymond has had divorce papers prepared not purpose ending marriage but with hope that threat might force evelyn have real conversation with him about their relationship things start get weird even before they head irs meeting with agent played with gusto by jamie lee curtis but while there we get our first real taste fantastical trip we evelyn are about take course i cant really offer any description action that occurs but nothing is spoiled if i tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions universes attempt save world while doing this they mix some acrobatic martial arts that would make jackie chan envious its rare film where frenetic pace dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences fanny pack trophies with unfortunate shape blue tooth type devices all play unusual roles here this film challenges everyone actors directors editors fight coordinators youll likely recognize evelyns husband as grown up version child actor who played short round indiana jones temple doom 1984 daughter joy is portrayed by stephanie hsu contributor marvelous mrs maisel who gets cover just about widest range character weve likely ever seen screen estimable james hong is riot as gong gong mr hong is now 93 years old with incredible canon 450 credits his 8 decades work his presence is quite crucial film it should also be noted that as we would expect jenny slate shines her brief role as big nose regular customer at laundromat as terrific as cast is this is really chance michelle yeoh bring her full arsenal role evelyn shes angry frustrated scared courageous even adds her comic timing ms yeoh flashes her crouching tiger hidden dragon fighting skills while also brining regal presence film that requires strong core its no mystery that family love can solve many worlds issues daniels have delivered wild ride that defies simple description its long one at 139 minutes but youll thank me later not saying much more than its bonkers opens select markets march 25 april 1 2022 nationwide april 8 2022,0.46528998778998776,0.13486111111111107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"

But can someone please explain why movies these days feel like they need to be so damn long? Seriously, this could have been 100 minutes, easily. It's way too indulgent. Scenes drag on and on and when they're over you're still no further to any semblance of plot clarity than you were 10 minutes earlier. It seems like they shot tonnes of footage and just wanted to include it all, without really embellishing the actual story. If the movie was more succinct and arrived more quickly at the overall point of the narrative, that being her connection with her daughter, I would have liked it a lot more.I just really don't understand why producers and writers are electing their films to be these immense lengths these days when they really don't need to be. No Way Home, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, Drive My Car, all over 2 hours for no good reason.I really felt the length of this movie was to the detriment of the overall narrative and it disallowed me appreciating what the message was meant to be.That being said, the direction and editing was cool, acting was strong and the scene at the end with the daughter really did hit all the right notes.

5.0,Two movies in one... but only one is worth watching,"Underneath all the chaos of this movie lies a lovely story about not being so caught up in ""the business of life"" that you miss the beauty of life, the personal connections, and the positive (even if sometimes small) impact or negative repercussions of the decisions you've made. Each individual decision has the potential to branch out into a myriad of paths, and I think Evelyn finally learns to appreciate the positive aspects of her decisions and their resulting paths, and realizes that few paths are without merit and no path is perfect.However, this lovely story gets lost in a a ridiculous over-exaggeration of chaos that, if toned down and purged of the stupid ""potty humor"" could have been a real positive. Beatings by huge dildos and universe jumping via butt plugs cheapened the sci-fi aspects of the movie and distracted from what could have been a great film. Too many long fight scenes made for boring stretches, the hot dog fingers stuff could have been funny (and point taken regarding the skills development of other body parts) if not overdone, and the bagel thing was just... dumb. The overused ""I can't accept my child being gay"" intro that turns into parental acceptance at the end of the movie seems to be a requisite storyline these days, and is becoming a real eye roller. ""Again???"" I appreciated the variety of ""Evelyn"" characters and they way the skills of each were integrated into the new Evelyn. Who knew sign twirling was such a useful skill? :-)Though the acting was excellent for the Evelyn character (Michelle Yeoh) and her family members (Ke Huy Quan, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong), the part of IRS agent (Jamie Lee Curtis) was played way too over the top.
