8.0,Ranbir's stellar performance nearly makes up for the movie's flaws,"Even if you ignore his surname for a moment, Ranbir Kapoor is arguably one of the most naturally talented actors in today's Bollywood. In addition to this, his good looks ensure female fan following, read: rake in more moolah. His 'Rockstar' may have just been his most intense and splendid performance till date. 'Rockstar' begins at a concert in Rome and someone scuffling with ruffians. It is soon revealed that the 'someone' is Jordan, a major rockstar, labeled a bad-boy by the media and someone who hardly smiles. Cut to his college days, there's the simple Janardan Jahkar or JJ strumming his guitar and singing for the local audience and his days in the college canteen gorging samosas and idolizing Jim Morrison.When his well-wisher and canteen manager Katana, played impressively by Kumud Mishra tells him that a true artist needs to be driven by hurt and anguish, JJ curses his simple and incident-free life. Just to get his heart broken, he chases the college bombshell, Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri). Eventually, it turns out that under the prim and proper exterior Heer is thrill-seeker and the two become wild friends. What begins as a fun-filled friendship takes different shades as the time passes. On one hand, Heer drowns into depression without our hero, whom she re-christens as 'Jordan'. And, Jordan's yearning for her company brings out the performer in him.In what is probably the best portrayal of what goes on in a creative head, the story brings depth and makes its audience feel for JJ. Despite the negative publicity he gets as Jordan, he's a simple guy who yearns for love. Noticeably, it is only after his tryst with Heer that his motive in life changes from chasing success to something else. During the process, success merely becomes a byproduct he is least interested in. Director Imtiaz Ali plays around with the story's chronology. It is likely that the editors too may have actually lost track in between. Repeated scenes, songs and too much of flash-back or forth gets annoying after a point. The restlessness among the audience was very apparent as the movie seemed to go on forever. Talking of performances, Ranbir surely has a line of awards waiting for him. Nargis Fakhri, the American with Pakistani antecedents who plays the leading lady is truly beautiful and has been a Kingfisher calendar girl; but not as gifted with acting skills. The film also marks Shammi Kapoor's last screen appearance as he plays an Ustaad who recognizes JJ's talent. Aditi Rao Hydari plays a small role as a Journalist.AR Rahman's music is integral to the story and songs have already become runaway hits. 'Sadda Haq', 'Kun Faya Kun', 'Jo Bhi Main', with Mohit Chauhan as the Rockstar's voice and 'Katiya Karun' give the album an eclectic blend of rock, desi flavor and Sufi mysticism. Again, some more awards are in the waiting here.Cinematography too is well done, especially the jerky shots and quirky angles that capture the actors' emotions effectively. Be it the by lanes of Delhi, picturesque Europe or Breathtaking beautiful Kashmir winter, the excellence with the camera is undeniable. The realistic costumes complement the camera work. The dialog is very smart and the first half evokes laughter and stands up ably as things turn serious in the second half. You may blame the script for some of its flaws, but asking for perfection when portraying emotions and out of the ordinary relationships is a monumental challenge. So, to say, it's a job moderately well done.So, should you be watching this movie? The answer is a resounding 'Yes'! Granted, the story gets a little lost in the second half, but the rest of the goodies will make you overlook its flaws. The movie is powerful enough to keep you thinking much after you are out of the movie hall.

10.0,Excellent piece of work,"Jordan is sitting among prostitutes and strumming his guitar as they sing together -- when his manager pulls him out onto the street. Soon, a crowd engulfs them and starts chanting Jordan's name, their voices drowning the sound of the manager pleading with the musician to get his act together. ""This is what I have always wanted,"" Jordan says, looking at his screaming fans. ""But I am not happy inside.""Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar is a bittersweet journey of a man, an artist, from being an everyman to a superstar. But while Ali uncovers layers off Jordan the iconic musician -- each layer as fascinating as it is intriguing -- he keeps the core of the character, Janardhan Jakkad, alive. He hurts like anybody else, falls in love like anybody else, and also has to deal with moments of sheer frustration.And all of it finds release in music. Music is Jordan's identity; it's what makes him rich and famous. But to Jordan, that's incidental. In the end, his artistry is what connects him with himself. For a Hindi film viewer, that is a fascinating story to watch unfold.Then there's the opening shot, a tribute to India's original Rockstar, Shammi Kapoor. From there on, it's a tumultuous ride – one with its highs and lows, one that has anguish as also love, one that has pain, but also a sense of fulfillment. And a brilliant finale -- not a conventional one, but effective nonetheless -- which leaves you feeling like the characters themselves: incomplete but content, like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting more.The music itself is a delight. Each AR Rahman number is lilting, and woven beautifully in the story, the high frequency of songs not hindering the storytelling but enhancing the experience. Lyricist Irshad Kamil does an outstanding job, penning words that reflect the lead character's state of mind and complement situations aptly.Imtiaz Ali, in trademark fashion though, isn't content with Focussing on the complexities of a troubled musician; he gives us a dose of romance too, and a generous one at that. Estrangement from family, lack of fulfillment in life, and self-discovery apart, what really drives Jordan's music is his relationship with Heer (Fakhri, beautiful but awkward). Volatile as the affair is, it's also what keeps Jordan sane, and Heer alive.For about 15 minutes in Rockstar, the narrative tends to resort to 'Bollywoodism'; true love having the power to cure a terminal illness (almost), for example, doesn't exactly fit with what the rest of the film has to say. The story tends to meander a bit post-interval, but Imtiaz makes it work eventually, interweaving the fantastical romantic part of the film with the more gritty, dark bits deftly. In the end, how much you enjoy Rockstar will largely depend on whether the balance between the tale of a broken, discontented musician and the more conventional love story works for you.It did for me -- though I would have preferred the former -- but you can't deny Imtiaz credit for his mastery over the romance genre. No contemporary filmmaker has dealt with man-woman relationships with as much dexterity. His films often tread a similar path (the lovers are usually confused, meet at different points in life, and there's always the 'other man'), but his fresh approach to each story is what makes them immensely watchable.With Rockstar, Imtiaz goes beyond his own tried-and-tested format, his ambition to narrating a more complex story coming through. This is probably his most personal film, and his honesty as filmmaker is hard not to be affected by. Hopefully, he goes the whole hog next, ditching the genre he's adept at to trying his hand at something entirely out of his comfort zone. Rockstar is also Imtiaz's most technically polished film, and he benefits from the association with cinematographer Anil Mehta and editor Aarti Bajaj.Ranbir Kapoor has been Hindi cinema's Next Big Thing for a while now. With Rockstar, he lives up to the hopes pinned on him to deliver big. Ranbir revels in Jordan's complexities; another actor may have found it to be an obstacle. The character arc undergoes constant transformation and he adapts suitably. It wouldn't be an understatement to say that Ranbir's portrayal of Jordan may go down as one of Hindi cinema's most accomplished performances by a lead actor. Just to see him work his magic on screen, Rockstar is worth a watch.But while good acting is always an incentive, it's a director's vision that makes a film truly watchable, and Imtiaz makes Rockstar stand out from what the mainstream churns out every week. And brings back the one aspect sorely missing from Hindi films lately -- music.",excellent piece work,jordan is sitting among prostitutes strumming his guitar as they sing together when his manager pulls him out onto street soon crowd engulfs them starts chanting jordans name their voices drowning sound manager pleading with musician get his act together this is what i have always wanted jordan says looking at his screaming fans but i am not happy inside imtiaz alis rockstar is bittersweet journey man artist being everyman superstar but while ali uncovers layers off jordan iconic musician each layer as fascinating as it is intriguing he keeps core character janardhan jakkad alive he hurts like anybody else falls love like anybody else also has deal with moments sheer frustration all it finds release music music is jordans identity its what makes him rich famous but jordan thats incidental end his artistry is what connects him with himself hindi film viewer that is fascinating story watch unfold then theres opening shot tribute indias original rockstar shammi kapoor there its tumultuous ride one with its highs lows one that has anguish as also love one that has pain but also sense fulfillment brilliant finale not conventional one but effective nonetheless which leaves you feeling like characters themselves incomplete but content like effective crescendo that leaves you wanting more music itself is delight each ar rahman number is lilting woven beautifully story high frequency songs not hindering storytelling but enhancing experience lyricist irshad kamil does outstanding job penning words that reflect lead characters state mind complement situations aptly imtiaz ali trademark fashion though isnt content with focussing complexities troubled musician he gives us dose romance too generous one at that estrangement family lack fulfillment life self discovery apart what really drives jordans music is his relationship with heer fakhri beautiful but awkward volatile as affair is its also what keeps jordan sane heer alive about 15 minutes rockstar narrative tends resort bollywoodism true love having power cure terminal illness almost example doesnt exactly fit with what rest film has say story tends meander bit post interval but imtiaz makes it work eventually interweaving fantastical romantic part film with more gritty dark bits deftly end how much you enjoy rockstar will largely depend whether balance between tale broken discontented musician more conventional love story works you it did me though i would have preferred former but you cant deny imtiaz credit his mastery over romance genre no contemporary filmmaker has dealt with man woman relationships with as much dexterity his films often tread similar path lovers are usually confused meet at different points life theres always other man but his fresh approach each story is what makes them immensely watchable with rockstar imtiaz goes beyond his own tried tested format his ambition narrating more complex story coming through this is probably his most personal film his honesty as filmmaker is hard not be affected by hopefully he goes whole hog next ditching genre hes adept at trying his hand at something entirely out his comfort zone rockstar is also imtiazs most technically polished film he benefits association with cinematographer anil mehta editor aarti bajaj ranbir kapoor has been hindi cinemas next big thing while now with rockstar he lives up hopes pinned him deliver big ranbir revels jordans complexities another actor may have found it be obstacle character arc undergoes constant transformation he adapts suitably it wouldnt be understatement say that ranbirs portrayal jordan may go down as one hindi cinemas most accomplished performances by lead actor just see him work his magic screen rockstar is worth watch but while good acting is always incentive its directors vision that makes film truly watchable imtiaz makes rockstar stand out what mainstream churns out every week brings back one aspect sorely missing hindi films lately music,0.5397267430178821,0.22971267832027317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,A New Star Is Born - RockStar,"First of all, Rockstar is not a mere love story, for those people I saw drawing conclusion that this is just an extramarital affair which is justified by Imtiaz Ali, it's much more than that.When the character of protagonist was getting built, it was told to him that it would be pain that would get the star out of him; movie is journey of making of a Rock star who goes through pain of separation, depravity from society which makes him someone he was never meant to be but finally a Rockstar. A true blue eyed boy who was always away from any sense of pain in his life until he falls in love and tore apart life of his and love of his life Heer.I am although not a big Rock music fan but got food for thought for those posthumous rock stars that lost their lives to depression and drugs. This film gives gray shades of their tainted life which is always open to so much of public scrutiny which perhaps helped me to recon with their hysterical behavior.It starts with a young lad trying to make big in music but who doesn't have soul to sell himself as a serious artist. He has shown a way through love and betrayal and he fancies his chances with the most admired girl of the town, little does he know that this would embark an endless journey of pain for both which would see it's penultimate end being both leads battling for their survival literally.I don't wish to discuss movie dynamics in length as this is not about how the script has been written with/without conviction. The real sense of conviction in this movie comes through Ranbir Kapoor, he lives the character of Jordan and gives performance of his life time. Not in for a second you would think for the entire movie that he is a movie star, you would watch him struggle through his pathos. Kudos to him for pulling this off with such great ease, I couldn't imagine anyone doing this role and leave the same impression. Nargis who is the leading lady in this movie, looks no less than an angel in movie and gives a performance for which any new comer can feel proud about especially against such a strong character played by Ranbir Kapoor.Of all the loudest praise should go to two people, A.R. Rehman for his genius music and to Mohit Chauhan, this movie is as much a milestone for him as it is for Ranbir Kapoor. Both Mohit and Ranbir jells so well that it's hard to believe that actually Ranbir's voice is backed by a singer, it's a compliment for both of them. Every song stands out and they all are superb.I thoroughly enjoyed this journey of making of a Rock star. This movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist; it's about how much pain it goes in making a real Rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldn't ground his foot correctly. Movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero Jordan who don't have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music, a picture perfect depiction of a rebel Rock star to the core.Watch it, if you are in for dark movies. Don't expect any Bollywood masala but an intense tide of emotions throughout.",new star is born rockstar,first all rockstar is not mere love story those people i saw drawing conclusion that this is just extramarital affair which is justified by imtiaz ali its much more than that when character protagonist was getting built it was told him that it would be pain that would get star out him movie is journey making rock star who goes through pain separation depravity society which makes him someone he was never meant be but finally rockstar true blue eyed boy who was always away any sense pain his life until he falls love tore apart life his love his life heer i am although not big rock music fan but got food thought those posthumous rock stars that lost their lives depression drugs this film gives gray shades their tainted life which is always open so much public scrutiny which perhaps helped me recon with their hysterical behavior it starts with young lad trying make big music but who doesnt have soul sell himself as serious artist he has shown way through love betrayal he fancies his chances with most admired girl town little does he know that this would embark endless journey pain both which would see its penultimate end being both leads battling their survival literally i dont wish discuss movie dynamics length as this is not about how script has been written with without conviction real sense conviction this movie comes through ranbir kapoor he lives character jordan gives performance his life time not second you would think entire movie that he is movie star you would watch him struggle through his pathos kudos him pulling this off with such great ease i couldnt imagine anyone doing this role leave same impression nargis who is leading lady this movie looks no less than angel movie gives performance which any new comer can feel proud about especially against such strong character played by ranbir kapoor all loudest praise should go two people r rehman his genius music mohit chauhan this movie is as much milestone him as it is ranbir kapoor both mohit ranbir jells so well that its hard believe that actually ranbirs voice is backed by singer its compliment both them every song stands out they all are superb i thoroughly enjoyed this journey making rock star this movie is not about making right statement society not follow footsteps protagonist its about how much pain it goes making real rock star that makes everyone feel cloud when he couldnt ground his foot correctly movie is dark nature this is about anti hero jordan who dont have sense righteousness he vents out his anger form music picture perfect depiction rebel rock star core watch it if you are dark movies dont expect any bollywood masala but intense tide emotions throughout,0.5117689048540112,0.16143847287464308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8.0,Imperfect Love of Perfect Lovers,"I have to say that watching this movie ALONE in an empty movie theatre added several dimensions to the whole experience of watching ROCKSTAR. My first comment is to Imtiaz Ali-- What were you thinking, bro? To actually have the gumption to create a love story around the idea of ethereal and eternal love as envisioned by the great Sufi Master Rumi in the land of DABANGG and BODYGUARD? Did you really think that audiences (read THE COMMON MAN) would throng cinemas and multiplexes to get a taste of sublime love?For sublime love is the thread that binds this beautiful bitter sweet tale together. It is a love story written in the idiom of NorthIndian/Kashmiri/Sufi culture, of dargahs, of spirituality, of Delhi University Campus insider jokes, of the topography of North India, especially Kashmir and I fear the film could be condemned with the ""E"" word--elitism. The starting point of the story is a young ordinary low middle class callow youth who is a wannabe singer, strumming his guitar to ordinary lyrics hoping to make it big. He is accused of being shallow by his mentor and advised to seek out ""PAIN"" in order to light the creative spark, that divine glow that accompanies great art. Unbeknownst to him, his casual and frivolous flirtation with this search for angst leads him into the deep end where he has to come face to face first with true love and then with the inevitable pain that comes with it. The dialogues are fabulous. So is the cinematography. The snow clad mountains of Kashmir and the misty mornings of New Delhi, the green fields full of flowers in Prague place the story in the here and now when in truth the story could belong to any era, any century, any epoch. The universality of love, the self realisation that comes with it, the realisation that this life is but a dream is what the movie is really about. The essence of the story is not in the physicality of love but love beyond the here and now, beyond right and wrong and love for the Creator who was there when there was nothing else.See what I mean when I ask Imtiaz--what were you thinking, bro? And now for the piece de resistance-the music, the lyrics, the singer. If there were any doubts being expressed by the hoi polloi about A R Rehman's diminishing creativity well then, here is his rebuttal. The music is earthy, rooted in our traditions and culture, and designed to rock. It's astonishing how Rehman is able to dive into the musical traditions of the Punjab to create the ""Saada Haq"" and ""Katiyaan Karoon"". Irshad Kamil's lyrics, if you take the time to listen to the songs and understand the words, are beyond compare. Mohit Chauhan's voice is eminently suitable for all the songs. My favorite is ""Naadaan parinde, ghar aajaa"" Listen to the lyrics and cry. We have been enjoying a lot of junk food lately. Now it's time for some haute cuisine.",imperfect love perfect lovers,i have say that watching this movie alone empty movie theatre added several dimensions whole experience watching rockstar my first comment is imtiaz ali what were you thinking bro actually have gumption create love story around idea ethereal eternal love as envisioned by great sufi master rumi land dabangg bodyguard did you really think that audiences read common man would throng cinemas multiplexes get taste sublime love sublime love is thread that binds this beautiful bitter sweet tale together it is love story written idiom northindian kashmiri sufi culture dargahs spirituality delhi university campus insider jokes topography north india especially kashmir i fear film could be condemned with e word elitism starting point story is young ordinary low middle class callow youth who is wannabe singer strumming his guitar ordinary lyrics hoping make it big he is accused being shallow by his mentor advised seek out pain order light creative spark that divine glow that accompanies great art unbeknownst him his casual frivolous flirtation with this search angst leads him into deep end where he has come face face first with true love then with inevitable pain that comes with it dialogues are fabulous so is cinematography snow clad mountains kashmir misty mornings new delhi green fields full flowers prague place story here now when truth story could belong any era any century any epoch universality love self realisation that comes with it realisation that this life is but dream is what movie is really about essence story is not physicality love but love beyond here now beyond right wrong love creator who was there when there was nothing else see what i mean when i ask imtiaz what were you thinking bro now piece de resistance music lyrics singer if there were any doubts being expressed by hoi polloi about r rehmans diminishing creativity well then here is his rebuttal music is earthy rooted our traditions culture designed rock its astonishing how rehman is able dive into musical traditions punjab create saada haq katiyaan karoon irshad kamils lyrics if you take time listen songs understand words are beyond compare mohit chauhans voice is eminently suitable all songs my favorite is naadaan parinde ghar aajaa listen lyrics cry we have been enjoying lot junk food lately now its time some haute cuisine,0.5606562377016923,0.22411353797717434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,An awesome piece of Art by Imtiaz Ali,"Indian cinema has matured and specially Hindi film with new directors pouring in with new ideas. Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Vishal Bhardwaj should get special mention for their brilliant coming of age films. After Rockstar, Imtiaz Ali should be added to this category of filmmakers. Romantic cinema is immortal perennial but never ever it has been witnessed in such creative, symbolic, real manner as in Rockstar. Rockstar is journey of Janarthan, a regular north Delhi brat who dreams of becoming Jim Morrison. He even tries to match his initials with the famous singer and tries to change his fate. Alas! He couldn't succeed in making a mark when a college canteen owner (who becomes family for Janarthan later on) Khataria tells him that through pain comes music. Janarthan took his word too seriously thus involving in a web of suffering and success all revolving around Heer, a lady who becomes life for Janarthan rather Jordan. The movie is a journey of a young ambitious boy from his being Janarthan to Jordan and in a symbolic manner raises several questions about independence and democracy. Imtiaz Ali is a fabulous story teller and his previous work reflects those but with Rockstar he goes a level higher. The film will bring polarizing reactions from cine goers but they can't ignore it. Probably one of the best romantic cinemas ever made. Ali is almost flawless in his execution. With a semi non-linear narrative Ali goes into the psyche of Jordan merging his scenario pre and post success. The scene where Jordan cries in front of Khataria that he doesn't need all the fame he wants to be Happy – sums up Jordan's strive with his impression. The rebel has been created in a thought provoking manner raising questions to establishment. The rules set in the society, the willingness to live freely, how power has destroyed the regular course of nature – all these ideas have been embedded subtle in a brilliant love story that is natural unlike loud melodramatic blockbusters of regular Hindi cinema. When Jordan is almost losing Heer forever there is a scene which shows Jordan in a bath tub looking at his guitar on fire which reflects the life of present youth who tends to burn (loss) everything one loves in course of success. There are many more such brilliant sequences which show Ali's craftsmanship as a director. With able support from Anil Mehta the camera work is probably the best of this year. Ali didn't compromise for commerce and gave a surreal feel to the real proceedings. Kudos to Aarti Bajaj for her apt editing and making the film a work of art. Coming to the acting department, Ranbir Kapoor rocks. He camouflaged himself as Jordan with élan. Rockstar will prove how fine actor he is. In fact the new brigade of actors should take acting lessons from Ranbir. Watch his transition from Janarthan to Jordan, his success his failures his love his despair – Ranbir's expression deserves awards and accolades. Teaming up with fabulous actors like Piyush Mishra, Kumud Mishra (who was last seen in brilliant ""That girl in yellow boots"") Ranbir showed extreme maturity. In a sequence where he tore down a contract and made hysteric gestures towards Piyush Mishra deserves standing ovation. Those dialogues showing Ali's angst against consumerism deserves mention. Nargis Fakhri as Heer is serene beauty. Any boy will fall in love with her. As an actress she needs to improve but then she isn't bad either. Piyush Mishra as the opportunist Dhingra simply rocks as usual. Kumud Mishra is surely to catch attention of other directors. The ensemble cast provides ample support in their brief and significant role. Lastly how can one forget the original Rockstar Late Shammi Kapoor in a significant appearance. As a successful classical Sahnai (flute) player he is mind blowing. And how can I forget about Rehman's music in the film. Each of the songs are mark of a genius and brilliant in their own space. With awesome lyrics from Irshad Kamil the musical score elevates the movie to another level. ""Nadan parinday"" is one of the best written songs of recent times and ""Sadda Haq"" had all the power to be the youth anthem. Simply brilliant album in every sense.

10.0,"'Rockstar' leaves you with a feel-good hangover of itself, that is hard to digest at first watch.","Love stories have always been Bollywood's thing. A trifle here and there might have changed over the years, but the formulaic love story, the one that we've all grown up on and savored, always takes you by the hand, guides you through the film's ups and downs and leaves you at an ending. But when you have a story as new, as fresh and as free-falling as the one in Imtiaz Ali's 'Rockstar', then these are times that herald a new change in today's Bollywood.The story goes something like this. Janardhan Jakkad(JJ a.k.a Jordan), a Delhi simpleton, has always wanted to be a rockstar. His friend/mentor and college canteen manager, Khatana, gives him a 'get-your-heart-broken-and-you-will-be-a-rockstar' solution. JJ automatically aims for the prettiest chick on campus, Heer, sure to have his heart broken. But what follows is a story that goes from a simple one of fame-mongering to a love story most unusual. The chapter of Jordan and Heer never seems to end and their complexities take them on a path that would ultimately destroy their lives.It is very difficult to characterize the movie with a single emotion. It is so beautifully layered that it will take repeated viewings to form a consensus within yourself as to WHY you love the film. Just like its soundtrack, 'Rockstar' is a movie you will have to allow to grow on you. The film can best be described as a heady cocktail of love and fame and how each has an effect on the other. It's the free-falling nature of the story that gives it a feeling never before experienced in Indian cinema. The movie borders on self-indulgence every once in a while but wonderfully balances it out with realism.The music, composed by A.R. Rahman, is in many ways a character in the film. Every phase of Jordan's life is characterized by a song which magically sets the tone for the next few minutes, till the next song or sequence comes along and changes the mood. The music, in many ways, drives the film. Its very obvious now why Imtiaz Ali replaced usual collaborator Pritam with Rahman. Without the type and scale of the music Rahman has given for this film, 'Rockstar' would have been very handicapped. The music truly forms the soul of the film. Also, from the snow covered mountains of Kashmir and Himachal and the dingy discotheques to the old-architecture of Prague and the various concert venues, the film looks beautiful in almost every shot, thanks to ace cinematographer Anil Mehta. The right variations in angle, color and focus gives the film a biographical feel where the scenes portray an emotion as much as the actors in them do.Which brings me to the performances. The film has few characters and each of them are well-defined. Aditi Rao plays the journalist Sheena, who tracks Jordan's life and though she has precious little to do, she plays her part. Piyush Mishra as the shrewd record company owner Dhingra, is the quintessential greedy man in the film and does well too. Kumud Mishra as Khatana, Jordan's old friend and manager is perfect and brings in a certain sincerity and authenticity to his part. Shammi Kapoor as the shehnai maestro Ustad Jameel Khan is absolutely charming every time he appears on screen. It is hard to miss the glint in his eye and these being his last shots, will always be what 'Rockstar' will be remembered for. Now for the two lead actors. Nargis Fakri is unfortunately, the weakest link in the film. She obviously has a lot to learn in the acting department. She blatantly disappoints in scenes where she is required to do more than just look pretty, and ends up as the cold dish in 'Rockstar'. Nonetheless, she does look good in every frame and with better acting, could go places. With her current form, she will find it tough to make a mark.However, 'Rockstar' completely belongs to Ranbir Kapoor, who has clearly gives this film his all. He plays his part with utmost perfection and with a depth that is so rare in Bollywood these days. Through the film, it is Jordan, and not Ranbir Kapoor, that we see on screen. He earnestly brings out the character transition from JJ to Jordan with such ease, that this could very well be his career-defining performance. He's clearly left his contemporaries WAY behind. Ranbir Kapoor, as of now, owns Bollywood.Having dared to make such an experimental film, director Imtiaz Ali is truly the new-age doyen of Indian Cinema. His refreshing take on love stories, from 'Jab We Met' to 'Love Aaj Kal', continues with 'Rockstar' which will be remembered for a long time as the first movie of its kind. Truly original and truly inspired from all the right sources, Imtiaz Ali is the new age phenomenon of modern love in cinema.Truly magical and spell-binding, 'Rockstar' leaves you with a feel-good hangover of itself, that is hard to digest at first watch. I'd give it a 4/5.Don't miss.",rockstar leaves you with feel good hangover itself that is hard digest at first watch,love stories have always been bollywoods thing trifle here there might have changed over years but formulaic love story one that weve all grown up savored always takes you by hand guides you through films ups downs leaves you at ending but when you have story as new as fresh as free falling as one imtiaz alis rockstar then these are times that herald new change todays bollywood story goes something like this janardhan jakkad jj k jordan delhi simpleton has always wanted be rockstar his friend mentor college canteen manager khatana gives him get your heart broken you will be rockstar solution jj automatically aims prettiest chick campus heer sure have his heart broken but what follows is story that goes simple one fame mongering love story most unusual chapter jordan heer never seems end their complexities take them path that would ultimately destroy their lives it is very difficult characterize movie with single emotion it is so beautifully layered that it will take repeated viewings form consensus within yourself as why you love film just like its soundtrack rockstar is movie you will have allow grow you film can best be described as heady cocktail love fame how each has effect other its free falling nature story that gives it feeling never before experienced indian cinema movie borders self indulgence every once while but wonderfully balances it out with realism music composed by r rahman is many ways character film every phase jordans life is characterized by song which magically sets tone next few minutes till next song or sequence comes along changes mood music many ways drives film its very obvious now why imtiaz ali replaced usual collaborator pritam with rahman without type scale music rahman has given this film rockstar would have been very handicapped music truly forms soul film also snow covered mountains kashmir himachal dingy discotheques old architecture prague various concert venues film looks beautiful almost every shot thanks ace cinematographer anil mehta right variations angle color focus gives film biographical feel where scenes portray emotion as much as actors them do which brings me performances film has few characters each them are well defined aditi rao plays journalist sheena who tracks jordans life though she has precious little do she plays her part piyush mishra as shrewd record company owner dhingra is quintessential greedy man film does well too kumud mishra as khatana jordans old friend manager is perfect brings certain sincerity authenticity his part shammi kapoor as shehnai maestro ustad jameel khan is absolutely charming every time he appears screen it is hard miss glint his eye these being his last shots will always be what rockstar will be remembered now two lead actors nargis fakri is unfortunately weakest link film she obviously has lot learn acting department she blatantly disappoints scenes where she is required do more than just look pretty ends up as cold dish rockstar nonetheless she does look good every frame with better acting could go places with her current form she will find it tough make mark however rockstar completely belongs ranbir kapoor who has clearly gives this film his all he plays his part with utmost perfection with depth that is so rare bollywood these days through film it is jordan not ranbir kapoor that we see screen he earnestly brings out character transition jj jordan with such ease that this could very well be his career defining performance hes clearly left his contemporaries way behind ranbir kapoor as now owns bollywood having dared make such experimental film director imtiaz ali is truly new age doyen indian cinema his refreshing take love stories jab we met love aaj kal continues with rockstar which will be remembered long time as first movie its kind truly original truly inspired all right sources imtiaz ali is new age phenomenon modern love cinema truly magical spell binding rockstar leaves you with feel good hangover itself that is hard digest at first watch id give it 4 5 dont miss,0.528704379266177,0.19897024012192543,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Rockstar- Poignant and one of a kind with soulful music and Ranbir's noble performance,"Rockstar is an enchantment to watch that how Indian Cinema is up-and-coming with some different subject matter.Janardan Jakhad(JJ) a regular lad with vehemence for rock music and die-hard fan of Jim Morrison goes to an indistinct length. He was recommended by his mentor that to become an eminent artist there must have occurred a catastrophe and pain deep in heart. The efforts to break his heart are very funny with some witty dialogs and great body language by Ranbir. Eventually Nargis Fakhri's screen presence is a cool breeze, she is striking but lacks in the acting skills. She missed the expressions and unable to deliver nevertheless having a counterpart role. The supporting cast has done very well, special mention for Kumud Mishra (Katara) & Piyush Mishra (Dhingra).The first half of the movie shows the character development of JJ with some fine moments of mirth and splendid cinematography. However, the second half drags a bit with some no obvious reason deeds. Ranbir adds a new feather is his cap with outstanding performance. He shows a great potential in every movie with a different shade. He is going to take the Kapoor's legacy to a whole new level. Ultimately, the Music, given by our own Oscar winner A R Rahman, is exceptional and soul of the movie. Every score is blazing with the correct situation. Rahman is a genius and kudos for compiling such stupendous music which will remain in our hearts until the world ends. Imtiaz Ali has given us some fantastic movies including his best (My Opinion) SOCHA NA THA and with Rockstar he chooses a very fine and daring subject.

10.0,"Un-Indianised, simply brilliant","Lately i have had to go through the trauma of watching some rubbish, money motivated Bollywood flicks such as the prolonged ""bodyguard"" and the hideously scripted ""Ra-One"".However, Rock-star is just on another level. It is the most gripping Bollywood film of the year. It reminds me of movies like ""Rock on"", ""Dil Chahta hai"", ""Rang de Basanti"". Because this like them is not a clichéd story, it is out of the box and very very different from the monotonous chocolate-love flicks.The best part of the movie was that there were no non-sense songs, all the songs made sense and were perfectly timed. The music by A.R Rehman is absolutely brilliant. Apart from that, it is very well directed, the way the director has played with the time-line is marvelous. The time-line keeps the viewer glued to the screen. For instance, the start of the movie is showing JJ or Jordan at a massive concert and then suddenly you see him as a struggling visionary artist during his college life trying to imitate famous Rock-stars.Yes, the movie basically is a love story, but an extremely gripping one unlike most Bollywood love stories. You see how Jordan becomes the star he is, due to this love story. That is what makes it so special, 2 plots working side by side complementing one another i,e him becoming a ""star"" due to his passionate ""love affair"".The facial expressions of both ""Ranbir"" and ""Nargis"" add to the spice. You actually feel they are in love. The intensity of their relationship is very evident due to the acting. Nargis despite not having her own voice has done an outstanding job and Ranbir Kapoor has stepped up a notch from his other brilliant performance in ""Rajneeti"".It is one of those epic movies, you cant afford to miss. If you are a fan of wonderfully scripted biographies then this one is definitely for you. However if you enjoy over the top action, stunts or illogical comedy then don't watch it.My recommendation to all purists out there, do watch it. I cant believe the rating of this movie is only 7.6 which is most likely to drop.Through all this i have learned one thing, Through this movie the Indian cinema has shown signs of maturity however through the rating the public has not.Ranbir Kapoor and Nargis take a bow !! extremely brilliant performance !",un indianised simply brilliant,lately i have had go through trauma watching some rubbish money motivated bollywood flicks such as prolonged bodyguard hideously scripted ra one however rock star is just another level it is most gripping bollywood film year it reminds me movies like rock dil chahta hai rang de basanti because this like them is not clich d story it is out box very very different monotonous chocolate love flicks best part movie was that there were no non sense songs all songs made sense were perfectly timed music by r rehman is absolutely brilliant apart that it is very well directed way director has played with time line is marvelous time line keeps viewer glued screen instance start movie is showing jj or jordan at massive concert then suddenly you see him as struggling visionary artist during his college life trying imitate famous rock stars yes movie basically is love story but extremely gripping one unlike most bollywood love stories you see how jordan becomes star he is due this love story that is what makes it so special 2 plots working side by side complementing one another i e him becoming star due his passionate love affair facial expressions both ranbir nargis add spice you actually feel they are love intensity their relationship is very evident due acting nargis despite not having her own voice has done outstanding job ranbir kapoor has stepped up notch his other brilliant performance rajneeti it is one those epic movies you cant afford miss if you are fan wonderfully scripted biographies then this one is definitely you however if you enjoy over top action stunts or illogical comedy then dont watch it my recommendation all purists out there do watch it i cant believe rating this movie is only 7 6 which is most likely drop through all this i have learned one thing through this movie indian cinema has shown signs maturity however through rating public has not ranbir kapoor nargis take bow extremely brilliant performance,0.621661600810537,0.34642857142857136,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,An emotional and powerful journey.,"Even though the Indian film Industry releases countless big budget films every year, only once in a while there comes a movie like ""Rockstar"" which moves away from the usual story and casts an impression on the viewers.Imtiaz Ali has created such a masterpiece this time. His story is a fresh take on romance and pain and he has shown he is one of the best directors around.The story revolves around 2 characters Janardhan Jakhar a.k.a Jordan(Ranbir Kapoor) and Heer(Nargis Fakri) and their feelings towards each other. The special thing about this movie is that despite being a love story, the lead characters never act as the clichéd lovers..they never said ""I love you"" throughout the movie and still their love was so intense and powerful..The self inflicted pain of 'Jordan' is the soul of this movie and moves the audience.Ranbir has done a remarkable act and has again proved he is an exceptional actor in the film industry. His transition from the innocent and confused 'JJ' to the ruthless, shattered 'Jordan' is flawless. The audience were in awe of him throughout the movie and rightly so.The music blends with this movie perfectly and most of the time lifts the movie to higher levels. The voice of Mohit Chauhan along with the expertise of AR Rahman is just superb and this duo will be in demand for a long time. The joy, enlightenment, pain and suffering of 'Jordan' is portrayed very well through the songs. And this is one of those movies in which you feel that the songs weren't just forced in the story.Despite everything being so good there was one shortcoming, Nargis. The model turned actress had weird expressions in few scenes in her debut film. This created some funny moments in the first half but she did a convincing act post interval.One thing which the director couldn't balance was the pace..The first half was expanded into few years showing the pair's love and relationship but post interval they didn't do that, and stuck to a straight and small period with longer scenes. This gave most of the general audience an idea that it was slow. If the story in between intervals was balanced in terms of the time span, more people would have appreciated the whole movie.This an emotional, and an intense journey of a simple man who goes on a path of self destruction. A Must Watch, this movie needs deep understanding and appreciation.",emotional powerful journey,even though indian film industry releases countless big budget films every year only once while there comes movie like rockstar which moves away usual story casts impression viewers imtiaz ali has created such masterpiece this time his story is fresh take romance pain he has shown he is one best directors around story revolves around 2 characters janardhan jakhar k jordan ranbir kapoor heer nargis fakri their feelings towards each other special thing about this movie is that despite being love story lead characters never act as clich d lovers they never said i love you throughout movie still their love was so intense powerful self inflicted pain jordan is soul this movie moves audience ranbir has done remarkable act has again proved he is exceptional actor film industry his transition innocent confused jj ruthless shattered jordan is flawless audience were awe him throughout movie rightly so music blends with this movie perfectly most time lifts movie higher levels voice mohit chauhan along with expertise ar rahman is just superb this duo will be demand long time joy enlightenment pain suffering jordan is portrayed very well through songs this is one those movies which you feel that songs werent just forced story despite everything being so good there was one shortcoming nargis model turned actress had weird expressions few scenes her debut film this created some funny moments first half but she did convincing act post interval one thing which director couldnt balance was pace first half was expanded into few years showing pairs love relationship but post interval they didnt do that stuck straight small period with longer scenes this gave most general audience idea that it was slow if story between intervals was balanced terms time span more people would have appreciated whole movie this emotional intense journey simple man who goes path self destruction must watch this movie needs deep understanding appreciation,0.5535714285714285,0.19436208445642403,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Rocking !!!!,"Rockstar is one of the best movie of 2011. It has the much needed thing called a ""STORY"". Movies like this release once in a blue moon. The movie is directed by Imtiaz Ali . The cast has a young actor Ranbir Kapoor supported by débutant Nargis Fakhri. The music is given by the Oscar winning musician A.R.Rehman and songs are sung by Mohit Chauhan. Janaradan Jakhar (Ranbir Kapoor) – his friends at Hindu College call him JJ – is a rotten seed for his ultra-conservative family. So all he receives at home is scorn and ridicule. The owner of the college canteen, where the young man whiles away his time day-dreaming over endless plates of samosas, tells him he cannot be the path-breaking musician that he wants to be until he experiences genuine pain and heartbreak.JJ finds both love and loss in the form of the rich and statuesque Heer, a Kashmiri girl who blows hot and cold, as he mutates into a rockstar, Jordan. A rebel is born.Read more at: http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_Review.aspx?id=673&cp Nargis Fakhri as the seemingly straight-laced but 'wild at heart' girl who decides to give vent to her repressed desires before her imminent wedding also hits the right notes.Nargis Fakhri as Heer has done an excellent job.Ranbir Kapoor, as JJ, makes a go for it with infectious intent. He gets the lingo and diction right; the gawky gait is delightfully apt.AR Rahman's outstandingly lively and eclectic musical score presents a wide range of sounds blended into a harmonious whole. Ranbir's Shammi Kapoor act on a boat on the Dal Lake (he sings Chand Sa Roshan Chehra) is probably worth the price of the ticket, if the recently deceased Bollywood icon's cameo in the film isn't. Moreover, writer-director Imtiaz Ali's sensibility ensures that Rockstar, for the most part, steers well clear of the clichés that usually hound the average Bollywood love story.Though there are many flaws in the movie but Ranbir with his performance covers it up. verdict - Awesome movies guys just watch it. ratings - 9/10.",rocking,rockstar is one best movie 2011 it has much needed thing called story movies like this release once blue moon movie is directed by imtiaz ali cast has young actor ranbir kapoor supported by d butant nargis fakhri music is given by oscar winning musician r rehman songs are sung by mohit chauhan janaradan jakhar ranbir kapoor his friends at hindu college call him jj is rotten seed his ultra conservative family so all he receives at home is scorn ridicule owner college canteen where young man whiles away his time day dreaming over endless plates samosas tells him he cannot be path breaking musician that he wants be until he experiences genuine pain heartbreak jj finds both love loss form rich statuesque heer kashmiri girl who blows hot cold as he mutates into rockstar jordan rebel is born read more at nargis fakhri as seemingly straight laced but wild at heart girl who decides give vent her repressed desires before her imminent wedding also hits right notes nargis fakhri as heer has done excellent job ranbir kapoor as jj makes go it with infectious intent he gets lingo diction right gawky gait is delightfully apt ar rahmans outstandingly lively eclectic musical score presents wide range sounds blended into harmonious whole ranbirs shammi kapoor act boat dal lake he sings chand sa roshan chehra is probably worth price ticket if recently deceased bollywood icons cameo film isnt moreover writer director imtiaz alis sensibility ensures that rockstar most part steers well clear clich s that usually hound average bollywood love story though there are many flaws movie but ranbir with his performance covers it up verdict awesome movies guys just watch it ratings 9 10,0.5089635854341736,0.2369938884644767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"

Many people will differ from me on this that they felt post interval portions or climax weak or the narration of the movie was not good but I TOTALLY DIFFER AS I FELL THE POST INTERVAL, CLIMAX, NARRATION ALL was just AWESOME.. Specially the INTENSITY of the LOVE story was just mindblowing. beautifully wriiten mindblowing love story i would say IMTIAZ ALI have did it once more.. He is one of the best director these days. His Story of the movie, his direction is just TOO GOOD.MUSICMR. AR RAHMAN has did it once more.. He has given one of His best music so far.. THE MUSIC OF ROCKSTAR IS JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD..When the music released it took several hearings to grip as most of AR RAHMAN's music do but once it grips on u , u'll fall in love with the Music of ROCKSTAR.. The music arrangements, the compositions, the lyircs, the vocals, everything is just BRILLIANT. Similarly, the BACKGROUND MUSIC of the movie totally goes with the movie and is great too..Lyrics By Irshal Kamil are just Too mind blowing .. He has given one of His best too. And Mohit Chohan has done a Brilliant job as vocalist as his voice totally suits JORDAN 's character.Sadda Haq, Jo Bhi Main, Tum Ho, Hawa Hawa, How can one choose all are too good including the instrumentals. and after the picturization of songs one love the songs more.. specially the picturization of Hawa Hawa and Aur Ho is on the top.CAST, ACTING & CHEMISTRYRANBIR KAPOOR as a Rockstar (JORDAN) totally Rocks.. He has given his career best Acting without any doubt and is surely an award winning performance. His emotions, his dialogue delievery, his body language, his anger, his love, his Music, is just MINDBLOWING.. NARGIS FAKHRI ,what i find by IMTIAZ ALI, Her screen pressence is so cool and sweet. she has acted very well as a debutant. her emotions and her love is too good. just her dialogue delievery was weak which was a some what let down but still she has done a great job. The CHEMISTRY and Love story and the INTENSITY between RANBIR and NARGIS is Brilliant. they rock throughout the movie..SHAMMI KAOOR in His last movie is totally likable and He has done his part very good.. the JUGAL BANDI scene is a treat to watch.KUMUD MISHRA is very good in his role so as ADITI RAO in her role suits totally and have done a great job.PIYUSH MISHRA is very good to.. his Massage sceen is too enjoyable..SHERNAZ PATEL Is good so as MAUFID AZIZ.. The casting of the movie is brilliant..CONCLUSIONOnly at few places the movie dips a bit and gets slow but those are to be avoided as remaining movie is a TREAT to watch..Sadda Haq, Tum Ho, Nadaan Parindey, Phir se Ud Chala, Jo Bhi Main Kehna Chahun...Rockstar totally rocks.... Awesome direction..Beautiful intensity of the Love story.... Music just Brilliant,, and RK a true Rockstar.. Luvd every bit of it.. ROCKSTAR..!!RATINGS = 4.75/5.

8.0,Celebration of 'look within' process,"When the Rockstar's trailer was released. I was blown away by the frames that speak louder than everything else. Kudos to those who edited and reedited the trailer with such a sharp mind that one wants to watch it over and over again. I have gone through many interpretations of the trailer to satisfy my curiosity; I expected (as usual) something vibrant from the film.The film starts with rock concert where people are celebrating the 'Rockstar Jordan'. This Rockstar, who kicks some cops and gates, comes on the stage, and then first cord of his guitar takes you to the flash back. Janardan Jakhad (Ranbir Kapoor) is the ordinary youngster who fascinates about big Musicians. He wants to make it big with his guitar but as they say, college and confusion comes together, he is not sure how and what to bring out. Rockstar is all about the 'look within' process, an ordinary guy conveys his 'look within' process through the music. Love of his life triggered that process. It's about the chaos that surrounds you, you always try to make meaning out of it and unfortunately we end with our own interpretation which is backed by the conscious ego. Jordan is not the different, He is very true with his 'own' that people starts relating with it. We always comfort the idea of 'be yourself' by being in fascinating moment. You will be astonished by the thought that Imitiaz Ali wants to say which slowly grasp your mind and makes you part of it. The heart of the film is Ruby's poem about a place where 'unconditional love' exists.The film offers a lot of metaphors that makes you part of it. Janardan can't sing and play his music in jammed environment of studio, but effortlessly he composes his music with Shehnai maestro (Shammi Kapoor) who recognised him as a free spirit. How anyone can controlled your 'within' when you have at urge to bring it out. 'Jok bhi mein keh na chaho barbad kare alfaz mere', this is nothing but desperate attempt to connect with yourself.This film tries to organise the definition of the Love. This film conveys that love comes with no restriction, responsibilities which are difficult for someone's appetite. Imtiaz Ali brings his signature madness of 'Jab we met' and 'Love Aaj Kal' in this film. But he has forgotten to fill those plot holes, where this Rockstar randomly meets his love of life on the street of Prague. (This sequence reminds me recent disaster 'Mausam' where randomness was constant) and the TV reporter who out of the blue wants to find about this Rockstar. Imtiaz Ali used non-linear story telling format to organise the story but unfortunately that weakens what he exactly wants to say. People will watch it again and again because of AR's music that calms you and makes you thoughtless for a moment. Ranbir had a chance he has proved it. Ranbir conveys character's emotions and metaphors. He switches his roles perfectly as a troubled Rockstar who yelled at reporters every other time and as a lover who doesn't give damn about anything else but his love. As we all know Imtiaz's love for firangi gal, Nargis Fakiri fails to synchronise herself with her co-star. Imtiaz Ali surprisingly avoids melodrama and come with the ending that will allow you to fetch your own interpretations. This kind of ending that doesn't give full stop to storytelling and story viewing experience.The movie that itself talks about beyond the wrong and right, I don't want to judge this movie on the grounds of film-making rules. This is my love for this kind of cinema.",celebration look within process,when rockstars trailer was released i was blown away by frames that speak louder than everything else kudos those who edited reedited trailer with such sharp mind that one wants watch it over over again i have gone through many interpretations trailer satisfy my curiosity i expected as usual something vibrant film film starts with rock concert where people are celebrating rockstar jordan this rockstar who kicks some cops gates comes stage then first cord his guitar takes you flash back janardan jakhad ranbir kapoor is ordinary youngster who fascinates about big musicians he wants make it big with his guitar but as they say college confusion comes together he is not sure how what bring out rockstar is all about look within process ordinary guy conveys his look within process through music love his life triggered that process its about chaos that surrounds you you always try make meaning out it unfortunately we end with our own interpretation which is backed by conscious ego jordan is not different he is very true with his own that people starts relating with it we always comfort idea be yourself by being fascinating moment you will be astonished by thought that imitiaz ali wants say which slowly grasp your mind makes you part it heart film is rubys poem about place where unconditional love exists film offers lot metaphors that makes you part it janardan cant sing play his music jammed environment studio but effortlessly he composes his music with shehnai maestro shammi kapoor who recognised him as free spirit how anyone can controlled your within when you have at urge bring it out jok bhi mein keh na chaho barbad kare alfaz mere this is nothing but desperate attempt connect with yourself this film tries organise definition love this film conveys that love comes with no restriction responsibilities which are difficult someones appetite imtiaz ali brings his signature madness jab we met love aaj kal this film but he has forgotten fill those plot holes where this rockstar randomly meets his love life street prague this sequence reminds me recent disaster mausam where randomness was constant tv reporter who out blue wants find about this rockstar imtiaz ali used non linear story telling format organise story but unfortunately that weakens what he exactly wants say people will watch it again again because ars music that calms you makes you thoughtless moment ranbir had chance he has proved it ranbir conveys characters emotions metaphors he switches his roles perfectly as troubled rockstar who yelled at reporters every other time as lover who doesnt give damn about anything else but his love as we all know imtiazs love firangi gal nargis fakiri fails synchronise herself with her co star imtiaz ali surprisingly avoids melodrama come with ending that will allow you fetch your own interpretations this kind ending that doesnt give full stop storytelling story viewing experience movie that itself talks about beyond wrong right i dont want judge this movie grounds film making rules this is my love this kind cinema,0.5326655719759169,0.09926518883415435,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Soulful!,"Rockstar is a beautiful painting on a canvas. It's a journey through the soul of a musician; mellow and bitter sweet. It's not a feel good movie or even an actual tale. It has gaps as glaring as a 30 foot wide goal post but Rockstar has a soul and that keep you fixed to the screen long after the goal! I liked Rockstar for three reasons; AR Rahman, the visuals and Ranbir Kapoor. A R Rahman has weaved magic and the music would be stuck in your head long after the movie; 'Saddha Haq'is raw and full of energy and will gets your fists pumping in the air. The visuals are simply scintillating; there would definitely be more Indians holidaying in Prague and Kashmir now. Anil Mehta deserves the kudos for the cinematography; Kashmir will take your breath away but the lapses quickly bring it back. Rockstar has great humor! It's refreshing to see Bollywood have well written clean and neat humor. It's funny and does leave you in splits! The ideology that only pain begets music is a little retarded though! The movie progresses at its own pace with the music and visuals. Rockstar is not a statement or even the tale of most rock stars; it just is.AR Rahman music is alone worth going to the film; soulful and very Sufi in nature. The 14 tracks in the movie are simply a testament to the genius he is. The rawness of the music has an addictive aura to it and will mesmerize you. Ranbir Kapoor, I must say has matured into a fine young actor; with élan and crisp he blends the several layers of his character seamlessly into one. He's not acting, he's living it! Imitaz Ali has definitely grown as a director since Jab we met & Love Aaj Kal. Rockstar is loosely based on a friend of his, but he manages to pen it right. This is definitely not his best work but it pulls through. What you will find hard to digest is the logic used that leaves you numb. Aarti Bajaj could have edited Rockstar better to make it edgy but you would not want to change that because you would risk hurting the soul of Rockstar. Nagris Fakri is the new Katrina Kaif and has done an outstanding job considering that this is her debut. Shammi Kapoor spoke with his eyes and what a tribute it was to him. Rockstar is no 'Dabaang' or 'Singham'; not a movie for the masses but it appeals to you. RB has the charm to keep you stuck to the screen. Frankly, Rockstar could be the perfect cure for the Ra One hangover. It's not a great movie, but it will suffice to rid of the week! It's a half baked chocolate cake. Who cares; it's chocolate anyway! Baked or half baked!",soulful,rockstar is beautiful painting canvas its journey through soul musician mellow bitter sweet its not feel good movie or even actual tale it has gaps as glaring as 30 foot wide goal post but rockstar has soul that keep you fixed screen long after goal i liked rockstar three reasons ar rahman visuals ranbir kapoor r rahman has weaved magic music would be stuck your head long after movie saddha haqis raw full energy will gets your fists pumping air visuals are simply scintillating there would definitely be more indians holidaying prague kashmir now anil mehta deserves kudos cinematography kashmir will take your breath away but lapses quickly bring it back rockstar has great humor its refreshing see bollywood have well written clean neat humor its funny does leave you splits ideology that only pain begets music is little retarded though movie progresses at its own pace with music visuals rockstar is not statement or even tale most rock stars it just is ar rahman music is alone worth going film soulful very sufi nature 14 tracks movie are simply testament genius he is rawness music has addictive aura it will mesmerize you ranbir kapoor i must say has matured into fine young actor with lan crisp he blends several layers his character seamlessly into one hes not acting hes living it imitaz ali has definitely grown as director since jab we met love aaj kal rockstar is loosely based friend his but he manages pen it right this is definitely not his best work but it pulls through what you will find hard digest is logic used that leaves you numb aarti bajaj could have edited rockstar better make it edgy but you would not want change that because you would risk hurting soul rockstar nagris fakri is new katrina kaif has done outstanding job considering that this is her debut shammi kapoor spoke with his eyes what tribute it was him rockstar is no dabaang or singham not movie masses but it appeals you rb has charm keep you stuck screen frankly rockstar could be perfect cure ra one hangover its not great movie but it will suffice rid week its half baked chocolate cake who cares its chocolate anyway baked or half baked,0.5317688721534876,0.17439523617408234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,"A touching story with a bold treatment, imtiaz's treads uncharted waters","I believe good directors are great Narrators. That is what enables them to breathe life into a mere series of scenes. And when the story being told is their own or perhaps very close to them, they break the surly bonds of commercial success themes and formulas. Movie then becomes a ruthless pursuit to expose and convey the most naked emotions buried within the story. Many times such an attempt becomes an awkward experience for us as a viewer. Sometimes it turns into a masterpiece. Rockstar is the latter.This movie, too, is a signature imtiaz Ali movie where he yet again explores the most famous four lettered invention called ""Love"". However, this time its portrayed as an unverbalized camaraderie between a Jim Morrison idolizing artist, yearning to be a Rockstar, and a College sweetheart soon to be married off into affluence. Janardhan Jhakar (Ranbir K), is searching for a heartbreak to happen as it will fuel his creativity and hence his dream to be a rockstar. He bumps into Heer (Nargis Fakhri), believing getting dumped by her should seal the deal. But mindless fooling around soon blossoms undetected and before they know has grown into a chronic tumor of love.By the time they realize this its too late. Though it may seem formulaic, Imtiaz's treatment of the subject is very unique. So much that it transcends from a Raw human emotion to borderline supernatural and yet seems very beautifully plausible. People complain about a slow second half have missed the point. I guess they were waiting for something to happen while missing to savor some of the most beautiful unsaid portrayals of love.Imtiaz experiments with non-linear editing in this one and has done some really cool stuff. Its like a novel which tells you in the first 5 lines that the protagonists dies in the end and grips the reader wondering how did that come to pass. The Cinematography too is brilliant and has produced one of the most memorable scenes of Bollywood cinema. At least for me. To top it all off is a shell of fresh and innocent humor which helps the movie remain easy going and yet not loose its depth.Ranbir has arguably done a marvelous job, for his role is that of silent anguish, which can easily become one of a chronic constipation in the hands of a clumsy actor. He has also done one of the most close to reality portrayal of a guitarist within Bollywood and should be given credit for that.(looking at Rampal in rock on). Nargis is a Newcomer and is just that, a novice, however she is as beautiful as she is delicate and portrays her character well enough.Last but not the Least, A R Rehman, trademarks the soundtrack with Kun Faya and cranks up the distortion with Saada Haq. (it has liberal sprinkling of guitar riffs and some good ones at that). Orianthi lends her gifted talent to this song. The Music is a true soul of the movie.With a climax which can send jitters into many Bollywood directors this movie is definitely a feather in imtiaz Ali's Cap.A Must watch by me, but then I am a sucker for Imtiaz Ali movies, hence a Pinch of salt is advised.",touching story with bold treatment imtiazs treads uncharted waters,i believe good directors are great narrators that is what enables them breathe life into mere series scenes when story being told is their own or perhaps very close them they break surly bonds commercial success themes formulas movie then becomes ruthless pursuit expose convey most naked emotions buried within story many times such attempt becomes awkward experience us as viewer sometimes it turns into masterpiece rockstar is latter this movie too is signature imtiaz ali movie where he yet again explores most famous four lettered invention called love however this time its portrayed as unverbalized camaraderie between jim morrison idolizing artist yearning be rockstar college sweetheart soon be married off into affluence janardhan jhakar ranbir k is searching heartbreak happen as it will fuel his creativity hence his dream be rockstar he bumps into heer nargis fakhri believing getting dumped by her should seal deal but mindless fooling around soon blossoms undetected before they know has grown into chronic tumor love by time they realize this its too late though it may seem formulaic imtiazs treatment subject is very unique so much that it transcends raw human emotion borderline supernatural yet seems very beautifully plausible people complain about slow second half have missed point i guess they were waiting something happen while missing savor some most beautiful unsaid portrayals love imtiaz experiments with non linear editing this one has done some really cool stuff its like novel which tells you first 5 lines that protagonists dies end grips reader wondering how did that come pass cinematography too is brilliant has produced one most memorable scenes bollywood cinema at least me top it all off is shell fresh innocent humor which helps movie remain easy going yet not loose its depth ranbir has arguably done marvelous job his role is that silent anguish which can easily become one chronic constipation hands clumsy actor he has also done one most close reality portrayal guitarist within bollywood should be given credit that looking at rampal rock nargis is newcomer is just that novice however she is as beautiful as she is delicate portrays her character well enough last but not least r rehman trademarks soundtrack with kun faya cranks up distortion with saada haq it has liberal sprinkling guitar riffs some good ones at that orianthi lends her gifted talent this song music is true soul movie with climax which can send jitters into many bollywood directors this movie is definitely feather imtiaz alis cap must watch by me but then i am sucker imtiaz ali movies hence pinch salt is advised,0.5381656804733727,0.2196696252465483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,It rises above the level of entertainment and is like a smashing mirror on our face making us realize our own filthy self.,"ROCKSTAR is a winner all the way in the first half and the viewers are sure going to enjoy all the proceedings in its first hour with an intelligent direction, entertaining performances, perfect cinematography, realistic dialogues, believable characters and soothingly supporting soundtrack. Narrated mostly in flashback mode, the film is about the journey of a Rockstar who is basically suffering the consequences of his own indecisive character. Taking an inspiration from the real-life story of the famous & charismatic Rock-music Icon Jim Morrison, the script takes you inside the complex character of a popular STAR who majorly gets famous for the wrong reasons. The Ranbir-Nargis pairing looks ravishing on the screen with the traces of ""Geet"" from JAB WE MET in the characterization of Nargis. The writers beautifully explain the need of ""Some kind of Pain or Heartbreak"" in order to become an artist in a lighter mode, which later on takes a realistic shape in Janardan's life. The transformation sequences of Janardan becoming the famous Jordon are a treat to watch, especially the qawaali at Nizammudin Dargah and all in-studio scenes of Ranbir along with Piyush Mishra and the great Shammi Kapoor. So till the interval point, ROCKSTAR is totally an entertaining venture with something thrown in for all kind of audiences both in the major and the smaller centers (like the adult movie sequence).But all the commercial problems start post intermission where the film takes a drastic turn towards becoming a more enlightening experience than an entertaining one. And that's where most of the viewers are going to find it difficult to grasp as that is nothing compared to anything ordinary or easily understandable. In its second half, ROCKSTAR mostly talks about the inner conflicts of a big star and her beloved who are not ONE at the moment due to their own lack of will of taking the right decisions at the right time.Moreover, the last 30 minutes of the film and its purely enlightening climax, might be equal to the phrase of""Upar Se Nikal Gayi"" for many viewers particularly in the smaller centers. Because this very part of the movie takes it to another spiritual level where one gets to see the bitterness in the words ""SEX"" and ""GUILT"" clearly before his eyes, quite shamelessly. And in all probabilities of the world, where people don't like to get serious or listen to something about their own real life in a film, this abrupt and open ending of ROCKSTAR will not be taken sportingly by majority of the audience as well as critiques.Musically, the track ""Saada Haq, Aithey Rakh"" explains the inner clash & tension of a true artist perfectly. It is well supported by a brilliant camera-work equivalent to the International Standards, a superlative musical arrangement by the maestro (including the singing part by Mohit Chauhan) and some truly great lyrics by Irshad Kamil, which pump up the blood flowing in your body and you feel like standing and saying""Saaaaaada Haq, Aitheeeeey Rakh"".However, as a true die-hard fan of A.R. Rahman I would humbly like to say that I was really expecting a lot more from this soundtrack of ROCKSTAR. No doubt, it has got the few gems in the kitty but when it's the musical score by Rahman, of a film called ROCKSTAR, made by Imtiaz Ali, then its unarguably logical to expect something extra-ordinary in its each track. The songs other than ""Saada Haq"" and ""Kun Faaya"" need repeated listening to become likable and one can only relate with most of them after watching the film.In the performance department, this has a flawless, award winning act from Ranbir Kapoor going far beyond whatever glimpses you may have seen in the promos. Therefore this has to be the movie which Ranbir should feel proud of and only one man would be the happiest person to see this from his heavenly abode..his grandfather, the Legendary Showman Sh. Raj Kapoor. And I am sure that if he was alive today, then without thinking about the box office result of the film, he would have announced a big party calling every single person of the Industry to share this fabulous achievement of Ranbir.Nargis Fakhri as Heer gave me much more than my expectations. Therefore even though many friends may have some different things to say about her but I hugely cherished her performance undoubtedly and also must say that Imtiaz does have a special eye for beauties having a foreign link. So I am all game for seeing more of Nargis Fakhri very soon. Further, I simply loved watching one of my dearest legends Shammi Kapoor coming alive once again on the screen in a truly adorable cameo with his enigmatic presence. Piyush Mishra as the Music Company owner is as usual, fantastic along with another great supporting performance by the actor playing Ranbir's friend-manager. Aditi Rao Hydari becomes the victim of a wrong kind of suggestive characterization but Shernaz Patel does well in her short role. Technically ROCKSTAR excels in its Cinematography by Anil Mehta with perfect capturing of all On & Off stage sequences. The same can also be said about its styling and the dialogues, especially in the first half of the film, which straight away remind you of your own college days.So with ROCKSTAR, Imtiaz takes you onto the journey into the mind of a Creative Musician depicting his inner pain, love and hate in a splendid way. And in the process he insightfully reveals the truth that Yes, its a blessing to be a Creative as blessed by the Almighty. But at the same time, its also very painful to be there where you are given a different eye to look through everyone like a mirror and can feel the pain like nobody else.",it rises above level entertainment is like smashing mirror our face making us realize our own filthy self,rockstar is winner all way first half viewers are sure going enjoy all proceedings its first hour with intelligent

10.0,It is about a young successful musician how he become successful along with ups n down in love.,"Ranbir is committed in his disturbed Desi rocker avatar and his abstention from any intoxicants makes him an idol who wouldn't corrupt his worshipers. Nargis blends divine beauty with lips that jive like she's in the movie, 'Finding Nemo'.Watching 'Rockstar' once is like watching it many times over, thanks to the repeated montages that sporadically recap the film. If you thought being stabbed once was bad, here's what a knife set can do.The film drives home an unscientific hypothesis that people who've endured sufferings/ heart break/ loose motions etc will reach their creative best. By this logic, each person in the audience will be blessed with superhuman creativity as they step out after watching 'Rockstar'. Oh, yeah! Yeah!

8.0,Imtiaz Ali Best!!!! The real way how love story should be made.,"This is seriously Imtiaz's Best film yet!!!! When the movie end, i kept asking myself how is it possible to narrate a story like this... Story wise, absolutely amazing!!! What you guys will see in the trailer is just 1% of the movie!!!! Ranbir Kapoor was amazing too, balancing the right emotions at the right time. Some Amards should be waiting for him now... definitely AR Rahman stole the whole movie with 14 Top charting music!!!! Every Music suits the story every single time. Well he isn't called genius without a reason.For me, its the Best Album of the year and potentially the best movie if the year!!!! All Credits goes to Imtiaz Ali for such great story/content.",imtiaz ali best real way how love story should be made,this is seriously imtiazs best film yet when movie end i kept asking myself how is it possible narrate story like this story wise absolutely amazing what you guys will see trailer is just 1 movie ranbir kapoor was amazing too balancing right emotions at right time some amards should be waiting him now definitely ar rahman stole whole movie with 14 top charting music every music suits story every single time well he isnt called genius without reason me its best album year potentially best movie if year all credits goes imtiaz ali such great story content,0.5474937343358397,0.43508771929824563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,Typical Imtiaz Ali style movie,"For me it was the most awaited movie for this year, especially after listening to the awesome songs. First of all the music, Rehman and Irshad Kamil did fabulously well. The music and songs were totally different from the regular bollywood style.Ranbir was terrific and this was truly his best performance till date. He looked so natural that sometimes you feel that you are watching a live shot documentary or something.Imtiaz Ali's direction as always was very good. He has a different style of making movies and this movie is a great example of that. Though my personal favorite from his lot is Love Aaj Kal.The only loose part in the movie was Nargis. She was not up to the mark and some very good scenes and situations got spoiled because of her poor acting skills. And especially when pitted against the flawless Ranbir she looks pathetic to say the least. So, without disclosing anything from the story I'd say its a great movie and you surely can't afford to miss it.",typical imtiaz ali style movie,me it was most awaited movie this year especially after listening awesome songs first all music rehman irshad kamil did fabulously well music songs were totally different regular bollywood style ranbir was terrific this was truly his best performance till date he looked so natural that sometimes you feel that you are watching live shot documentary or something imtiaz alis direction as always was very good he has different style making movies this movie is great example that though my personal favorite his lot is love aaj kal only loose part movie was nargis she was not up mark some very good scenes situations got spoiled because her poor acting skills especially when pitted against flawless ranbir she looks pathetic say least so without disclosing anything story id say its great movie you surely cant afford miss it,0.6309458689458689,0.24542579642579643,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.12}"
