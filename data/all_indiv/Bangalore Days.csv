10.0,The One thing You Must Watch.....,"I started to watch the movie with excitement....Every one hated Multistar movies(20-20.christian brothers...).But watching this movie will change that prejudice... Movie starts with slow pace and it become a race of humor,emotions,love.Every one,each one of the character have something special........ Bangalore Days Review The movie starts with Nivin Pauly introducing other characters. Divya (Nazriya), Aju(Dulquer) and Kuttan (Nivin) are childhood friends, living in Kerala. Their characters also are very different from each other. Divya is a very charming bubbly girl, Kuttan is a very normal guy and Aju a wanderer. Their ambition is to go to Bangalore one day and celebrate life for a few days in the garden city. Certain unavoidable circumstances lead to Divya's marriage with a guy (Fahad) who has extremely opposite character of her. Fahad is a well employed, serious & rough guy who is settled in Bangalore. After wedding Divya moves to Bangalore with husband. Eventually Kuttan and Aju also come down to Bangalore for various reasons. At this moment Fahad has to leave to US for an official assignment which leaves the childhood friends again together in the city where they once dreamed of coming. What happens next is the soul of the movie. The initial combination scenes between the friends are damn funny. Nivin leads the fun parade from the front. His physical transformation to impress Isha Talwar is a fun ride. The film is close to three hours which is too long in Mollywood. The second half starts with a lag and gets interesting towards the twist. Dulquer's love track was dragging but he was too good in his rough avatar and especially in the climax. The bike racing during the climax is excellent. Though Fahad was a bit silent in the first half, was at his best towards the end. All other supporting cast were good. Overall this movie has A HUGE HIT written all over it. Into the technical side, songs are great to listen as well as watch. Nice camera work and top notch back ground music. Excellent script and direction.Ending was good...Emotional story A MUST WATCH!!!!!!!!",one thing you must watch,i started watch movie with excitement every one hated multistar movies 20 20 christian brothers but watching this movie will change that prejudice movie starts with slow pace it become race humor emotions love every one each one character have something special bangalore days review movie starts with nivin pauly introducing other characters divya nazriya aju dulquer kuttan nivin are childhood friends living kerala their characters also are very different each other divya is very charming bubbly girl kuttan is very normal guy aju wanderer their ambition is go bangalore one day celebrate life few days garden city certain unavoidable circumstances lead divyas marriage with guy fahad who has extremely opposite character her fahad is well employed serious rough guy who is settled bangalore after wedding divya moves bangalore with husband eventually kuttan aju also come down bangalore various reasons at this moment fahad has leave us official assignment which leaves childhood friends again together city where they once dreamed coming what happens next is soul movie initial combination scenes between friends are damn funny nivin leads fun parade front his physical transformation impress isha talwar is fun ride film is close three hours which is too long mollywood second half starts with lag gets interesting towards twist dulquers love track was dragging but he was too good his rough avatar especially climax bike racing during climax is excellent though fahad was bit silent first half was at his best towards end all other supporting cast were good overall this movie has huge hit written all over it into technical side songs are great listen as well as watch nice camera work top notch back ground music excellent script direction ending was good emotional story must watch,0.4448253968253968,0.17658412698412695,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8.0,A Jovial Romantic Drama Poised With Laudable Performances.,"Bangalore days is full of life. The movie talks about the tale of three cousins who travel to Bangalore in the pursuit of chasing their dreams.The story revolves around the journeys of these three twenty- somethings and how each one of them cops up in accordance to the twists and turns in their individual lives. Because it consists of a prestigious star cast, the expectation bar among the viewers regarding the flick was too high. And let me tell you, it is unmitigatedly worth the hype! The film is incorporated with appreciable transitions, commendable drollery, a congenial run time of 170 minutes and one of the most pleasurable story lines. All these factors bolstered by exquisite performances add to the film's charm fashioning it into a complete package.Kudos to the person who took the task of assembling such an effulgent movie troupe. Nivin Pauly, as one of the three main leads, was as natural as he could have been. Also, the way he narrates their journey diversifies the script making it even more delectable. Nazriya, as the main female lead is creditable. She is much blessed with the skill of exhibiting emotional scenes and is bound to get better with age. Out of the three leads, Dulquer Salman's portrayal was paramount. Enacting the character of a rowdy biker driven by complex emotions is not a piece of cake, but Salman has hit the spot effortlessly. Fahadh Fasil has been the cream of the crop while enacting his part that of an angry young husband, his performance was just simply flawless! Parvathy Menon as RJ Sarah was like a cherry on the top, she definitely managed to make an impression. Other minor roles played by Isha Talwar and Kalpana were mediocre as well. Anjali Menon has unambiguously managed to make a hit with her 2nd major directorial venture. Also, a distinguished and wondrous screenplay leaves you mesmerized. Editing and Cinematography departments have definitely aced at their respective jobs. All the locations from Kerala and Bangalore have been impeccably put on the big screen. Music and other background scores by Gopi Sunder too were very much above average. Summarizing everything, Bangalore days is a perfect blend of meritorious drama, affable romance and rollicking comicality. Lovely is the word for it! People who take pleasure in watching jolly youth dramas and love stories will surely fall in love with this one.",jovial romantic drama poised with laudable performances,bangalore days is full life movie talks about tale three cousins who travel bangalore pursuit chasing their dreams story revolves around journeys these three twenty somethings how each one them cops up accordance twists turns their individual lives because it consists prestigious star cast expectation bar among viewers regarding flick was too high let me tell you it is unmitigatedly worth hype film is incorporated with appreciable transitions commendable drollery congenial run time 170 minutes one most pleasurable story lines all these factors bolstered by exquisite performances add films charm fashioning it into complete package kudos person who took task assembling such effulgent movie troupe nivin pauly as one three main leads was as natural as he could have been also way he narrates their journey diversifies script making it even more delectable nazriya as main female lead is creditable she is much blessed with skill exhibiting emotional scenes is bound get better with age out three leads dulquer salmans portrayal was paramount enacting character rowdy biker driven by complex emotions is not piece cake but salman has hit spot effortlessly fahadh fasil has been cream crop while enacting his part that angry young husband his performance was just simply flawless parvathy menon as rj sarah was like cherry top she definitely managed make impression other minor roles played by isha talwar kalpana were mediocre as well anjali menon has unambiguously managed make hit with her 2nd major directorial venture also distinguished wondrous screenplay leaves you mesmerized editing cinematography departments have definitely aced at their respective jobs all locations kerala bangalore have been impeccably put big screen music other background scores by gopi sunder too were very much above average summarizing everything bangalore days is perfect blend meritorious drama affable romance rollicking comicality lovely is word it people who take pleasure watching jolly youth dramas love stories will surely fall love with this one,0.5027371273712737,0.20745934959349593,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"

7.0,There's A Charm In Every Single Factor Except One. ♦ 73%,"Yes, that's right. Since the first poster broke out in March disclosing the brilliant ensemble cast, it had started gathering moss. Anjali Menon fabulously handled her casting and struck the right chord with people who are now looking more for abstract, youth-driven films than boring dramas or idiotic slapstick. Her Manjadikuru failed to impress, but her Ustad Hotel was one hell of a film made right. With Bangalore Days, she not only explores the niceties of film-making but also throws out a vivid picture of how charming movies can be.I have hardly seen brilliant introductions like this in Malayalam films; Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Ellipathayam says everything it wants to with its starting & ending scenes. The three main characters, played wonderfully by Pauly, Nazria & Salman give a head-start to the plot that revolves around their lives' roller-coaster ride. Partly set in Kerala & Bangalore, the story moves forward as they face life's everyday difficulties. Their friendship is cute.Then Fahadh Faasil enters the plot and introduces drama. His portrayal is, as always, fantastic. Individual stories pop in as Nivin Pauly effortlessly tries & succeeds in making the audience roar with laughter. His nuanced, slightly effeminate air is brilliant and I loved him the most. Dulquer Salman is raw as a dirt-biker who plays a nomad with no aim in life. As the three tackle their issues of love, marriage, family & the whole game of life, few twists and minor turns enter the scene and enthrall the audience.Rocky BG score and good songs steer our attention. Cinematography by Thahir is good but not his best while I am still charmed with the overall art department. Supporting cast is very good and the cameos by Nithya Menon & Isha Talwar is laudable. The newcomer is sweet.The second half is where we realize the ploy: that drama has been converted to comedy without slipping into melodrama. The gap between drama & comedy should always be maintained and that is where Menon fails with Bangalore Days. She tries too smart to induce humor into everything which leaves the brainy part of the audience go numb with gimmicky overture. Then the minor flaws start to stumble out of the cupboard. I am not mentioning those tiny anachronistic goofs, but I wonder why no one noticed that ironically the only Kannada language the film has is mere 2 words that Pauly exchanges with a shopkeeper. About the story: three cousins who happen to be great friends but haven't met in years; their lives are affected by each other's; few ups and downs; they help each other to find the right path; happy ending. Haven't you seen this setup before? Ironically, the characters themselves say that there is nothing like ""Happily Ever After"" which now makes me wanna question the makers' intentions. ""Let us mint some high moolah with the hackneyed story I have, shall we?""No, we are not that dumb to believe that Bangalorians only speak English or Hindi is a staple language; not to mention how people don't mind locking their lips mid-street. It wonderfully succeeds in tarnishing the reputation of Bangalore, in a way. Then we start to observe the story itself which has fabrications everywhere written on it in the last 30 minutes. All it shows can never happen in real life and people who think can are being fooled. Maybe the imagination got too much out of the box.The main twist is credible but the ending could've been more polished in order to not make it look like a fairy tale unfolding in a merry ending. This confirms that Menon has her limitations and can only construct a script made out of clichés, stereotype-busters & surrealistic contrivance. But I gotta strain that she does it well. Anyway, the huge amount of humor and for the charismatic visual extravaganza it is, Bangalore Days is one of the very, very, very few films that are both worth watchable & enjoyable.BOTTOM LINE: Except with the creatively propagandist story, Bangalore Days is a must watch this weekend with friends, family & relatives alike for there is not a single factor that prevents you from being entertained. Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

10.0,Stunning Film of Three Cousins and their Three life partners,"Bangalore Days was a new era for both elders and youngsters. Probably, the enormous cast such as Nivin Pauly, Nazriya, Dulquer, Fahadh Faasil, made this film a blockbuster and 2nd Most Grossing Film in the History of Malayalam Film till that time. Of course, this was the film that New Generation was looking for. This film was almost like Twenty:20 in 2009. Not because of the story, but the enormous cast. The crew of Bangalore Days including Direction and cinematography was outstanding and spectacular. The film, according to me, is outstanding and an entertaining family movie. Gopi Sunder does his job stunningly than he done before for any film. Why did Meenakshi simply double-crossed Kuttan alias Krishnan P? P? He was a just a poor traditional guy. All genuinely shown tenderness towards that poor guy! DQ, the Great, you are legend like your father. Nithya Menon had a comeback after a short period of time to Mollywood via this film. Parvathy (RJ Sarah) had a amazing comeback after the blockbuster NoteBook. Nazriya Nazim and Fahadh Faasil also done a great job to make this film a blockbuster! Gopi Sunder was amazing, Anjali was extraordinary, Camera was OK.Adult Film - No | Family film - Obviously | Direction - 9.5/10 | Cinematography - 7/10 | Cast - 10/10 | Make Up - 6/10 | Songs - 9.5/10 | Background Score - 9.5/10 | Story - 9.5/10 | Climax - 8/10 | Art Direction - 7/10 | Location Department - 10/10 | Overall - 8.7/10 | My Rating - 10/10",stunning film three cousins their three life partners,bangalore days was new era both elders youngsters probably enormous cast such as nivin pauly nazriya dulquer fahadh faasil made this film blockbuster 2nd most grossing film history malayalam film till that time course this was film that new generation was looking this film was almost like twenty 20 2009 not because story but enormous cast crew bangalore days including direction cinematography was outstanding spectacular film according me is outstanding entertaining family movie gopi sunder does his job stunningly than he done before any film why did meenakshi simply double crossed kuttan alias krishnan p p he was just poor traditional guy all genuinely shown tenderness towards that poor guy dq great you are legend like your father nithya menon had comeback after short period time mollywood via this film parvathy rj sarah had amazing comeback after blockbuster notebook nazriya nazim fahadh faasil also done great job make this film blockbuster gopi sunder was amazing anjali was extraordinary camera was ok adult film no family film obviously direction 9 5 10 cinematography 7 10 cast 10 10 make up 6 10 songs 9 5 10 background score 9 5 10 story 9 5 10 climax 8 10 art direction 7 10 location department 10 10 overall 8 7 10 my rating 10 10,0.6217532467532468,0.25735930735930734,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.26}"
7.0,"A Love-Hate Story; Loved the Bangalore, Hated the ""Days""","No, its not a bad movie, but its definitely not worth the hype. First things first, the movie is blessed with an awesomely energetic cast. The first 20 minutes were a breeze, thanks to the lightheartedness, the mockery of our Nair Tharavadus and Nivin Pauly, this despite that wedding song (Thun thuna ney na... and than thana ney na... where do you come up with such deep lyrics I wonder!). It feels like Anjali Menon is picking up from where she left us at the end of ""Manjadikuru"", letting us know what happened to those cousins as they grew up.The movie follows three (and a half) different story arcs of the three (and a half) main leads connected by their intermittent get-together at Rasta Cafe (I give it to them for their will to drive 50 KMs routinely through the Bangalore traffic for some coffee).Dulquer plays the cool dude, the biker, the rebel, the go-to guy, the RJ stalker among other things with a look that has become quite a regular with him now. He might soon start getting type cast. But then he carries it off so well. Nivin plays the simpleton trying to get along with the city life. However caricaturish the role and performance, I just loved the character and this was the track I liked the most. Nasriya plays the lighthearted girl who gets into an arranged marriage way too early and to someone who doesn't make it easy, played seamlessly well by Fahad, despite the boring/unconvincing character (and that's where we get the half character and story arc).Of the 2 other main characters, Parvathy gets a meaty role and plays it to perfection, while Isha gets a role that suits her very well - of looking good and breaking hearts (with none of the innocence of her earlier role in a thattum). And then there is Kalpana who cracks us up in the second half and of course Vijayaraghavan in that one scene where he is only heard...brilliant! Nithya Menon in her cameo is, well, BAD and yes, it does breaks my heart to say that.Despite the superficiality, the movie entertains in parts, but not as a whole. It stretches so, especially the Nasriya-Fahad track which is the least convincing and boring. Dulquer's track is predictable till the entry of Parvathy Menon. She has a very interesting character to play and without giving away any spoilers, keeps things from going downhill. Coming to the highlight of the movie (to me), its Kuttan, played by Nivin Pauly. That innocent, simpleton who finds it almost impossible to get along with the new lifestyle, the one who gawks at people kissing in public, but can't accept it. The reason behind the mallu hypocrisy which many fail to see.The movie handles the arranged marriage, the transition of a naive young boy to the city lifestyle and such nuances very well. Music is just about good, the background score though should not have been so obviously plagiarized. Scenes and locations are great, after all, the movie focuses on good looking faces and places. Like my cousin's 5-year old said, ""Wow! No garbage on Bangalore roads!!!"" You need some serious cinematography talent or CGI to achieve that.At the end, Bangalore Days, ends up being a Malayalam movie in Bollywood format, a ""Dil Chahta Hai"" for us. You got the multi star cast, you got the good looking people and locations, you even got the wedding song and dance... its got the works. A""Karan Johar""-ization of Malayalam cinema (of course at a much better quality). You know the kind, where someone, who is seemingly an entry level employee at an IT services firm (which has a training center at Mysore...now which one was that?) but lives in a fully furnished Confident group ka flat, all ALONE (no roommates and no scope to share rent). He hasn't even been onsite yet!! Since when did they start paying so well??? Come on guys, please set realistic expectations. Anjali Menon, you should make more responsible movies. Now, how am I gonna explain to my relatives that we don't live like that here! Finally, did I like the movie? Well, I've got a love-hate thing going for ""Bangalore Days"". Loved that someone attempted a decent ""Dedication to Bangalore from a Malayalee"" and Hated that they deviated mid way. Loved the cousin camaraderie and Bangalore parts, Hated that it turned into a candy-floss, cliché' ridden, Bollywood-ization of Malayalam Cinema. Loved the Nivin Pauly character and the half-decent Dulquer track, but absolutely Hated the Nasria story.",love hate story loved bangalore hated days,no its not bad movie but its definitely not worth hype first things first movie is blessed with awesomely energetic cast first 20 minutes were breeze thanks lightheartedness mockery our nair tharavadus nivin pauly this despite that wedding song thun thuna ney na than thana ney na where do you come up with such deep lyrics i wonder it feels like anjali menon is picking up where she left us at end manjadikuru letting us know what happened those cousins as they grew up movie follows three half different story arcs three half main leads connected by their intermittent get together at rasta cafe i give it them their will drive 50 kms routinely through bangalore traffic some coffee dulquer plays cool dude biker rebel go guy rj stalker among other things with look that has become quite regular with him now he might soon start getting type cast but then he carries it off so well nivin plays simpleton trying get along with city life however caricaturish role performance i just loved character this was track i liked most nasriya plays lighthearted girl who gets into arranged marriage way too early someone who doesnt make it easy played seamlessly well by fahad despite boring unconvincing character thats where we get half character story arc 2 other main characters parvathy gets meaty role plays it perfection while isha gets role that suits her very well looking good breaking hearts with none innocence her earlier role thattum then there is kalpana who cracks us up second half course vijayaraghavan that one scene where he is only heard brilliant nithya menon her cameo is well bad yes it does breaks my heart say that despite superficiality movie entertains parts but not as whole it stretches so especially nasriya fahad track which is least convincing boring dulquers track is predictable till entry parvathy menon she has very interesting character play without giving away any spoilers keeps things going downhill coming highlight movie me its kuttan played by nivin pauly that innocent simpleton who finds it almost impossible get along with new lifestyle one who gawks at people kissing public but cant accept it reason behind mallu hypocrisy which many fail see movie handles arranged marriage transition naive young boy city lifestyle such nuances very well music is just about good background score though should not have been so obviously plagiarized scenes locations are great after all movie focuses good looking faces places like my cousins 5 year old said wow no garbage bangalore roads you need some serious cinematography talent or cgi achieve that at end bangalore days ends up being malayalam movie bollywood format dil chahta hai us you got multi star cast you got good looking people locations you even got wedding song dance its got works karan johar ization malayalam cinema course at much better quality you know kind where someone who is seemingly entry level employee at it services firm which has training center at mysore now which one was that but lives fully furnished confident group ka flat all alone no roommates no scope share rent he hasnt even been onsite yet since when did they start paying so well come guys please set realistic expectations anjali menon you should make more responsible movies now how am i gonna explain my relatives that we dont live like that here finally did i like movie well ive got love hate thing going bangalore days loved that someone attempted decent dedication bangalore malayalee hated that they deviated mid way loved cousin camaraderie bangalore parts hated that it turned into candy floss clich ridden bollywood ization malayalam cinema loved nivin pauly character half decent dulquer track but absolutely hated nasria story,0.5364371424030513,0.08160296143250688,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"

The plot is nice and different-something that we don't usually get in Malayalam movies but it doesn't deserve a 10. It's a decent flick that makes you smile at the love the characters have for each other and the simplicity of the story but it's a movie that can only be watched once. It sticks in your mind, sure, but only for a short while. It's a good movie with great acting (and amazing songs) but not one that leaves a lasting impression.

Nivin pauly tries hard in comedy but does not succeed much. Dulquer tries to look menacing but does not come up to the mark. Nazriya is really bad. The story turns melodramatic and songs are there for no reason. Songs were actually good, but there is no context for these songs in the movie. And what's with putting the setting as Bangalore? Seriously, this story could've taken place in any of the cities of India. Kochi would've been fine. I won't say this is a complete failure. It is only overrated.

8.0,"Each Maalyalam movie is a different experience, Bangalore Days was no different and a great experience that too!","Bangalore Days opens with a narrative style of Navin Pouli - the story is about 3 cousins and their different temperaments and lives.Though each personality is very different from one other, their bond which is portrayed through an excellent screenplay is what makes the film special. In these days where own families do not support each other when things get tough, this movie portrays how these 3 cousins stay together through thick and thin. Coming to the characters: Divya/Nazriya - Resilient, sharp witted and independent in the true sense; is exceptional. Her portrayal of how a modern Indian woman is expected to conform is spot on but her free spirit is destined to do much more. Kutta/Navin - The quintessential small town software engineer, who wants to explore new places, earn money but finally wants a homely girl who will cook for him and serve him. Arjun/Dilquer - The romeo, the free spirit who doesn't care for rules or perceptions. Extremely impulsive, he does what his heart tells him to do. This character is the glue in the 3 lives, and brings the whole story to life. Finally, Mr. Das/Fahd - the brooding/depressed/chauvinistic husband who is actually not any of the above but his past has made him who he is today. Well portrayed by Fahd. The RJ and short appearance by Menon along with all the supporting family members add to the chutzpah of the movie. This movie will make you laugh and cry.

9.0,Desires last 60 days; lust 30.,"The stories of the silver screen and fairy tales make us believe that it is worthwhile to grasp that one chance at love. They convince us that it the single most crucial fight that one has to win. Overcoming that would translate to eternal bliss. It is happiness afterwards, forever and ever. Err... wrong answer.In a very entertaining way, combining the scenic backgrounds of Kerala and Bangaluru, as well as the pleasing youthful features of the good looking actors, the story tries to tell us in a subtle way that it is not all hunky-dory when and especially after one finds love. It is an eternal struggle to keep the flames alive. Even if the ember stays aglow, there are too many interferences that threatened its harmony. In modern living, with the relaxation of rigid social restrictions that used to prevail and the scream of empowerment, no one can be pinned down anymore. Everybody is free to do what he (or she) wants. Is that daring to be different, to empower oneself, defiance to status or plain lazy to uphold the age-old agreed norms that rock the whole fabric of marital bliss? Or is it that the desire to defend the holy institution of marriage that makes one overlook or tolerate the many imperfections of the other?The story revolves around three cousins (Kuttan, Arjun and Divya) who are close as thick as thieves sharing an unforgettable childhood and the same sense of humour.Arjun, a son of an army man, went wayward after his parents divorced. We get the sense that he attributes his failure in life to his parents' separation. From a top student, he ended up being a dirt-bike racer and an occasional mechanic. His love interest turns out to be wheelchair-bound paraplegic. The positive thing about the film is the paraplegic character actually had a positive. Unlike a typical India movie where a far from 'perfect' person will usually sacrifice her life, here she is paved the way for a possible happy experience.Happy forever and ever?Kuttan is a goody-two-shoes who followed all the pointers given by his parents and is a software engineer. One day, Kuttan's father disappeared from their home. He left a note citing his desire to find peace and purpose in life. A subsequent letter clarifies that he actually must be enjoying himself in the laid back beaches of Goa, away from the smothering of his wife, Kuttan's mother. Kuttan also realises that his mother, though meaning well, could be quite a pain in the neck when she moved in with him. Meanwhile, Kuttan is also finding love, naively thinking that a nice traditional Kerala girl would be ideal. His first love, a stewardess, proved disappointing. She used him to get back to her ex-boyfriend!Divya, the only female of the trio, undergoes an arranged marriage to Shiva. After the wedding, Shiva and Divya move to Bangalore. By a twist of fate, her cousins land up in Bangalore. Divya soon discovers that her husband is far from intimate. Their marriage goes through a tailspin. Soon it is found that Shiva keeps a dark secret from his past.The rest of the story is in trying to tie up everybody's life to a resolution and a happy ending. Inserted subtly into scenes are cryptic messages which tend to answer itself. One visible message is how Indians tend to parrot Western's way of dressing and embracing their culture while the Westerners look highly at the Indian way of living and cannot wait to immerse into them.At the end of the film, Kuttan, who was looking out for a typical Bharat Natyam dancing Malayalee with long pleats for matrimony, found one in Michelle, a Caucasian girl fitting the above description!",desires last 60 days lust 30,stories silver screen fairy tales make us believe that it is worthwhile grasp that one chance at love they convince us that it single most crucial fight that one has win overcoming that would translate eternal bliss it is happiness afterwards forever ever err wrong answer very entertaining way combining scenic backgrounds kerala bangaluru as well as pleasing youthful features good looking actors story tries tell us subtle way that it is not all hunky dory when especially after one finds love it is eternal struggle keep flames alive even if ember stays aglow there are too many interferences that threatened its harmony modern living with relaxation rigid social restrictions that used prevail scream empowerment no one can be pinned down anymore everybody is free do what he or she wants is that daring be different empower oneself defiance status or plain lazy uphold age old agreed norms that rock whole fabric marital bliss or is it that desire defend holy institution marriage that makes one overlook or tolerate many imperfections other story revolves around three cousins kuttan arjun divya who are close as thick as thieves sharing unforgettable childhood same sense humour arjun son army man went wayward after his parents divorced we get sense that he attributes his failure life his parents separation top student he ended up being dirt bike racer occasional mechanic his love interest turns out be wheelchair bound paraplegic positive thing about film is paraplegic character actually had positive unlike typical india movie where far perfect person will usually sacrifice her life here she is paved way possible happy experience happy forever ever kuttan is goody two shoes who followed all pointers given by his parents is software engineer one day kuttans father disappeared their home he left note citing his desire find peace purpose life subsequent letter clarifies that he actually must be enjoying himself laid back beaches goa away smothering his wife kuttans mother kuttan also realises that his mother though meaning well could be quite pain neck when she moved with him meanwhile kuttan is also finding love naively thinking that nice traditional kerala girl would be ideal his first love stewardess proved disappointing she used him get back her ex boyfriend divya only female trio undergoes arranged marriage shiva after wedding shiva divya move bangalore by twist fate her cousins land up bangalore divya soon discovers that her husband is far intimate their marriage goes through tailspin soon it is found that shiva keeps dark secret his past rest story is trying tie up everybodys life resolution happy ending inserted subtly into scenes are cryptic messages which tend answer itself one visible message is how indians tend parrot westerns way dressing embracing their culture while westerners look highly at indian way living cannot wait immerse into them at end film kuttan who was looking out typical bharat natyam dancing malayalee with long pleats matrimony found one michelle caucasian girl fitting above description,0.5191274651274653,0.16019923039923037,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"

8.0,"Bangalore days, a great entertainer, perfectly blended with emotions, passion, dreams, romance, positivities, family relationships etc  The impact would linger on for sure","Please read my review at http://moviereviewsbybinduc.blogspot.in/2014/06/bangalore-days.htmlBangalore Days, a very youthful, vibrant, peppy and entertaining movie by director Anjali Menon. She has tried to beautifully capture various individual behaviours / perceptions, lovely camaraderie / friendship among cousins, positive outlook towards life in spite of personal hiccups / challenges, individuals having different outlook towards a situation, passion to fulfill one's dreams etc. She has successfully justified various characters. The beauty of Anjali's work is that she has not tried to be preachy, but makes us believe that every individual has their own frame of reference i.e. perception towards life. Anjali facilitates us to think that it would be unfair to justify a particular outlook towards life / things, rather every individual has a reason / logic behind his or her choices. The title is almost justified with all the three main protagonists landing up in Bangalore and the twists and turns happening in their lives in this city, which is the utopia every Malayali youngster wishes to escape to in search of his dreams (as projected in the movie). The movie begins with the narration of Kuttan aka Krishnan PP (Nivin Pauly), a techie, who is in midst of a job interview and grabs the offer to join at Bangalore after completing his training at Mysore. He is a hard-core Malayali at heart, who loves everything about Kerala. Then he introduces his cousin vivacious and bubbly Kunju aka Divya Prakash (Nazriya Nazim) who aspires to pursue MBA from IIM and then be an entrepreneur. Another cousin carefree Aju aka Arjun (Dulqar Salman) is shown to have the courage to create his own rules of life, who pursues his dreams passionately, whether it is to be a graffiti-artist, or bike- racing or repairing the bikes / vintage cars. Kuttan, Kunju and Aju have great bonding since childhood, who took different paths after school, but yes, their relationships remained intact. If Kuttan is shown as traditional Malayali guy who wants Kerala touch in every aspects of his life, Aju is projected as a rebel who doesn't believe in giving answers to anyone, but he creates his own sets of questions and answers, Kunju is traditional enough to bid adieu to her IIM dreams and get married for parents' sake to Das (Fahadh Faasil), yet assertive enough to get her due share in relationship. A beautiful song 'Mangalyam' is there when Kuttan, Aju and Kunju dance together during Kunju's marriage celebrations. They look so good together. Ultimately, all three of them reach Bangalore: Kuttan for his IT job, Aju for his bike-repairing assignments, and Kunju shifting from Kerala to Das' apartment in Bangalore after marriage. Das is a workaholic, who loves his own privacy and remains confined to himself most of the time. Kunju is just opposite, and extrovert, full of life and adaptive as well. Das seems an odd man out amongst Kunju, Kuttan and Aju. Whenever Das goes for outstation trips, three of them just hang out together and have a blast. Lot of light hearted as well as great moments are shown in the movie viz. Aju, Kuttan and Kunju teasing each other, Kuttan's fantasies about falling in love with the Malayali Airhostess Meenakshi (Isha Talwar), Kunju inviting almost all the neighbours for tea at home, RJ Sarah (Parvathy)'s compering with lot of positive messages for the listeners, Aju falling in love with the positivity of Sarah and his effort to surprise her with his impulsive visit to the studio etc. Anjali has definitely taken a very realistic and balanced approach in this movie. When there are so many light moments in the movie, every character is also shown facing a few challenges of their own viz. Aju's impulsiveness and brash attitude, Das not being able to get over his past of Natasha (Nithya Menon), Kunju's disappointments and void in her life due to stoic Das, Kuttan's failed relationship, Das not being able to move on in his life (his past plays a pivotal point in the movie), Shobha (Praveena, Kunju's mother)'s obsession towards astrology etc. Rather every character is a story in itself. Certain serious instances viz. marital disharmony is also projected very lightly viz. Kuttan's father wanting to breathe after suffocating for years in marriage and mother wanting to break free from the confines of a small village and to enjoy the excitement of living in cities or even abroad. Script has fabulous humour to project partners having different perspectives and outlooks. The movie has ensemble cast who have given magnificent performances. All of them fit in so well with their characters.",bangalore days great entertainer perfectly blended with emotions passion dreams romance positivities family relationships etc impact would linger sure,please read my review at days very youthful vibrant peppy entertaining movie by director anjali menon she has tried beautifully capture various individual behaviours perceptions lovely camaraderie friendship among cousins positive outlook towards life spite personal hiccups challenges individuals having different outlook towards situation passion fulfill ones dreams etc she has successfully justified various characters beauty anjalis work is that she has not tried be preachy but makes us believe that every individual has their own frame reference i e perception towards life anjali facilitates us think that it would be unfair justify particular outlook towards life things rather every individual has reason logic behind his or her choices title is almost justified with all three main protagonists landing up bangalore twists turns happening their lives this city which is utopia every malayali youngster wishes escape search his dreams as projected movie movie begins with narration kuttan aka krishnan pp nivin pauly techie who is midst job interview grabs offer join at bangalore after completing his training at mysore he is hard core malayali at heart who loves everything about kerala then he introduces his cousin vivacious bubbly kunju aka divya prakash nazriya nazim who aspires pursue mba iim then be entrepreneur another cousin carefree aju aka arjun dulqar salman is shown have courage create his own rules life who pursues his dreams passionately whether it is be graffiti artist or bike racing or repairing bikes vintage cars kuttan kunju aju have great bonding since childhood who took different paths after school but yes their relationships remained intact if kuttan is shown as traditional malayali guy who wants kerala touch every aspects his life aju is projected as rebel who doesnt believe giving answers anyone but he creates his own sets questions answers kunju is traditional enough bid adieu her iim dreams get married parents sake das fahadh faasil yet assertive enough get her due share relationship beautiful song mangalyam is there when kuttan aju kunju dance together during kunjus marriage celebrations they look so good together ultimately all three them reach bangalore kuttan his it job aju his bike repairing assignments kunju shifting kerala das apartment bangalore after marriage das is workaholic who loves his own privacy remains confined himself most time kunju is just opposite extrovert full life adaptive as well das seems odd man out amongst kunju kuttan aju whenever das goes outstation trips three them just hang out together have blast lot light hearted as well as great moments are shown movie viz aju kuttan kunju teasing each other kuttans fantasies about falling love with malayali airhostess meenakshi isha talwar kunju inviting almost all neighbours tea at home rj sarah parvathy s compering with lot positive messages listeners aju falling love with positivity sarah his effort surprise her with his impulsive visit studio etc anjali has definitely taken very realistic balanced approach this movie when there are so many light moments movie every character is also shown facing few challenges their own viz ajus impulsiveness brash attitude das not being able get over his past natasha nithya menon kunjus disappointments void her life due stoic das kuttans failed relationship das not being able move his life his past plays pivotal point movie shobha praveena kunjus mother s obsession towards astrology etc rather every character is story itself certain serious instances viz marital disharmony is also projected very lightly viz kuttans father wanting breathe after suffocating years marriage mother wanting break free confines small village enjoy excitement living cities or even abroad script has fabulous humour project partners having different perspectives outlooks movie has ensemble cast who have given magnificent performances all them fit so well with their characters,0.6049722791828054,0.21630041011619958,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.48}"

1.0,Laughable. Pathetically overrated film.,"Seriously, such high ratings for this? Lmao. Where do I start about this horrible film? Started watching Malayalam films in the lockdown. While many films I found amazing, this disappointed me to the core. I'm still laughing at such high ratings and YouTube reviews raving about this film being a fantastic flick and all that.The characters are really bad and one dimensional. Filled with plot holes, this film is so bad that it is actually funny. The director seems to have no clue how to make a film decent enough. I don't know what's the reason. I can't for the life of me comprehend how this badly made film was appreciated by so many.The only likeable thing was Fahad Fazil's character initially, who also I didn't like towards the end when his past comes up. I could relate only to him, like how he finds it hard to tolerate those dumb and idiotic cousins. Especially the ""cool"" guy who has hardly any manners. Also the bond that these cousins share, doesn't feel very natural. It honestly felt quite forced.Like don't they have any friends? Especially with the cool guy, you'd expect him to have many friends but still chooses to hang out with his cousins, one being a super boring IT engineer sorta nerdy guy. At times it felt like that guy and his female cousins were into an arrangement sort of thing. Honestly, with the way they were behaving, hiding from their relatives, etc it felt like they were more than cousins lol.While there are so many things in this movie that are beyond silly and laughable, the songs are the only respite that the movie is able to provide. The wedding song is good and then later when they the cousins hang out at the theatre, go for a bike ride and stuff a cool song plays. The guitar playing and melody of it add a nice feel to the song. Also there is one song in the film which is the same tune as Summer of '69 which is painfully bad.If it weren't for the songs and Fahad Fazil I would rank this film as #1 in The most horrible and Overrated films ever list, but they are the only saving grace. Without the songs and Mr Fazil, this movie would for me be not just the worst Malayalam film, but the worst film ever.I would give this film a 4 as it has some redeeming qualities at least, but in my hopes to bring down the ludicrous ratings which currently stand at 8.3, I give this film a 1/10.",laughable pathetically overrated film,seriously such high ratings this lmao where do i start about this horrible film started watching malayalam films lockdown while many films i found amazing this disappointed me core im still laughing at such high ratings youtube reviews raving about this film being fantastic flick all that characters are really bad one dimensional filled with plot holes this film is so bad that it is actually funny director seems have no clue how make film decent enough i dont know whats reason i cant life me comprehend how this badly made film was appreciated by so many only likeable thing was fahad fazils character initially who also i didnt like towards end when his past comes up i could relate only him like how he finds it hard tolerate those dumb idiotic cousins especially cool guy who has hardly any manners also bond that these cousins share doesnt feel very natural it honestly felt quite forced like dont they have any friends especially with cool guy youd expect him have many friends but still chooses hang out with his cousins one being super boring it engineer sorta nerdy guy at times it felt like that guy his female cousins were into arrangement sort thing honestly with way they were behaving hiding their relatives etc it felt like they were more than cousins lol while there are so many things this movie that are beyond silly laughable songs are only respite that movie is able provide wedding song is good then later when they cousins hang out at theatre go bike ride stuff cool song plays guitar playing melody it add nice feel song also there is one song film which is same tune as summer 69 which is painfully bad if it werent songs fahad fazil i would rank this film as most horrible overrated films ever list but they are only saving grace without songs mr fazil this movie would me be not just worst malayalam film but worst film ever i would give this film 4 as it has some redeeming qualities at least but my hopes bring down ludicrous ratings which currently stand at 8 3 i give this film 1 10,0.6644713261648745,-0.022267025089605732,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"

It stars four of the biggest young stars in Malayalam cinema - FAHAD, DULQER, NIVIN and NAZRIYA, and its a huge hit in Kerala.I'm sure remakes in other languages are being planned. DULQER must be one of the worst leading men in the history of Malayalam cinema. My god, the guy cannot act at all. He does not even make an effort. FAHAD was pretty good though, he is one of the few young Malayali actors who try really hard. Nazriya systematically destroys the Malayalam language in a silly and shrill performance. Nivin Pauly had an author backed role so he does have his moments even though he is bad an actor as Dulqer. The background score was also very annoying.And the film is so long.(1/10)",puerile nonsense,this is uber crappy mallu movie about friendship between cousins it is bit like mallu dil chahta hain it stars four biggest young stars malayalam cinema fahad dulqer nivin nazriya its huge hit kerala im sure remakes other languages are being planned dulqer must be one worst leading men history malayalam cinema my god guy cannot act at all he does not even make effort fahad was pretty good though he is one few young malayali actors who try really hard nazriya systematically destroys malayalam language silly shrill performance nivin pauly had author backed role so he does have his moments even though he is bad actor as dulqer background score was also very annoying film is so long 1 10,0.649814814814815,-0.14777777777777776,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,(Not just) the year of Nivin,"Not playing the main protagonist and mostly used for comic relief, this guy manages to walk away with the movie (Referring to Nivin Pauly here - who did such a fantastic job earlier this year in '1983').His 2nd collaboration (this year after 'Ohm Shanthi Ohshaana' or 'OSO'; they've worked earlier too) with Nazriya Nazim, along with a plethora of stars, all digging into something substantial, this one's chicken soup for the soul this year.One of the best things about it, never mind the (strong) feeling of nostalgia that it evokes on multiple occasions, is that it highlights the relationship between cousins, something hitherto un(der)portrayed on the big screen before (unless I missed something big). In spite of its long running time, and the fact that one does see a plot twist coming from a mile away, both the screenplay and the editing are so good that most of us didn't feel restive much. Gopi Sundar has done a better job here than he did in 'How old are you', with the sound being more consistent and mellifluous ('How old..' had its moments, but this has more, from a musical standpoint). All my doubts about Salmaan's potential as a good actor can be finally laid to rest (I had concerns after 'Vaayaiy moodi pesavum', which had him and Nazim too). He owns each and every scene he's in, and I, for one, would love to see what he does next.Special mention must be made of the meaty portions and decent characterization given to (quite a) few supporting characters, including both parents of Pauly's character (one of them played Pauly's subtle antagonist in 'OSO', his screen time being limited in both movies, but he's not the less for that; with the lady playing his wine- making wife in 'OSO' playing an important character, along with being given due prominence in this one as well). Pauly's father's character's off-screen makeover, and his mom's character's on screen one, have to be enjoyed on the big screen with an audience to be truly enjoyed. Very much a slice-of-life thing.Nazim, as is her wont, tends to overact in a few scenes, but her well-etched characterization and performance more than make up for those initial follies.Most of us could've done without one of the corniest twists ever put on celluloid, that (kinda) ruined the movie for me halfway into the 2nd half, but the rest of the movie's so good that this is easily forgiven, not just for the fact that it bring Fazil's character to the forefront from that point on.Definitely a good movie, though my pick for the best this year remains 'OSO'.",not just year nivin,not playing main protagonist mostly used comic relief this guy manages walk away with movie referring nivin pauly here who did such fantastic job earlier this year 1983 his 2nd collaboration this year after ohm shanthi ohshaana or oso theyve worked earlier too with nazriya nazim along with plethora stars all digging into something substantial this ones chicken soup soul this year one best things about it never mind strong feeling nostalgia that it evokes multiple occasions is that it highlights relationship between cousins something hitherto un der portrayed big screen before unless i missed something big spite its long running time fact that one does see plot twist coming mile away both screenplay editing are so good that most us didnt feel restive much gopi sundar has done better job here than he did how old are you with sound being more consistent mellifluous how old had its moments but this has more musical standpoint all my doubts about salmaans potential as good actor can be finally laid rest i had concerns after vaayaiy moodi pesavum which had him nazim too he owns each every scene hes i one would love see what he does next special mention must be made meaty portions decent characterization given quite few supporting characters including both parents paulys character one them played paulys subtle antagonist oso his screen time being limited both movies but hes not less that with lady playing his wine making wife oso playing important character along with being given due prominence this one as well paulys fathers characters off screen makeover his moms characters screen one have be enjoyed big screen with audience be truly enjoyed very much slice life thing nazim as is her wont tends overact few scenes but her well etched characterization performance more than make up those initial follies most us couldve done without one corniest twists ever put celluloid that kinda ruined movie me halfway into 2nd half but rest movies so good that this is easily forgiven not just fact that it bring fazils character forefront that point definitely good movie though my pick best this year remains oso,0.41480158730158734,0.227852733686067,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9.0,Different movie-,"In the beginning, I couldn't much understand where the story was heading, but eventually it started feeling good. Had the feeling of watching a movie that I could relate myself with, after a long time. ANd thats probably why I loved the movie.Comedy was something I really loved. All of this, after I watched the movie with subtitles(I don't know Malayalam). And I can't imagine how I would have felt had I known Malayalam. Edit: I have watched this movie three times, three days in a row, which has never happened for me with any other movie. The more I watched it, the more I am loving it.",different movie,beginning i couldnt much understand where story was heading but eventually it started feeling good had feeling watching movie that i could relate myself with after long time thats probably why i loved movie comedy was something i really loved all this after i watched movie with subtitles i dont know malayalam i cant imagine how i would have felt had i known malayalam edit i have watched this movie three times three days row which has never happened me with any other movie more i watched it more i am loving it,0.5725,0.3725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.25}"
