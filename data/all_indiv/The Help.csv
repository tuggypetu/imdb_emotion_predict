7.0,Minny Don't Burn Chicken,"Greetings again from the darkness. The film is based on the controversial best selling novel by Kathryn Stockett. It was controversial because it is the story of Jim Crow-era maids written by a white woman. Yes, the book is actually the fictionalized story of a white woman getting black maids to discuss their lives as maids for white folks. Rather than get into some politically correct dissertation on the book, movie or story, I will only comment on the film itself ... this very entertaining movie that also manages to deliver a timeless message.Let me first start by saying that this movie is incredibly well acted. It is quite rare to have so many developed characters in one movie. There are some characters we immediately connect with, while others draw our ire each time their face appears. The script and these fine actresses utilize humor to point out the shameful behavior of those who saw themselves as superior. The humor doesn't soften the ignorance or abuse, but it does make the film infinitely more watchable and entertaining. Please know this is not a documentary.Ms. Stockett's novel has a very loyal following in addition to the naysayers. A two hour film must, of course, take short cuts and trim story lines. Still the key elements are present. Based in Jackson, Mississippi during Governor Ross Barnett's term we see the social shark, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), in her full glory of ignorance, entitlement and superiority. We see her minions and followers emulating her moves while trying to gain her approval.The story takes off when Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates from Ole Miss and returns home and takes a job at the local newspaper. Possessing observation skills and humanity that her lifelong friends can't comprehend, Skeeter desperately wants to tell a story from the perspective of the maids. As expected, the maids are hesitant, but Aibileen (Viola Davis) does relent. The stories begin to flow and soon the robust Minny (Octavia Spencer) joins in. Others soon follow their lead and Skeeter's education goes to an entirely new level.That's really all of the story I care to discuss. The brilliance of this one is actually in the details ... individual scenes and moments of acting genius by most of the cast. In addition to those mentioned above, Jessica Chastain plays Celia, the ""white trash"" outcast who so desperately wants to be allowed back into the girls' club. Ms. Chastain was seen a few weeks ago in the fabulous ""Tree of Life"" in quite a different role ... I would venture to say no actress will have two roles of such variance this year. Also, Allison Janney plays Skeeter's cancer-stricken mother, and Sissy Spacek is Hilly's mother who gets tossed aside before she is ready to go! The great Cicely Tyson makes a brief appearance as Constantine, Skeeter's childhood maid who was done so wrong after 29 years of service. Mary Steenburgen has a couple of scenes as a big NYC book publisher.As a said, this is pure acting heaven, but I must single out Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Viola is so powerful at the beginning and end of the film, and Ms. Spencer is a force of nature during the middle. This movie is really their story and these two ladies make it fascinating, painful and a joy to behold. They both deserve recognition at Oscar time.There are so many fantastic details to the film. At times, it is like watching a classic car show ... the late 50's and early 60's models are works of art. The wardrobe, hair and make-up are perfect in setting up the class differentials. The TV and radio segments provide context and timing with the deaths of Medger Evers and JFK. Even the books on Skeeter's shelf make a statement: To Kill a Mockingbird, Huck Finn, Native Son, and Gone With the Wind.This story takes place 50 years ago and director Tate Taylor does an admirable job of bringing Stockett's novel to the big screen. Mr. Taylor is a longtime friend of Ms. Stockett's and was quite fortunate to get the directing rights. He doesn't disappoint. Sure the story is a bit glossy at times ... it is geared towards the masses. If you are looking for more depth, there are numerous documentaries available on the Civil Rights movement. If you are seeking a very entertaining movie that uses humor to tell a story and send a message, then this one's for you.",minny dont burn chicken,greetings again darkness film is based controversial best selling novel by kathryn stockett it was controversial because it is story jim crow era maids written by white woman yes book is actually fictionalized story white woman getting black maids discuss their lives as maids white folks rather than get into some politically correct dissertation book movie or story i will only comment film itself this very entertaining movie that also manages deliver timeless message let me first start by saying that this movie is incredibly well acted it is quite rare have so many developed characters one movie there are some characters we immediately connect with while others draw our ire each time their face appears script these fine actresses utilize humor point out shameful behavior those who saw themselves as superior humor doesnt soften ignorance or abuse but it does make film infinitely more watchable entertaining please know this is not documentary ms stocketts novel has very loyal following addition naysayers two hour film must course take short cuts trim story lines still key elements are present based jackson mississippi during governor ross barnetts term we see social shark hilly holbrook bryce dallas howard her full glory ignorance entitlement superiority we see her minions followers emulating her moves while trying gain her approval story takes off when skeeter emma stone graduates ole miss returns home takes job at local newspaper possessing observation skills humanity that her lifelong friends cant comprehend skeeter desperately wants tell story perspective maids as expected maids are hesitant but aibileen viola davis does relent stories begin flow soon robust minny octavia spencer joins others soon follow their lead skeeters education goes entirely new level thats really all story i care discuss brilliance this one is actually details individual scenes moments acting genius by most cast addition those mentioned above jessica chastain plays celia white trash outcast who so desperately wants be allowed back into girls club ms chastain was seen few weeks ago fabulous tree life quite different role i would venture say no actress will have two roles such variance this year also allison janney plays skeeters cancer stricken mother sissy spacek is hillys mother who gets tossed aside before she is ready go great cicely tyson makes brief appearance as constantine skeeters childhood maid who was done so wrong after 29 years service mary steenburgen has couple scenes as big nyc book publisher as said this is pure acting heaven but i must single out viola davis octavia spencer viola is so powerful at beginning end film ms spencer is force nature during middle this movie is really their story these two ladies make it fascinating painful joy behold they both deserve recognition at oscar time there are so many fantastic details film at times it is like watching classic car show late 50s early 60s models are works art wardrobe hair make up are perfect setting up class differentials tv radio segments provide context timing with deaths medger evers jfk even books skeeters shelf make statement kill mockingbird huck finn native son gone with wind this story takes place 50 years ago director tate taylor does admirable job bringing stocketts novel big screen mr taylor is longtime friend ms stocketts was quite fortunate get directing rights he doesnt disappoint sure story is bit glossy at times it is geared towards masses if you are looking more depth there are numerous documentaries available civil rights movement if you are seeking very entertaining movie that uses humor tell story send message then this ones you,0.45014937014937023,0.19543992043992045,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
,A Film to Remember,"I took our 12 year old daughter to see this movie and we both loved it. She was not thrilled when I told her we were going to see a film that told a story from the civil rights era but when we left she said she loved it because of the women's courage, their humor and the power of their friendships. We had never seen most of the actors which was refreshing and the acting by the entire cast made it easy to get totally involved. I laughed out loud and shed quite a few tears in The Help, and will remember it and recommend it to my friends. It was wonderful to see so many scenes in which the actors related to each other so perfectly. Even the vilest characters showed moments of conflict within themselves as they played out poor behavior that had long been inbred in them. I am especially grateful to the team who provided a film that told an engaging story about human relationships with important lessons for my daughter. That is a rare occurrence in today's movies.",film remember,i took our 12 year old daughter see this movie we both loved it she was not thrilled when i told her we were going see film that told story civil rights era but when we left she said she loved it because womens courage their humor power their friendships we had never seen most actors which was refreshing acting by entire cast made it easy get totally involved i laughed out loud shed quite few tears help will remember it recommend it my friends it was wonderful see so many scenes which actors related each other so perfectly even vilest characters showed moments conflict within themselves as they played out poor behavior that had long been inbred them i am especially grateful team who provided film that told engaging story about human relationships with important lessons my daughter that is rare occurrence todays movies,0.5878205128205128,0.24070512820512827,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Ready to burst . . .,"I grew up in the 60's, the setting for The Help, a story of Southern prejudice and cruelty toward African Americans, who were chattel of the Southern rich treating their servants as expendable and marginal. I can say that as a Northerner with a black maid for our household, there was love but always a barrier, a carryover from the strict separation still prevailing after reconstruction.Director Tate Taylor keeps the race relations taut but not strident, as if we were living through the emerging civil rights movement slowly but inevitably aimed at equality, not ""separate but equal."" Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates, returns to Jackson, Miss., and decides to write about the black help, whose ""perspective' needs to be told. As more maids join in the writing of the manuscript, the more possible it is to counter the assassination of Medgar Evers and eventually that of Martin Luther King.While we have grown used to the base scatological humor of the Hangovers, Change-UP, and other rom-coms, the fundament motif in The Help is as low-key as will ever be depicted in film. Not only is the idea of the bad guys ""eating s—t"" effective, it is funny and poignant.A note about the performances—Bryce Dallas Howard as the conservative, prejudiced Hilly, is remarkably successful, making her a full-fledged actress and not just a famous director's daughter. Jessica Chastain as the ditzy but big-hearted Celia Foote cements her place as a great modern actress following her memorable role as the compliant wife in Tree of Life. Emma Stone no longer need rely on rom-coms, for she stars in The Help with a performance nuanced and underplayed, just the way I like it, albeit a bit too hip for the times.Although the film tends toward the simplistic, e.g., there are no bad blacks and most whites are obtuse, Viola Davis as maid Aibileen Clark successfully carries the film displaying the ambivalent nature of slavery ready to burst out of its chains.",ready burst,i grew up 60s setting help story southern prejudice cruelty toward african americans who were chattel southern rich treating their servants as expendable marginal i can say that as northerner with black maid our household there was love but always barrier carryover strict separation still prevailing after reconstruction director tate taylor keeps race relations taut but not strident as if we were living through emerging civil rights movement slowly but inevitably aimed at equality not separate but equal skeeter emma stone graduates returns jackson miss decides write about black help whose perspective needs be told as more maids join writing manuscript more possible it is counter assassination medgar evers eventually that martin luther king while we have grown used base scatological humor hangovers change up other rom coms fundament motif help is as low key as will ever be depicted film not only is idea bad guys eating s t effective it is funny poignant note about performances bryce dallas howard as conservative prejudiced hilly is remarkably successful making her full fledged actress not just famous directors daughter jessica chastain as ditzy but big hearted celia foote cements her place as great modern actress following her memorable role as compliant wife tree life emma stone no longer need rely rom coms she stars help with performance nuanced underplayed just way i like it albeit bit too hip times although film tends toward simplistic e g there are no bad blacks most whites are obtuse viola davis as maid aibileen clark successfully carries film displaying ambivalent nature slavery ready burst out its chains,0.5798611111111112,0.14074074074074075,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,"Well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama","There have been a number of films about the Deep South during the Civil Rights era, mostly (""Mississippi Burning"" and ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" being examples) concentrating on the political struggle for equality. ""The Help"" is a recent film which brings a slightly different approach to this period, concentrating on the relationship between well-to-do white Southerners and their black maids. Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan is a young white woman from a wealthy family in Jackson, Mississippi. She has ambitions to make a career in writing and journalism, and plans to write a book about the experiences of black maids (referred to as ""the help"") working for white families. Unlike most of her friends, Skeeter is a liberal on racial issues and is horrified by the bigoted views which she has heard other white women express, often quite openly in front of their black servants. She hopes that her book will help to expose this sort of prejudice, but finds that no maids are willing to be interviewed. Eventually, however, two maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, come forward. Both have good cause to be dissatisfied with their employers, especially Minny who has not only been sacked but also falsely accused of theft. Minny's employer Hilly is a particularly unpleasant individual, with an obsession with forcing black maids to use separate toilet facilities from the families they work for. The real reason for Minny's sacking was that she used the family's indoor bathroom rather than use an outside toilet during a thunderstorm. (One thing I have never understood why people like Hilly, who obviously has a poisonous dislike of all black people, did not simply employ a white maid; perhaps they could not find any white women willing to work for the low wages that black maids were paid). Some films with a ""civil rights"" theme, ""Mississippi Burning"" being an example, have a male-dominated cast, but ""The Help"" is very much a ""women's film"" with all the main roles, both heroines and villains, being taken by women. There is an attempt to give Skeeter a boyfriend, but their brief friendship- it never really deserves the name ""romance""- fizzles out when he disapproves of her book and of her views on the race question. With that exception, all the male actors play very minor roles. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard from ""The Village"" and Viola Davis, who greatly impressed me in ""Doubt"", most of the leading actresses in the film were faces I had never seen before. (I must admit that I did not recognise Howard, here a brunette although normally a redhead). I understand that Jessica Chastain actually made seven feature films in 2011- a quite remarkable work-rate for a modern actress- but this is the only one I have yet seen. Chastain plays Celia Foote, Skeeter's only ally among Jackson's housewives. Although Celia's husband is from the city's wealthy elite, she herself is from a working-class background, which means that the likes of Hilly despise her as poor white trash who has got above herself. Although historically many poor whites were just as racist as rich ones, if not more so, Celia's experience of being on the receiving end of bigotry makes her a much more liberal employer. (Minny goes to work for her after being sacked by Hilly). Chastain's is one of a number of excellent performances in this film; the others come from Emma Stone as Skeeter, Davis (even better here than she was in ""Doubt"") as Aibileen and Octavia Spencer as the sharp-tongued Minny, a woman determined to fight back against prejudice. (Spencer won a ""Best Supporting Actress"" Oscar). I would have a couple of criticisms of the film. Howard as Hilly, like some of the other actresses playing the snooty society matrons, plays her character rather too much as a one-dimensional stereotype, the snobbish upper-class bitch. The sub-plot involving Minny's chocolate pie seemed out of place, the sort of vulgar humour which would be more at home in a Farrelly Brothers gross-out comedy than in a supposedly serious film. I would not, however, agree with the criticism some have made that the film demeans African-Americans by showing them as dependent upon whites for their emancipation. It is the black characters here who display real courage in bringing their working conditions to public notice, far more so than does Skeeter. She risks nothing worse than losing the friendship of a few people she never cared for in the first place; they risk the loss of their jobs and their livelihoods, and possibly also violence from white racists.Despite my criticisms, I felt that overall ""The Help"" was an excellent film- a well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama with some powerful acting performances, and one which shed an interesting light on this period of American history. 8/10",well acted emotionally satisfying human drama,there have been number films about deep south during civil rights era mostly mississippi burning ghosts mississippi being examples concentrating political struggle equality help is recent film which brings slightly different approach this period concentrating relationship between well do white southerners their black maids eugenia skeeter phelan is young white woman wealthy family jackson mississippi she has ambitions make career writing journalism plans write book about experiences black maids referred as help working white families unlike most her friends skeeter is liberal racial issues is horrified by bigoted views which she has heard other white women express often quite openly front their black servants she hopes that her book will help expose this sort prejudice but finds that no maids are willing be interviewed eventually however two maids aibileen clark minny jackson come forward both have good cause be dissatisfied with their employers especially minny who has not only been sacked but also falsely accused theft minnys employer hilly is particularly unpleasant individual with obsession with forcing black maids use separate toilet facilities families they work real reason minnys sacking was that she used familys indoor bathroom rather than use outside toilet during thunderstorm one thing i have never understood why people like hilly who obviously has poisonous dislike all black people did not simply employ white maid perhaps they could not find any white women willing work low wages that black maids were paid some films with civil rights theme mississippi burning being example have male dominated cast but help is very much womens film with all main roles both heroines villains being taken by women there is attempt give skeeter boyfriend but their brief friendship it never really deserves name romance fizzles out when he disapproves her book her views race question with that exception all male actors play very minor roles with exception bryce dallas howard village viola davis who greatly impressed me doubt most leading actresses film were faces i had never seen before i must admit that i did not recognise howard here brunette although normally redhead i understand that jessica chastain actually made seven feature films 2011 quite remarkable work rate modern actress but this is only one i have yet seen chastain plays celia foote skeeters only ally among jacksons housewives although celias husband is citys wealthy elite she herself is working class background which means that likes hilly despise her as poor white trash who has got above herself although historically many poor whites were just as racist as rich ones if not more so celias experience being receiving end bigotry makes her much more liberal employer minny goes work her after being sacked by hilly chastains is one number excellent performances this film others come emma stone as skeeter davis even better here than she was doubt as aibileen octavia spencer as sharp tongued minny woman determined fight back against prejudice spencer won best supporting actress oscar i would have couple criticisms film howard as hilly like some other actresses playing snooty society matrons plays her character rather too much as one dimensional stereotype snobbish upper class bitch sub plot involving minnys chocolate pie seemed out place sort vulgar humour which would be more at home farrelly brothers gross out comedy than supposedly serious film i would not however agree with criticism some have made that film demeans african americans by showing them as dependent upon whites their emancipation it is black characters here who display real courage bringing their working conditions public notice far more so than does skeeter she risks nothing worse than losing friendship few people she never cared first place they risk loss their jobs their livelihoods possibly also violence white racists despite my criticisms i felt that overall help was excellent film well acted emotionally satisfying human drama with some powerful acting performances one which shed interesting light this period american history 8 10,0.43014384920634935,0.10515624999999999,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"
,A beautiful film--and realistic,"If this film were total fiction bearing no relation to reality, it would still be worth seeing for the fine acting and production values--even if some of the young white women approached ""Southern Gothic."" But it wasn't fiction--at least, the depiction of Southern society wasn't. As I watched I kept drifting back to small-town South Carolina in the 1950s, where I grew up. It was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet ""kept down in their place."" Our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. There were plenty of boys my age, we visited in each other's homes, and called every maid by her first name. One even started a baseball team for the little white boys, for which her reward was a visit by the Klan.Our maid helped my mother cook and clean. One of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. She ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. I remember her eating with her fingers. I do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. I thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did, an embarrassing gap in memory.I do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. I actually cried; she was a member of our family. When talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s, my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting ""uppity."" And so it went. We moved to central Florida in 1961, where there were no maids.Travel back in time with this film. It's quite real, and I highly recommend it.",beautiful film realistic,if this film were total fiction bearing no relation reality it would still be worth seeing fine acting production values even if some young white women approached southern gothic but it wasnt fiction at least depiction southern society wasnt as i watched i kept drifting back small town south carolina 1950s where i grew up it was moving disturbing be reminded how black people were treated then loved yet kept down their place our neighborhood was all middle class every family had maid there were plenty boys my age we visited each others homes called every maid by her first name one even started baseball team little white boys which her reward was visit by klan our maid helped my mother cook clean one my parents picked her up took her home every day she rode back seat she ate her lunch our kitchen without being allowed use our utensils i remember her eating with her fingers i do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms i thought about that during movie truly cannot recall what she did embarrassing gap memory i do remember when my father was out work our maid had be cut back three days week i actually cried she was member our family when talk about civil rights began late 1950s my mother became annoyed at our maid getting uppity so it went we moved central florida 1961 where there were no maids travel back time with this film its quite real i highly recommend it,0.3432962962962963,0.037675925925925925,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,See this film,"I just returned from seeing a special preview of ""The Help,"" which is due out in theaters this summer. Okay, so here's the truth: I'm a middle-aged, white male... I didn't read the book and I assumed, based on the fact that this is a virtually an all-female cast, that this was some sort of chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! This is an incredible film that not only pays justice to the bestseller on which it's based (according to those who have read the book AND seen the film), but is phenomenally cast, with exceptional performances by Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney. Veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson also deliver incredible performances. While Tyson's character is central to the storyline, her role comprises what seems to be a few, precious minutes of the 2:20 running time, she delivers, in my opinion, one of the most powerful and moving moments in the film...one in which she doesn't even utter a line (trust me, you'll know when you see it.)The Help also delivers some very funny moments and will make you laugh. I'll go so far as to say that this film and a few of its cast members will draw some Oscar nominations. I certainly think this takes Stone into a whole new level.The racial imbalances of 1963 are well illustrated in ""The Help,"" and will, no doubt, underscore how far America has come, as well as how little progress we've made in the last 50 years.

9.0,"A Must See, Oscar Worthy film","Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn't around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed ""chick flick"" it would be this one. In spite of that, I've heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I'm happy to say that I'm glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go. Taylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.When a movie doesn't have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we've become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren't many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me.

8.0,Some really nice acting here....,"While ""The Help"" has received TONS of great press and a ton of SAG and other awards, I am also aware that there is some controversy concerning the film. Some people have felt that the film was a bit paternalistic--as it might be interpreted as yet another story of a rich, enlightened white lady going out to help all the downtrodden black folk. I am just not sure if I could see this or not--especially as the black women in the film end up showing LOTS of strength during the course of the film. BUT, I am also a white guy--and it's not fair for me to automatically brand the film one way or another. Just be aware that there are a few who resent the idea of this film.I could discuss the plot, but LOTS of other reviewers have discussed this. So instead, let's talk about what I liked and didn't like. I liked the acting. The problem, however, is that giving any of these actresses awards is tough as it's such an ensemble cast. I can truly understand why the Screen Actor's Guild chose to award ALL the cast a joint award. The direction was very nice and the movie was well filmed. The script was also very nice--and quite inspiring. My quibbles are VERY small---very, very small. I felt that a few characters were a bit one-dimensional (particularly the lead villainess). Also, the ending of the film seemed to drag out a bit and wrapping it up a bit sooner. It wasn't a bad ending--but tightening would have heightened the overall emotional impact.So my advice for you is to see this film. While I still think ""Hugo"" is the best nominated film this year, I can see the merit in ""The Help"" winning and ""The Artist"" sure seems to have a lot of momentum. So, do yourself a favor and see all three--all three are terrific.",some really nice acting here,while help has received tons great press ton sag other awards i am also aware that there is some controversy concerning film some people have felt that film was bit paternalistic as it might be interpreted as yet another story rich enlightened white lady going out help all downtrodden black folk i am just not sure if i could see this or not especially as black women film end up showing lots strength during course film but i am also white guy its not fair me automatically brand film one way or another just be aware that there are few who resent idea this film i could discuss plot but lots other reviewers have discussed this so instead lets talk about what i liked didnt like i liked acting problem however is that giving any these actresses awards is tough as its such ensemble cast i can truly understand why screen actors guild chose award all cast joint award direction was very nice movie was well filmed script was also very nice quite inspiring my quibbles are very small very very small i felt that few characters were bit one dimensional particularly lead villainess also ending film seemed drag out bit wrapping it up bit sooner it wasnt bad ending but tightening would have heightened overall emotional impact so my advice you is see this film while i still think hugo is best nominated film this year i can see merit help winning artist sure seems have lot momentum so do yourself favor see all three all three are terrific,0.5149126984126985,0.1282222222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,A Nutshell Review: The Help,"The Help is one of the many films that's set in the 60s that deals with themes like prejudice and racism involving segregation amongst the Whites and the African Americans in Jackson, Mississippi, but having the very same themes also being relevant in society today even here in Singapore especially, with recent talk and focus on the issue of domestic help and our attitudes toward household maids that many employ for various reasons, who assist in looking after the children and the elderly, as well as to keep home while the rest of the adults are neck deep in economic pursuits. While racism is generally kept under control here, there are niggling incidents that pop up every now and then, so clearly we're not off the hook and there will always be individuals who choose intolerance.Granted that racism back then was more pronounced especially during that era put on film, the story's based on an international bestseller written by Kathryn Stockett, and over here we're bound to identify with the issues highlighted especially in the horror stories you'd hear with regards to the treatment of domestic help, with abuse cases that make you sit up and wonder why we are capable of such inhumane acts. And the worst of all involves being hypocritical, putting on a false front for society, while clearly behaving like the devil when behind closed doors. The bottom line is, we're all humans and we share similar hopes and dreams whatever our skin colour, language and where we're from, in desiring a comfortable life filled with love, with a roof over our heads, food and community, friends and family we can turn to in times of need. Which is why this film has themes and a poignant, thought provoking narrative that screams relevance, especially for those closeted intolerant few who must watch this, and reflect. Emma Stone stars as Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan, an aspiring journalist who has returned home only to find out that the group of peers she had grown up with, are leading a lifestyle of superficial leisure, saying a lot of things, but meaning nothing. And for all their cliquish behaviour in cruelly treating one of their own as a social outcast (Jessica Chastain from The Tree of Life), for an ulterior reason only Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) knows, what more their household maids who have to slog with the chores, be that surrogate mother to their kids, be at their beck and call, and being given attitude, stick, and threats of the sack?Given the tension all round during the time, it's no wonder that Skeeter's plans to want to highlight The Help's predicament and provide them with a voice, no doubt also serving as a ticket for her journalistic ambitions to embark on a career in New York, all met with stone walled silence, until Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) decided that enough is enough, and begin opening up to Skeeter as research material, becoming her insights and perspective on how the African American help get treated in White households. And besides Aibileen's point of view, her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) also chipped in, and both represent the broad spectrum of heartfelt accounts both good and bad, though largely negative, with the tacit understanding with Skeeter that they are not to be referred to directly.It's one of those powerful films that takes the ugly side of humanity and presents it to us face on, to confront how cruel some of us can be, and what the strong amongst us must do to act and help those who are weak or bullied. Director Tate Taylor, who also wrote the screenplay, focuses on the tales crafted around the households both Aibileen and Minny serve, from being treated like dirt to forming firm friendships with some of the people they know and serve, such as Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain), as a reminder on how we should never judge a book by its cover, being obviously relevant when one gets handed one's fate for being of a certain skin colour. You may think that this may be a heavy film with all its seriousness, but trust me there is enough light hearted, even heart warming moments scattered throughout, though counter-balanced with moments of fear that will make you worry for the characters since mob mentality can lead to anything.Emma Stone normally plays kooky characters of late, so this was perfect opportunity for her to shine in more serious drama which she does adequately. But she got upstaged by both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the former who brought a certain quiet dignity to her role which just calls for respect, and the latter being the comic relief as a really straight-talker, and whose story was probably the most touching in the film, with one of the funniest, running gag in the later half. Bryce Dallas Howard also owned her role as the antagonist Hilly in the film, and if you'd think she's only capable of goody two shoes roles, think again as she can convincingly play back-stabbers, with Sissy Spacek in a supporting role as Hilly's mom.The Help reminds us of how one has to have Fear and Courage to addresses changes in community or the larger society we serve in, without which we would all be poorer for it. It may be almost 2 1/2 hours long, but it's every minute worth it just watching how an uphill battle was fought, and baby steps being taken each time to overcome obstacles placed in the characters' way. It's guaranteed that you'll laugh and you'll cry in the film thanks to its material, and it's firmly one of the contenders to be amongst my favourite films of this year.

9.0,Delightfully-different!,"I just got back from a special-screening of ""The Help"" at my local movie theatre, so I thought that I might as well do a review for all of you who are wanting to see this movie when it comes out.Now, first off, I must admit that I have only read a portion of the book, but I definitely do know a lot about it. After watching the trailer, I was intrigued, so of course, I visited the IMDb boards to learn more about it. At first glance, the casting caught my attention big-time. Emma Stone as 'Skeeter'? I bet most people were as shocked as I was to find out that she was cast as the main character -- but let me tell you what: the casting was superb! I could not have chosen a better cast than what was already chosen. There was amazing chemistry between both the antagonists and protagonists. I won't go into too much depth about the characters, but for me, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, and Octavia Spencer were the shining stars of the movie.Casting: 9.5/10 I know that there has been an on-going issue about this movie from a lot of people claiming that ""the blacks had to be 'saved' by the whites"" (pardon the language), or something along those lines. I have to agree that the trailer does give off that type of vibe -- Skeeter saving the colored-folks -- however, the movie tells and depicts otherwise - the colored-folks actually saved themselves. Minny and Aibileen, as well as the other colored-folks in the community, were the real ""heroes"" of the movie; they just needed someone to push them to their potential (Skeeter).I can not remember the last time I saw a movie that inspired me, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me sad, angry, and hopeful, all at the same time -- this is what ""The Help"" strides and aims for, without making it ""cheesy"". Without a doubt in my mind, there are definitely Oscar-worthy performances in this movie. Not only does this movie depict just the colored-folks' side of the story, but it also equally shows the feelings of the white-folks, as well. So, you definitely get both sides of the story without it being more or less ""mean"" or ""degrading"" to any sides.There are definitely a few awkward moments in the movie, but what movie doesn't have them? This movie started around 7:10 and ended around 9:20 -- about 2 hours and 10 minutes, give or take, if my calculations are correct. However, this movie only felt like it was an hour-long. It was so good that I didn't even know the two hours passed by until the theatre lights lid and the rolling credits began.All in all, this is a DEFINITELY-MUST-SEE movie. I personally believe that it is one of the best movies of 2011. Go see it -- you will not regret it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Movie rating: 9/10",delightfully different,i just got back special screening help at my local movie theatre so i thought that i might as well do review all you who are wanting see this movie when it comes out now first off i must admit that i have only read portion book but i definitely do know lot about it after watching trailer i was intrigued so course i visited imdb boards learn more about it at first glance casting caught my attention big time emma stone as skeeter i bet most people were as shocked as i was find out that she was cast as main character but let me tell you what casting was superb i could not have chosen better cast than what was already chosen there was amazing chemistry between both antagonists protagonists i wont go into too much depth about characters but me emma stone jessica chastain sissy spacek octavia spencer were shining stars movie casting 9 5 10 i know that there has been going issue about this movie lot people claiming that blacks had be saved by whites pardon language or something along those lines i have agree that trailer does give off that type vibe skeeter saving colored folks however movie tells depicts otherwise colored folks actually saved themselves minny aibileen as well as other colored folks community were real heroes movie they just needed someone push them their potential skeeter i can not remember last time i saw movie that inspired me made me cry made me laugh made me sad angry hopeful all at same time this is what help strides aims without making it cheesy without doubt my mind there are definitely oscar worthy performances this movie not only does this movie depict just colored folks side story but it also equally shows feelings white folks as well so you definitely get both sides story without it being more or less mean or degrading any sides there are definitely few awkward moments movie but what movie doesnt have them this movie started around 7 10 ended around 9 20 about 2 hours 10 minutes give or take if my calculations are correct however this movie only felt like it was hour long it was so good that i didnt even know two hours passed by until theatre lights lid rolling credits began all all this is definitely must see movie i personally believe that it is one best movies 2011 go see it you will not regret it if you have any questions feel free ask movie rating 9 10,0.505383597883598,0.09117724867724869,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Mesmerizing - Pure Oscar Material!,"Oscar Oscar Oscar – Kathryn Stockett's beautiful book is Oscar worthy in this film -- for editing, screenplay, supporting actress (several deserving) – Emma Stone just shines – at just 22 years old, this film proves she is a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. There are so few roles written for black women and I was thrilled to see such great roles filled by Viola Davis (Abigail) and Octavia Spencer (Minnie) - both should be nominated for supporting roles although in my opinion, along with Emma Stone, all three share top billing.The character development in this movie is really outstanding – I hate movies with flat single dimension characters and these from the lowest to those with the most screen time are just remarkably developed – even the newspaper editor, the lines they chose for him to keep gave you enough information that even he is a memorable character with only three scenes, maybe 4 in the entire movie. Same for Stuart, Skeeter's love interest – you actually like him then hate him and he only has maybe 3 minutes of air time. Great great job. Sissy Spacek with so few speaking moments is great as is Cicely Tyson who speaks volumes even in scenes with no words. Admittedly, being based on an amazing book the background story was already set out and tracks the book closely without some of the details but they have done a great job of putting it to film – This movie sets out beautifully a terrible time in our history that unfortunately is not over – it is better, but not over by a long shot. Being a child of the south and coming up during that time, being raised by such bigoted grandparents and parents, it leaves me pause to wonder how I avoided this rabid virus of hate and takes me back to long hot lazy days in the deep south before every building was air conditioned – such attention detail right down to the Jesus fans they waved in church – awesome flick. You FEEL the heat, the tension, the pain, the injustice of the time but still you laugh with them even as you cry for them - both races - ignorance is to be wept over.However, I think this movie does more, goes further in its exploration of the behavior of the privileged during that time. They were rabid toward blacks but were not that much better toward anyone who did not share their socio-economic status (the way the ""Junior League"" treated Celia) and the enormous peer pressure they put on one another (the club encouraging Skeeter's mother to make a poor decision). It visits the sins of the parents passed on to their children – the bigotry and injustice that is learned at the knee of our elders.

9.0,A Movie That Helps To Expose The Racial Divide That Yet Remains,"14 August 2011. The unintentional and revealing shock of this movie isn't how the trailers and previews misled the audience as to the nature of this movie, but that the marketing arm and distributor felt that it was necessary (perhaps rightly so) to depict the movie more as primarily a comedy rather than a drama in the first place. Fifty years after this period piece takes place, the irony is that the emotional drama and power of this movie arises for its ""contemporary"" audience from the likelihood that we can be shocked by this movie at all and its ability to push the audience's racial button after all this time. Like the hidden embarrassment of sexual products on commercial television, this movie seems to have dared to expose the dirty laundry in a balanced drama, lightened with elements of humor.Unlike The Stepford Wives (2004) that used comedy as its primary platform to expose the dichotomy of the 1950s with todays societal values, The Help in the same way Uncle Tom's Cabin published in 1852 (there were not movies back then) brings to the mainstream audience a serious but balanced and mainstream acceptable version of the racial divide of the 1950s. The Help is a break through movie for our times that oddly enough may or may not hold up in 50 or 100 years unless it becomes memorable for its revelation at least in mainstream movies, the racial blindness of its history America still retained so many years later at the Civil Rights era. Or maybe like Schindler's List (1993), the shocking but revealing World War II drama, The Help may be able to retain its historical value aside from its present day exposure of today's America's subconscious.The Help is a deeply revealing, emotional compelling inward look at America and allows mainstream America to become sensitively aware of the thin veneer that remains covering over the racial prejudice that still pervades America today, even as the gains made over the past 30,40 years have been wiped away, especially with the Great Recession and the political atmosphere that has become a backdrop of everyday existence for African Americans and other minorities in this Country.",movie that helps expose racial divide that yet remains,14 august 2011 unintentional revealing shock this movie isnt how trailers previews misled audience as nature this movie but that marketing arm distributor felt that it was necessary perhaps rightly so depict movie more as primarily comedy rather than drama first place fifty years after this period piece takes place irony is that emotional drama power this movie arises its contemporary audience likelihood that we can be shocked by this movie at all its ability push audiences racial button after all this time like hidden embarrassment sexual products commercial television this movie seems have dared expose dirty laundry balanced drama lightened with elements humor unlike stepford wives 2004 that used comedy as its primary platform expose dichotomy 1950s with todays societal values help same way uncle toms cabin published 1852 there were not movies back then brings mainstream audience serious but balanced mainstream acceptable version racial divide 1950s help is break through movie our times that oddly enough may or may not hold up 50 or 100 years unless it becomes memorable its revelation at least mainstream movies racial blindness its history america still retained so many years later at civil rights era or maybe like schindlers list 1993 shocking but revealing world war ii drama help may be able retain its historical value aside its present day exposure todays americas subconscious help is deeply revealing emotional compelling inward look at america allows mainstream america become sensitively aware thin veneer that remains covering over racial prejudice that still pervades america today even as gains made over past 30 40 years have been wiped away especially with great recession political atmosphere that has become backdrop everyday existence african americans other minorities this country,0.4774749373433585,0.03361528822055139,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
3.0,"Anachronistic, melodramatic take on discrimination against civil rights era domestic workers","'The Help' is a well-meaning attempt to educate the film going public about the civil rights era in the deep South through the perspective of the relationship between black maids and their white female employers.  Author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the book on which the film is based, does well in reminding us that the black 'help' not only had to endure the threat of violence as a result of the encroaching backlash from white racists upset over a new black militancy in southern communities, but also had to deal with a multiplicity of indignities on the drab domestic front, including being forced to use separate bathrooms in the homes of their white female employers.  Not only does Hilly Holbrook (the film's principal 'villain') enforce this rule in her own home and influences her immediate neighbors to follow suit, but lobbies local politicians in order to have her racist initiative be codified into law.While Hilly may be a tad bit melodramatic as Stockett's 'Cruella de Vil', she is undoubtedly the most compelling character in the entire film. Stockett also does well with Elizabeth Leefolt, Aibileen's racist employer, who is perhaps more repulsive than Hilly, in that she does not have the self-awareness to realize that she is an incompetent mother. Occasionally, Stockett even suggests that some of oppressed maids may not have all their moral compasses in order. In perhaps one of the most interesting scenes in the film (due to the ambiguity), one of the maids is roughly pulled off a bus and arrested by seemingly racist, redneck policeman. I could hear the indignant sounds of the audience suddenly go quiet, when it's revealed that the maid arrested was the one who pilfered a diamond ring that had fallen behind a cabinet in the home of one of the white employers.Despite Stockett's noble attempt to relate the atmosphere of institutional racism so prevalent in the south during early 1960s, her main character, Skeeter, feels wholly anachronistic. It's as if Stockett projected her own modern day sensibility on to Skeeter and asks us to believe that such a character would have existed at that time. If there were progressive minded white liberals participating in the civil rights movement in the early 60s, usually they came from the north and were often met with outright violence. To have such a progressive minded white female from the south take up the cause of the oppressed black 'help', let alone create a book based on interviews with such women, is simply wish fulfillment on the part of the author. Stockett is obviously trying to mitigate some of her own guilt by creating the illusory, ""feel-good"" character of Skeeter. No book like ""The Help"" ever appeared in the early 60s and it would have never been published at that time.There's another reason why 'The Help' makes little sense. Why would ""The Help"" ever agree to Skeeter's plan? They certainly receive little financial compensation for their efforts and in the end, they're only setting themselves up for retaliation. A character in a book might take some satisfaction in mouthing off against an employer who subjects them to racist humiliation, but in the real world (and especially in the 60s deep South), one doesn't 'talk back', unless one wants to lose their sole source of support. Of course there were individual black women who worked as maids who could have 'talked back' and lost their jobs, but to suggest such a large group of women agreed to interviews en masse, is another one of Stockett's 'feel-good' conceits! While all those juicy interviews Stockett collected from the 'Help' may have worked in the book, the stories come off as dry recitations in the film. We don't actually experience the maids' stories visually—they are merely communicated to Skeeter during the interviews. Obviously, flashbacks wouldn't have worked during the interview scenes since there were too many of them. Stockett's other big problem with the 'Help' is that she's forced to place her main 'Help' characters on a pedestal. Yes Aibileen and Minny ARE victims but can they do no wrong? It may have been a more interesting story if ""The Help"" were REALLY told from their perspective. Stockett unfortunately is unable to make the Help's world come alive—do they actually have a back story? (the best we get is an allusion to Minny's ""abusive"" husband who never appears on screen). Or is everything defined by their relationship to the white world?Stockett resorts to melodramatic form, by offering up storytelling akin to a decidedly unsubtle 'quid pro quo.' You have your evil Hilly and then you need to counter it with the ditsy but kind Cecelia Foote, another unbelievable character designed to prove that whites weren't all that bad during the era. Even Charlotte, Skeeter's mother, must be subject to Stockett's quid pro quo treatment (Charlotte channels Hilly when she banishes beloved family maid Constantin in order to appease her racist club members but then sticks up for Skeeter when Hilly tries to blackmail her daughter).Worst of all are Stockett's male characters who are practically non-existent in the film. I didn't buy for one second that Skeeter would have actually been attracted to the boyfriend and gone out with him for a time. Wouldn't she have clarified from the beginning that he was a racist and had nothing to do with him? For those who are interested in getting a better picture of black life during the civil rights era, can I recommend the classic 1964 picture, 'Nothing But a Man'? 'The Help' only seems to suggest that white people deserve more credit than they really should receive for aiding black people in their quest for social equality and justice.",anachronistic

well with elizabeth leefolt aibileens racist employer who is perhaps more repulsive than hilly that she does not have self awareness realize that she is incompetent mother occasionally stockett even

employers despite stocketts noble attempt relate atmosphere institutional racism so prevalent south during early 1960s her main character skeeter feels wholly anachronistic its as if stockett projected her own modern day sensibility skeeter asks us believe that such character would have existed at that time if there were progressive minded white liberals participating civil rights movement early 60s usually they came north were often met with outright violence have such progressive minded white female south take up cause oppressed black help let alone create book based interviews with such women is simply wish fulfillment part author stockett is obviously trying mitigate some her own guilt by creating illusory feel good character skeeter no book like help ever appeared early 60s it would have never been published at that time theres another reason why help makes little sense why would help ever agree skeeters plan they certainly receive little financial compensation their efforts end theyre only setting themselves up retaliation character book might take some satisfaction mouthing off against employer who subjects them racist humiliation but real world especially 60s deep south one doesnt talk back unless one wants lose their sole source support course there were individual black women who worked as maids who could have talked back lost their jobs but suggest such large group women agreed interviews en masse is another one stocketts feel good conceits while all those juicy interviews stockett collected help may have worked book stories come off as dry

5.0,Safe Fluff,"So....I went and saw The Help last night.I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't as offensive as ""The Blind Side"" (ala the big overgrown, illiterate, strong as an ox, loyal, gullible, clown saved by a white Christian savior caricature) but the overall story was pretty watered down. The acting is solid, but I was torn about this movie. It does elicit the ""Great White Hope"" character, in that the maids only come together through the unlikely liberalism and goodness of a young white character. Its message for the future is also disturbing. For example, toward the end, one maid is offered salvation by a white couple who offers her the security of being their maid for the REST OF HER LIFE...a deal that makes her eyes grow wide with happiness. Meanwhile, the main white character goes off to greener pastures outside the limitations of her town.There are also some unsettling caricatures...like a ""Mammy"" figure who gets misty eyed when she talks about how frying chicken makes her feel good inside.I think they were pretty spot on in the portrayal of the white ""southern belles (given that I'm from Jackson myself)."" They were mostly ridiculous, petty and cold...which, to my understanding, is how they really were. It makes for some good comedic moments.This is a ""safe"" film...there's no violence, and the threat of violence doesn't feel very immediate or nearby. The racism of the day feels like an omniscient boogey-man...and the white men in the film are all portrayed in an indifferent ""they could care less"" light...which seems VERY unbelievable. And the Black men were either abusive, docile or messengers...I mean, not a single, strong Black man?The real sad thing about this film is what it says about Black progress in Hollywood. I haven't seen ""real"" roles for black women this year...and it's telling that the project that employs the most black women at once is one where they all have to play maids. Even in a trailer shown before this film for ""Tower Heist,"" Gabourey Sidibe (from ""Precious"") is playing a maid...complemented by Eddie Murphy playing a convict with expert knowledge on robberies. So, blacks are either subservient, criminals, comedic clowns...or the ever present ""token black friend."" The exception to this rule are the few Blacks that are seen as being ""negro-lite""...e.g. Will Smith, Halle Berry and Beyonce. Many whites don't understand why Blacks are sensitive to their portrayals on film...but whites have to realize...you have an abundance of images to choose from. However, we have very few. Imagine taking your children to the movies...and the people that look like them, on screen, are usually stupefied, marginalized, subservient or comedic to the point of buffoorney. That's not the reality whites EVER have to accept, adapt to or address. This is not playing the race card...as there is no card to play when this is your life.My grandmother was a maid, like these women in the film. She went to work every day for the local car dealer's family...doing housework, cooking their meals and taking care of their kids for $5/day. She supplemented her income ironing white people's clothes from town. She raised 10 kids and helped with the war effort at home. While a film like ""The Help"" gives her a voice, it also robs her of hope that things will get better. After all, one maid quits her job even though her options are extremely limited and she has jeopardized her own safety by helping Skeeter...the other maid accepts a position to be the lifetime maid of another couple and then leaves her abusive husband...and the third maid that we come to know is rotting in jail. The only people who make out with better futures are the white characters....Skeeter is off to New York. Celia learns how to cook and, through the ""wisdom"" of her maid, learns how to communicate with her husband and develops self worth. The young white child Viola was raising may get a ""fighting chance"" because Viola tells her mother to give her one. And Hilly may actually become a better person who's finally learned the error of her ways.Finally, there is one part that really summarized this whole film to me. At one point, Skeeter is sitting at Viola Davis's table. She asks her if she ever wanted to do anything else rather than be a maid. Viola Davis nods...and Skeeter never follows up with her to ask her what she wanted to do. My feeling was she didn't ask because it was irrelevant...irrelevant to the story and to the reality of the time. Black women didn't have choices, so there was no reason to speak of dreams that they both knew were empty.All in all, I think this film is a nice effort for what it was, and fluff for what it was not.6.5/10",safe fluff,so i went saw help last night i must say i was pleasantly surprised it wasnt as offensive as blind side ala big overgrown illiterate strong as ox loyal gullible clown saved by white christian savior caricature but overall story was pretty watered down acting is solid but i was torn about this movie it does elicit great white hope character that maids only come together through unlikely liberalism goodness young white character its message future is also disturbing example toward end one maid is offered salvation by white couple who offers her security being their maid rest her life deal that makes her eyes grow wide with happiness meanwhile main white character goes off greener pastures outside limitations her town there are also some unsettling caricatures like mammy figure who gets misty eyed when she talks about how frying chicken makes her feel good inside i think they were pretty spot portrayal white southern belles given that im jackson myself they were mostly ridiculous petty cold which my understanding is how they really were it makes some good comedic moments this is safe film theres no violence threat violence doesnt feel very immediate or nearby racism day feels like omniscient boogey man white men film are all portrayed indifferent they could care less light which seems very unbelievable black men were either abusive docile or messengers i mean not single strong black man real sad thing about this film is what it says about black progress hollywood i havent seen real roles black women this year its telling that project that employs most black women at once is one where they all have play maids even trailer shown before this film tower heist gabourey sidibe precious is playing maid complemented by eddie murphy playing convict with expert knowledge robberies so blacks are either subservient criminals comedic clowns or ever present token black friend exception this rule are few blacks that are seen as being negro lite e g will smith halle berry beyonce many whites dont understand why blacks are sensitive their portrayals film but whites have realize you have abundance images choose however we have very few imagine taking your children movies people that look like them screen are usually stupefied marginalized subservient or comedic point buffoorney thats not reality whites ever have accept adapt or address this is not playing race card as there is no card play when this is your life my grandmother was maid like these women film she went work every day local car dealers family doing housework cooking their meals taking care their kids 5 day she supplemented her income ironing white peoples clothes town she raised 10 kids helped with war effort at home while film like help gives her voice it also robs her hope that things will get better after all one maid quits her job even though her options are extremely limited she has jeopardized her own safety by helping skeeter other maid accepts position be lifetime maid another couple then leaves her abusive husband third maid that we come know is rotting jail only people who make out with better futures are white characters skeeter is off new york celia learns how cook through wisdom her maid learns how communicate with her husband develops self worth young white child viola was raising may get fighting chance because viola tells her mother give her one hilly may actually become better person whos finally learned error her ways finally there is one part that really summarized this whole film me at one point skeeter is sitting at viola daviss table she asks her if she ever wanted do anything else rather than be maid viola davis nods skeeter never follows up with her ask her what she wanted do my feeling was she didnt ask because it was irrelevant irrelevant story reality time black women didnt have choices so there was no reason speak dreams that they both knew were empty all all i think this film is nice effort what it was fluff what it was not 6 5 10,0.4291819985569985,0.03828906299014995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.48}"
9.0,Unforgettable Movie about a Forgettable Time,"In Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, the aspirant writer Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has just graduated and returns home after finding a job writing in a futile newspaper column in the local newspaper. When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) is gone. Skeeter sees the chance of writing a book about the relationship of the black maids with the Southern society for an editor from New York. First she convinces Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) to open her heart to her; then Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) is unfairly fired by the arrogant Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is a leader in the racist high society, and Minny decides to tell her stories after finding a job with the outcast Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain). Soon eleven other maids accept to be interviewed by Skeeter that also tells the truth about Constantine. When the book ""The Help"" is released, Jackson's high society will never be the same.""The Help"" is an unforgettable movie about a forgettable time in the history of the United States of America. The engaging story is supported by magnificent performances and the viewer does not feel the 146 minutes running time. The performances of Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain are top-notch and all of them deserved at least nomination to the Oscar and major film festivals. The direction is tight and art direction is very realistic.

2.0,"Cartoon caricatures trivialize in black and white,","This movie wasn't badly made, it's just bad that it was made. In it every character is a cliché cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken.

7.0,A very nice film about a shameful subject,"We have seen and heard a lot about individual cases of terrible racial injustices. What makes this film different, and precious, is the way it shows the way good people were terribly hurt in a 1,001 little ways, every day of their lives - not only by a system designed to keep them as second-class citizens every bit as nasty as apartheid, but by the way others who considered themselves good people enforced that system and behaved towards fellow members of society who were making an important contribution to that society. I don't know how it is possible for white people in the USA not to watch films like this without squirming in their seats, not from guilt - for guilt is not something one inherits, nor is it automatically collective - but from the discomfort of seeing how badly people can treat one another, based entirely on the colour of their skin (or any of the myriad other silly little ways that are used to divide us as a society - how can any reasonable person believe such distinctions reflect a person's true worth?).",very nice film about shameful subject,we have seen heard lot about individual cases terrible racial injustices what makes this film different precious is way it shows way good people were terribly hurt 1 001 little ways every day their lives not only by system designed keep them as second class citizens every bit as nasty as apartheid but by way others who considered themselves good people enforced that system behaved towards fellow members society who were making important contribution that society i dont know how it is possible white people usa not watch films like this without squirming their seats not guilt guilt is not something one inherits nor is it automatically collective but discomfort seeing how badly people can treat one another based entirely colour their skin or any myriad other silly little ways that are used divide us as society how can any reasonable person believe such distinctions reflect persons true worth,0.637,-0.037466666666666655,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.28}"
3.0,"Exploits real suffering, and panders for sympathy without doing anything genuine","This is a hard film to adequately review, because so much is right with it, yet at the same time so much is wrong. Or if not ""wrong,"" at least there are some major tones that simply did not work for me.The cast is spectacular. Emma Stone is not just adorable, but a skilled and marvelous actor. You don't need me to remark that she has a stellar career ahead of her. The rest of the cast includes some of those great character actors you see in the better films, but can't quite remember where you've seen them before. but that's a plus for a character actor, as their appearances, therefore, always seems fresh.It feels very awkward for me to mention the tone that felt wrong. The abuse and inhumane treatment endured by black people 50 years ago is hard to watch today. The pain inflicted, and the behavior of the oppressors can only be called an ""evil"" situation. One hopes that evolution has done its work, and social justice prevails today. If not perfectly, then at least to a tolerable degree.But that is part of the problem, to me. This film seems to merely recycle old tropes of injustice. It seems to be, as one of my professors used to call it, a ""pot stirrer."" Lots of agitation and angst and shame and sympathy just for the sake of chaos--- but here it doesn't seem to be authentic. It certainly doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's almost as if the writer has taken an easy issue guaranteed to provoke outrage and anger, rather than doing the authentic, and difficult, artistic work necessary to invoke compassion and healing. This film might be, to be blunt, merely counterfeit social justice. It might be a brazen attempt to ""push buttons"" for undeserved sympathy. I sincerely hope I am mistaken, and overly unkind.Granted, that's a subtle point. But that's also why I found the theme of the film a bit objectionable- it seemed as if the filmmakers were taking advantage of most people's natural and gut-level decency to elicit an audience response on a tabloid level.Further, who would DARE to criticize this film? It's almost as if it were ""criticism proof."" Therefore unsound dramatic treatments will go by without comment. Given that I think that was done deliberately, even if somewhat unconsciously, this movie takes an honorable and lofty struggle for which many people suffered and even died, and shamelessly exploits that to make a few bucks at the box office. Think about it- what insights or ""new"" themes were introduced here? I'd say none. It may be an example of what Plato called ""pandering,"" going for the cheap points via a stimulus-response fest.I hope I am wrong- I hope it is really just a matter of me not responding to this particular cinematic venture. If I am even partly right, however, it bodes ill for our modern shallow and thoughtless ""junk media"" environment.",exploits real suffering panders sympathy without doing anything genuine,this is hard film adequately review because so much is right with it yet at same time so much is wrong or if not wrong at least there are some major tones that simply did not work me cast is spectacular emma stone is not just adorable but skilled marvelous actor you dont need me remark that she has stellar career ahead her rest cast includes some those great character actors you see better films but cant quite remember where youve seen them before but thats plus character actor as their appearances therefore always seems fresh it feels very awkward me mention tone that felt wrong abuse inhumane treatment endured by black people 50 years ago is hard watch today pain inflicted behavior oppressors can only be called evil situation one hopes that evolution has done its work social justice prevails today if not perfectly then at least tolerable degree but that is part problem me this film seems merely recycle old tropes injustice it seems be as one my professors used call it pot stirrer lots agitation angst shame sympathy just sake chaos but here it doesnt seem be authentic it certainly doesnt seem go anywhere its almost as if writer has taken easy issue guaranteed provoke outrage anger rather than doing authentic difficult artistic work necessary invoke compassion healing this film might be be blunt merely counterfeit social justice it might be brazen attempt push buttons undeserved sympathy i sincerely hope i am mistaken overly unkind granted thats subtle point but thats also why i found theme film bit objectionable it seemed as if filmmakers were taking advantage most peoples natural gut level decency elicit audience response tabloid level further who would dare criticize this film its almost as if it were criticism proof therefore unsound dramatic treatments will go by without comment given that i think that was done deliberately even if somewhat unconsciously this movie takes honorable lofty struggle which many people suffered even died shamelessly exploits that make few bucks at box office think about it what insights or new themes were introduced here id say none it may be example what plato called pandering going cheap points via stimulus response fest i hope i am wrong i hope it is really just matter me not responding this particular cinematic venture if i am even partly right however it bodes ill our modern shallow thoughtless junk media environment,0.5738257575757575,0.013131854256854265,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,First rate reminder,"Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has spent 4 years doing her degree in the North before returning to 1960s Jackson, Mississippi, where her eyes are opened to the unconscious prejudice which is constantly directed towards the black domestic staff by the over-privileged housewives of the area. Skeeter determines to collect the personal recollections of the domestic maids for publication as a small step towards righting these wrongs.Let's get something straight - I am an ageing white man from rural England so, apart from having grown up through these times, I have nothing in common with any of these people. I am, however, a human being and this is, above all, a story about human beings and how they show - or don't show - their humanity towards each other. I have not read the book on which this film is based.Like The King's Speech, The Help is not just a worthy film, it is also an entertaining one. The characters are all engaging and rounded people, and are all well played. The film is frequently moving and, more frequently, very funny. The period is nicely evoked.Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer have been singled out for praise for their performances as the two domestics who are first to tell their stories: for me, however, I most enjoyed Jessica Chastain's performance as a bimbo who is not as empty-headed as she at first appears. Her performance was funny, emotional, and haunting, and vastly different to her performances in The Debt and Texas Killing Fields. Bryce Dallas Howard's monstrous queen bee was both funny and chilling. In truth, all the principals had their moments.The film is not perfect. It is a touch too long, and what it says is, at this distance in time, something of a given.

10.0,You is kind. You is smart. You is Important,"My wife read this book for a college class and she loved it. The I told her my mom had the movie and she wanted to watch it after she read the book. She invited me to watch it with her, and I have to say I loved it from start to finish.This is a story about prejudice, hate, anger, love, sadness, courage, and doing the right thing. It takes place in the south during 1960 a time of racism and violence, a time when Martin Luther King Jr did his famous march for African American rights. A time when blacks were still considered the lowest of the low. The story is about two African American women and a white writer, together they collect stories about how abusive, rude, and cruel the white society of the south really could be. I am a big history buff, and I know of the times of the 1960's. This movie rings true to everything that went on in the south during this time. Having had parents that grew up during this time but not in the south they knew of this. The reason it is called the help is because it is about a group of African American house keepers the serve high white southern society, who basically raise their children for them because their mothers are to busy with social matters. As I watched the film it struck me hard, how could these mothers just abandon their children? These African American women basically raise them and these children look to them as mothers and caretakers, and when they leave or get fired these children miss them so much. The white writer who is played well by Emma Stone was basically raised by one, and is planning to write a book about these caretakers stories. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will cheer when good things come about. I loved the character Minnie and her sassyness and attitude she was my favorite character, though I liked all of them, I didn't like Bryce Dallas Howard's character Hilly, she was a stuck up, rude, snobbish, evil character who disgusted me throughout the entire movie. You cheer inside when the good characters triumph over her. This film also will open your eyes to what really went on during the south during the civil rights movement. For my generation I do believe this film needs to be watched and understood and after watching this movie I started asking my parents who were just barely teenagers at this time lots and lots of questions. And I also want to read the book. Racism still goes on today though not as big as it was back then. I invite you to watch this movie, your eyes will be opened and you will enjoy it too.

3.0,So help me...,"My wife had recently read the source novel and was most keen to see this movie adaptation, plus I have a keen interest in the US Civil Rights movement and was likewise keen to see it. Perhaps it helps to be an American to appreciate some of the nuances a bit better, but I basically found this a sentimentalised and overly patronising story, with as much resonance as an episode of ""The Waltons"" or ""Little House On The Prairie"". The basic idea of the young college girl writing up her town-life experience and causing controversy as she does so was used before in ""Peyton Place"", that historical but much decorated cinematic piece of soap opera, which for me is about the level the film achieves.In addition, one of the major plot-lines (regarding the shall I say, tainted ""gift"" of a pie) was immediately apparent to me because of a similar scene I recalled from the seminal 70's TV series ""Roots"", which dealt with the big issue here more exhaustively and realistically. There are lots of episodic scenes demonstrating the ebb and flow of ""the help's"" struggle for acceptance, with some drop-in insertions to the narrative from real-time, real-life events such as the murder of Medgar Evers, but I felt the direction catered to the cosy and felt little real drama throughout. Similarly I felt the acting to be showy and shallow by pretty much everyone in the cast, indeed no-one came across as real and I failed to engage with the characters. The depiction of time and place is excellent but students of this era looking for insight and emotional connection with this shaming episode of modern American history should buy or rent out ""Roots"" instead. Oh and make sure you get out of your seat quickly at the end to avoid the overblown Mary J Blige power-ballad over the end-titles which only adds to the disconnect here.",so help me,my wife had recently read source novel was most keen see this movie adaptation plus i have keen interest us civil rights movement was likewise keen see it perhaps it helps be american appreciate some nuances bit better but i basically found this sentimentalised overly patronising story with as much resonance as episode waltons or little house prairie basic idea young college girl writing up her town life experience causing controversy as she does so was used before peyton place that historical but much decorated cinematic piece soap opera which me is about level film achieves addition one major plot lines regarding shall i say tainted gift pie was immediately apparent me because similar scene i recalled seminal 70s tv series roots which dealt with big issue here more exhaustively realistically there are lots episodic scenes demonstrating ebb flow helps struggle acceptance with some drop insertions narrative real time real life events such as murder medgar evers but i felt direction catered cosy felt little real drama throughout similarly i felt acting be showy shallow by pretty much everyone cast indeed no one came across as real i failed engage with characters depiction time place is excellent but students this era looking insight emotional connection with this shaming episode modern american history should buy or rent out roots instead oh make sure you get out your seat quickly at end avoid overblown mary j blige power ballad over end titles which only adds disconnect here,0.39746732026143794,0.10992647058823532,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.4}"
5.0,Forgets about the people's stories they're trying to tell...,"WARNING: *MILD SPOILERS*I've heard a lot about this film so I decided to give it a watch and there are some things about the way this film handled its subject matter which bothered me.The Help is about a woman who decides to write a book detailing African American maids' point of view on the white families they work for as well as the struggles and hardships they go through on a daily basis.I can totally see why this film is held in such high regard amongst average moviegoers and there are aspects that are well done but as a whole, I found The Help to be a very 'safe' film. The best parts of this film has to be the acting and production design. Clearly a lot of work has gone into recreating the 1960s era with the sets and clothing. It looks beautiful and is well made. The performances by everyone involved is fantastic. Viola Davis has never let me down and here she does a terrific job as Aibileen Clark. Bryce Dallas Howard is really convincing as the unlikeable and hateful Hilly Holbrook. Emma Stone is wonderful as Allison Janney is also good. Octavia Spencer gives one of her best and I can see why she won an Oscar for it. Jessica Chastain is great in everything I see her in. She's able to play different characters in each film really well and her performance in The Help is also very good. The accents pulled off by everyone adds to the believability of the time period and their characters.The major issue I have with this film is the story and its treatment of racism. For a film about the experiences gone through African American maids, I'm surprised by how little the film explores that story. A lot of time is spent focusing on the white characters and it's got many subplots involving them which didn't seem necessary and derailed the film from its primary focus which were the maids. The ending itself may seem optimistic but it somehow benefits the white characters more. We see Skeeter Phelan go off to to New York, Celia Foote learns how to be a better cook and strengthens her relationship with her husband and Hilly Holbrook may hopefully learn to better herself whereas Minny Jackson gets offered to be a maid for her entire life and Aibileen Clark leaves her job.The Help is well made in terms of its technicals but the way the story plays out doesn't do the maids justice. It's a white saviour film that manages to forget about the people's stories they're trying to tell and instead looks upon the characters that don't matter as much.",forgets about peoples stories theyre trying tell,warning mild spoilers ive heard lot about this film so i decided give it watch there are some things about way this film handled its subject matter which bothered me help is about woman who decides write book detailing african american maids point view white families they work as well as struggles hardships they go through daily basis i can totally see why this film is held such high regard amongst average moviegoers there are aspects that are well done but as whole i found help be very safe film best parts this film has be acting production design clearly lot work has gone into recreating 1960s era with sets clothing it looks beautiful is well made performances by everyone involved is fantastic viola davis has never let me down here she does terrific job as aibileen clark bryce dallas howard is really convincing as unlikeable hateful hilly holbrook emma stone is wonderful as allison janney is also good octavia spencer gives one her best i can see why she won oscar it jessica chastain is great everything i see her shes able play different characters each film really well her performance help is also very good accents pulled off by everyone adds believability time period their characters major issue i have with this film is story its treatment racism film about experiences gone through african american maids im surprised by how little film explores that story lot time is spent focusing white characters its got many subplots involving them which didnt seem necessary derailed film its primary focus which were maids ending itself may seem optimistic but it somehow benefits white characters more we see skeeter phelan go off new york celia foote learns how be better cook strengthens her relationship with her husband hilly holbrook may hopefully learn better herself whereas minny jackson gets offered be maid her entire life aibileen clark leaves her job help is well made terms its technicals but way story plays out doesnt do maids justice its white saviour film that manages forget about peoples stories theyre trying tell instead looks upon characters that dont matter as much,0.4473935002195871,0.24874945103205973,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.48}"
9.0,Not what I expected.,"The Help is set in the 1960's where colored people had little to no rights and mainly focuses on the colored maids working for the ""white"" people.I didn't really want to see the movie but it got great reviews so I decided to check it out. I must say this movie was quite touching and very well done.The cast is excellent with award worthy performances from Viola Davis, Emma Stone and Octavia Spencer - the main cast. The acting was amazing and there was great chemistry among the respectful classes of people in the film ( the whites and the blacks).The script was well written and I love the balance of comedy and drama. There are some intense scenes however the comedy makes the movie more enjoyable rather than just a movie to make you feel sad all the way through. There was a perfects balance there and I loved that. The film also took you on a roller-coaster of emotions. Sometimes you were sad, extremely happy, angry or laughing. Its also one of those movies that can hold your interest from beginning to end.With great performances, a brilliant script and a film so touching and inspiring, The Help is definitely a must-see!",not what i expected,help is set 1960s where colored people had little no rights mainly focuses colored maids working white people i didnt really want see movie but it got great reviews so i decided check it out i must say this movie was quite touching very well done cast is excellent with award worthy performances viola davis emma stone octavia spencer main cast acting was amazing there was great chemistry among respectful classes people film whites blacks script was well written i love balance comedy drama there are some intense scenes however comedy makes movie more enjoyable rather than just movie make you feel sad all way through there was perfects balance there i loved that film also took you roller coaster emotions sometimes you were sad extremely happy angry or laughing its also one those movies that can hold your interest beginning end with great performances brilliant script film so touching inspiring help is definitely must see,0.6522988505747127,0.32341954022988506,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
