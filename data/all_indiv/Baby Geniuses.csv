7.0,"I laughed a ton, so that's all that matters to me.","Sometimes it amazes me how films that I can't stand get such great reviews or films that I love end up being panned and box office bombs. This one in particular got horrendous reviews but did well enough at the box office to make a sequel, and watching it for the second time I still find it delightfully silly yet ingenious.Top billed villains Kathleen Turner and Christopher Lloyd add another campy bad guy to their plethora of bad guy roles, and really are having a grand time being sinister. Married couple Kim Cattrall and Peter MacNichol work for their alleged baby charity foundation which is really a front for an organization determined to uncode baby talk, utilizing a special breed of baby that they have determined to be genius.Having separated the twins born to Cattrall and MacNichol at birth, they keep losing the twin they kept which, in true ""Parent Trap"" fashion, is switched with his brother, and Cattrall's Auntie Kathleen utilizes this as an opportunity for further research as she goes out of her way to switch them back. But baby geniuses have unfathomable ways of outwitting bad adults, and it becomes a fun battle between evil and Innocence, but with a twist.This has a great supporting cast which includes veteran actors Dom DeLuise, Ruby Dee, Kaye Ballard and Kathleen Freeman, with Dee going up against MacNichol and Cattrall's punk rocker nephew Kyle Howard, and outdoing him with the wisecracks everytime he tries to get one up on her. some of the dialogue is really out of place and rather uncomfortable to hear coming out of children's voices, but that's a minor complaint for me. All I know is that I had a really good time, laughed a lot, and even saved my copy, something I rarely do anymore. a reference to ""Home Alone"" style gags by one of the bad guys does indicate they know they are ripping off already done material, but that's part of the charm.",i laughed ton so thats all that matters me,sometimes it amazes me how films that i cant stand get such great reviews or films that i love end up being panned box office bombs this one particular got horrendous reviews but did well enough at box office make sequel watching it second time i still find it delightfully silly yet ingenious top billed villains kathleen turner christopher lloyd add another campy bad guy their plethora bad guy roles really are having grand time being sinister married couple kim cattrall peter macnichol work their alleged baby charity foundation which is really front organization determined uncode baby talk utilizing special breed baby that they have determined be genius having separated twins born cattrall macnichol at birth they keep losing twin they kept which true parent trap fashion is switched with his brother cattralls auntie kathleen utilizes this as opportunity further research as she goes out her way switch them back but baby geniuses have unfathomable ways outwitting bad adults it becomes fun battle between evil innocence but with twist this has great supporting cast which includes veteran actors dom deluise ruby dee kaye ballard kathleen freeman with dee going up against macnichol cattralls punk rocker nephew kyle howard outdoing him with wisecracks everytime he tries get one up her some dialogue is really out place rather uncomfortable hear coming out childrens voices but thats minor complaint me all i know is that i had really good time laughed lot even saved my copy something i rarely do anymore reference home alone style gags by one bad guys does indicate they know they are ripping off already done material but thats part charm,0.4944980694980694,0.06550836550836553,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.23}"

9.0,YOu've got to have babies to love this,"Maybe I'm addled, but I wasn't expecting ""Julius Ceasar"" and Laurence Olivier. This was hilarious, especially since I have a bunch of baby grandchildren, some in that 'before we cross over' area. Jung thinks we do have a collective unconscious, as there is some idea that pre-literate babies have knowledge that the conscious suppresses once they start to speak. This movie explores that premise, but in a hilarious over the top way. Katheryn Turner makes a great baby abuser, tyrant, villainess: Cruella de Ville of the psychology world.Get it and let the little toddlers watch it. Watch THEIR expressions as the babies talk to one another. That's an event and a great interactive situation in itself. A lot easier than talking with a teen-ager.Just don't expect great writing or great acting and you won't be disappointed.

7.0,"Silly, But Not That Stupid","""Baby Geniuses"" is a movie that can be best described as a live-action cartoon. It's certainly not cinematic perfection. Some people have said it's idiotic. But in my opinion, it's not that stupid. It's just very, very silly. You just have to enjoy this sort of movie to not hate it. There are several big name actors appearing; Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd, Dom DeLuise and Kim (""Sex and the City"") Catrall. There aren't any memorable performances, though. The main characters are the babies, and their cartoonish hi-jinx (even if the hi-jinx doesn't always work). ""Baby Geniuses"" is clearly not for everyone. It's just for the few who can appreciate it.",silly but not that stupid,baby geniuses is movie that can be best described as live action cartoon its certainly not cinematic perfection some people have said its idiotic but my opinion its not that stupid its just very very silly you just have enjoy this sort movie not hate it there are several big name actors appearing kathleen turner christopher lloyd dom deluise kim sex city catrall there arent any memorable performances though main characters are babies their cartoonish hi jinx even if hi jinx doesnt always work baby geniuses is clearly not everyone its just few who can appreciate it,0.5367647058823529,-0.05668449197860964,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"

6.0,Stupid?  -> INTENTIONALLY!!!,"I saw this movie on the big screen and had no opinion one way or another about it. After 3 years, while searching for the work of ""Seth Adkins"" I came across this movie, and the many negative comments about it! So, I rented and watched the video to see what I missed that so many found to give it such a bad rating and review. My findings are as follows:This movie is exactly what it is presented as!Please note the following:It was presented as a comedy. (Is is not?). It was presented as a silly, slap-stick comedy (Is it not?). It was NEVER presented to be an academy award winner!I personally do not care for slap-stick humor, but I have to admit that this movie was somewhat enjoyable to me.  I respect Leonard Maltin's opinion about movies, as most of the time he is right on the money. However, this is one of the few times I have to disagree with him!   Why did Leonard Maltin give the movie ""Fire Down Below"" 2 stars and this one BOMB status?? ""Fire Down Below"" is supposed to be a ""serious"" action/drama and Leonard Maltin himself admits that it is ""Laughably bad""! However, here is a move that is supposed to be funny, silly, stupid (whatever way you put it), and he dumps all over it for being exactly what it was promoted to be!!!!!!!!!  No, I do not believe this is one of my favorite movies, but I believe that it has been given a very poor review, based upon many people who desire a more mature script. It is as entertaining as just about any Slap-stick comedy I have ever seen!(Please note: There is some language and (very little (almost un-noticeable)) sexual suggestion that you might find objectionable or object to allowing young children to witness)!",stupid intentionally,i saw this movie big screen had no opinion one way or another about it after 3 years while searching work seth adkins i came across this movie many negative comments about it so i rented watched video see what i missed that so many found give it such bad rating review my findings are as follows this movie is exactly what it is presented as please note following it was presented as comedy is is not it was presented as silly slap stick comedy is it not it was never presented be academy award winner i personally do not care slap stick humor but i have admit that this movie was somewhat enjoyable me i respect leonard maltins opinion about movies as most time he is right money however this is one few times i have disagree with him why did leonard maltin give movie fire down below 2 stars this one bomb status fire down below is supposed be serious action drama leonard maltin himself admits that it is laughably bad however here is move that is supposed be funny silly stupid whatever way you put it he dumps all over it being exactly what it was promoted be no i do not believe this is one my favorite movies but i believe that it has been given very poor review based upon many people who desire more mature script it is as entertaining as just about any slap stick comedy i have ever seen please note there is some language very little almost un noticeable sexual suggestion that you might find objectionable or object allowing young children witness,0.531115921115921,-0.0021963684463684337,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Excellent little silly comedy,"I find this movie funny. Maybe not side splitting, laugh out loud funny but it has a story and it has some good ideas and will tickle you a bit.I don't agree that it is the worst movie of any year as some have said. You have to watch it for what it is. It is simply a little story held together with some nice performances by some kids who probably did not know what they were doing most of the time. I expect it took a lot of editing time to make this happen with the right expressions and timing by the kids. The story holds together, although there is some fantasy in it and at least one hard to believe plot point. I have watched it twice. Once, some years ago and I accidentally watched it again tonight. I thought it was something else (a documentary on smart babies) And I made it all the way through, both times. I don't always make it through movies with no story or bad acting. But this has a good cast, including the twin baby leads (played by triplets), some good lines and it holds together.How bad could it be. There was a sequel and that means that it did make some money and there was some thought by someone that it would make more with the sequel. So take it for what it is. A cutesy little movie with a plot, some evil characters and some fantasy plot points to hold it together and it will be enjoyable. I do not work in the entertainment industry and certainly don't work for any entity connected with the movie but I do think it is not nearly as bad as most here say. Maybe they were embarrassed in some way and were afraid to admit liking it. Whatever! Just see it and judge for yourself. I think you will be pleased at the time spent.miKe",excellent little silly comedy,i find this movie funny maybe not side splitting laugh out loud funny but it has story it has some good ideas will tickle you bit i dont agree that it is worst movie any year as some have said you have watch it what it is it is simply little story held together with some nice performances by some kids who probably did not know what they were doing most time i expect it took lot editing time make this happen with right expressions timing by kids story holds together although there is some fantasy it at least one hard believe plot point i have watched it twice once some years ago i accidentally watched it again tonight i thought it was something else documentary smart babies i made it all way through both times i dont always make it through movies with no story or bad acting but this has good cast including twin baby leads played by triplets some good lines it holds together how bad could it be there was sequel that means that it did make some money there was some thought by someone that it would make more with sequel so take it what it is cutesy little movie with plot some evil characters some fantasy plot points hold it together it will be enjoyable i do not work entertainment industry certainly dont work any entity connected with movie but i do think it is not nearly as bad as most here say maybe they were embarrassed some way were afraid admit liking it whatever just see it judge yourself i think you will be pleased at time spent mike,0.6208333333333333,0.07531622023809521,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.22}"
5.0,Yeah...don't bother.,"I saw that this film had such an unbelievably low rating on IMDb, so I had to see for myself what was so bad about this film. I figured it couldn't possibly be that bad. Well...I think I spoke too soon, cause it was REALLY BAD!The story is really bizarre. No, make that freaking stupid!!! I can't imagine that child would get enjoyment out of this movie. I'm sure that kids would laugh at a little bit of the stupid humor, but not a whole lot.I find it physically painful that Christopher Lloyd agreed to do this movie. Why Chris, Why? I was also a little surprised to see Kim Cattrall in the film too, I think she can do much better than this. I do like Peter MacNicol (TV's ""Ally McBeal""), and he did a pretty good job with his role. Kyle Howard's character was quite bizarre, if you've seen the film, I think you'll know what I'm talking about. But...he did a pretty good job with his role. Dom DeLuise was another good addition, but not enough to make this film worth watching. I did like seeing Jim Hanks in the film, brother to a certain other famous Hanks (Tom Hanks if you can't figure it out), although he has a very small role in the film. It's amazing how much Jim looks like Tom.One other thing I have to vent out that really angered me. The cover to this movie shows the little kid with glasses on. I don't think he EVER had glasses on in the entire film!!! Perhaps I missed it, but I sure didn't notice them. Strange huh?All in all, I would definitely recommend staying clear of this film, unless you're curious like I was. If you do end up seeing this film, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.

8.0,In defense of this film... it's not THAT bad...,"I think people are coming down entirely too hard on this film. Granted, it's no Look Who's Talking (1 or 2) or Baby's Day Out. It wasn't intended to be. It's a fantastical way to bring ""thinking"" babies back into the spotlight. Look at how much we all love Rugrats, not to mention the aforementioned films. The main goal is not about content, but the ""aww"" factor or just sheer enjoyment of cute toddlers. This is not a film that should be picked apart. It was more than likely made just for fun. Maybe babies don't know the secrets of the universe. But it's something silly to think about.

1.0,May I ask a legitimate question- whose idea was it to use the talents of Kathaleen Turner and Christopher Lloyd and waste them?,"I will give some credit to this otherwise awful film, that it is better than its abysmal sequel Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. On paper, it doesn't look so bad, it has a great cast including beautiful Kathaleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd who is a lot of fun in pretty much everything he's in and the late Dom DeLuise. If only, if only it had a decent enough script and a good enough plot. However, the film is severely lacking in both areas, and makes a waste of those truly talented actors.The script is just awful, and doesn't give anyone enough to work with, and there is no originality or sophistication. The story is one that has been done before and better about a nasty children's magnate who is carrying out tests on a host of brainy little children on the premise that they can speak in a secret language. Bob Clark's direction is very unfocused throughout, and doesn't improve whatsoever. The camera-work is rushed, and the slapstick is uninspiredly staged. In fact, if there was a redeeming quality, the soundtrack was okay to say the least.The performances are disappointingly poor, and they are not helped by the lacklustre direction and the witless script. To be honest I found triplets Leo, Myles and Gerry Fitzgerald very irritating as the twins who try to outmatch Dr Kinder. As for Turner, this has to be a career low for her. This is a shame, because she is so beautiful and talented, but her strengths aren't even put to use here and she does overact quite wildly. Christopher Lloyd usually excels in roles similar to the one he has here, but he looks embarrassed here and looks as though he wants to get it all out of the way. And Dom DeLuise? For such a talented and versatile actor like DeLuise, you would expect a lot from him. But his part is so badly underwritten that he comes across as wasted.All in all, sorry but I didn't like this movie. Even with such a wonderful bunch of actors, their talents are all gone to waste with poor writing, direction and plot. 1/10 Bethany Cox",may i ask legitimate question whose idea was it use talents kathaleen turner christopher lloyd waste them,i will give some credit this otherwise awful film that it is better than its abysmal sequel superbabies baby geniuses 2 paper it doesnt look so bad it has great cast including beautiful kathaleen turner christopher lloyd who is lot fun pretty much everything hes late dom deluise if only if only it had decent enough script good enough plot however film is severely lacking both areas makes waste those truly talented actors script is just awful doesnt give anyone enough work with there is no originality or sophistication story is one that has been done before better about nasty childrens magnate who is carrying out tests host brainy little children premise that they can speak secret language bob clarks direction is very unfocused throughout doesnt improve whatsoever camera work is rushed slapstick is uninspiredly staged fact if there was redeeming quality soundtrack was okay say least performances are disappointingly poor they are not helped by lacklustre direction witless script be honest i found triplets leo myles gerry fitzgerald very irritating as twins who try outmatch dr kinder as turner this has be career low her this is shame because she is so beautiful talented but her strengths arent even put use here she does overact quite wildly christopher lloyd usually excels roles similar one he has here but he looks embarrassed here looks as though he wants get it all out way dom deluise such talented versatile actor like deluise you would expect lot him but his part is so badly underwritten that he comes across as wasted all all sorry but i didnt like this movie even with such wonderful bunch actors their talents are all gone waste with poor writing direction plot 1 10 bethany cox,0.6187499999999999,0.01331597222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"

6.0,A fun romp,"I didn't think this movie was as bad as apparently most IMDb viewers did. It's based loosely on a folk belief that babies really know everything, but forget it as they learn how to talk and therefore can never communicate the ""secrets of life"" to others. The film obviously is intended for an audience of very small children, and the characters and plot are all one-dimensional and exaggerated, but allowing for all that the story made a sort of sense, with definable good guys and bad guys.

10.0,An Under-rated Great Family Movie.,"Wow what an excellent movie!. I could not believe why it has been extremely under-rated. It is so amusing,funny and witty. Critics are sometimes narrow-minded and unfair in their reviews. Most kids all over the world will enjoy watching a fantastic comedy movie with superb action and great cinematography.Plot of Baby Geniuses: Two scientists, Dr. Elena Kinder (Kathleen Turner) and Dr. Heep (Christopher Lloyd), use genius-baby studies to fund BabyCo's theme park ""Joyworld"". According Dr. Kinder's Research, babies are supposed to possess vast, universal knowledge and speak a secret yet impossible-to-translate baby prelanguage called ""Babytalk"". At age two, however, the knowledge and language are lost as the babies ""cross over"" by learning how to talk. Most of the babies that were raised in Dr. Kinder's vast, underground research facility were adopted from the Pasadena orphanage, transformed into geniuses through use of the Kinder Method, and then used in experiments to decipher the language used by the baby-geniuses.One mischievous toddler, Sylvester (AKA Sly), makes repeated attempts to escape Dr. Kinder's research facility and one night, Sylvester goes into a dirty diaper truck and he actually succeeds. The next morning, one things Sylvester does not expect is to run into his twin, Whit, in a mall playground. Although Sylvester and Whit share a telepathic bond, they have no idea of each other's existence. While the guards from Dr. Kinder's research facility capture Whit, mistake him for Sylvester, and take him back to Dr. Kinder's research facility, Sylvester is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, Robin (Kim Cattrall), who is Dr. Kinder's niece. After Dr. Kinder is horrified that Whit and Sylvester switched at the mall, she decides to do a cross evaluation on Sylvester and Whit. However, when she comes to Dan Bobbin's place, she realizes that Dan Bobbin can understand babies. After the attempts to retrieve Sylvester fail, Dr. Kinder decides to move the research facility to Lichtenstein, so that they can transform Whit into becoming a genius thanks to him getting bred by the Kinder Method (thus erasing his memories about his foster parents, foster brothers and foster sisters) and use him as an experiment to crack the code to ""Babytalk"".The babies at Bobbin's place hypnotize Lenny (Dom DeLuise), the bus driver to drive to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Once at the research facility, Sylvester goes to the control room to set the robots from the theme park on the lab scientists. When the Bobbins return home, their natural daughter Carrie tells her father that the children are in Dr. Kinder's research facility. At the end of the fight Dr. Kinder captures Whit and takes him to the helicopter pad on the roof. Robin and Dan chase them to the roof, where Dr. Kinder reveals that she and Robin are not related, and that Robin was adopted at age two. After Dr. Kinder got arrested by the police, Sylvester and Whit come together on the roof to cross over.Dan and Robin adopt Sylvester. Dan is still curious of the secrets of life, but as the twins have crossed over they no longer know those secrets. Carrie, their sister, doesn't reveal anything (just gives her dad a sly smile) because adults aren't meant to know their secrets.Buy This DVD!.

7.0,An interesting failure,"Christopher Lloyd, as usual, is in top form. The rest of the cast is good as well, but that's not where Baby Geniuses fails. It's main problem is that the script just isn't funny enough. The film has moments of zany humor and a few laughs, but nothing here is that memorable...except the interaction between babies. These kiddies really appear to be communicating with one another. There are elements in this film that may help it achieve cult status in the near future. As it stands now, Baby Geniuses is an interesting failure. It entertained me until the end, but I just didn't laugh enough. See it for the novel plot and Lloyd's over the top performance.

,I Liked It,"This was a pretty good movie, in my opinion. There was good humor, kids could watch it and enjoy it, and the plot is easy to understand. I don't know why people here don't like it, but that's their opinions. While I don't hate the movie, it can be a tad bit unbelievable. But if it were believable, then it couldn't exist. A kid might enjoy this and so might some adults. Comparable to Rugrats, it isn't as good as that show, but is the next best thing. What kids might like are the babies in the movie that could be just like them if they were like that. Man, I am running out of things to say. But I am almost at ten lines! The point is watch the movie. Phew! I made it.",i liked it,this was pretty good movie my opinion there was good humor kids could watch it enjoy it plot is easy understand i dont know why people here dont like it but thats their opinions while i dont hate movie it can be tad bit unbelievable but if it were believable then it couldnt exist kid might enjoy this so might some adults comparable rugrats it isnt as good as that show but is next best thing what kids might like are babies movie that could be just like them if they were like that man i am running out things say but i am almost at ten lines point is watch movie phew i made it,0.580952380952381,0.33095238095238094,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.04}"

9.0,"Hilarious, and stunningly true","Before ever seeing this movie, I believed babies were capable of a lot more than what we're led to believe... for example, one baby starts crying in a crowded store, and suddenly babies are crying throughout the store. I dubbed this ""sympathy crying"" where they're all telling each other how bad they have it. (""My mom didn't change my diaper for three hours! By the time I got her to change it, I had a really bad rash!"" ""Oh yeah? Well my dad forgot to feed me at six! I had to remind him for over a half hour before he finally brought in a bottle!"")Since I've seen this movie, I find it much easier to get babies to smile, and usually give them a knowing look when they start to fuss up... only to have them stop! It's amazing!The movie is hilarious... Some people apparently think it's a little corny; these people are the same ones who can't watch a comedian without getting bored. The antics, and pure comedy, of this movie makes it worth a watch...

10.0,What film was created for...,"For those not initiated in the BG Fanclub, Baby Geniuses is one of the best movies ever filmed since the invention of motion pictures. Shunned by certain members of the Academy in 1999, Baby Geniuses failed to be nominated for any Oscars due to too many dried up, haggard, pro-choice members who were terrified of the children in this film. Otherwise, this movie would have been awarded the highest honors for its superb acting, special effects, direction, and choreography. ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" anyone?
