8,Another Pulp Fiction with a universal message!,"Second Time: Watching it for the second time did feel a bit bored as the movie was very very slow paced, but there were few tidbits that I got to notice and few unnoticed background noises, music & dialogues. But still, it is definitely one of the differently best-made movies every in Tamil cinema.First Time: Yet another pulp fiction kinda movie with 3 plots going in parallel with a wee bit of interesting link in the end along with a universal message that relates to life, relationships, sex, sexism, love and with a whole lot of other societal concerns. Yuvan's BGM is the SOUL of the movie. Camera angles/frames portrayed the environments realistically. Each and every characterization just feels so lively, shuttle performance by everyone.

8,"'Super Deluxe' is bit lengthy and boring film, yet I call it supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!","No doubt Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Super Deluxe is one of the masterpiece and the cult classic film in Tamil. The moment I saw the posters of Park Chan-wook's Sympathy for Vengeance, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and a picture of David Lynch at the DVD Rental store in the film, I was sold, that's when I thought this is going to be full paisa vasool padam. You're getting a full package of four Film (since it has four different story) wrapped and served on a platter.In one of the interview Thiagarajan Kumararaja said he's afraid to write and he's lazy. Seriously...? When he can create wonders like Aaranya Kaandam and Super Deluxe when he's afraid and lazy, just wonder what would be the outcome if he's not lazy or afraid.Take a bow to the writers - Kumararaja, Mysskin, Nalan Kumarasamy and Neelan K. Sekhar for crafting such a phenomenal story across their views on life, relationships, love, sex and spirituality. And an extra effort made by Kumararaja to hyperlink those stories along With Idiosyncratic and Palpable characters.Samantha as Vaembu, is one heck of a performance. For the fact, she wasn't the first choice for the character, many leading actresses had turned down playing Vaembu. And now I can say, no one else could have done it better than Sam, she's irreplaceable.And our very own Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi playing the transgender women Shilpa, the episodes between him and his son Rasukutty (Ashwanth Ashokkumar) Was so pure, for sure you will fall in love with that kid. Bagavathi Perumal as SI Berlin is one character where the audience will feel like thrashing him, Shilpa-Berlin and Vaembu-Berlin scenes, will definitely fill the rage in the eyes of the audience for its own reasons. Leela's (Ramya Krishnan) dialogue towards the end of the climax, will definitely hit you hard.Fahadh Faasil as Mugilan, Mysskin as Arputham, Gayathrie as Jyothi and the four kids. You will witness some awe-inspiring performance by each and everyone, proving their caliber. Even the minor characters, has done some stupendous job in acting.Once you understand Kumararaja, the same lengthy and boring scenes will now slowly transit to an interesting setting. Vinod and Nirav Shah cinematography elevates the story, the color pattern, the unconventional camera angles, along with the crisp editing by Sathyaraj Natarajan, I was spellbound.If you've already validated 'Rowdy Baby' as Yuvan Shankar Raja best in career in terms of its quality treatment and popularity, then you must Watch Super Deluxe. As they say, there's something more than that meets the eye, U1 's sound design techniques is one among that. Every minute detail that you witness in his background scoring along with Illaiyaraja songs, is something which can be considered as the added bonus to your paisa vasool ticket. And the ride ends with the compelling climax.If one can even enjoy the steady frame for more than 8 seconds and the silence within that. Then it has to be Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Film.",super deluxe is bit lengthy boring film yet i call it supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,no doubt thiagarajan kumararajas super deluxe is one masterpiece cult classic film tamil moment i saw posters park chan wooks sympathy vengeance quentin tarantinos kill bill picture david lynch at dvd rental store film i was sold thats when i thought this is going be full paisa vasool padam youre getting full package four film since it has four different story wrapped served platter one interview thiagarajan kumararaja said hes afraid write hes lazy seriously when he can create wonders like aaranya kaandam super deluxe when hes afraid lazy just wonder what would be outcome if hes not lazy or afraid take bow writers kumararaja mysskin nalan kumarasamy neelan k sekhar crafting such phenomenal story across their views life relationships love sex spirituality extra effort made by kumararaja hyperlink those stories along with idiosyncratic palpable characters samantha as vaembu is one heck performance fact she wasnt first choice character many leading actresses had turned down playing vaembu now i can say no one else could have done it better than sam shes irreplaceable our very own makkal selvan vijay sethupathi playing transgender women shilpa episodes between him his son rasukutty ashwanth ashokkumar was so pure sure you will fall love with that kid bagavathi perumal as si berlin is one character where audience will feel like thrashing him shilpa berlin vaembu berlin scenes will definitely fill rage eyes audience its own reasons leelas ramya krishnan dialogue towards end climax will definitely hit you hard fahadh faasil as mugilan mysskin as arputham gayathrie as jyothi four kids you will witness some awe inspiring performance by each everyone proving their caliber even minor characters has done some stupendous job acting once you understand kumararaja same lengthy boring scenes will now slowly transit interesting setting vinod nirav shah cinematography elevates story color pattern unconventional camera angles along with crisp editing by sathyaraj natarajan i was spellbound if youve already validated rowdy baby as yuvan shankar raja best career terms its quality treatment popularity then you must watch super deluxe as they say theres something more than that meets eye u1 s sound design techniques is one among that every minute detail that you witness his background scoring along with illaiyaraja songs is something which can be considered as added bonus your paisa vasool ticket ride ends with compelling climax if one can even enjoy steady frame more than 8 seconds silence within that then it has be thiagarajan kumararajas film,0.611431623931624,0.16644993894993892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8,Where art meets entertainment; 'Super Deluxe' is the kind of 'cult-classic' Tamil cinema needs! [+80%],"'Super Deluxe' is everything you cannot have imagined by just knowing the title. With Thiagarajan Kumararaja at its helm, I did have high hopes. The writing duties were shared between the director, Mysskin, Nalan Kumaraswamy, and Neelan K. Sekar - all promising names in the industry. The cast featured Vijay Sethupathi (in the role of a transwoman as revealed from the poster), Samantha Akkineni, Fahadh Faasil, Ramya Krishnan, Mysskin, and more. Did they deliver? A colossal YES!Super Deluxe is 'Pulp Fiction' for Tamil cinema in 2019. There are four different storylines happening parallel to each other, yet somehow connected in ways that you would not see coming. Each frame in the film boasts a colour palette that only someone like Kumararaja can come up with. The opacity is rich and saturated, the costumes match the backdrops well, and the colour tones employed by cinematographers Nirav Shah and P.S Vinod blend with the respective storylines brilliantly.The screenplay will throw a good number of surprises (and twists) at you. It's too random to be placed into a single genre (or even two, or three!). The undercurrent of black humour is certainly there, but when the emotions take centre-stage, the viewer has no choice but to treat it with the seriousness that it whole-heartedly deserves. The list of whammies include someone dying during sex, a husband/father returning to his household in the most unforeseen way possible, a porn movie that had more than what its teen viewers bargained for, and lastly, the struggles of a wife (of a self-proclaimed godman) whose son has met with an unruly accident.When it comes to performances, Super Deluxe holds nothing back. If we thought Sethupathi did not have any more challenging roles to do (we last saw him as Ayya in Seethakaathi), here comes yet another cracker of a show by him, conveying the troubles that a transwoman often has to deal with in our world. This has to be Samantha's best performance as yet, where she doesn't play second fiddle to a masala/sappy hero, instead putting forth an extremely layered act. Fahadh Faasil is tremendous as usual, playing the husband who has to deal with his wife's infidelity and the unlikely aftermath that follows. The actors who portray the schoolboys who decide to watch porn at home on a regular working day, certainly show promise.However, the top honours go to Ashwanth Ashokkumar, the child actor playing the kid excited to meet his dad for the first time. This has got to be one of the most well-written, well-acted child characters in a movie in a very long time. He wants to prove to his friends at school that he's not a 'test-tube baby', and he does not care who or how his father has turned out to be in the meantime. And it is for this reason that the finale of this particular segment felt the most satisfying (and heartwarming at the same time).Leela's (Ramya Krishnan) segment could have been edited better, but the aesthetics (just look at Arputham's prayer hall and how it has been designed) are impressive. Everything in the movie has been placed to impeccable detail - the police station set, the gangster's house that the boys barge into, the roadside walls (filled with movie posters and a parked lorry with rusted barrels and what-not) and many many more. When it comes to comedy, Mugil's (Fahadh) monologue with his wife's dead lover will surely leave you in splits. Berlin, the cop, has been played with the right amount of nastiness by Bucks.This isn't your regular commercial potboiler - it's a film with substance, well-rounded characters, tasteful aesthetics, clap-worthy performances, a moving background score (by Yuvan) and subtle philosophy. Watch it with people who appreciate cinema for the flagrant/expressive art-form that it is.",where art meets entertainment super deluxe is kind cult classic tamil cinema needs,super deluxe is everything you cannot have imagined by just knowing title with thiagarajan kumararaja at its helm i did have high hopes writing duties were shared between director mysskin nalan kumaraswamy neelan k sekar all promising names industry cast featured vijay sethupathi role transwoman as revealed poster samantha akkineni fahadh faasil ramya krishnan mysskin more did they deliver colossal yes super deluxe is pulp fiction tamil cinema 2019 there are four different storylines happening parallel each other yet somehow connected ways that you would not see coming each frame film boasts colour palette that only someone like kumararaja can come up with opacity is rich saturated costumes match backdrops well colour tones employed by cinematographers nirav shah p s vinod blend with respective storylines brilliantly screenplay will throw good number surprises twists at you its too random be placed into single genre or even two or three undercurrent black humour is certainly there but when emotions take centre stage viewer has no choice but treat it with seriousness that it whole heartedly deserves list whammies include someone dying during sex husband father returning his household most unforeseen way possible porn movie that had more than what its teen viewers bargained lastly struggles wife self proclaimed godman whose son has met with unruly accident when it comes performances super deluxe holds nothing back if we thought sethupathi did not have any more challenging roles do we last saw him as ayya seethakaathi here comes yet another cracker show by him conveying troubles that transwoman often has deal with our world this has be samanthas best performance as yet where she doesnt play second fiddle masala sappy hero instead putting forth extremely layered act fahadh faasil is tremendous as usual playing husband who has deal with his wifes infidelity unlikely aftermath that follows actors who portray schoolboys who decide watch porn at home regular working day certainly show promise however top honours go ashwanth ashokkumar child actor playing kid excited meet his dad first time this has got be one most well written well acted child characters movie very long time he wants prove his friends at school that hes not test tube baby he does not care who or how his father has turned out be meantime it is this reason that finale this particular segment felt most satisfying heartwarming at same time leelas ramya krishnan segment could have been edited better but aesthetics just look at arputhams prayer hall how it has been designed are impressive everything movie has been placed impeccable detail police station set gangsters house that boys barge into roadside walls filled with movie posters parked lorry with rusted barrels what not many many more when it comes comedy mugils fahadh monologue with his wifes dead lover will surely leave you splits berlin cop has been played with right amount nastiness by bucks this isnt your regular commercial potboiler its film with substance well rounded characters tasteful aesthetics clap worthy performances moving background score by yuvan subtle philosophy watch it with people who appreciate cinema flagrant expressive art form that it is,0.5400327369892587,0.25465493443754317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,Multilayered Cualdron of cinemas,"The movie sets the ball rolling big time even as the credits come on. Then the background music makes it's entry and then the first scene comes on, and you know, you are in the right theater.The deep saturated colors in the frames feel so perfect. The frames are simply perfect - framing characters in different portions of the screen, amazing.There are so many scenes that are so hilarious. The screenplay has a welcome randomness to it. You typically never know what is coming.Vijay Sethupathi is on a push-the-envelope mode. While the old man in Aadhi was challenging, the transgender in Super-Deluxe is a level up in challenge and well met.Fahad Fazil, on the other hand, did not have a better role here than say ""Kumbalangi Nights"". Some of his scenes almost did not work, while many others did.Bagavathi Perumal, who plays the subinspector has given a truly outstanding performance, potentially surpassed only by Vijay Sethupathi, who had the advantage of much more challenging scenes.Yuvan Shankar Raja has done amazing background music work, that stands out with it's subduedness. Music is used to enhance comedy at multiple points, and the result has been fantastic. Also, unique sound choices to communicate scene tension, background sounds to give a feel of a lot of background action.Multiple unpredictable random threads of stories sometimes come together in such a sudden tight knot that you can almost touch. Randomness is just awesome.The thread on god did not connect with me and hence, scenes on that thread, felt like a drag, as also did some scenes of Fahadh.Deeply philosophical as well, the movie presents various valid stands.

8,Not a Deluxe Story but a Super Storytelling.,"Super Deluxe (2018) : Brief Review-Not a Deluxe Story but a Super Storytelling. Tamil Cinema finally has an experimental artistic cinema loaded with massy black comedy even though the script seems to have lost sense couple of times. Nevertheless, the script is not everything everytime, sometimes it's about storytelling and Super Deluxe is indeed a Super Storytelling. 3 different stories of disasters happening somewhere in this crazy world, each one having different circumstances, different ratios, different lifestyle and different reasons meet each other in accidental way to prove God's crazy direction in this filmy world. Out of those 3 stories, one is about a transgender, one is about a group of boys leading to heavy disasters after their horny desires and the third is one another a married couples. The first one is Highly appreciated one because it talks about society's point of view about a Transgender and how the victim's thinking changes after his family gets into support him. The 2nd one is full on fun yet shocking because lusty and horny boys can have delusions too and so it could be one related to your family. Here some fictional and non realistic elements like Aliens and Christening were contradictory. The third one is the weakest one as it tells this poor vision of husband accepting his wife's sexual affair after she's forced to have another one in front of him. However this bad story is saved by the accidental link to the 2nd one which had ended on solid note. Overall, one story is Great, one is Good and one is average. Acting, cinematography, dialogues and direction are fine and nothing much down here. It's the writing which could have had more sense in the begining because they go beyond intellectual ends in the climax with some mind shattering facts about God, World, Human Life and Death. A Classic for me with 2-3 conditions.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",not deluxe story but super storytelling,super deluxe 2018 brief review not deluxe story but super storytelling tamil cinema finally has experimental artistic cinema loaded with massy black comedy even though script seems have lost sense couple times nevertheless script is not everything everytime sometimes its about storytelling super deluxe is indeed super storytelling 3 different stories disasters happening somewhere this crazy world each one having different circumstances different ratios different lifestyle different reasons meet each other accidental way prove gods crazy direction this filmy world out those 3 stories one is about transgender one is about group boys leading heavy disasters after their horny desires third is one another married couples first one is highly appreciated one because it talks about societys point view about transgender how victims thinking changes after his family gets into support him 2nd one is full fun yet shocking because lusty horny boys can have delusions too so it could be one related your family here some fictional non realistic elements like aliens christening were contradictory third one is weakest one as it tells this poor vision husband accepting his wifes sexual affair after shes forced have another one front him however this bad story is saved by accidental link 2nd one which had ended solid note overall one story is great one is good one is average acting cinematography dialogues direction are fine nothing much down here its writing which could have had more sense begining because they go beyond intellectual ends climax with some mind shattering facts about god world human life death classic me with 2 3 conditions rating 8 10 by,0.4864850427350427,0.06159188034188034,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,Super Deluxe is a masterpiece,"#SuperDeluxe - This is a strict A film. Not like IAMK type but something that is very new to tamil cinema. The film is so dark because these characters are so real and it's like meeting someone you'll never meet in ordinary life.

Maybe he'll be Kollywood's best known Screen writer.The background set, Cinematography is all just so perfect. No compromises made anywhere.Coming on to #Samantha, she made a terrific role. Her second lifetime best role, first is always Nithya from #NEP. #VijaySethupathy has nothing to prove here, we already know what he is. #FahadhFaasil, #Bucks, #Mysskin, small boy, 5 youngesters all gave a wonderful performance.Overall, I would give Super Deluxe an Oscar if I was part of Jury for it's unconventional story line, something we have never seen in Tamil Cinema. The low point is, it won't work with all of the Tamil audiences. I have a friend who diagrees with all my points and says that 'Super Deluxe' has too many unclutural, uncomfortable scenes or dialogs involved. The problem is that the film is way ahead of our time.But in the end of the day, a film should either be Art or Entertainment. This is Artainment. This is new, this is very new with Tamil Cinema.

10,A Landmark For Indian Cinema.,"Re-watched Super Deluxe The Movie not only for writing about it but also for experiencing 3 hours with one of the greatest film of the country. Previously when someone asked about my favourite film, 3 Idiots come to my mind first. But after watching this, it become one of my favourite film of all time. Now coming to the review.First thing I want to say about this film is it's cinematography. Cinematographer P. S. Vinod and Nirav Shah capture each frame beautifully. The camera movement and positioning are simply brilliant. It follows every character movement with such ease. Using of colour palette is something that I've never seen before in Indian Cinema. The colour is so good that if you watch the film in your phone and take a screenshot of any scene, it'll look like an individual picture.We can't keep this film in one genre. This is a mixed genre film, we can say it's Thiagarajan Kumararaja genre film ðŸ˜„. Because in his first film Aaranya Kaandam also, he had showed us a unique Screenplay. In this one, there are 4 stories in the film, that could be individual movie storyline, connected to each other seamlessly. The Movie is too much detailed. Even in the film, there were some news playing on the TV, that's also interlinked with the plot. The Movie is approx 3 hours long but I'm sure you'll not get bored for 1 sec.The most fabulous thing is it's Performances. It has a huge cast of great actors and everyone puts a lasting impression with their characters. The star of the show is undoubtedly Vijay Sethupathi as Shilpa and Ashwanth Ashokkumar as Rasukutty and their relationship as father and son is the most lovable thing of the film. Samantha Akkineni was amazing and also looking very beautiful. My favourite Fahadh Faasil is as always brilliant. The three friends played by Vijay Ram, Naveen and Abdul Jabbar were so natural. Ramya Krishnan as a helpless mother portrays her character with perfection. Bagavathi Perumalas as a corrupt and disgusting police officer was horrifying, you'll just hate the character.The film teaches us several lessons and also focuses on human nature towards specific things of society. I've never seen this type of film before. This is undoubtedly a landmark for Indian Cinema.",landmark indian cinema,re watched super deluxe movie not only writing about it but also experiencing 3 hours with one greatest film country previously when someone asked about my favourite film 3 idiots come my mind first but after watching this it become one my favourite film all time now coming review first thing i want say about this film is its cinematography cinematographer p s vinod nirav shah capture each frame beautifully camera movement positioning are simply brilliant it follows every character movement with such ease using colour palette is something that ive never seen before indian cinema colour is so good that if you watch film your phone take screenshot any scene itll look like individual picture we cant keep this film one genre this is mixed genre film we can say its thiagarajan kumararaja genre film because his first film aaranya kaandam also he had showed us unique screenplay this one there are 4 stories film that could be individual movie storyline connected each other seamlessly movie is too much detailed even film there were some news playing tv thats also interlinked with plot movie is approx 3 hours long but im sure youll not get bored 1 sec most fabulous thing is its performances it has huge cast great actors everyone puts lasting impression with their characters star show is undoubtedly vijay sethupathi as shilpa ashwanth ashokkumar as rasukutty their relationship as father son is most lovable thing film samantha akkineni was amazing also looking very beautiful my favourite fahadh faasil is as always brilliant three friends played by vijay ram naveen abdul jabbar were so natural ramya krishnan as helpless mother portrays her character with perfection bagavathi perumalas as corrupt disgusting police officer was horrifying youll just hate character film teaches us several lessons also focuses human nature towards specific things society ive never seen this type film before this is undoubtedly landmark indian cinema,0.6279100529100529,0.173015873015873,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9,The Super Deluxe Experience,"Even before the trailer was released, I was excited to watch this movie. When you watch movies like 'Aaranya Kaandam', the kind of experience you get will only leave you to crave for more. And when you hear names like - Vijay Sethupathi, Fahad Fazil, Ramya Krishnan, etc., your expectation grows multi-fold. Finally, when the trailer was released, it did perfect justice to the huge expectations. But will Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja deliver? Will the audience understand the genius that is Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja? Or Will 'Super Deluxe' succumb to the same fate of 'Aaranya Kaandam'? We'll get to all of these in a bit but first things first.Vijay Sethupathi - I don't know how many know about this trivia - Maniratnam was mighty impressed with the performance of Mohanlal in 'Iruvar' that, after he finished the shoot, he told Mohanlal - 'I will never direct you again.' And he never did. The reason I'm citing this here is that I don't think Vijay Sethupathi should ever act again. He should retire after this movie. I have seen a handful of world movies in different languages but I'm telling you no actor/acting in the world can compare to what he has done in this movie. Being a diehard Kamal fan from childhood, I can tell you this is a role that even legends like Kamal, Mohanlal cannot do justice to. And the fact that Vijay Sethupathi made it look so easy and convincing speaks volume about this man's talent, dedication, and hard work. The role of a lifetime. You might have already seen Vijay Sethupathi as a transgender in the poster and in the trailer, but nothing will prepare you for what he has done in the movie. I repeat, NOTHING!No one can depict the beauty of a Father-Son relationship in the most unimaginable situations like Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja does. Take Aaranya Kaandam for instance - In one of the many parallels in the movie, we get a Father-son duo - A once rich Father who lost all his money in gambling and let down his family and a son who is angry on his Father for letting him down but will never give up on his Father. In fact, his dialogue sums up the entire movie. When a Police ask, ""Unga appa na unaku avlo pidikuma da?"" he replies, ""Apdi lam illa. Aana avaru enga Appa.."". In Super Deluxe we get a similar parallel, A transgender father who left his family, and a son who never gives up on his father no matter how much he is angry on him. And so beautifully the son sums up their relationship when he utters this dialogue while crying - ""Nee aambalaya iru, pombalaya iru.. Aana enga kooda iru.."". The boy who plays Vijay Sethupathi's son has just nailed it.Fahad Fazil plays a poor husband. Poor - not as in financially poor, but the most unfortunate kind of poor - 'has-a-wife-who-cheats-him-with-his-college-boyfriend-in-his-own-bed' type of poor. I don't know who wrote Fahad Fazil's character, but the bits and pieces he speaks then and there just like that, have very deep meaning and Fahad Fazil being the brilliant actor he is, has portrayed his character with so much conviction. Samantha plays a modern-day girl who always finds her torn between culture, tradition, desires, love, and sex. The best thing about Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja is that he never judges - even his characters. He leaves it entirely to us. Whether what Samantha did was right or wrong? Well, that depends on WHAT is right and WHAT is wrong.Only Ramya Krishnan can play the role of a 'Rajamatha' and a 'Sex worker' so convincingly that we actually think these are two different actors. Such a versatile actress! In the center of all this hoopla are the 3 boys whose actions who, like a domino effect, sets up the entire story in action. The story begins and ends with them. Whenever they come on screen, complete entertainment guaranteed. These 3 might be the best find of this year.P.S Vinod and Nirav Shah are the cinematographers for this movie. I don't know who did which part but the shots in all the parallels are beautifully composed that you may want to watch the movie again just to appreciate the amount of work that has gone into cinematography. There are blurred shots (For example, there is this one shot where the camera focusses on a group of ants blurring what happens in the background when the everyone in Vijay Sethupathi's family is debating about his gender) , POV shots, Out of Focus shots all of them perfectly placed to give you the feeling that you are watching the stories unfold right next to you, that you are a silent spectator to all the craziness that is happening.Yuvan has once again proved that when it comes to BGM he is, THE BOSS. The music complements and in most scenes elevates the entire scene into a whole new level. Ilayaraja has once said the best background music is no background music - meaning the composer should know when to use BGM and when to be silent and let the dialogues take the center stage. It's no surprise that Yuvan has mastered that craft. In a dialogue-heavy movie like this and with masterclass dialogue writer like Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja, Yuvan has perfectly blended silence with his amazing BGM. The success of Yuvan's BGM is making you hum the hit Ilayaraja Number, ""Anthiyila Vaanam.."" after watching the movie.(You have to watch the movie to understand this). Like Karthik Subbburaj, Kumaraaja also uses many Ilayaraja songs to set the mood of a scene and it works charmingly.Back to where we started.Has Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja delivered? - Hell Yeah!!Will the audience understand the genius that is Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja? When the title card read, 'A Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja movie' there were whistles and claps (A feat only a handful director like Maniratnam, Karthik Subburaj has managed to achieve).Will 'Super Deluxe' succumb to the same fate of 'Aaranya Kaandam'? I don't think so. You ask me how? The applause and whistle at the beginning for Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja had turned into a standing ovation after a 3 hour long running movie when the title card read in the end - 'Written and Directed by Thiyagarajan Kumaraaja' (Again, a feat only handful directors like Maniratnam, Karthik Subburaj has managed to achieve).So, is 'Super Deluxe' a social movie that speaks about the struggle of transgenders? Is it a Drama that mocks the society and its so-called (double) standards? It has a cat and mouse game - Is it a thriller? Is this an Adult comedy? It has aliens in it - Is it a science fiction movie? Is the too much darkness in the movie makes it a neo-noir? Or is there even a genre that this movie can fit into? The beauty is that you cannot fit 'Super Deluxe' into one genre. It's beyond all that. All I know is 'Super Deluxe' is a rare masterpiece. A once in a lifetime experience. A movie that transcends all the boundaries of film making, a movie that makes that thrills you, excites you, makes you laugh, smile, cry, whistle, think and in the end sticks with you, forever.Super Deluxe, to me, is a drug. A drug that makes you an addict and cures you of the addiction, all at the same time.",super deluxe experience,even before trailer was released i was excited watch this movie when you watch movies like aaranya kaandam kind experience you get will only leave you crave more when you hear names like vijay sethupathi fahad fazil ramya krishnan etc your expectation grows multi fold finally when trailer was released it did perfect justice huge expectations but will thiyagarajan kumaraaja deliver will audience understand genius that is thiyagarajan kumaraaja or will super deluxe succumb same

after he finished shoot he told mohanlal i will never direct you again he never did reason im citing this here is that i dont think vijay sethupathi should ever act again he should retire after this

might have already seen vijay sethupathi as transgender poster trailer but nothing will prepare you what he has done movie i repeat nothing no one can depict beauty father son relationship most unimaginable situations like thiyagarajan kumaraaja does take aaranya kaandam instance one many parallels movie we get father son duo once rich father who lost all his money gambling let down his family son who is angry his father letting him down but will never give up his father fact his dialogue sums up entire movie when police ask unga appa na unaku avlo pidikuma da he replies apdi lam illa aana avaru enga appa super deluxe we get similar parallel transgender father who left his family son who never gives up his father no matter how much he is angry him so beautifully son sums up their relationship when he utters this dialogue while crying nee aambalaya iru pombalaya iru aana enga kooda iru boy who plays vijay sethupathis son has just nailed it fahad fazil plays poor husband poor not as financially poor but most unfortunate kind poor has wife who cheats him with his college boyfriend his own bed type poor i dont know who wrote fahad fazils character but bits pieces he speaks then there just like that have very deep meaning fahad fazil being brilliant actor he is has portrayed his character with so much conviction samantha plays modern day girl who always finds her torn between culture tradition desires love sex best thing about thiyagarajan kumaraaja is that he never judges even his characters he leaves it entirely us whether what samantha did was right or wrong well that depends what is right what is wrong only ramya krishnan can play role rajamatha sex worker so convincingly that we actually think these are two different actors such versatile actress center all this hoopla are 3 boys whose actions who like domino effect sets up entire story action story begins ends with them whenever they come screen complete entertainment guaranteed these 3 might

8,Super Deluxe - Thiagarajan Kumararaja all the way,"The movie belongs only to the Director - Thiagarajan KumararajaThis is his second movie. Earlier he had made a gangster movie (which I have not seen) but was well appreciated. (It had Hindi movie star Jackie Shroff doing his tamil debut as a mafia don)The movie is written and director by Thiagarajan Kumararaja He is in full control of every frame. Earlier he had worked as a song writer, dialogue writer, photographer, and worked under various directors in Tamil industry.This experience shows in every frame and dialogue he has written and the way he has built the mood and conceptualized the whole movie. The movie has 4-5 sub plots.The Director has used Bright colors - like painting - with contrast - light and dark - that range from pastels red, orange, blue, yellow.The movie sub-plots are querky and remind of something we have never ever watched in Indian cinema.Obviously - the movie is par with any international art movie house cinema.Plot 1 4 young boys want to watch a porn. They somehow get a porn CD from a shop run by a lady owner, and they find one of the mother of a boy as the porn star (beautiful Ramya Krishnan)Plot 2 The boy who reaches home to his mother Ramya Krshnan - accidentally gets injured in his stomach. This plot deals with how Ramya Krishnan struggles to take him to the hospital to get him cured.Plot 3 The remaining boys by mistake break the TV on which they were watching the porn movie. They want to get some money to buy a new TV. They contact a local don - and entangle into his greed and gang.Plot 4 A husband wife - Samatha and Fayad - are not having a great marriage life. In absence of Fayad - Samatha is having sex with her boy friend in their home. While having sex - the boy friend dies. At the same moment - Fayad comes to the home along with his parents and relatives. The plot shows how the angry husband Fayad helps his wife's lover dead body get disposed.Plot 5 While disposing the dead body - they encounter a police inspector who knowing the situation wants to have sex with Samatha - he hand-cuffs the husband Fayad to the jeep where the dead body of lover is kept and tries to rape Samatha - while capturing on the mobilePlot 6 While Ramya Krishnan is trying to find doctor and money to treat her injured son - her drunkard husband has belief in a quack and takes the body of his son to get cured from him.Plot 7 A child (along with his mother) - are waiting for their father to come after he has ran away. Father arrives (Vijay Setupathi) and he is a trans. The family and relatives find it difficult to accept a trans as a fatherPlot 8. The same police inspector catches hold of Vijay Setupathi and wants to have sex with him in the police custodyPlot 9 The child is lost and Vijay Setupathi is desperately searching for him, and goes back to the same police station - where he (as trans) is abused more********There are so many sexual overtones in the movie and obviously it is an adult movie. It is a bold movie and to get ""A"" stars in assemble in a cast - all the credit goes to the directorThe pace of the story and build up is slow - but once we are into three parallel tracks - one gets totally involved in the narrationThe style of presentation is the USP of the movie. The movie shows that Super Deluxe though caught the eyes because of Vijay Sethupathi playing a trans gender in the movie - it is all and all the show of Thiagarajan Kumararaja. He orchestrates each and every movie, dialogue, line and camera - and we can see his presence throughout the movie. It is like his signature mark throughout each frame of the movie.A very unique movie experience for the Indian audienceI would go with 7.5 out of 10 for the bold movie making - very creative and innovative plot and presentation.*********",super deluxe thiagarajan kumararaja all way,movie belongs only director thiagarajan kumararajathis is his second movie earlier he had made gangster movie which i have not seen but was well appreciated it had hindi movie star jackie shroff doing his tamil debut as mafia don movie is written director by thiagarajan kumararaja he is full control every frame earlier he had worked as song writer dialogue writer photographer worked under various directors tamil industry this experience shows every frame dialogue he has written way he has built mood conceptualized whole movie movie has 4 5 sub plots director has used bright colors like painting with contrast light dark that range pastels red orange blue yellow movie sub plots are querky remind something we have never ever watched indian cinema obviously movie is par with any international art movie house cinema plot 1 4 young boys want watch porn they somehow get porn cd shop run by lady owner they find one mother boy as porn star beautiful ramya krishnan plot 2 boy who reaches home his mother ramya krshnan accidentally gets injured his stomach this plot deals with how ramya krishnan struggles take him hospital get him cured plot 3 remaining boys by mistake break tv which they were watching porn movie they want get some money buy new tv they contact local don entangle into his greed gang plot 4 husband wife samatha fayad are not having great marriage life absence fayad samatha is having sex with her boy friend their home while having sex boy friend dies at same moment fayad comes home along with his parents relatives plot shows how angry husband fayad helps his wifes lover dead body get disposed plot 5 while disposing dead body they encounter police inspector who knowing situation wants have sex with samatha he hand cuffs husband fayad jeep where dead body lover is kept tries rape samatha while capturing mobileplot 6 while ramya krishnan is trying find doctor money treat her injured son her drunkard husband has belief quack takes body his son get cured him plot 7 child along with his mother are waiting their father come after he has ran away father arrives vijay setupathi he is trans family relatives find it difficult accept trans as fatherplot 8 same police inspector catches hold vijay setupathi wants have sex with him police custodyplot 9 child is lost vijay setupathi is desperately searching him goes back same police station where he as trans is abused more there are so many sexual overtones movie obviously it is adult movie it is bold movie get stars assemble cast all credit goes directorthe pace story build up is slow but once we are into three parallel tracks one gets totally involved narrationthe style presentation is usp movie movie shows that super deluxe though caught eyes because vijay sethupathi playing trans gender movie it is all all show thiagarajan kumararaja he orchestrates each every movie dialogue line camera we can see his presence throughout movie it is like his signature mark throughout each frame movie very unique movie experience indian audiencei would go with 7 5 out 10 bold movie making very creative innovative plot presentation,0.48195187165775405,0.1400920974450386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,SUPER DELUXE REVIEW,"A couple try to dispose a dead body; a little boy gets a surprise when he meets his estranged father; a son discovers his mother's other side; a religious man starts having doubts over his God... What connects these four stories? Super Deluxe gives us four stories and the protagonists in each of these stories are tested in their beliefs in the strangest ways. For the married couple Vembu (Samantha) and Mukil (Fahadh Faasil), the situation in which they get into is a test of their marital relationship. It is a test of her love for her son for Shilpa (Vijay Sethupathi), a transgender who has come back to her family. For Arputham (Mysskin), who has survived the tsunami and found a new God, and Leela (Ramya Krishnan), a former porn star who is desperately trying to save her injured son, Soori, it is a test of their belief in God and humanity respectively. And there are also three lads who face a literal test of bravery.Giving out anything more about the plot of Super Deluxe will ruin the fun and joy of experiencing something singularly unique. There is a heartless and horny cop, a quirky don, a publicity crazy politician, a greedy doctor, unwanted neighbours, a loyal Man Friday, and more in this crazy world that Thiagarajan Kumararaja has come up with. The performances are first-rate all around. Vijay Sethupathi's Shilpa is a new high for the actor, while Fahadh and Samantha are instantly likeable. Mysskin and Ramya Krishnan are solid while the gang of boys are great finds. Then, there is Ashwath, who wins our hearts, and a cast-against-type Bhagavathi Perumal, who makes us want to murder him. There is black comedy, double entendres, swear words, WTF moments, political and social commentary, romance, sentiment and even a musing on what it means to be life on Earth. There is ambition, genius, and also a beating heart.",super deluxe review,couple try dispose dead body little boy gets surprise when he meets his estranged father son discovers his mothers other side religious man starts having doubts over his god what connects these four stories super deluxe gives us four stories protagonists each these stories are tested their beliefs strangest ways married couple vembu samantha mukil fahadh faasil situation which they get into is test their marital relationship it is test her love her son shilpa vijay sethupathi transgender who has come back her family arputham mysskin who has survived tsunami found new god leela ramya krishnan former porn star who is desperately trying save her injured son soori it is test their belief god humanity respectively there are also three lads who face literal test bravery giving out anything more about plot super deluxe will ruin fun joy experiencing something singularly unique there is heartless horny cop quirky don publicity crazy politician greedy doctor unwanted neighbours loyal man friday more this crazy world that thiagarajan kumararaja has come up with performances are first rate all around vijay sethupathis shilpa is new high actor while fahadh samantha are instantly likeable mysskin ramya krishnan are solid while gang boys are great finds then there is ashwath who wins our hearts cast against type bhagavathi perumal who makes us want murder him there is black comedy double entendres swear words wtf moments political social commentary romance sentiment even musing what it means be life earth there is ambition genius also beating heart,0.5080901116427432,0.13671650717703349,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
7,Don't go by the 10 star ratings or the 1 star ones.,"It is a good movie overall, but don't go expecting it to blow your mind based on the perfect ratings given or YouTube reviews intensely hailing this film. I did and was a little disappointed as I saw nothing in this film worthy of such high praise. The film is quite long, not because it has too much substance, but because many a scenes are dragged too much.The first half of it is actually pretty good. The introduction to each of these storyline's are fun and beautifully shot. The first half is quite funny and I was actually enjoying it a lot. But in the second half, it became quite predictable and also some of the characters were pretty annoying like the cop for instance. There are so many scenes in the second half that were hard to get through. Long and over drawn out, I found myself hoping this would end soon. These scenes could've easily been cut out and the film would be even better. But I don't understand the director's need to keep these long and boring and painful scenes which spoilt the charm of this movie.The only exceptional performance in the entire film was that of Vijay Sethupathi's. That story was extremely beautiful and the chemistry between the little kid, what a pure soul and his father was just so heartwarming and pure. The kid nailed his role, he looked so cute and was also very funny. His acceptance of his father despite of his appearance just shows how beautiful and innocent children are, so unassuming and full of love. Watch this film just for that. Absolutely spectacular. Also the way Vijay Sethupathi portrayed the role of Shilpa was brilliant. His voice and his acting was nothing short of extraordinary. I'm in awe of his performance!",dont go by 10 star ratings or 1 star ones,it is good movie overall but dont go expecting it blow your mind based perfect ratings given or youtube reviews intensely hailing this film i did was little disappointed as i saw nothing this film worthy such high praise film is quite long not because it has too much substance but because many scenes are dragged too much first half it is actually pretty good introduction each these storylines are fun beautifully shot first half is quite funny i was actually enjoying it lot but second half it became quite predictable also some characters were pretty annoying like cop instance there are so many scenes second half that were hard get through long over drawn out i found myself hoping this would end soon these scenes couldve easily been cut out film would be even better but i dont understand directors need keep these long boring painful scenes which spoilt charm this movie only exceptional performance entire film was that vijay sethupathis that story was extremely beautiful chemistry between little kid what pure soul his father was just so heartwarming pure kid nailed his role he looked so cute was also very funny his acceptance his father despite his appearance just shows how beautiful innocent children are so unassuming full love watch this film just that absolutely spectacular also way vijay sethupathi portrayed role shilpa was brilliant his voice his acting was nothing short extraordinary im awe his performance,0.6067878787878785,0.18176190476190474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.27}"

7,Bit too experimental,"#SuperDeluxe As a guy who likes experimental movie as much as the next person, this one is a weird movie! To be fair something's in the plot was totally unnecessary and could have been avoided for a little bit more realistic approach. Sorry to go way ahead, this is a good experiment but may be a little bit too experimental to patiently sit and watch at theatre! So super deluxe is a movie that happens mostly on a day with some stories and events barely intertwined together. There are mainly three stories happening together and how it is resolved forms the crux of the story. The movie shines due to tremendous and good perfomances of its cast. And the movie is clearly very dark with almost all characters having a grey shade. First half of the movie was so good that i didn't feel it was a long half, but second half just shift into a weird turn! I still couldn't get over some of the things they adapted story wise, it may be something writer have to come up with to make a story ends well but really could have been something else and more realistic to make the movie works even better. Believe me you'll understand what I'm saying after watching the movie. It is difficult to speak more about it without spoilers!. As usual great performance from Vijay Sethupathi. Fahadh was good. And i really liked women in this movie. They were never apologetic about the decisions they made with their life, they know what they needed at the moment and go for it! It's great to see that on any movies. There are many things and philosophies portrayed throughout the movie which can only be discussed with spoilers. So it is a movie worth of discussions. And in the end it may not be everyone's cup of tea, and may find 3 hour runtime bit of a stretch! But even though i felt a bit lengthy during second half, it is something worth watching once. May be if you're not sure watch it after DVD release but by all means go for it if you love seeing a weird crazy dark movie!",bit too experimental,as guy who likes experimental movie as much as next person this one is weird movie be fair somethings plot was totally unnecessary could have been avoided little bit more realistic approach sorry go way ahead this is good experiment but may be little bit too experimental patiently sit watch at theatre so super deluxe is movie that happens mostly day with some stories events barely intertwined together there are mainly three stories happening together how it is resolved forms crux story movie shines due tremendous good perfomances its cast movie is clearly very dark with almost all characters having grey shade first half movie was so good that i didnt feel it was long half but second half just shift into weird turn i still couldnt get over some things they adapted story wise it may be something writer have come up with make story ends well but really could have been something else more realistic make movie works even better believe me youll understand what im saying after watching movie it is difficult speak more about it without spoilers as usual great performance vijay sethupathi fahadh was good i really liked women this movie they were never apologetic about decisions they made with their life they know what they needed at moment go it its great see that any movies there are many things philosophies portrayed throughout movie which can only be discussed with spoilers so it is movie worth discussions end it may not be everyones cup tea may find 3 hour runtime bit stretch but even though i felt bit lengthy during second half it is something worth watching once may be if youre not sure watch it after dvd release but by all means go it if you love seeing weird crazy dark movie,0.520380658436214,0.13805555555555563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
