8.0,Underrated gem,"This film is fantastic! An Indianised ""comedy of errors"", it nicely highlights the similarities between Indian humour and that of Shakespeare. The comic potential of ""twin twins"" may seem to have been fully exploited,but this film transported the idea to India superbly well. The scene with the bhang was a gem. I am not sure why this film receives so little praise, or even acknowledgement, but if you are looking for a first-class Indian comic film, it is very hard to go past ""Angoor"". Considering the drek that passes for comedy in Hindi film today, thanks to David Dhawan and others like him, Angoor may be hard to find, but it's worth the effort, and I now want to find more films featuring this talented cast.",underrated gem,this film is fantastic indianised comedy errors it nicely highlights similarities between indian humour that shakespeare comic potential twin twins may seem have been fully exploited but this film transported idea india superbly well scene with bhang was gem i am not sure why this film receives so little praise or even acknowledgement but if you are looking first class indian comic film it is very hard go past angoor considering drek that passes comedy hindi film today thanks david dhawan others like him angoor may be hard find but its worth effort i now want find more films featuring this talented cast,0.6136284722222223,0.19322916666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,"Extremely Nice, A must watch!!!!!","Perfectly casted into a fabulous movie, perfect in comedy and fun. Inspired by William Shakespeare's The Comedy Of Errors, this movie displays a general confusion regarding two characters (each in a double role), having same name. This movie illustrates the beauty of acting and superb performance by every character. This movie is worth watching to everyone. Acting performance is natural and really really funny. This movie is one of the best movie (comedy) that I have ever watched in my life. I rate this movie 9/10, as it is perfect and natural. There are no villains, no fight scenes in the movie, yet it is very effective and influencing. The movie makes us laugh at the very start of the movie, and makes us laugh till the end. This movie is directed by Gulzar, who is, in my view, one of the best directors in Indian Cinema. Songs are not bad, and the song ""Pritam aan milo"" makes movie superb and Worth to watch.",extremely nice must watch,perfectly casted into fabulous movie perfect comedy fun inspired by william shakespeares comedy errors this movie displays general confusion regarding two characters each double role having same name this movie illustrates beauty acting superb performance by every character this movie is worth watching everyone acting performance is natural really really funny this movie is one best movie comedy that i have ever watched my life i rate this movie 9 10 as it is perfect natural there are no villains no fight scenes movie yet it is very effective influencing movie makes us laugh at very start movie makes us laugh till end this movie is directed by gulzar who is my view one best directors indian cinema songs are not bad song pritam aan milo makes movie superb worth watch,0.5036666666666667,0.4532,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,Ample Grapes Of Humour,"Gulzar's hilarious adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Comedy of Errors' offers ample laugh out loud moment. Gulzar's poetic writing is loaded with humour and he gives this superb adaptation its own unique touch. He successfully avoids the usually melodrama (that flooded in most Bollywood films) and I liked that he doesn't waste too much time in needlessly elaborating the story. For example, the separation of the twins and how they were raised is told in a simple dialogue (which is adequate). Very quickly, after introducing the charming characters, Gulzar quickly moves to the double trouble confusion and he does it with wit, sarcasm and loads of comedy.It's also well-made on the technical side. The cinematography is very good and the way the images of the actors are juxtaposed (to show the twins in one scene) is well conducted. There are a few songs but they are well utilized and the lyrics are magic (thanks to a great poet's touch).Sanjeev Kumar and Deven Verma are turn on their comic flair to the maximum. Their abilities in comedy are very well known and this is a prototype in their careers. A lovely Moushumi Chatterjee, cute and vivacious Deepti Naval and funny Aruna Irani lend excellent comedic support.Not only does 'Angoor' prove that Gulzar can tackle comedy with class but also that he is one of the most versatile directors today.

9.0,Wow...Shakespeared CAN be fun!,"""Angoor"" is an Indian film based on one of Shakespeare's more obscure plays--""A Comedy of Errors"". It is so obscure that there are very few versions of the story in film, so if you are curious about it, see this film. However, you might see some similarities to a couple films which may or may not have been influenced by Shakespeare--""Big Business"" and ""Start the Revolution Without Me"". All are about two pairs of twins who have been separated since childhood and have no idea the other exists.The film begins with some rich Indian parents doting over their twin boys. A very short time later, the husband learns that another set of twins have been abandoned nearby and brings them home to be servants to his two boys as they grow. I know this is pretty strange but bear with it. Now what happens next is pretty clear in the play but in the film it is not--there's just some crappy stock footage and the story doesn't really explain it well. But what you soon realize happened is that there was a shipwreck and the boys got separated--one twin from each set got raised by one of the parents. That's because they thought the others were dead when the boat sank--but Dad raised two and Mom, separately raised the other two. Although totally bizarre, both sets of mismatched also use the same names--so there are two Ashoks and Badahars being raised in different parts of India.Many years pass. One set of mismatched twins is traveling to a city where they've never traveled. BUT, people seem to recognize them! Ashok #1 thinks that perhaps there is some sort of scam going on by some gang and he becomes quite paranoid. When Ashok #1 goes out for the day, he leaves his brother, Badahar #1 back at the hotel to guard their money from these 'thieves'. But, in the market, Ashok #1 sees Badahar #2 and slaps him--how dare he NOT stay at the hotel and watch the money!! Now if this sounds goofy, it gets REALLY goofy when Ashok #2's sister-in-law sees Ashok #1 and Badahar #2 and INSISTS they come home! The men have no idea who this woman is and they only go with her because a cop (who knows Ashok #2) threatens to arrest him if he doesn't go home with the sister-in-law!! And, when they arrive, BOTH learn they have wives--though in reality both #1s are bachelors!! Things are crazy--and it only gets worse! The original Shakespeare title was perfect for this film--it's a wonderful comedy of errors. While it's not the deepest story (and this could be why Shakespeare buffs haven't embraced it like his more famous plays), it is MUCH more approachable and enjoyable than his other work. As for me, I'd MUCH rather see this than ""Romeo and Juliet"" or ""Hamlet""! But even if you don't agree, you have to really enjoy ""Angoor"" if you see it--whether you are a Shakespeare fan or not. Very funny, clever and fun! And, now one of my favorite Indian films.By the way, although it in no way harms enjoyment of the film, the DVD copy I saw of ""Angoor"" was very badly scratched and in need of conservation.",wow shakespeared can be fun,angoor is indian film based one shakespeares more obscure plays comedy errors it is so obscure that there are very few versions story film so if you are curious about it see this film however you might see some similarities couple films which may or may not have been influenced by shakespeare big business start revolution without me all are about two pairs twins who have been separated since childhood have no idea other exists film begins with some rich indian parents doting over their twin boys very short time later husband learns that another set twins have been abandoned nearby brings them home be servants his two boys as they grow i know this is pretty strange but bear with it now what happens next is pretty clear play but film it is not theres just some crappy stock footage story doesnt really explain it well but what you soon realize happened is that there was shipwreck boys got separated one twin each set got raised by one parents thats because they thought others were dead when boat sank but dad raised two mom separately raised other two although totally bizarre both sets mismatched also use same names so there are two ashoks badahars being raised different parts india many years pass one set mismatched twins is traveling city where theyve never traveled but people seem recognize them ashok thinks that perhaps there is some sort scam going by some gang he becomes quite paranoid when ashok goes out day he leaves his brother badahar back at hotel guard their money these thieves but market ashok sees badahar slaps him how dare he not stay at hotel watch money now if this sounds goofy it gets really goofy when ashok sister law sees ashok badahar insists they come home men have no idea who this woman is they only go with her because cop who knows ashok threatens arrest him if he doesnt go home with sister law when they arrive both learn they have wives though reality both are bachelors things are crazy it only gets worse original shakespeare title was perfect this film its wonderful comedy errors while its not deepest story this could be why shakespeare buffs havent embraced it like his more famous plays it is much more approachable enjoyable than his other work as me id much rather see this than romeo juliet or hamlet but even if you dont agree you have really enjoy angoor if you see it whether you are shakespeare fan or not very funny clever fun now one my favorite indian films by way although it no way harms enjoyment film dvd copy i saw angoor was very badly scratched need conservation,0.5638347578347579,0.1527891737891738,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"

9.0,One of Bollywood's finest comedies,"Bollywood comedies are normally associated with slapstick and nonsense especially in recent times, but there were times when such comedies were made which make us laugh even today. Gulzar who teamed with Sanjeev Kumar earlier in AANDHI(1975), MAUSAM(1975) and several films teamed with him back in one of the best comedies. The film is based on Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors and is a laugh riot, even Shakespeare is given a big homage. The film is one of the most confusing film about mistaken identities. Something done to death recently by Priyadarshan and DD but none can achieve what Gulzar achieved. The film makes you fall down laughing but never looking OTT.The film starts off with the twins getting separated in a tragic incident and then the comedy starts off, the characters are all well written, though some things are not explained like what job the other 2 Sanjeev and Deven do, it's not too clear, also whatever happened to the 1 lakh in the end? But lets forget such stuff as the film promises comedy but doesn't insult your intelligence.Direction by Gulzar is topnotch Music by RD Burman is okay in minimal doses, only 1 song makes it to the film Roz Roz Daali Daali by his wife Asha Bhosle and it's superb Editing is superb, with a few glitches when the double roles meet which is pardonable for its a 1982 film, The length of 2 hours is superbSanjeev Kumar proves yet again why he is one of the best actors Bollywood had, His every gesture, his every voice intonation, every scene will leave you laughing hard, the best part is he never tries too hard, he gives both roles a distinct identity Deven Verma makes a perfect combo with him and he is simply fabulous, this is one of his finest works, for which he got the best comedian award Moushami Chattergee is fantastic in her role, Deepti Naval is good too while Aruna Irani is fab Amongst rest Utpal Dutt and Shammi are good in their brief roles C.S.Dubey is fab, the others are fab too",one bollywoods finest comedies,bollywood comedies are normally associated with slapstick nonsense especially recent times but there were times when such comedies were made which make us laugh even today gulzar who teamed with sanjeev kumar earlier aandhi 1975 mausam 1975 several films teamed with him back one best comedies film is based shakespeares comedy errors is laugh riot even shakespeare is given big homage film is one most confusing film about mistaken identities something done death recently by priyadarshan dd but none can achieve what gulzar achieved film makes you fall down laughing but never looking ott film starts off with twins getting separated tragic incident then comedy starts off characters are all well written though some things are not explained like what job other 2 sanjeev deven do its not too clear also whatever happened 1 lakh end but lets forget such stuff as film promises comedy but doesnt insult your intelligence direction by gulzar is topnotch music by rd burman is okay minimal doses only 1 song makes it film roz roz daali daali by his wife asha bhosle its superb editing is superb with few glitches when double roles meet which is pardonable its 1982 film length 2 hours is superbsanjeev kumar proves yet again why he is one best actors bollywood had his every gesture his every voice intonation every scene will leave you laughing hard best part is he never tries too hard he gives both roles distinct identity deven verma makes perfect combo with him he is simply fabulous this is one his finest works which he got best comedian award moushami chattergee is fantastic her role deepti naval is good too while aruna irani is fab amongst rest utpal dutt shammi are good their brief roles c s dubey is fab others are fab too,0.4490740740740742,0.24323361823361817,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.26}"

6.0,Comedy of Errors.....,"""Angoor"" was one of the directorial ventures of Gulzar, the great poet, lyricist, and a story teller; and most of his successful films have been based on foreign stories like Parichay, Mere Apne, and Koshish. In this film, he Indianizes the Shakespeare tale ""Comedy of Errors."" In this entirely comic film we have a master and a maid who both have their identical twins. When the both sets of master and maid gets mixed up in the same town, situations of confusions arise resulting some of the rib tickling moments. And the comedy gets carried out perfectly by the duo of Sanjeev Kumar and Deven Verma. The film is commendable for its sincere effort to stick to the main theme and emerges as a perfect comedy film which Indian film makers rarely dare to make.

7.0,Bollywood again borrows Shakespeare's 'Comedy Of Errors' to make a Genuine Comedy Flick..,"Angoor (1982) : Brief Review -Bollywood again borrows Shakespeare's 'Comedy Of Errors' to make a Genuine Comedy Flick. Angoor is an adoption of Legends Shakespeare's 'Comedy Of Errors' which was already remade in Bollywood with 'Do Dooni Chaar' (1968) so the narrative remains same but the different actors, different director and different attitude makes it a Fine and Nice Comedy that can be watched anytime by anyone. Twin brothers theme is nothing new for Bollywood comedies but here, there're two pairs of Twin brothers which create more chaos and more mess. The fiasco is funny and the situations genuinely look realistic to believe that this isn't fully fictional world. What works the most is the screenplay, it brings together all the character under one roof but on different situations and the links between misunderstanding are fantastically written. Sanjeev Kumar and Deven Verma creates hysterical punches in their double roles because typically one fella is a naive and the other one is kind of con. Mausami Chaterjee did exceptionally well, i loved how she changed her expressions quickly from sadness to fake and then real happiness. Dipti Naval, Aruna Irani and rest of the cast have less to do yet add decency. Gulzar could have made it more hysterically and non stop junction of comedy but he kept the comedy geniune and it is likeable for sure. It is just that Bollywood had gone ahead with Classic Comedies like 'Chupke Chupke', 'Gol Maal', 'Chashmebaddoor' just before Gulzar decided to remake this Comedy of errors 'Do Dooni Chaar' so the standard of Classic is not achieved. It was just a matter of time. The same film in 60s would have been more special. Otherwise, it is a timeless comic flick and brings genuine laughters without the use of any intentional humour, slapstick comedy and forceful laughters.
