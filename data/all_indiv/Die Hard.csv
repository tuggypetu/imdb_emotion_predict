10.0,Not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best movies of the action genre,"Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",not only best die hard franchise but one best movies action genre,even if non action parts are tad slow comparison that is more than compensated by so many things that makes die hard so brilliant one thing action is explosive consistently exciting cinematography is astounding being very inventive colourful john mctiernon hunt red october last action hero directs briskly efficiently pacing vast majority time is exhilarating then there is terrific score by michael kamen some intelligent witty scripting plot that doesnt feel forced or convoluted not mention some excellent acting as good as bruce willis is yes his character is somewhat two dimensional but he is also resourceful world weary willis handles this really well it is alan rickman who steals acting honours as hans gruber gruber is cold calculating suave menacing my opinion only rickman could do justice such character overall superb movie not only best die hard franchise but one best action genre 10 10 bethany cox,0.5558943089430896,0.2530487804878049,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,The greatest bad-ass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie of all time,"Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today.",greatest bad ass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie all time,die hard 1988 first action film is by far one greatest

10.0,It can't be bettered,"This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick.",it cant be bettered,this original action classic has been hugely influential over years its no surprise as its one best action thrillers ever made new meaning is brought word action as here it is exhilarating furious nothing less than exciting premise is simple one location one good guy twelve bad guys cue lots explosions fist fights blood violence plenty shooting too thrills come suspense willis using his wits as well as his brawn fight bad guys save hostages when watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is this hasnt been filmed with some cheap cameras quick buck it looks professional couldnt be less polished photography is clear brings out best surroundings while music has obviously been carefully chosen convey right mood strangely enough action film acting is actually very good unheard as remember this was back days where schwarzenegger stallone were top stars action genre bruce willis excels as wisecracking sardonic cop you cant fail like him hes consistently witty provides powerful presence when needed it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image next six or seven years supporting cast arent half bad either reliable bonnie bedelia takes break her usual highbrow moral dilemma television movie fare as willis tough wife while reginald veljohnson is also great as sympathetic cop you just want hug him but most memorable all is alan rickman his excellent turn as cool calculating terrorist with carefully crafted german accent fine line natty suits rickman is bad guy modern cinema watch any subsequent action film with terrorists youll see people trying be him hes that good rest cast terrorists have all been picked their imposing looks theyre not bad either keep your eyes peeled fearsome bond baddie robert davi minor role as fbi man as well as tense running around corridors stand offs between willis various creeps this film really delivers action stakes guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest kill each other we get people flying down stairs getting chains wrapped around their necks getting shot all over place every kill that willis makes is original exciting there are also plenty ace stunts like when willis jumps off exploding roof with only fire hose tied around his waist gore level is high graphic fact with people being shot apart wherever you look its definitely film all cinema fans enjoy consistently entertaining strong enough withstand repeated viewings this is first final word one guy versus lots bad guys sub genre action flick,0.4778911435786436,0.14674125180375175,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,Was there Action Films before Die Hard?? Who cares!! Die Hard is the patriarch of modern action.,"Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10",was there action films before die hard who cares die hard is patriarch modern action,course action genre existed before die hard after all you had terminator commando top gun roadhouse but didnt die hard absolutely revolutionize eighties action genre it came like savior encompassed everything that would blow you right out back theater made bruce willis absolute idol action world good reason die hard had pointless nudity scores bad language bloody death guns explosions gritty tough as nails sweating dirty hero that takes everyone with nothing more than hand gun his brains if you watch willis die hard its thing beauty his shirt torn off bare foot wounds all over him he looks like he just crawled war rather than stalking terrorists through enormous high rise office building l script was so dead it was basic it was point it has great sarcastic humor one liners that could never be forgotten willis was man pull it all together add decent supporting cast guy ground who is like his partner macgyver style killing bad guys that will go down history this is die hard bruce willis was brought up right prime his tv series moonlighting where his irresistible charm personality made him hit john mclean was david addison but with lot more guts lot more ammo that only made film more exciting fans willis already willis has way just making everything edge your seat everything believable who else could make you smile fear when hes diving out 30 story window attached fire hose while roof building is exploding he really doesnt single handedly make film supporting cast is terrific bonnie bedelia is great as mcleans straight laced professional estranged wife they make odd yet touching couple they have some electricity its ironic yet sensible that they dont end up together throughout series still bedelia is great female lead her character is strong not at all misused role alan rickman is just one kick ass bad guy can you say anything else as terrorist hans gruber he is terrifying evil brilliant you just despise him you cant wait see him go up against willis he does he doesnt stand chance but rickman is still brilliant as bad guy reginald veljohnson plays small yet very important role as willis guy ground other end walkie talkie they dont know each other barely know each others name but yet they become as close as partners they too are odd together yet fit william atherton has be mentioned even though its very small role its die hard history that he plays slimy tabloid reporter richard thornburg who gets his just end by holly mcleans fist which becomes running joke series die hard is everything that people would look at disgust now new millennium yet it was everything eighties stood when it came action heroes mclean has cigarette dangling his mouth blood pouring everywhere happy ending despite all destruction around them if you havent seen die hard you cant ever proclaim yourself action fan because die hard is action its film every action film strives live will never meet whether it was before 1988 or after we wont ever get something like this again its absolute 100 classic all wrong reasons 10 10,0.5157652941373871,0.04021259102654452,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"""Yipee-ki-yay M.....F.....!""","Totally outrageous, totally unbelievable and totally over the top - and as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) would say - 'But who cares'? It's Bruce Willis in a version of saving humanity along the lines of John Wayne, Rambo and Marshal Dillon. Personally, John McClane had me when he said he was partial to Roy Rogers because that's who my favorite TV and movie cowboy was as a kid growing up. I'd bet that someone might say that of Willis some day.In his own way, John McClane must have had some sort of mystical power because up until the point he started crawling through the transom feeling like a TV dinner, his wife-beater t-shirt was white with some blood spatter. But when he hit the floor again to do battle with the bad guys it suddenly turned brown. So mesmerized was I by this turn of events that I never even noticed when the shirt turned a neat dark forest green later in the picture. I wonder how stuff like that gets by the director? Say, and how about the FBI sending in a double Johnson to take over the attack at Nakatomi Plaza? I'm sure there's a pretty good punch line in there somewhere but I think I'll just let it go for now.It's been stated, and rightly so I think, that this film set a new standard for action/adventure flicks with Bruce Willis portraying a new kind of hero. He's smart, thinks on his feet, takes what help he can get, and engages in wise-ass banter to keep the audience fully engaged. All the noise, explosions and crashing glass is merely window dressing to keep the story moving as our hero saves the day. What more can you ask for in a two hour action flick? You know, if this was a Roy Rogers Western it would probably have a title like ""Under California Stars"".

,Wham Bam Action Classic,"Die Hard (1988) *** (out of 4)Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan.

8.0,Actually a good Christmas movie.,"I've got to admit, I only really watched this movie because of the (many, many) references in Brooklyn 99. And I got thinking, is Die Hard really that good? So, I gave it a watch, guided by the many, many Jake Peralta jokes that I had grown accustomed to. And I've got to say, this is the action movie that paved the way for all future action movies.I usually have an aversion to Christmas movies as they all tend to turn into cheesy rom-coms but this was pretty awesome. And I think the reason for that is because that even though it was Christmassy where it mattered, the plot didn't completely revolve around it.I've got to admit, most of it was guns and explosions and there was very little plot to go off of besides a pretty traditional three-act structure, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. And you know it's a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.There was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I'm actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it's nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.So, Jake of B99 was right. I mean, it's badass, Bruce Willis has the best one-liners, you have cool explosions. There's not too much more I could say about this movie. Yippie kayak, other buckets.-Sasha.",actually good christmas movie,ive got admit i only really watched this movie because many many references brooklyn 99 i got thinking is die hard really that good so i gave it watch guided by many many jake peralta jokes that i had grown accustomed ive got say this is action movie that paved way all future action movies i usually have aversion christmas movies as they all tend turn into cheesy rom coms but this was pretty awesome i think reason that is because that even though it was christmassy where it mattered plot didnt completely revolve around it ive got admit most it was guns explosions there was very little plot go off besides pretty traditional three act structure but it was still pretty damn entertaining you know its good movie when about 90 it was guns blood explosions other 10 was bruce willis saying badass things crawling through vents ever disintegrating tank top you stilled enjoyed it there was never still moment this movie but unlike most times where i just end up getting bored cgi fest explosions i was actually pretty captivated through entire runtime im actually really pleasantly surprised ending is predictable but its nice not all movies have be intellectual masterpieces sometimes you just need switch your brain little watch bruce willis kick ass so jake b99 was right i mean its badass bruce willis has best one liners you have cool explosions theres not too much more i could say about this movie yippie kayak other buckets sasha,0.5898809523809523,0.2255883167220376,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10.0,"You'll ""Die Hard"" with this action-lover's action movie","One could claim that 1988's ""Die Hard"" is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an ""x"" number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.By the time that ""Die Hard"" was released, the action movies were most often dominated by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Chuck Norris. Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's ""Moonlighting"" and 1987's ""Blind Date,"" which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero ""John McClane"" - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this. But that's the beauty of his performance in this movie: he's an everyday guy, caught in a not-so-everyday situation.On Christmas, McClane's estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him from New York all the way out to Los Angeles to spend the holidays with the family. But it requires him to make a stop at the Nakatomi offices, which is having an after-hours Christmas party. Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.At Nakatomi, things of course get off to a rough start for McClane, as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery. However, those problems are about to take a backseat to the real ""party"" - twelve terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (all-purpose bad guy Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) - seize control of the building and proceed to rob the Nakatomi building of its assets, most of which include negotiable bonds and other valuables. But they didn't count on the ""fly in the ointment"" (pain in the a**) to make things hell for these so-called party crashers.Certainly one of the best known action movies ever, ""Die Hard"" did receive the scorn of critics upon its 1988 summer release, but the audiences sung a completely different tune.The film was most often praised for the production, with the brand-new Fox Plaza office tower serving as the fictional Nakatomi building. It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller ""Predator,"" which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie, I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.Personally, I think ""Die Hard"" is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Like Indiana Jones in that film, ""Die Hard"" had an Everyman cast in the role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.10/10",youll die hard with this action lovers action movie,one could claim that 1988s die hard is one most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one most copied but never matched at least terms quality formulas loner by some unique twist fate battles it out with x number terrorists enclosed environment by time that die hard was released action movies were most often dominated by likes arnold schwarzenegger sylvester stallone chuck norris star bruce willis whose only notable credits at time were televisions moonlighting 1987s blind date which was released year before was unlikeliest them all willis was wild card unlikely choice role our hero john mcclane since he didnt have any action credits his resume lets face it bruce willis just didnt have bulging biceps required role like this but thats beauty his performance this movie hes everyday guy caught not so everyday situation christmas mcclanes estranged wife holly bonnie bedelia invites him new york all way out los angeles spend holidays with family but it requires him make stop at nakatomi offices which is having after hours christmas party riding first time limo hes introduced suave driver argyle devoreaux white who gives him some pretty useful advice trying win over wife at nakatomi things course get off rough start mcclane as he gets into argument with wife is left wallow his misery however those problems are about take backseat real party twelve terrorists led by hans gruber all purpose bad guy alan rickman perfectly cast seize control building proceed rob nakatomi building its assets most which include negotiable bonds other valuables but they didnt count fly ointment pain make things hell these so called party crashers certainly one best known action movies ever die hard did receive scorn critics upon its 1988 summer release but audiences sung completely different tune film was most often praised production with brand new fox plaza office tower serving as fictional nakatomi building it was also praised energetic skillful direction john mctiernan whose most notable credit was action sci fi thriller predator which was released year before starred arnold schwarzenegger bruce willis was perfect actor this performance since he brings wit vulnerability role like this one if stallone or schwarzenegger were this movie im sure effect would have been lot different personally i think die hard is one greatest action movies ever up there close my favorite action movie all time raiders lost ark like indiana jones that film die hard had everyman cast role mcclane like indiana jones wasnt larger than life musclebound grotesque he was real guy that you cared about who got hurt had real feelings thats why i think both these movies have sort stood test time as becoming what they are best known today action classics theyre here stay ladies gentlemen 10 10,0.47557261962023895,0.17439703153988861,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,The ultimate thrill-ride – and still the standard by which I judge an action movie,"Seeing 'Die Hard' for the first time as a teenager was a one-of-a-kind experience. This level of raw, ""edge-of-your-seat"" action was unknown to me prior to this film; it made my head spin and the intensity of it was nearly unbearable. When it was over, I could only think of one word: Wow!For a long time - at least in western cinema - the only ""true"" action movies (by that I mean films that were all about the action and you went to see them because of the action) were the 'James Bond' movies. They had the most unreal stunts and crazy, over the top action sequences that you could imagine at the time, and they were (and still are) great fun. However, they usually lacked three vital ingredients:1. A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)Well, it took John McTiernan to bring those three key elements together in 'Die Hard' - and thus the modern action film was born (it had a good run through the late eighties until the end of the nineties – then the studios figured out they could maximise the box-office by taming down the swearing, violence and sex and thus, alas, the contemporary, toothless PG-13 action film was born). Sure, there have been a couple of others before McTiernan's masterpiece ('First Blood', 'Terminator', 'Predator' - which was also by McTiernan - or 'Lethal Weapon' and probably some more), but those films could have fallen into any number of other categories as well ('Adventure-/Survival-/War-', 'Sci- Fi', 'Horror-' or 'Buddy-movie') – and I can't think of another film that was just such a relentless, pure-action-from-the-beginning-to-the-end film as was 'Die Hard'. To me, it's the ultimate thrill ride. The formula has since been repeated so many times, but the original still sets the standard by which I judge an action film.

9.0,"Gosh, Bruce Willis really could act, couldn't he?..","... and there was a big question mark there in 1988 because up until that time Willis had been only the thorn in Maddie Hayes' side in the TV show that unleashed him on the world, ""Moonlighting"", and tabloid headline fuel with all of his after hours exploits. John Goodman later said that he was just as drunk and disorderly as Willis was, but pre Roseanne nobody knew who the heck he was, so he was given a pass. But I digress.On Christmas Eve NYPD cop John McClane(Bruce Willis) is in LA to visit his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) at her place of business as a company Christmas party is in progress. She wanted to chase a big career and a big promotion on the west coast with a Japanese company, and John wanted to stay in New York as a cop. That is about the extent of their disagreement, but it put 2000 miles between them. But while they are talking a bunch of terrorists break in. They are actually just thieves, but they are using a terrorism angle as a front for the theft. They don't count on one thing though - McClane. They don't see him so he slips away and spends the evening thwarting their plans. The bad guys spend their evening trying to kill McClane. Why don't they use his wife as leverage? They don't know Bedelia's character is his wife.At one point McClane triggers a fire alarm and a lone cop, Powell, is sent to investigate. That lone cop talks to McClane through a radio and tells McClane he shot a kid once on the job, and he doesn't think he is capable of using his gun even if he must. The radio-bound comradery between the two is very good, in between all of the action.This is very likely one of the very best action films ever made. It has non-stop thrills, human interest, great acting by Willis which I think surprised everybody, and lampoons the media by showing them as lapdogs that eat up the contrived terrorist drivel they are fed by the thieves/kidnappers. And Alan Rickman gives a delicious performance as the head terrorist that is only surpassed by his role in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves three years later.Try it, as most big hits that were first in a franchise, it is much better than any of its sequels primarily because nobody was expecting it to be such a megahit, thus it is somewhat humble in its presentation. And that always helps.",gosh bruce willis really could act couldnt he,there was big question mark there 1988 because up until that time willis had been only thorn maddie hayes side tv show that unleashed him world moonlighting tabloid headline fuel with all his after hours exploits john goodman later said that he was just as drunk disorderly as willis was but pre roseanne nobody knew who heck he was so he was given pass but i digress christmas eve nypd cop john mcclane bruce willis is la visit his estranged wife bonnie bedelia at her place business as company christmas party is progress she wanted chase big career big promotion west coast with japanese company john wanted stay new york as cop that is about extent their disagreement but it put 2000 miles between them but while they are talking bunch terrorists break they are actually just thieves but they are using terrorism angle as front theft they dont count one thing though mcclane they dont see him so he slips away spends evening thwarting their plans bad guys spend their evening trying kill mcclane why dont they use his wife as leverage they dont know bedelias character is his wife at one point mcclane triggers fire alarm lone cop powell is sent investigate that lone cop talks mcclane through radio tells mcclane he shot kid once job he doesnt think he is capable using his gun even if he must radio bound comradery between two is very good between all action this is very likely one very best action films ever made it has non stop thrills human interest great acting by willis which i think surprised everybody lampoons media by showing them as lapdogs that eat up contrived terrorist drivel they are fed by thieves kidnappers alan rickman gives delicious performance as head terrorist that is only surpassed by his role robin hood prince thieves three years later try it as most big hits that were first franchise it is much better than any its sequels primarily because nobody was expecting it be such megahit thus it is somewhat humble its presentation that always helps,0.43201704545454545,0.13426136363636362,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,The Perfect Modern Action Film,"""Die Hard"" is the prototype type for the modern action film. Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing. ""Die Hard"" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since ""Die Hard"" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of ""Die Hard"" . . . or, for that matter, is better than ""Die Hard"". ""Die Hard"" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.  Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim. The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over. There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out. (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, ""Die Hard"" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written. McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action. A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, ""Die Hard"" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all. With ""Die Hard"", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism. The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant. (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.) There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber. The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route. Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero. He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand. Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains. As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good. Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual ""damsel in distress"" mold. It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero. The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.""Die Hard"" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly. There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.

8.0,The ultimate action film.,"Die Hard tells the story of a New York City detective named John McClane who is separated from his wife. She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out. Once there, a group of German terrorists come in and take hostages with the intent of stealing millions of dollars in bonds. McClane manages to escape and begins to fight the terrorists one by one to save the people in the building.Die Hard is a classic film because it completely revolutionized action films. The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it's so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it's a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There's really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.The acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well.

,"Great action, well directed, tense and slick action thriller with enjoyable performances and intelligent social subtext (spoilers)","I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980's and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a ""normal"" guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar ""man's man"" type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (""ladies & gentlemen""); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between ""man's man"" and ""new man""  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a ""quick-draw"" style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid ""buddy""; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years.",great action well directed tense slick action thriller with enjoyable performances intelligent social subtext spoilers,i first saw die hard late 1980s have owned it various formats down years will watch it now again one main reasons i enjoy it so is because iconic place it holds within action genre at time it came out we were mostly served up pumped up action heroes who happily take entire armies win battles that are mostly simple matter good versus evil where good is us evil is them whoever them happened be at that time die hard manages be more than that by starting out with normal guy as our hero now i wont pretend that mcclane is not action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible i particularly like fact that his first reaction is run call help form others that he only faces terrorists when he has rather than going all rambo us if this approach provides grounding concept also brings action into slightly more real environment action is more or less confined tower bad guys limited rather than being constantly flowing army stuntmen director mctiernan uses location really well injecting tension sense claustrophobia that works really well action is enjoyable offers lesson that modern cgi heavy action movies can learn if you rely totally technology then youll date quickly if you make effects serve action narrative then youll be standing years as result action die hard feels no less slick or exciting being almost twenty years old although this is most important part film get right i always appreciated clever subtexts narrative filmed 1980s film is clever attack yuppie values contrast with blue collar mans man type this way narrative can be viewed as those seeking more more wealth getting way those who just want be with their families most obvious attack business culture is aligning terrorists corporation hans takagi share taste suits education knowledge even share same opening lines ladies gentlemen it is not stretch see film suggesting that takagi may have also shared some hans ruthlessness his rise top this is also evident very start john does not lose his wife hans he has already lost her corporation as she drops his name had moved away indeed such is films paralleling these two threats mcclane that he only rescues holly hans by getting watch off her wrist watch that was specifically mentioned at start film as gift company ellis sees connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself hans apart gun fountain pen aspect course with both businessmen being connected terrorists this way they must also share their fate do although it has lumbered film series with rather poor catchphrase discussion westerns again confirms contrast between mans man new man connection further made by having mcclane his vest outfit more befitting blue collar worker who has his values usa frontier rather than cut throat world foreign business this distain bureaucracy is also seen redemption al stuck outside action building handicapped by incompetence but also desk bound due shooting kid at end movie he is redeemed by killing karl quick draw style shoot out freeing him his desk restoring his manhood again split between bureaucracy real workers again use wild west symbolism cast respond strong script direction by turning roundly good performances willis has not really been better even same character his action twist his moonlighting character was making him it is rickman that dominates film though like robin hood he is delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines great presence support cast is good below them with bedelia avoiding being just damsel distress veljohnson solid buddy godunov is real physical threat even if few other terrorists barely make impression memory gleason atherton white davi all give good show as well rightly iconic action movie then action has stood up really well is delivered within story that is tense well paced performances suit material if you want it there is clever engaging subtext running across whole film i find it hard fault you can see why it has had influence it has had action genre over last twenty years,0.4192346855653309,0.1499268316808639,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,Still regarded as the quintessential action movie twenty five years on,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs Christmas Eve looms in Los Angeles, New York detective John McClaine (Bruce Willis) arrives to meet his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedilia) at the Nakatomi Plaza. All is going smoothly enough, until a group of terrorists lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building and take everyone inside hostage-all except McClaine, who takes the terrorists on at their own game, in a deadly duel to the death.The 80's was the decade where the last of the great big ideas were brewing, where the studios thought big and delivered bigger, where concepts became franchises and true artistic integrity became a distinct after thought. That's not to say most of the ideas weren't truly inspired, and didn't have the potential to become big investments. Trouble is, the last year in that decade is now very nearly twenty five years ago, leaving the time period itself very much as a thing of the ages. But it is now twenty five years since Die Hard burst on to the scene, and to it's credit, is still hailed by many after all that time as the definitive action film which set the standard by which all others are measured and of which countless imitations have been made. If nothing else, watching it again will wash the memory of that Godawful new film released earlier this year out your mind and remind you of the joyful, exhilarating spectacle that inspired the series in the first place.Bruce Willis made his name with this role, making it all his own and putting his stamp all over it as the cynical, gnarly detective who proves a one man battle machine for the villains he's engaged with. The massive appeal here is almost certainly his presence as an every-man the average, predominantly male action fan could probably relate to, having been force-fed the impossible image through-out the 80's of the muscle bound, mumbling killing machine they could never live up to. McClaine is totally believable as a resourceful but bewildered man of the law thrown in to a situation he wasn't expecting, while Rickman as his adversary is restrained, jovial but also utterly cold and ruthless, determined to see his plan through to the end. Between them, they are a brilliantly twisted double act.Some ideas are so good, and are executed so faultlessly, they deserve to become profitable institutions, spinning off with other versions and sequels, being imitated many times and still holding a special place in everyone's heart twenty five years on. Die Hard is full of explosive, exciting action, is brilliantly written, with great characters, fine dialogue and even finer set pieces. And all that aside, it's just great fun. It's success really speaks for itself. *****",still regarded as quintessential action movie twenty five years,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morningas christmas eve looms los angeles new york detective john mcclaine bruce willis arrives meet his estranged wife holly bonnie bedilia at nakatomi plaza all is going smoothly enough until group terrorists lead by hans gruber alan rickman seize control building take everyone inside hostage all except mcclaine who takes terrorists at their own game deadly duel death 80s was decade where last great big ideas were brewing where studios thought big delivered bigger where concepts became franchises true artistic integrity became distinct after thought thats not say most ideas werent truly inspired didnt have potential become big investments trouble is last year that decade is now very nearly twenty five years ago leaving time period itself very much as thing ages but it is now twenty five years since die hard burst scene its credit is still hailed by many after all that time as definitive action film which set standard by which all others are measured which countless imitations have been made if nothing else watching it again will wash memory that godawful new film released earlier this year out your mind remind you joyful exhilarating spectacle that inspired series first place bruce willis made his name with this role making it all his own putting his stamp all over it as cynical gnarly detective who proves one man battle machine villains hes engaged with massive appeal here is almost certainly his presence as every man average predominantly male action fan could probably relate having been force fed impossible image through out 80s muscle bound mumbling killing machine they could never live up mcclaine is totally believable as resourceful but bewildered man law thrown situation he wasnt expecting while rickman as his adversary is restrained jovial but also utterly cold ruthless determined see his plan through end between them they are brilliantly twisted double act some ideas are so good are executed so faultlessly they deserve become profitable institutions spinning off with other versions sequels being imitated many times still holding special place everyones heart twenty five years die hard is full explosive exciting action is brilliantly written with great characters fine dialogue even finer set pieces all that aside its just great fun its success really speaks itself,0.5049507750314203,0.1522737746124843,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,"""Die Hard""- Quite simply the greatest action-adventure film ever made.","It's almost unfathomable that in just one year's time, the original entry in the ""Die Hard"" saga will be thirty years old. And yet, even then, it will still remain in its position as indisputably the greatest action-adventure ever committed to the screen. In every way remarkable, entertaining and breathlessly exhilarating, it is the quintessential gold-standard when it comes to action. A masterpiece of filmmaking, ""Die Hard"" took the world by storm in 1988 and even with inconsistent quality in sequels, it still enthralls and entertains thanks to sharp writing, perfect casting, exquisite performances and top-notch direction. It's hard to imagine that anything will ever top it.Bruce Willis stars as Detective John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and children. Arriving at a massive Christmas Party at Holly's workplace in Nakatomi Plaza, things start to seem like they might be looking up for John... until a group of terrorists, lead by the vile Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building, hoping to get their hands on over half a billion dollars in bearer bonds that are locked away in the vault. Escaping the threat and discovering that the police will be completely unable to help, John realizes he must work alone, eluding capture and taking out terrorists one by one if he is to save the day...Directed by John McTiernan from a script by Jeb Stuart and Steve E. de Souza, the film as just exquisitely assembled. McTiernan's keen eye for visuals and perfect sense of pacing and composition allow the tension and excitement to build with virtually every second as the story progresses and the stakes rise. But he also knows when to pull back and give the characters breathing room to develop and just talk with one another, without rushing through it or over-relying on broad archetypes as many more modern filmmakers do. Absolutely amazing direction. The screenplay (inspired loosely by the Roderick Thorp novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"") is exceptionally well put- together. de Souza and Stuart craft an instantly identifiable and highly likable cast of characters- including villains you very much love to hate- that all get their proper moment to shine and all feel well-defined and developed. The structure of the film is also very sound, and they strike a perfect balance between story and action in a way few other films have.We are treated to one of the finest casts to ever populate a tale of adventure in the film. Much has already been said about Bruce Willis and his iconic turn in the role of McClane, but it is still not enough. Bruce Willis just might be the ideal action hero. He's tough, but not unstoppable. Smart, but not a genius. And sharp- witted, but with a certain sense of vulnerability. In many ways, he's the sort-of person anyone and everyone can identify with, and that's what makes McClane such an incredible hero. Alan Rickman- in his first starring role- absolutely steals the show as the villainous Hans, a presence who will charm you, even while you root for him to go down. Rickman is a talent that was taken too soon after his tragic passing last year, and it's roles like this that prove just how great a loss it was. Supporting roles by the likes of Bedelia and William Atherton are exceptional for the material. And Reginald VelJohnson is just magical as Sgt. Al Powell, a cop who offers support to McClane over the radio throughout the film's runtime.Beyond the cast, the direction and the writing is just simply a phenomenal overall production. Cinematographer Jan de Bont, who would later go on to become a director in his own right, paints a beautiful cinematic image, with outstanding work done, particularly in the lighting and color. Composer Michael Kamen's score is just a blast of pure fun. With a sort-of old-fashioned scope yet a modern flair, the music constantly and consistently compliments the images on-screen perfectly, and it's such a relief that his themes were used in each subsequent film. And editors Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link expertly manipulate the footage so that every shot... every emotion... everything is in service to the story and characters. Now THIS is how you film and cut an action film!In the end, ""Die Hard"" may soon be turning thirty years old, but it remains as exciting, engaging and enthralling as ever. Upon initial release, it became the perfect example of an adventure done right, and blew audiences away. And it continues to do that now. I honestly have my doubts that anything will ever be able to beat it in terms of quality in storytelling and execution of action. It simple is the best action movie ever made. And for that, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.",die hard quite simply greatest action adventure film ever made,its almost unfathomable that just one years time original entry die hard saga will be thirty years old yet even then it will still remain its position as indisputably greatest action adventure ever committed screen every way remarkable entertaining breathlessly exhilarating it is quintessential gold standard when it comes action masterpiece filmmaking die hard took world by storm 1988 even with inconsistent quality sequels it still enthralls entertains thanks sharp writing perfect casting exquisite performances top notch direction its hard imagine that anything will ever top it bruce willis stars as detective john mcclane new york cop who flies out los angeles spend christmas with his estranged wife holly bonnie bedelia children arriving at massive christmas party at hollys workplace nakatomi plaza things start seem like they might be looking up john until group terrorists lead by vile hans gruber alan rickman seize control building hoping get their hands over half billion dollars bearer bonds that are locked away vault escaping threat discovering that police will be completely unable help john realizes he must work alone eluding capture taking out terrorists one by one if he is save day directed by john mctiernan script by jeb stuart steve e de souza film as just exquisitely assembled mctiernans keen eye visuals perfect sense pacing composition allow tension excitement build with virtually every second as story progresses stakes rise but he also knows when pull back give characters breathing room develop just talk with one another without rushing through it or over relying broad archetypes as many more modern filmmakers do absolutely amazing direction screenplay inspired loosely by roderick thorp novel nothing lasts forever is exceptionally well put together de souza stuart craft instantly identifiable highly likable cast characters including villains you very much love hate that all get their proper moment shine all feel well defined developed structure film is also very sound they strike perfect balance between story action way few other films have we are treated one finest casts ever populate tale adventure film much has already been said about bruce willis his iconic turn role mcclane but it is still not enough bruce willis just might be ideal action hero hes tough but not unstoppable smart but not genius sharp witted but with certain sense vulnerability many ways hes sort person anyone everyone can identify with thats what makes mcclane such incredible hero alan rickman his first starring role absolutely steals show as villainous hans presence who will charm you even while you root him go down rickman is talent that was taken too soon after his tragic passing last year its roles like this that prove just how great loss it was supporting roles by likes bedelia william atherton are exceptional material reginald veljohnson is just magical as sgt al powell cop who offers support mcclane over radio throughout films runtime beyond cast direction writing is just simply phenomenal overall production cinematographer jan de bont who would later go become director his own right paints beautiful cinematic image with outstanding work done particularly lighting color composer michael kamens score is just blast pure fun with sort old fashioned scope yet modern flair music constantly consistently compliments images screen perfectly its such relief that his themes were used each subsequent film editors frank j urioste john f link expertly manipulate footage so that every shot every emotion everything is service story characters now this is how you film cut action film end die hard may soon be turning thirty years old but it remains as exciting engaging enthralling as ever upon initial release it became perfect example adventure done right blew audiences away it continues do that now i honestly have my doubts that anything will ever be able beat it terms quality storytelling execution action it simple is best action movie ever made that it easily earns perfect 10 out 10,0.5145884534855124,0.2717658349275997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Definitely a classic action movie...,"The 1988 was the movie that definitely put Bruce Willis on the radar for me, as this movie turned out to be such a blast of an action movie back in 1988. In fact, it is a movie that still holds up in 2020; where I just revisited it yet again.""Die Hard"" is very much a late 1980s action movie with everything that term carries. And ""Die Hard"" placed Bruce Willis right up there alongside the likes of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Seagal and Van Damme back in the late 1980s.The storyline told in ""Die Hard"" is an enjoyable and entertaining storyline, one that actually has enough contents and material to it to support several viewings over the years. And while one does know the story after having seen the movie, there is just something solid about it to make it possible to watch it again and again.Now, they cast some nice performers for ""Die Hard"". Needless to mention Bruce Willis in this movie, but Alan Rickman in the role of Hans Gruber was just so well-cast because he performed so well and that role was just tailored for him and his charismatic presence. I remember being rather impressed with seeing Reginald VelJohnson (playing Al Powell) in this movie back in 1988, as I had only seen him on that TV series ""Family Matters"".Some people claim that ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie. I beg to differ. Just because the story was set to take place during the Christmas holidays doesn't make it a Christmas movie, nor does ""Die Hard"" have the contents to be a Christmas movie in any way. So nay, I am not one of those claiming that ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas classic.If you haven't already seen ""Die Hard"", then there is something wrong, because this is one of the defining action movies of the late 1980s. So if you haven't already seen this classic action movie, then you should most definitely take the time to do so.My rating of ""Die Hard"" settles on a well-deserved 8 out of 10 stars.",definitely classic action movie,1988 was movie that definitely put bruce willis radar me as this movie turned out be such blast action movie back 1988 fact it is movie that still holds up 2020 where i just revisited it yet again die hard is very much late 1980s action movie with everything that term carries die hard placed bruce willis right up there alongside likes stallone schwarzenegger seagal van damme back late 1980s storyline told die hard is enjoyable entertaining storyline one that actually has enough contents material it support several viewings over years while one does know story after having seen movie there is just something solid about it make it possible watch it again again now they cast some nice performers die hard needless mention bruce willis this movie but alan rickman role hans gruber was just so well cast because he performed so well that role was just tailored him his charismatic presence i remember being rather impressed with seeing reginald veljohnson playing al powell this movie back 1988 as i had only seen him that tv series family matters some people claim that die hard is christmas movie i beg differ just because story was set take place during christmas holidays doesnt make it christmas movie nor does die hard have contents be christmas movie any way so nay i am not one those claiming that die hard is christmas classic if you havent already seen die hard then there is something wrong because this is one defining action movies late 1980s so if you havent already seen this classic action movie then you should most definitely take time do so my rating die hard settles well deserved 8 out 10 stars,0.46611498257839723,0.008797909407665496,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.22, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,The Most Influential Action Film of the 1980's!,"Is Die Hard a Christmas movie? That is the age-old debate that surrounds this action-thriller. Without a doubt, you bet it is. Not only is the setting during Christmas, but the holiday music incorporated throughout is enough to win the debate. Terrorists can still do their thing during Christmas, you know. Satisfied? Great, let's talk about how this is one of the greatest action films of all time and revolutionized the genre to make it better, more evolved. The combined forces of director John McTiernan (Predator) and stars Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman created an unforgettable experience. Excellent, relatable performances, great stunt work, and a pleasing mix of comedy/action delivers the goods for this classic.As the 80's came to a close, action films were waning. The formula for these films involved macho men (usually someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger) and nonsensical villains with outlandish schemes. The formula was becoming stale, and change was needed. Enter the idea about an everyman forced into extreme circumstances where this type of action is necessary. Likewise, enter the idea of a villain who is smart, cunning, and has legitimate means. A more personable villain. Of course, these ideas would be played to death in the future (and subsequent sequels), but better than the alternative. Yes, Bruce Willis plays a hero. But a hero who can get banged up (the iconic bloody tank top), can show emotion if needed (not a macho personality), and uses humor as a way to combat nervousness (great one-liners, though!).The idea for this actioner came only the year before when screenwriter Jeb Stuart came across the idea to adapt Roderick Thorp's novel to the big screen. He kept the book's ""Christmas in LA"" setting and added relationship drama to the fold. He also scaled down the setting as it mainly took place at one office building, the fictional Nakatomi Plaza. The plaza was actually set in a vacant Fox Plaza which was under construction at the time. After the success of Predator, John McTiernan came on board to direct. They had a difficult time casting the film as seemingly any big name turned down the role...but Bruce Willis and his everyman persona was cast. For a man with hardly any movie credit and known for his comedic television series Moonlighting, it was an odd choice at first. As the film neared its release date, faith in Willis was very low and was kept away from marketing. It became known he was difficult to work with. In the end, it didn't matter because Willis became a star, and the action genre was seemingly revived.John McClane (Bruce Willis) is an NYPD cop and his wife, Holly Gennaro (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him to the Christmas party at her new job, Nakatomi Corporation located in Los Angeles. We learn that their marriage is strained. During the party, a group of German thieves led by the vastly intelligent Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of the building and take everyone hostage...all except one John McClane. With little or no help from the local police (except for Sgt. Al Powell played exceptionally from Reginald VelJohnson) and no escape, McClane must take matters into his own hands.The performances were really good. I believed Willis as the ordinary human being facing extraordinary situations outside his control. He is not the strongest nor the fastest action hero, but instead is a more humane, relatable hero. His one-liner delivery is superb throughout. That said, Alan Rickman has the honor of having the best villainous performance since Darth Vader. He was a man with a plan. Being Rickman's first role in the film industry, he knocked it out of the park. At least deserved an Oscar nomination. Regardless, he ushered in a new era of action movie villains with at least some sense of intelligence. The supporting cast was also really good, even if they do not have much to work with. Willis built a strong rapport with Reginald VelJohnson, whose character was battling his own demons. And Paul Gleason! Critics such as Roger Ebert knocked his performance as the ""dumb cop."" Be that as it may, it was still pretty entertaining to watch him shoot down McClane's actions in the high-rise.Overall, Die Hard is about as close to perfect as an action movie you can get. Even those subsequent action films repeated what happens here (you know the taglines, Die Hard but on a bus, etc), it still feels fresh here. That is because we get committed performances from everyone with Willis and Rickman standing out. Willis even offered to do his own stunts. The action is really great, and every sequence mattered. Some images will stay with you forever thanks to Jan De Bont's handiwork. With many of these action sequences film on one enclosed location (another thing this film influenced), he did a great job with the camera. The scene where Hans Gruber falls off the tower proves that. One more thing! I love how composer Michael Kamen incorporated ""Ode to Joy"" in the soundtrack.

10.0,The Best Christmas Movie Ever Made,"Die Hard is not simply one of the best action films ever made, but one that is easily able to stand the test of time, and do so in style. Die Hard shines brilliantly with some clever set pieces, action sequences, fun dialogue, and some great performances. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are obviously the greatest standouts in this 80's classic. It's surprising to say that audiences at the time were not too thrilled with the idea of him as action hero, and against all odds, he delivered a more than well, not to mention iconic, performance that simply no one could ever come close to capturing the same charm. Alan Rickman at the time was practically unknown, and with him as Hans Gruber, it's certainly a job well done into his life of stardom. Some other great performances include Bonnie Bedelia as Holly, Reginald VelJohnson as Al, and De'voreaux white as the limo driver Argyle. The film is also fantastically shot, surprisingly well written (for the most part), and wonderfully coordinated. In the end, Die Hard is not only a legitimate classic with more than enough reasons to justify it, but a timeless one as well.

,"Ladies and gentleman, Mr.Bruce Willis, Movie Star","DIE HARD (1988) **** Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov, Reginald Vel Johnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, Hart Bochner, Robert Davi. NYC cop John McClane (Willis in his star-making iconic role) is visiting LA at Christmas to reconnect with his estranged wife Bedelia who is at an office party that becomes a nightmare when a group of terrorists take over the building led by Hans Gruber (perfect Rickman) a German nutjob out to filch millions in bonds in the vault of the Japanese company. As the "" fly in the ointment"", Willis does his damnedest to stop him at all costs relying on his street-smarts and out-guessing as time ticks away. Great blend of action suspense and much welcomed humor.  Best bit: Willis plunging from a rooftop attack by the FBI (thinking the disheveled cop is one of the bad guys!) attached to a fire hose and shooting his way into an empty office! Hair-raising and exhilirating fun for all. ""Yippiee-Kay-Ay !!!!""
