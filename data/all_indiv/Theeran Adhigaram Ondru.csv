9,A fast paced action thriller,"I don't remember when I last saw a fast paced action thriller like this in Tamil. We are thoroughly absorbed in this movie that interval alone indicates that we are at the halfway mark. The only minus point in this movie is the romantic segment, which I personally feel as unnecessary for an action movie like this. So I reduce one star for that. The theme of this movie so unique and original. It's a ghost haunting from the past. The director had cleverly linked the past history to the present fiction. Even though Karthi is a super actor, super heroism, like flying in the air, hitting ten persons in one hit, etc. are minimal in this movie. This is an important plus point in this movie, because it makes you believe that you are actually watching a true story rather than a fiction. Acting by Karthi is excellent, doing his part perfectly without overdoing it. Many scenes in this movie, make you a participant in the ongoing action,than a mere spectator. A real gem among Tamil action movies.",fast paced action thriller,i dont remember when i last saw fast paced action thriller like this tamil we are thoroughly absorbed this movie that interval alone indicates that we are at halfway mark only minus point this movie is romantic segment which i personally feel as unnecessary action movie like this so i reduce one star that theme this movie so unique original its ghost haunting past director had cleverly linked past history present fiction even though karthi is super actor super heroism like flying air hitting ten persons one hit etc are minimal this movie this is important plus point this movie because it makes you believe that you are actually watching true story rather than fiction acting by karthi is excellent doing his part perfectly without overdoing it many scenes this movie make you participant ongoing action than mere spectator real gem among tamil action movies,0.47070707070707063,0.1404040404040404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,A movie with a exceptionally good story and super involving screenplay.,"Theeran Adhigaram ondru is destined to become one of the best cop movies ever to be made in Tamil film industry. A lot of effort has been put into writing the script and the screenplay that one can clearly see it's effect on the screen. All through the movie there was no plot holes or logical blunders which bothered me as there was nothing big enough to notice. For example, the mobile phones used by the characters were representative of the time period the movie is in. From the Nokia 1100 and Motorola Flip phones to Touch Screen smart phones, the mobile phones gradually changed in the hands of the characters.One of the main success of this movie as I see is the way in which they have established every character in the movie. Almost all the prominent characters have a back story and the director has done a great deal of research about the dacoits and criminal investigation techniques used by the crime solvers. The first part of the movie features some cold blooded murder cum robbery sequence, which are shot very realistically and the screenplay so involving that I felt like I witnessed everything first hand and they have not over done or exaggerated any action sequence in the movie, they all look very realistic. Unlike other cop stories where the protagonist will be able to miraculously able to solve crime almost like Sherlock Holmes with out explaining us how it is done, in this movie though there is a reference to Sherlock Holmes the whole investigation process is bound by the realism of this material world. The director did a great job in explaining the actions of the characters without boring us with lengthy voice overs.The movie could have been made without the female lead, Rakul Preet Singh. But, that doesn't mean that the character was a low point in the movie or that the character had no role to play in the movie. The character was there to establish the character of Theeran and show his temperament and reaffirm that he is no super human crime solving machine but a normal cop who does an exceptional job. The Back ground score is very engaging and really sets the tone for every scene. It was instrumental in carrying the emotions depicted on the screen to the audience. The placement of the songs too were reasonable. They came like a much needed breather in between the cold blooded action in the first half. Overall, Theeran Adhigaram Ondru is going to be a career best movie for Karthi as this has indeed over shone his performance in Paruthiveeran. This is a must watch movie if only you could stomach a little bit of gore and spine chilling violence (They did not over do it).

10,Theeran - Where the director takes you to the Horror world of notorious robbery gang,"H.Vinoth has given a cult movie !! PERIOD.The film is a horror-thriller roller coaster. The director gradually holds your hand and takes you to the ride and pushes from a dizzying height of horror and thriller to narrate his true story on notorious Bawaria robbery gang.As a person who have watched few of the top horror thriller genre movies , but this movie will send chills down your spine , mainly because it has the element of locality, something close happening in India.Director has taken lots of pain in detailing the movie and as far as i remember, there aren't much holes left , eve in the scene were the gang will stop the train , if you listen closely , the passengers will say "" this is the usual mischief done by the train traveler"" , so there the director has given us a reason that this thing is common , so the train after a short while starts to move. Or else we know it will take much longer time for the train to start after emergency stop is activated.Small things like these and also not deviating from the core and giving us the whole anatomy of this notorious gang right from their root has only strengthened the story and it makes the whole narration and the gang stick close to our heart. In most movie the enemy will be hyped till a certain point and after that his fate nose dives from there. But here the director has kept the hype - and it sticks too till almost three quarter of the movie , there my making us tremble each time we learn about the gang.Karti has done EXCELLENT EXCELLENT acting. He has played it aptly. I don't think anyone would have fit the role , may be Kamal ?Love sequence are the only downers in this movie. Overall i would say this is the BEST MOVIE in TAMIL FOR 2017 !! Movies like these elate the Tamil industry to new heights.Not for the faint hearted though..",theeran where director takes you horror world notorious robbery gang,h vinoth has given cult movie period film is horror thriller roller coaster director gradually holds your hand takes you ride pushes dizzying height horror thriller narrate his true story notorious bawaria robbery gang as person who have watched few top horror thriller genre movies but this movie will send chills down your spine mainly because it has element locality something close happening india director has taken lots pain detailing movie as far as i remember there arent much holes left eve scene were gang will stop train if you listen closely passengers will say this is usual mischief done by train traveler so there director has given us reason that this thing is common so train after short while starts move or else we know it will take much longer time train start after emergency stop is activated small things like these also not deviating core giving us whole anatomy this notorious gang right their root has only strengthened story it makes whole narration gang stick close our heart most movie enemy will be hyped till certain point after that his fate nose dives there but here director has kept hype it sticks too till almost three quarter movie there my making us tremble each time we learn about gang karti has done excellent excellent acting he has played it aptly i dont think anyone would have fit role may be kamal love sequence are only downers this movie overall i would say this is best movie tamil 2017 movies like these elate tamil industry new heights not faint hearted though,0.49613035113035125,0.2215824915824916,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10,Theeran Adhikaram Ondru Movie Review: Karthi Delivers a Power-packed Performance in This Gripping Cop Story,"In a seminal scene in Theeran-Adhikaram Ondru, DSP Theeran (Actor Karthi plays an upright police officer endowed equally with brains and rippling muscles) storms into a den of outlaws in the badlands of Rajasthan. He advises his team to stay inside the car as he walks on purposefully, the dusty hamlet is all eyes; it's the territory of Omah Singh, a much-feared highway dacoit responsible for a breakout of murders in rural Tamil Nadu. As the dust motes ripple upward in the desert air, Theeran slams one after the other until Singh sits up and takes notice, his hookah forgottenThe face-off defines the movie. Can a district police chief trace murders all the way to the North-West, surmount the crippling bureaucracy of multiple governments and bring to book a dacoit gang wreaking havoc on the crime numbers in TN? An emphatic Yes!H Vinoth, who deftly portrayed the lives and tricks of a gifted conman in Sathuranga Vettai is telling us a cop story this time. The usual clichés are in order: Theeran is transfer magnet, courtesy his sky- high morals and commitment to policing. His stay-at-home wife (Rakul Preet) is content with chiding him now and then about not being home most days. He chooses to go after the criminals when a dilemma presents itself after he gets to know his wife is dying. Even during training days, Theeran shows signs of precocity – he knows how to handle a crime-scene weapon (We are informed the usual handkerchief method of securing it will not protect the prints! Theeran holds it between two fingers at points where the criminal might not have touched the weapon).Neatly parted hair and a razor-sharp mush and almost-always wearing a dark shirt straining against his chest, Karthi looks every inch the ideal police officer. Assisted by a team of devoted cops, Theeran leads a national hunt for fingerprints that lead them into the history of Indian outlaws with origins in the British era. These huntsmen have no targets but gold, unless you leave out savagery. How Theeran bumps off each one of them form the crux of the story.Negatives include a bit of drag in the scenes describing the Rajasthani outlaws, or when the action sequences gets a little too long – Theeran beats the villain to pulp in searing Rajasthani heat before dragging him through the desert sands on a horse! Classic. A few songs are plugged here and there in the movie and they pass without causing inconvenience. The background scores for the Dakotas are particularly effective in accentuating their bestiality. Overall, music director Gibran is very good in many parts.The story itself rests on actual history. Dacoity at homes along the highways was a menace in Tamil Nadu during the late 90s. Apparently, Tamil Nadu had ranked high in taking it seriously and wiping such crimes off its map, although the policemen behind the job had gotten little credit.True to that, Theeran spends the twilight of his career behind a desk, complaining about a rickety chair not replaced for months. A young officer having known his deeds drops by just to salute him, and Theeran betrays that old glint of uprightness still bright in his eyes.After all these years? If you are Theeran, You would say ""Always.""",theeran adhikaram ondru movie review karthi delivers power packed performance this gripping cop story,seminal scene theeran adhikaram ondru dsp theeran actor karthi plays upright police officer endowed equally with brains rippling muscles storms into den outlaws badlands rajasthan he advises his team stay inside car as he walks purposefully dusty hamlet is all eyes its territory omah singh much feared highway dacoit responsible breakout murders rural tamil nadu as dust motes ripple upward desert air theeran slams one after other until singh sits up takes notice his hookah forgotten face off defines movie can district police chief trace murders all way north west surmount crippling bureaucracy multiple governments bring book dacoit gang wreaking havoc crime numbers tn emphatic yes h vinoth who deftly portrayed lives tricks gifted conman sathuranga vettai is telling us cop story this time usual clich s are order theeran is transfer magnet courtesy his sky high morals commitment policing his stay at home wife rakul preet is content with chiding him now then about not being home most days he chooses go after criminals when dilemma presents itself after he gets know his wife is dying even during training days theeran shows signs precocity he knows how handle crime scene weapon we are informed usual handkerchief method securing it will not protect prints theeran holds it between two fingers at points where criminal might not have touched weapon neatly parted hair razor sharp mush almost always wearing dark shirt straining against his chest karthi looks every inch ideal police officer assisted by team devoted cops theeran leads national hunt fingerprints that lead them into history indian outlaws with origins british era these huntsmen have no targets but gold unless you leave out savagery how theeran bumps off each one them form crux story negatives include bit drag scenes describing rajasthani outlaws or when action sequences gets little too long theeran beats villain pulp searing rajasthani heat before dragging him through desert sands horse classic few songs are plugged here there movie they pass without causing inconvenience background scores dakotas are particularly effective accentuating their bestiality overall music director gibran is very good many parts story itself rests actual history dacoity at homes along highways was menace tamil nadu during late 90s apparently tamil nadu had ranked high taking it seriously wiping such crimes off its map although policemen behind job had gotten little credit true that theeran spends twilight his career behind desk complaining about rickety chair not replaced months young officer having known his deeds drops by just salute him theeran betrays that old glint uprightness still bright his eyes after all these years if you are theeran you would say always,0.45807539682539666,0.08186507936507936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8,Theeram Adhigaaram Ondru is one of the most intense cop-dramas of Indian Cinema but love track is irritating.,"Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru (2017): Most of the Indian Cop films treat the lead role as a super-hero and has all the extra sensory abilities to find the antagonist without any proper investigation.But Theeram Adhigaaram Ondru is a rare realistic cop thriller where the villain's whereabouts are found only during the climax by one of the most interesting investigations I had seen in Indian Cinema.Plot: Theeran (Karthi), a police officer, tries to decode a series of cold blood events based on same pattern. Who's behind those ruthless events? How Theeran and team traces them? Did they succeed? forms the story of this crime action thriller. The story is based on true incidents handled by Police department in 1990s.My Review: ""Khakee"" deals with the subject of organised bandits and also reveals the history of dacoit gangs in India from the British era to the recent times.Director H Vinoth has done huge research on several tribes of dacoit gangs, their crimes, how they indulge in robbery, how they hide, and their lifestyle.Not only has he done deep research, but has shown all these in the movie, making it more interesting as we involve more into the investigation.These kind of cop dramas will work only if they have nail-biting scenes and this movie succeeded in providing us such intense experience.The film has full on edge of the seat moments which will keep you hooked till the end.The interval bang and bus chasing sequence in the second half literally gives you goosebumps.Even the scene where Karthi and his team are attacked by the whole village and the pre-climax scene where villain gang attack hero and his team in an abandoned village are shot exceptionally well.The major drawback with the film is the torturous love track between Karthi and Rakul.The typical ""Loose Ponnu"" obsession of Kollywood had went overboard here as we get irritated by Rakul's characterization.The first 30 or 40 mins of the movie is just about their clichéd love story which tests our patience.Director has done a very good job with the film. His detailing with the case is awesome and the way he narrated the film with ample action elements and racy chasing episodes make this film click big time. He keeps the film quite realistic which makes things even more interesting for the audience.Dhilip Subburayan's action scenes especially in the desserts of Rajasthan are superbly choreographed and Sathyan Sooryan's camera work is in sync with the story including the grey tone. Ghibran's music and background score creates the gritty feel.The film, despite its long run time, runs at a pace that makes it hard for one to look away.Karthi is stupendous in his role as the protagonist cop who will not rest until he nabs the criminals and brings the killings to a halt.He has shown his mettle in the gruelling episodes shot in Rajasthan desert in the second half of the movie.All his team members have played their roles perfectly.Rakul is irritating.So,Theeram Adhigaaram Ondru is one of the most intense cop-dramas of Indian Cinema but love track is irritating.My Rating 7.5/10",theeram adhigaaram ondru is one most intense cop dramas indian cinema but love track is irritating,theeran adhigaaram ondru 2017 most indian cop films treat lead role as super hero has all extra sensory abilities find antagonist without any proper investigation but theeram adhigaaram ondru is rare realistic cop thriller where villains whereabouts are found only during climax by one most interesting investigations i had seen indian cinema plot theeran karthi police officer tries decode series cold blood events based same pattern whos behind those ruthless events how theeran team traces them did they succeed forms story this crime action thriller story is based true incidents handled by police department 1990s my review khakee deals with subject organised bandits also reveals history dacoit gangs india british era recent times director h vinoth has done huge research several tribes dacoit gangs their crimes how they indulge robbery how they hide their lifestyle not only has he done deep research but has shown all these movie making it more interesting as we involve more into investigation these kind cop dramas will work only if they have nail biting scenes this movie succeeded providing us such intense experience film has full edge seat moments which will keep you hooked till end interval bang bus chasing sequence second half literally gives you goosebumps even scene where karthi his team are attacked by whole village pre climax scene where villain gang attack hero his team abandoned village are shot exceptionally well major drawback with film is torturous love track between karthi rakul typical loose ponnu obsession kollywood had went overboard here as we get irritated by rakuls characterization first 30 or 40 mins movie is just about their clich d love story which tests our patience director has done very good job with film his detailing with case is awesome way he narrated film with ample action elements racy chasing episodes make this film click big time he keeps film quite realistic which makes things even more interesting audience dhilip subburayans action scenes especially desserts rajasthan are superbly choreographed sathyan sooryans camera work is sync with story including grey tone ghibrans music background score creates gritty feel film despite its long run time runs at pace that makes it hard one look away karthi is stupendous his role as protagonist cop who will not rest until he nabs criminals brings killings halt he has shown his mettle gruelling episodes shot rajasthan desert second half movie all his team members have played their roles perfectly rakul is irritating so theeram adhigaaram ondru is one most intense cop dramas indian cinema but love track is irritating my rating 7 5 10,0.5352828054298644,0.1613320135746606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"

8,AN EXCELLENT WATCH !,"After a long time, A VERY SATISFYING action thriller. Director H. Vinoth (of Sathuranga Vettai fame) has presented a well made action movie which ticks almost all the right boxes of the genre with minimal compromises.The movie, which is based on true incidents, recounts an episode in the life of a tough cop from Tamil Nadu who sets out with his team to capture a dreaded gang of thugs that was involved in multiple gruesome, armed robberies and murders in Tamil Nadu as well as other states.Karthi fits the role of the daring cop and breathes life into the character in every frame. Abhimanyu Singh and his gang are utterly convincing as the brutally intense baddies.The pulsating score by Ghibran, cinematography by Sathyan Sooryan, nifty editing by Shivanandeeswaran and well executed action sequences choreographed by Dhilip Subbarayan elevate the impact of the proceedings.Director Vinoth deserves praise for his skillful combination of commercial elements with detailed research, stunning action set pieces and for shunning the regular trappings of super hero machismo and melodrama.While the movie has its fair share of blemishes including its run-time resulting in some drag and some logical pole vaulting, for the most parts, it remains a riveting watch.

6,A compelling cop-thriller that's well worth the sitting! [+62%],"'Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru' takes a while to get its cop act going. The initial hour is more in tune with what we usually see in the rom-com version of Tamil cinema these days: the hero stalks the heroine publicly while the heroine does so, in private (by drawing and collecting pictures of him). The involvement of family members in these scenes is so much that Vinoth almost makes us forget the cop- thriller side of the film altogether. Rakul Preet as Theeran's love-interest turned wife Priya, is cute as hell but gets annoying beyond a point.It's refreshing to see director Vinoth attempt to flesh out the antagonist gang (of dacoits) and bestow them with a thoroughly disconcerting vibe. Anyone witnessing the modus operandi of these vile men is bound to wince at least on a couple of occasions. In the first half though, their collusion is kept minimal, and the focus is more on building the titular character of Theeran (Karthi) and his rise to DSP status. The pre-interval stretch is one of the most well- choreographed action set-pieces seen in Tamil cinema recently. It invokes memories of 'Mad Max: Fury Road' (though just to the slightest extent).Another aspect that works in favor of TAO is the research effort that has gone into the screenplay. It vividly depicts the hassles involved in handling those cases where culprits are constantly moving between different states. The romantic track does slacken the pace a bit but Vinoth is wise enough not to let melodrama take over. The action sequences are a riot (be it pre-interval or post-interval) - sensationally choreographed and magnificently shot. Ghibran has done a wonderful job with respect to the background score, adding vigor to Theeran's punches and kicks. His song compositions though, lack that relisten value. The supporting characters too, do not disappoint. While the first hour is quite the cliché-fest (romance, police-training and the like - which we've seen a lot of lately), it still manages to keep the viewer engrossed owing to the lively performances. Abhimanyu Singh looks menacing as Oma, the leader of the dacoit-gang. Bose Venkat as Sathya puts up a convincing act. The film would've looked crisper had it not spent so much time intensifying the love-angle.Verdict: Worth a watch for the (otherwise) racy story-telling!",compelling cop thriller thats well worth sitting,theeran adhigaaram ondru takes while get its cop act going initial hour is more tune with what we usually see rom com version tamil cinema these days hero stalks heroine publicly while heroine does so private by drawing collecting pictures him involvement family members these scenes is so much that vinoth almost makes us forget cop thriller side film altogether rakul preet as theerans love interest turned wife priya is cute as hell but gets annoying beyond point its refreshing see director vinoth attempt flesh out antagonist gang dacoits bestow them with thoroughly disconcerting vibe anyone witnessing modus operandi these vile men is bound wince at least couple occasions first half though their collusion is kept minimal focus is more building titular character theeran karthi his rise dsp status pre interval stretch is one most well choreographed action set pieces seen tamil cinema recently it invokes memories mad max fury road though just slightest extent another aspect that works favor tao is research effort that has gone into screenplay it vividly depicts hassles involved handling those cases where culprits are constantly moving between different states romantic track does slacken pace bit but vinoth is wise enough not let melodrama take over action sequences are riot be it pre interval or post interval sensationally choreographed magnificently shot ghibran has done wonderful job with respect background score adding vigor theerans punches kicks his song compositions though lack that relisten value supporting characters too do not disappoint while first hour is quite clich fest romance police training like which weve seen lot lately it still manages keep viewer engrossed owing lively performances abhimanyu singh looks menacing as oma leader dacoit gang bose venkat as sathya puts up convincing act film wouldve looked crisper had it not spent so much time intensifying love angle verdict worth watch otherwise racy story telling,0.48313953488372097,0.14386892177589852,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"

7,The Father of all Cop-dramas made in the entire decade with solid branding of mass-mania.,"Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru (2017) : Brief Review -The Father of all Cop-dramas made in the entire decade with solid branding of mass-mania. Listing out the best cop films of 2010s decade which includes mass films like 'Singham' (2011), 'Thani Oruvan' (2015), and mystery like 'Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru' (2016), and yet Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru beats all of them because of extremely explosive nature and solid writing. Thani Oruvan still had mass elements but went wrong with couple of advanced techniques of storytelling while Dhuruvangal Pathiaaru, a murder mystery went on to leave one or two loopholes which are big threats to its genre. Theeran came out as a complete package of entertainment, romance, thrill, action, passion and very honest story which is not at all a regular thing for cop-dramas. Especially, when you consider action-packed films. Breaking all the barriers of limited and senseless content, Theeran rides high on human oriented content without using larger than life idiotisms. Theeran, a police officer, is entrusted with the task to solve the mystery behind a series of murders. The only clue left behind is that all the murders are committed in the same pattern. The film begins on a weak and light note where it sets love-story and basic characters of the film but once all is settled, it gears up and then never stops until it reaches its destination. Using realistical theories like bandits, dacoits and robbers from regional areas have given it a solid boost as far as sensibility is concerned and then additional momentum and passionate scenics provides big time entertainment. Overall, Theeran packs a great punch and dethrones all the regular cop-dramas but most importantly it doesn't lose the basics of prime filmmaking which is very rare in this genre. It deserves remakes in multiple languages.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",father all cop dramas made entire decade with solid branding mass mania,theeran adhigaaram ondru 2017 brief review father all cop dramas made entire decade with solid branding mass mania listing out best cop films 2010s decade which includes mass films like singham 2011 thani oruvan 2015 mystery like dhuruvangal pathinaaru 2016 yet theeran adhigaaram ondru beats all them because extremely explosive nature solid writing thani oruvan still had mass elements but went wrong with couple advanced techniques storytelling while dhuruvangal pathiaaru murder mystery went leave one or two loopholes which are big threats its genre theeran came out as complete package entertainment romance thrill action passion very honest story which is not at all regular thing cop dramas especially when you consider action packed films breaking all barriers limited senseless content theeran rides high human oriented content without using larger than life idiotisms theeran police officer is entrusted with task solve mystery behind series murders only clue left behind is that all murders are committed same pattern film begins weak light note where it sets love story basic characters film but once all is settled it gears up then never stops until it reaches its destination using realistical theories like bandits dacoits robbers regional areas have given it solid boost as far as sensibility is concerned then additional momentum passionate scenics provides big time entertainment overall theeran packs great punch dethrones all regular cop dramas but most importantly it doesnt lose basics prime filmmaking which is very rare this genre it deserves remakes multiple languages rating 7 5 10 by,0.455976503171625,0.09289198606271777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.49}"

7,Solid but compromised,"Theeran is a fictional character that has been inspired by real life Police officers. Karthi does an impressive job as the glorified hero Theeran and most of the film is carried by his character. Although at times the heroism is a bit too stretched that one may think that it would have been better if the sole focus of the narrative wasn't through the single character.""Theeran Adhigaram Ondru"" is a solid crime thriller which compromises a little for commercialization yet manages to be an impressive account of a brutal true story. As the title refers the film as Adhigaaram Ondru meaning Chapter One, there are chances of a sequel. But the Operation Bawariya story is finished here and since the character is fictional they can go on with a fictional story. Although, let us hope that it won't turn out like the atrocious ""Singam"" trilogy starring Surya, elder brother of Karthi.",solid but compromised,theeran is fictional character that has been inspired by real life police officers karthi does impressive job as glorified hero theeran most film is carried by his character although at times heroism is bit too stretched that one may think that it would have been better if sole focus narrative wasnt through single character theeran adhigaram ondru is solid crime thriller which compromises little commercialization yet manages be impressive account brutal true story as title refers film as adhigaaram ondru meaning chapter one there are chances sequel but operation bawariya story is finished here since character is fictional they can go with fictional story although let us hope that it wont turn out like atrocious singam trilogy starring surya elder brother karthi,0.46260504201680674,0.09800420168067225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.56}"

9,Awesome movie with useless first 30 mins,"While his brother Surya has made his career playing filmi cop,Karthi comes and shows what is a real cop and how hard it is to be one. I couldnt help saying that I would never want to be a cop if it was this hard.Our normal Indian movies romanticise or demonize the cop.But this is a rare gem(like Zodiac in English) which will really make you want to salute one. All credit to the director in making such a honest and gruelling movie. If only we had been spared the useless 30 mins of love track with Rakul Preet Singh, this film would be Oscar worthy.When everything was so realistic why cant Karthi's wife be a real Tamilian instead of white Northener in all Tamil masala movies. And I will think twice before going to any Rakul Preet Singh movie, she was most annoying playing innocent. Next time the talented director should do way with the love track, added no value than testing your patience",awesome movie with useless first 30 mins,while his brother surya has made his career playing filmi cop karthi comes shows what is real cop how hard it is be one i couldnt help saying that i would never want be cop if it was this hard our normal indian movies romanticise or demonize cop but this is rare gem like zodiac english which will really make you want salute one all credit director making such honest gruelling movie if only we had been spared useless 30 mins love track with rakul preet singh this film would be oscar worthy when everything was so realistic why cant karthis wife be real tamilian instead white northener all tamil masala movies i will think twice before going any rakul preet singh movie she was most annoying playing innocent next time talented director should do way with love track added no value than testing your patience,0.524,0.14866666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.25}"
