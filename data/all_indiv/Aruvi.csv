7,"If it doesn't arouse, is it art? ARUVI does","This is one of the best films of 2017 with an almost watertight screenplay that keeps you completely engrossed from start to finish with some mesmerizing central performances from the characters and the sidekicks but the main attraction of this movie has to be Aditi Balan. This actress manages to pull you in the story. She brings an intensity to the screen that only a few actors and actresses are able to do. You will love her and care for her. Through her you will experience a morality play showing how evil does not necessarily manifest itself in an orgy of destruction caused by war, that its roots may lie concealed in the malicious pranks of everyday life. I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this, and I was pleasantly surprised by a film that confounded all of my expectations.Aditi Balan, the lead actress at the center of ARUVI has lived the character and her ability to portray both utter intelligence and unknowable vacancy, as she does here, shows an uncommon deal of range. Her character in ARUVI has dropped out of society and every hint that we get is greeted with a contradiction. It then unfolds, flashbacks sandwiched between the main story. This way the movie never lets go of the suspense, while on the same time, it unravels new things for the viewer. Well there are abundant world movies on psycho-cultural mirrors, harassment, male domination and abuse that are far better than Aruvi, but come on, we don't see films like this releasing often in Indian cinema. I'm hyped for Arun Karthick's The Strange Case Of Shiva. Also, I can't deny the fact that the Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu's ending with 'Katheyondu Shuruvaagide' song runs through towards the climax of the Aruvi. Do not go to this movie expecting right to win and evil to perish, it won't happen, but along the way you will be asked to question every assumption. But believe me it's not easy being a woman in India and on the other hand this not a feminist movie as few of my friends had stated so. This is uncompromising, unashamed and a smash in your face, post-modernism, philosophical drama in short and on the side note the war between the rat race sexes and hedonist will rage on regardless.",if it doesnt arouse is it art aruvi does,this is one best films 2017 with almost watertight screenplay that keeps you completely engrossed start finish with some mesmerizing central performances characters sidekicks but main attraction this movie has be aditi balan this actress manages pull you story she brings intensity screen that only few actors actresses are able do you will love her care her through her you will experience morality play showing how evil does not necessarily manifest itself orgy destruction caused by war that its roots may lie concealed malicious pranks everyday life i had no idea what expect when i sat down watch this i was pleasantly surprised by film that confounded all my expectations aditi balan lead actress at center aruvi has lived character her ability portray both utter intelligence unknowable vacancy as she does here shows uncommon deal range her character aruvi has dropped out society every hint that we get is greeted with contradiction it then unfolds flashbacks sandwiched between main story this way movie never lets go suspense while same time it unravels new things viewer well there are abundant world movies psycho cultural mirrors harassment male domination abuse that are far better than aruvi but come we dont see films like this releasing often indian cinema im hyped arun karthicks strange case shiva also i cant deny fact that godhi banna sadharana mykattus ending with katheyondu shuruvaagide song runs through towards climax aruvi do not go this movie expecting right win evil perish it wont happen but along way you will be asked question every assumption but believe me its not easy being woman india other hand this not feminist movie as few my friends had stated so this is uncompromising unashamed smash your face post modernism philosophical drama short side note war between rat race sexes hedonist will rage regardless,0.5244042465471037,0.06880540094825811,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.53}"
10,Best Tamil film of 2017,"This might be the greatest movie Kollywood has offered us this year. With riveting screenplay and an excellent performance from newcomer Aditi Balan, Aruvi will keep you at the edge of your seats with nail biting sequences and an emotional backstory. Pretty much every element in this movie works cohesively with the script, and I'm hard-pressed to even find a flaw that is worth mentioning.Finally Tamil heroines are no longer props used for dance sequences but are the center point of a film that deals with real-life problems..

5,"Good attempt at total social commentary, but ultimately flawed..","(This is the longest review I have ever written! Why I wrote this long because I needed to pour out my whole brain in to a thing which was all against what I am hearing from people. I might be going harsh on this film but it is to express my flaws in the movie. I have no idea if you would read all this, but hey if you are up for it, let go on this ride.) Guess I'm the black ship. Because I think the movie is okay, not much more than that. I think it had great potential to be more. This large hype and this hysteria, I really don't know, maybe because people always got/saw 'mass' films and over the top films, not the down to earth one. If you loved and enjoyed this film, good for you!The beginning montage shots through Aruvi's life was brilliant. The director deserves due respect for those moments, just beautiful. The way he concealed how her family ostracize her, how she got aids, the family misunderstanding was very good.But for me in the 2nd act while the director, Arun prabhu was getting on with his commentary of reality shows (the comedy moments) ,when the three guys were called up, she reveals she has aids and all hell breaks loose, the movie faltered for me. The timing of her coming to the show is off. Because temple guy, friend's dad all violated her when she was still in home (with her parents) or after she left her home. Then she arranged the 1 lakh for her father, where the 3rd person (guy who hired her for tailoring) comes into play. But after that she goes on a vacation with her friend and all. All these must have taken at least some months before the tv show events right? Then all of a sudden, she wanted to bring this into fore. Maybe she was mulling on this on her vacation and wanted some justice or some reveal to happen. I don't know.Main question. What was her motive to come to the show - For them to apologize. She tells that beforehand. I guess she must have called them or confronted before for the apology. She might not have got what she wanted, so she took it to the next level - TV show. So, what was her plan (after the aids reveal) if they don't apologize. Get the gun from her bag and force them? Kind of stupid! So seriously what was her motive??? Reveal to them in a shocking fashion that they could have contradicted aids? To shame them on TV? Expose them? That seems like a more probable reason. What if they don't act as they have done any wrong? I really don't know. So all three must have had raped her or some form of sexual acts on her judging by their reactions on hearing the reveal. The guy who employed her asked for some sexual favour for money. But knowing she has aids she shouldn't have indulged in that, but that guy is bad for asking for sex but still I don't know if she should transfer the disease knowingly. Friend's dad guy and temple dude did bad things to her when she was not conscious, so they are very much in the guilty side. They raped her! But it's okay she don't want to file a case or anything, she just wants them to apologize to her. Not very good scenario if all girls just want apologies if something horrible happens to them. But I guess she didn't want anything more from them, because she was feeling guilty that they might have contracted aids and she didn't tell them after what they have done to her.Also the bashing scene of her (for not revealing being an aids patient) by the host was so stupid, because if they (the 3 bad guys) did anything bad to her, it was while she was NOT conscious except that guy who hired her. Any 'fault' on her part might be that she didn't inform them but they were monsters, I don't think they deserve that info considering she didn't report to the authorities, maybe that was best punishment for them. So everybody ignoring that aspect is just plain stupidity. Aruvi kind of mentions about it in a blitz but it wasn't stressed enough in the movie.Major plot point - Shooting the director of TV show The 'All hope lost aids' card can't be played like that while she shot the director. She could have just shot up the ceiling if she wanted everyone to quieten down. Also she could have really lost control and shot the director but then the scene was not convincingly set up, she didn't look angry or anything to commit the act. And this scene is very important because it changes the whole dynamics of the film. When she shot that director, you can't argue she was trained in shooting. Though she saw the gun from her childhood, it's not like she has shot or practised shooting. So basically, she could have killed the director which is very much important, you just can't take life of a person just because you are sick of the person or irritated or angry or whatever. She just met that guy! You can't claim that this was all a plan because she herelf confirms everything got out of hand.The fact that she carries her gun in bag is very unsettling, plus the bullets! What is she preparing for. So was she staging a big commotion on a big regional TV, if so it would be for nothing.The ragging scene. Blah. I was like all the people in the TV show room must be knowing at this point that she is just messing around and stuff. Felt more like put in for comedy relief and to reflect the hypocrisy in reality shows about everything being staged and not real. She could have just walked off at the start itself and surrender to the police. But she just wanted to be a college senior for a while, mess around and later feed them. Kind of like an exposition scene to show how loving,caring, funny she is?Police catches her. I understand they be kept in medical camps but that doesn't mean that all aids people can cause crime and not be punished. What happened in between, did I miss anything? Doesn't the case still exist? Well it was a national news and a hostage crisis case's culprit (also an attempted murder, also shooting the director itself could be brought in focus her mental instability ) can't be released just like that. Even if all the people involved were to be like she was very loving towards us or we were treated nicely etc, we don't have any complains, can a case of such public attention and high profile be left like that and not punished. No security details around them???? How did she, how can she escape with such deteriorated, fragile health and supposedly police surveillance around her? How did she acquire money to living alone somewhere remote, consuming her ART medications and cooking stuff, internet connection? I don't know the legal side to all this so there's that.The last scenes were projected as the sad scenes, didn't really feel real to me. While she was explaining about how she missed everyone and how she was scared, the director could have atleast removed the background sad music to make it more real and though wind sounds were put in it doesn't at all feel like something taken in a smartphone, her voice was so crisp and clear (ADR done in a studio), it removed the originality. Also the above things bothered me and took me out of the scene completely. (Also how did they track her down, it's not like she told anyone her address and if it was possible to track her, I can't imagine how much media people would be trying to get to her because she presents a great story. And like I said above is the case still on, doesn't the police want her for court trial?)Finally this is all seems like a rant (having myself read this essay) but I don't want this to be so. Just a thought process by an average joe. Maybe there is answers to all questions that I have posed here, but from what the movie showed me, I wasn't satisfied. For me the film is a flawed attempt with a good short film at the beginning.",good attempt at total social commentary but ultimately flawed,this is longest review i have ever written why i wrote this

The director has literally shaken the stereotype of movies where plot lines are black and white, good beats evil, etc. The director has very skilfully, and at the same time very artfully portrayed a snapshot of life, with all the associated greys in between. It's hard to say if this movie is a comedy or a tragedy or a celebration, but then again, isn't life just the same?Special mention to the cast, especially the lead actress Aditi Balan. Very rarely do we come across such talent in a debutant actress. I would say she has lived the role rather than simply performing it during the movie. Her subtle moves and gestures throughout the film have not gaudy element nor a bit of overacting. It is every bit as real as watching a real life event unfold in front of our eyes.Don't miss this movie.

6,"Middle part is amazing; but overall, contrived and sentimental","The middle part of the movie that deals with the reality TV show is a well-made spoof and critique of shows of such genre. But, the whole story is rather contrived; and the ending too sentimental. I wonder why the director chose a taboo subject and tried to glorify that character beyond normal circumstances. It is also obvious that the story intends to portray the lead female actor as a liberal girl fed up with social expectations for conformity. But, such a girl still has to contract AIDS under 'mysterious' circumstances! Probably, the makers were so much concerned to take care of her so called 'character'! May be, from their point of view the character might have lost its 'purity' if AIDS was contracted through the most common means!

8,Aruvi is sensational and emotional classic on sensitive topic. One of the most mind-shattering build up for any woman centric film recently.,"Aruvi (2016) : Brief Review -Aruvi is sensational and emotional classic on sensitive topic. One of the most mind-shattering build up for any woman centric film recently. Let's make this clear at the beginning that Aruvi isn't artistic or high cinematic experience so do not expect it to be one after seeing the high rating. It has loopes in the storyline that many smart movie buffs may not like (even i don't support it) but it has some sensational methods to drive an atypical topic which has been used many times before and it's highly sensitive. One more thing, DO NOT read any Synopsis or anything about the storyline please and believe me you'll be blown by the thrilling aspects in midway. A gentle girl born and brought up amidst the ever growing eco-social-consumeristic environment finds it difficult to fit in the society. She decides to take it hard on the people. What she does is the rest of the story. By the intermission point it leaves you stunned and then gives a social lecture which hits the emotional chords in the second half and especially in last 20 minutes. The visuals can be disturbing for weak hearted audience but what to do, it's the reality and we have to accept it. Overall, it's a great narrative despite couple of big loopholes but those can be overlooked for the sake of rest of show which is simply brilliant. It also lacks cinematic intelligence of director yet makes a beautiful mainstream film overall. Aditi Balan is terrific in the lead tole. Her expressions, dedication, transformation everything is extremely convincing.

1,Overrated and awful!,"The film is overly dramatic, gross at times, and awful! The movie sends a message that living with HIV is equivalent to death sentence. HIV is a manageable chronic disease and it is not the end of the world.The director does not have his facts straight about HIV. HIV does not progress to AIDS (which is now called stage 3 instead of AIDS) for 5-10 years after the person is first infected. So, how come the lead character experiences weight loss and AIDS related symptoms in such a short span of time?Also modern day HIV medications do not cause hair loss as a side effect and hair loss is generally not a symptom of HIV. The weight loss accompanied with it would have made sense 15 years ago when HIV medications were not technically advanced. It is highly misleading to portray HIV as a ""death sentence"" while the reality is far from it. This movie will scare any sexually active person into thinking that HIV could kill them.",overrated awful,film is overly dramatic gross at times awful movie sends message that living with hiv is equivalent death sentence hiv is manageable chronic disease it is not end world director does not have his facts straight about hiv hiv does not progress aids which is now called stage 3 instead aids 5 10 years after person is first infected so how come lead character experiences weight loss aids related symptoms such short span time also modern day hiv medications do not cause hair loss as side effect hair loss is generally not symptom hiv weight loss accompanied with it would have made sense 15 years ago when hiv medications were not technically advanced it is highly misleading portray hiv as death sentence while reality is far it this movie will scare any sexually active person into thinking that hiv could kill them,0.5382222222222222,-0.12544444444444444,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"

1,Sub-standard in most aspects,"Tamil cinema continues to veer as far away from reality as possible. This film is no different. It is still better than Telugu films, which cannot think beyond marriage or pelli. However, in this also, the actress laments about her marriage in the end. The film from the very start was rushed. The characters are all half baked and cliched. This seems to be norm now-a-days, there is no attempt to develop the character. Or it was a deliberate decision, considering the only real reason for making this movie was to rant against men. Watching the film I was wondering that does Tamil viewers really buy this stuff? Tamil films' relation with quick highs and cheap thrills is well know. This film is no different. It shows an IPS officer, ex-Commando, no less, interrogating the actress asking if she is from any terrorist organisation. This, after it is clear that the motive of hostage situation was make the rapists apologize on live TV. No IPS officer, let alone an ex-Commando is that stupid. That cannot be said about the makers of this film though. There is a scene where the heroine keeps a group of hapless men on their toes in front of her, asking them to do her bidding at gun point. If you flip the scene and had hero done that with a group of women, it would suddenly become unacceptable. The film is misandric, openly being hateful of men, of fellow human beings. The makers had some narrow agenda, and it would appear that they set forth with all their might to getting that agenda on the screen. If only they hadn't made it so poorly. The film appears contrived in almost every frame. It was a wastage of time. Performances of two actors stand out. One is Lakshmi Gopalaswamy, who did a good job, and another is an actor, who recites the multiplication table of 7 under duress. Who knew, under the labyrinth of this sordid movie you will find moments of good acting?",sub standard most aspects,tamil cinema continues veer as far away reality as possible this film is no different it is still better than telugu films which cannot think beyond marriage or pelli however this also actress laments about her marriage end film very start was rushed characters are all half baked cliched this seems be norm now days there is no attempt develop character or it was deliberate decision considering only real reason making this movie was rant against men watching film i was wondering that does tamil viewers really buy this stuff tamil films relation with quick highs cheap thrills is well know this film is no different it shows ips officer ex commando no less interrogating actress asking if she is any terrorist organisation this after it is clear that motive hostage situation was make rapists apologize live tv no ips officer let alone ex commando is that stupid that cannot be said about makers this film though there is scene where heroine keeps group hapless men their toes front her asking them do her bidding at gun point if you flip scene had hero done that with group women it would suddenly become unacceptable film is misandric openly being hateful men fellow human beings makers had some narrow agenda it would appear that they set forth with all their might getting that agenda screen if only they hadnt made it so poorly film appears contrived almost every frame it was wastage time performances two actors stand out one is lakshmi gopalaswamy who did good job another is actor who recites multiplication table 7 under duress who knew under labyrinth this sordid movie you will find moments good acting,0.5298850574712644,0.051253918495297805,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.32}"

5,Your usual commercial drama film,"The trailer is not true to the movie. The trailer gives an image that it is going to be a very fast paced biography drama filled with crime. But in reality, it is moderately fast paced movie about a one day event told in retrospect. The story is strong but at many places, it becomes so dramatic that it seems unrealistic. Whole ""spin the bottle"" scene is unbelievable. Many unrequired comic elements are added in an otherwise serious drama. Writing is very good. It actually gives meaning to many little things, which you don't think are important in the beginning. It doesn't leave any string untied at the end. Direction is okay.

Sounds too close to real life.. does it ?Aruvi is a genre grinder which mixes all this and more into a narrative that is engaging and enthralling in equal measure.Debutante Aditi Balan, who plays the titular protagonist, is a natural and shines bright in a layered role. Her superlative performance which sees her shouldering the entire movie and make it stick together is among the best this year and is sure to bring her many laurels. Director Arun Prabhu Purushothaman has announced himself as a helmer to look forward to with this audacious debut feature. He brilliantly strings together diverse strands of his storyline to concoct a captivating symphony like a seasoned maestro. Check out the initial sequences of measured vignettes from Aruvi's unfolding childhood which subtly state a lot and surreptitiously smuggle us into the storyline and create an instant connect with her and make us care for her. Or the way, he can transition from a tense situation of a terror response into a playful mood of truth or dare that takes us on a roller coaster ride of emotions.
