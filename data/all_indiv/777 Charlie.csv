7,Everyone with a beating heart go see this!,"No wonder they say that man's best friend is a dog. There has been many movies made about self discovery, finding oneself and this is one of the best in that list. Here our Protagonist Dharma (Rakshit Shetty) is the kinda guy who'd be hated by kids and families in the neighbourhood. But he is also the kinda guy who values his solitude with anxiety simmering below the surface. His seemingly normal life of is suddenly unsettled, the constant ringing of his door bells, presence of people, all for the uninvited guest, our snow loving Charlie. It's only when he reintegrates with his surrounding which leads to a beautiful, affectionate, touching film, a journey that touches on topics of life, pet adoption, overcoming anxiety, and most importantly love. Firstly, many will be familiar with the key concept of the film and it be no longer surprising but trust me you will be proven wrong.From choo choo to naming Charlie after the great Chaplin, there are a lot of such touching moments in the film and i'm sure it will be very hard to hold back tears while watching. At the same time, the picture is a wonderful sketch of the soul of an ordinary Dharma and Charlie's last wish as they both find love, including a new addition to the family.To conclude ""777 Charlie"" is good movie with very little flaws, also it is cleverly constructed love story, where the emotions are truly at heart and it perfectly sums up ""The tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug."" I went to the film and knew that I would enjoy it and with a brilliant cast and a cute dog, which is impossible not to love. I strongly recommend to stop looking for similarities with other movies that shares the same theme and enjoy this wholesome journey.",everyone with beating heart go see this,no wonder they say that mans best friend is dog there has been many movies made about self discovery finding oneself this is one best that list here our protagonist dharma rakshit shetty is kinda guy whod be hated by kids families neighbourhood but he is also kinda guy who values his solitude with anxiety simmering below surface his seemingly normal life is suddenly unsettled constant ringing his door bells presence people all uninvited guest our snow loving charlie its only when he reintegrates with his surrounding which leads beautiful affectionate touching film journey that touches topics life pet adoption overcoming anxiety most importantly love firstly many will be familiar with key concept film it be no longer surprising but trust me you will be proven wrong choo choo naming charlie after great chaplin there are lot such touching moments film im sure it will be very hard hold back tears while watching at same time picture is wonderful sketch soul ordinary dharma charlies last wish as they both find love including new addition family conclude 777 charlie is good movie with very little flaws also it is cleverly constructed love story where emotions are truly at heart it perfectly sums up tale dharmaraj kaliyug i went film knew that i would enjoy it with brilliant cast cute dog which is impossible not love i strongly recommend stop looking similarities with other movies that shares same theme enjoy this wholesome journey,0.6099833562901745,0.2794722796143251,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.21}"

8,Highly Recommended üëçüèº by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,"Rakshit Shetty is a gem of Sandalwood. After delivering critically acclaimed films like Ulidavaru Kandanthe, Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu, Kirik Party, and Avane Srimannarayana, Rakshit Shetty is back with another outstanding film.777 Charlie is a treat for dog lovers and those who are not connected to pets will definitely start liking them after watching this film. The makers have successfully delivered an endearing and wonderful film. The film has stood up to all the expectations of the audience. The writing of the film is flawless, the emotional roller coaster ride gives you the perfect blend of emotions and drama.Rakshit Shetty has again given an impressive performance and he never disappoints his fans. His bonding with Charlie is a delight to watch. The female labrador Charlie's acts and her eyes will surely melt your heart. The cameos by Danish Sait and Bobby Simha will be loved by the viewers. Raj B. Shetty, Sangeetha Sringeri, and other supporting actors were fine in their roles.This is indeed A Tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug, which has been inspired by Dharmaraya's character of the Mahabharata where he reaches heaven alone and a dog follows him and he ensures the dog will go to heaven. The score and soundtrack of the film composed by Nobin Paul are refreshing. The direction, cinematography, editing, and screenplay, everything was perfect in the film.The movies like 777 Charlie come so rarely in our Indian film industry.
