8.0,Anger begets more anger,"Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is disgusted that the police haven't found her daughter's rapist and killer, so she takes out billboards asking why the chief of police, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) hasn't done anything about the case.The billboards set off anger, violence, and revenge motifs in this small town. Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops.",anger begets more anger,frances mcdormand is grieving mother who puts up three billboards outside ebbing missouri this 2017 black comedy directed by martin mcdonagh mildred hayes mcdormand is disgusted that police havent found her daughters rapist killer so she takes out billboards asking why chief police willoughby woody harrelson hasnt done anything about case billboards set off anger violence revenge motifs this small town things become worse when pent up police officer dixon sam rockwell becomes enraged starts acting out lots swearing lots violence lots laughs be had this film it was strange watch as i had just seen another film past life that focused subject anger pain how it can eat person up destroy them this film is yet another good illustration that as mildred stops at nothing make point one liners are amazing mildreds speech priest who comes by ask her remove billboards is hilarious movie is filled with strong performances equally well developed characters we see all their sides violent kind vengeful angry sad we finally realize theyre just people driven some cases extremes harrelsons performance is touching were prepared dislike him but his sincerity humanity come through as dixon rockwell seems like monster but once he acts out hes able focus his energy little better then theres mcdormand powerhouse shes not good ol marge fargo shes tough woman with broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can its beautiful multilayered performance highly recommended asking questions where revenge hatred can take us deciding when if it stops,0.53509009009009,-0.07476726726726725,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,A thought-provoking and darkly comedic drama with lots to say.,"""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I've never quite seen before. We're presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character's motivations. It's obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it's constructed. One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they're in. That's not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It's a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don't miss this one.",thought provoking darkly comedic drama with lots say,three billboards outside ebbing missouri marks milestone writer directer martin mcdonagh is idea piece mothers struggle with her town after posting billboards containing call action regards her murdered daughter with outstanding screen writing near perfect editing this powerhouse film is easily one best all year is driven with force intensity by its lead frances mcdormand what begins as narrow focused drama gradually escalates film with big themes ideas relevant social commentary much more subplots than anticipated three billboards outside ebbing missouri is packed with questions few answers about anger revenge violence kindness story shows people realistic light ive never quite seen before were presented with characters their genuine emotions nothing feels sugarcoated fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting dark comedy that feels heavy due strong subject matter while at same time utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural characters motivations its obvious great care was taken into this script method which its constructed one most talked about elements this film are strong performances particularly by frances mcdormand sam rockwell rightfully so this is some their best if not their best work these eyes have beheld they steal show every film theyre thats not take away woody harrelson lucas hedges as well as entire cast who give memorable performances paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally if there is anything that might turn audiences away this film it might be its harsh subject matter despite none it every being depicted as well as its language execution with material personally this has strong impact i wouldnt have changed anything about it its highly recommended film with lot ponder at end is definitely contender best movie year definitely dont miss this one,0.469645390070922,0.22663120567375888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"Anger, what it begets, and what to do about it","When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.But a great story isn't necessary grand on the outside. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like a tiny rabbit hole size of those three wooden screens, but stick a head in - and you'll see a huge empty space laid with people's sorrow, guilt and regret. And that emptiness sucks you in and leaves no way to stay untouched.But there's also hope. Hope for justice. Hope for retribution. And maybe even hope that it's still not too late to change something, or to change yourself. That nothing is absolutely black and white. That even in the darkest moments of our lives there's some room for a sense of humor, maybe a sad and bitter one but still one worth a warm smile.This world is a crooked place, where crime often goes unpunished. And Peter Dinklage's small role in this film, as a reference to another not so pretty world where the ""happily ever after"" way doesn't quite exist, is a stinging reminder of that. TBOEM does not, however, try to pull the magic sword out of the stone and go crush the wicked and protect the righteous. Instead, it shows that sometimes, crumbling under the weight of the evil things that fall on us, we lose our own limits and become those who sow evil ourselves. Anger does beget even more anger.And maybe the reason that makes America great indeed is that, with all the messed up stuff happening without and within, it's in your culture to value forgiveness, something Christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends to listen. To suffer without guilt, yet to offer a helping hand to your offender when he's down and wounded. To break the circle of evil and help each other wake that yearning for decency that everyone has inside them, albeit dormant sometimes. Forgiveness is tough, and, just like revenge, it doesn't bring back the things - or people - we've lost. But at least it helps to hold onto what could still be here.Yeah, it's just a movie, and most people aren't as deep and philosophical as the movie characters can afford to be. But if some unrealistic complexity (and sometimes even wisdom) of the simple people could make some real regular people on the other side of the screen stop and think over their own real regular ways, maybe that's exactly what we need from time to time. Because life is still here, and so are the multiple choices it gives, And which road to choose today, we can still decide along the way.",anger what it begets what do about it,when you think about great cinema you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon likes gone with wind or godfather or shawshank redemption such films span through decades or cover major historic events but great story isnt necessary grand outside three billboards outside ebbing missouri is like tiny rabbit hole size those three wooden screens but stick head youll see huge empty space laid with peoples sorrow guilt regret that emptiness sucks you leaves no way stay untouched but theres also hope hope justice hope retribution maybe even hope that its still not too late change something or change yourself that nothing is absolutely black white that even darkest moments our lives theres some room sense humor maybe sad bitter one but still one worth warm smile this world is crooked place where crime often goes unpunished peter dinklages small role this film as reference another not so pretty world where happily ever after way doesnt quite exist is stinging reminder that tboem does not however try pull magic sword out stone go crush wicked protect righteous instead it shows that sometimes crumbling under weight evil things that fall us we lose our own limits become those who sow evil ourselves anger does beget even more anger maybe reason that makes america great indeed is that with all messed up stuff happening without within its your culture value forgiveness something christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends listen suffer without guilt yet offer helping hand your offender when hes down wounded break circle evil help each other wake that yearning decency that everyone has inside them albeit dormant sometimes forgiveness is tough just like revenge it doesnt bring back things or people weve lost but at least it helps hold onto what could still be here yeah its just movie most people arent as deep philosophical as movie characters can afford be but if some unrealistic complexity sometimes even wisdom simple people could make some real regular people other side screen stop think over their own real regular ways maybe thats exactly what we need time time because life is still here so are multiple choices it gives which road choose today we can still decide along way,0.4885559932729743,0.004743186582809222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,"Comedy, tragedy and morality rolled into one","Saw 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' on the promise of one of the year's best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh's previous work. On the most part 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' was incredibly well done. Understandably it is not for all. The film has already been criticised for implausibility, bigotry, the ending and its lack of character likeability and over-the-top actions, though often without acknowledging the film's many strengths and resorting to condescension (a big bugbear of mine) towards people who liked it let alone loved it. Did have a couple of issues with 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' myself. The ending is far too abrupt and without resolution in a film crying out for one. Epileptics should beware too of a dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene, understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it (luckily it quickly passed). Abbie Cornish felt out of place here, she doesn't have a lot to do (not enough to single handedly ruin the film, she would have to have a far more major role to do that) but everything about her just jarred. There are some implausible behaviours and consequences, Dixon's actions were more than just a sackable offense for instance.However, there is so much to like about 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'. With the sole exception of Cornish, who isn't in it enough to ruin the film, the acting is brilliant. Frances McDormand's performance is a career high and one of the year's best, very heartfelt and fiery, even if you don't condone some of her actions it is hard not to feel for her as she goes through every mother's worst nightmare. Woody Harrelson is heart-breaking and has the film's most sympathetic character perhaps (either he or Peter Dinklage's, although Dinklage doesn't have the film's most tragic scene). Sam Rockwell is similarly a revelation, you initially dislike his character but later on his 180 is incredibly moving and he is the character who changes and redeems the most. Peter Dinklage always makes anything better and it's the same here just by his presence alone and his performance is the most likeable one, especially towards the end where one actually feels sorry for him. Another standout is the writing, do not let the heavy use of profanity put you off. There are parts that are darkly comic and induce a number of chuckles and laugh out louds. The film also works as being one that is morally nuanced and complex, the characters are not ""likeable"" ones, neither were they intended to be, and make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them in a different perspective (Dixon especially). A large part of me found it difficult to not relate to Mildred, her actions are extreme at times but there are parents in the same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is an incredibly powerful and complex emotion. It's the tragic elements that resonate most though, with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly and harrowingly. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' has a story that is deliberate but also gripping, with an adept balance of its varied tones. Which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does. With the exception of one scene, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is succinctly edited and grittily and beautifully shot. McDonagh directs very skilfully. Carter Burwell's music score fits perfectly and is a hypnotic, understated and melancholic score in its own right. Just as fitting in a somewhat ironic way is the use of the gorgeous ""Last Rose of Summer"" exquisitely sung by Renee Fleming, whose voice one familiar with and loves classical music and opera (like me) recognises from anywhere. Overall, gripping and very well done film if not perfect. The performances are among the best of the year especially but the film itself as an overall whole just falls a tad short of being one of the year's best films. 8/10 Bethany Cox",comedy tragedy morality rolled into one,saw three billboards outside ebbing missouri promise one years best trailers immensely talented cast intriguing subject matter receiving pending numerous accolades being familiar with martin mcdonaghs previous work most part three billboards outside ebbing missouri was incredibly well done understandably it is not all film has already been criticised implausibility bigotry ending its lack character likeability over top actions though often without acknowledging films many strengths resorting condescension big bugbear mine towards people who liked it let alone loved it did have couple issues with three billboards outside ebbing missouri myself ending is far too abrupt without resolution film crying out one epileptics should beware too dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it luckily it quickly passed abbie cornish felt out place here she doesnt have lot do not enough single handedly ruin film she would have have far more major role do that but everything about her just jarred there are some implausible behaviours consequences dixons actions were more than just sackable offense instance however there is so much like about three billboards outside ebbing missouri with sole exception cornish who isnt it enough ruin film acting is brilliant frances mcdormands performance is career high one years best very heartfelt fiery even if you dont condone some her actions it is hard not feel her as she goes through every mothers worst nightmare woody harrelson is heart breaking has films most sympathetic character perhaps either he or peter dinklages although dinklage doesnt have films most tragic scene sam rockwell is similarly revelation you initially dislike his character but later his 180 is incredibly moving he is character who changes redeems most peter dinklage always makes anything better its same here just by his presence alone his performance is most likeable one especially towards end where one actually feels sorry him another standout is writing do not let heavy use profanity put you off there are parts that are darkly comic induce number chuckles laugh out louds film also works as being one that is morally nuanced complex characters are not likeable ones neither were they intended be make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them different perspective dixon especially large part me found it difficult not relate mildred her actions are extreme at times but there are parents same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is incredibly powerful complex emotion its tragic elements that resonate most though with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly harrowingly three billboards outside ebbing missouri has story that is deliberate but also gripping with adept balance its varied tones which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does with exception one scene three billboards outside ebbing missouri is succinctly edited grittily beautifully shot mcdonagh directs very skilfully carter burwells music score fits perfectly is hypnotic understated melancholic score its own right just as fitting somewhat ironic way is use gorgeous last rose summer exquisitely sung by renee fleming whose voice one familiar with loves classical music opera like me recognises anywhere overall gripping very well done film if not perfect performances are among best year especially but film itself as overall whole just falls tad short being one years best films 8 10 bethany cox,0.5426284771334273,0.17300683639792547,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,This is how a drama should be!,"Martin McDonagh has made critically acclaimed throughout his career. I haven't seen In Bruges but I liked Seven Psychopaths. However, it's with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri that made me realise what a talented writer and director he is.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri follows Mildred, a mother that rents three billboards to challenge the authorities in order to find and capture her daughter's murderer after they fail to do so.With this film, Martin McDonagh has crafted one of my favourite dramas to ever exist. I was thoroughly entertained throughout and couldn't spot a single thing I didn't like. One of the best parts of this film is its unpredictability. With a story like this, I thought I knew where it was headed but McDonagh managed to surprise me every time. Without taking the route many films do with this kind of story, McDonagh subverts our expectations by taking us on a more psychological journey with the characters of Mildred, Dixon and Willoughby. The writing is one of the smartest I've ever seen as McDonagh writes characters with immense depth and emotion. No character is perfect and as the films unfolds, McDonagh peels back the layers of each one of them to create an arc you wouldn't expect them to have on their odyssey of anger, revenge and love. The realistic and humane approach McDonagh takes made me genuinely care about the characters. There are also moments of dark humour spread across but they don't take away from the dramatic elements and impact you're meant to feel.Aside from Martin McDonagh's outstanding writing and direction, the acting is some of the best you'll see. Frances McDormand is an actress that consistently delivers exceptional performances and her performance as Mildred is one of her best. She is an absolute force to be reckoned with and deserves winner the Oscar for her work here. Sam Rockwell is extraordinary as Dixon. This is his best performance yet and he deserves all the awards he got for this film. Woody Harrelson is terrific as usual and plays Willoughby with enormous skill. John Hawkes, Peter Dinklage, Lucas Hedges and Caleb Landry Jones are also great.Every single aspect of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is done exceptionally well. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest films of 2017. With its dark subject matter, impeccable writing, directing and extraordinary acting, I consider this film to be one of the best dramas to ever exist.",this is how drama should be,martin mcdonagh has made critically acclaimed throughout his career i havent seen bruges but i liked seven psychopaths however its with three billboards outside ebbing missouri that made me realise what talented writer director he is three billboards outside ebbing missouri follows mildred mother that rents three billboards challenge authorities order find capture her daughters murderer after they fail do so with this film martin mcdonagh has crafted one my favourite dramas ever exist i was thoroughly entertained throughout couldnt spot single thing i didnt like one best parts this film is its unpredictability with story like this i thought i knew where it was headed but mcdonagh managed surprise me every time without taking route many films do with this kind story mcdonagh subverts our expectations by taking us more psychological journey with characters mildred dixon willoughby writing is one smartest ive ever seen as mcdonagh writes characters with immense depth emotion no character is perfect as films unfolds mcdonagh peels back layers each one them create arc you wouldnt expect them have their odyssey anger revenge love realistic humane approach mcdonagh takes made me genuinely care about characters there are also moments dark humour spread across but they dont take away dramatic elements impact youre meant feel aside martin mcdonaghs outstanding writing direction acting is some best youll see frances mcdormand is actress that consistently delivers exceptional performances her performance as mildred is one her best she is absolute force be reckoned with deserves winner oscar her work here sam rockwell is extraordinary as dixon this is his best performance yet he deserves all awards he got this film woody harrelson is terrific as usual plays willoughby with enormous skill john hawkes peter dinklage lucas hedges caleb landry jones are also great every single aspect three billboards outside ebbing missouri is done exceptionally well without doubt this is one greatest films 2017 with its dark subject matter impeccable writing directing extraordinary acting i consider this film be one best dramas ever exist,0.5209145021645022,0.29485930735930743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,Beware the p(l)ot holes near the billboards,"I will say that I enjoyed this film, mostly due to Frances McDormand's performance. It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I'd have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can't explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.--Most strikingly the (deputy?) Chief Dixon violently attacks Welby, busts his face with his gun, throws him out of a window and proceeds to kick him while he's down, all in eyes view of the new Chief Abercrombie. Sure, he gets fired. But not arrested? Not even sued?--And as for Abercrombie. He shows up the morning after the previous Police Chief died and declares that ""they"" sent him as a replacement. They who? Is there some force outside of Ebbing that dictates who their police chief is? That part really didn't make any sense to me. Also, replacing one of the main characters halfway through the film, a character we're starting to get to know, with a stereotype that we don't know anything about, was rather odd.--Someone lights the billboards on fire. But apparently only the paper on them burns, not the old wood that's been sitting there decaying since the 80s, because they are able to paste duplicate posters to the existing structures without any problems. That's laughable. That old wood would have been a pile of smoldering cinder.--Mildred is portrayed as such a tough-ass, assaulting a dentist, kicking children in the crotch (with no repercussions I might add), storming into the police station spouting vulgarities, but when she's confronted by a guy who suggests he's actually the one who killed her daughter, she freezes and seems helpless. One might say the fact that she didn't go psycho in this scene is what makes this screenplay original but someone else, like me, might argue that it's just out of her character and doesn't make a lick of sense.--Chief Willoughby for some reason is an old geezer but has a young, attractive Australian wife. He also has two young girls. Yet he's completely vulgar around them. While instructing them about a game of fishing he invents, he calls the blanket they are sitting on the ""god-dam blanked""--twice--to little four or five year old girls. He says to his wife later that it's her turn to ""clean the horse *hit"" out of the barn. OK, I actually have quite a bit of experience tending horses. It's not called ""*hit"" it's called manure and you wouldn't even call it that--you'd just say ""clean the barn"" if you really owned horses. The writing of his character, other than the scene between him and McDormand while they were sitting on the swings, was actually horrible.--Mildred burns the police station down, throwing 5 Molotov cocktails out of the still broken windows of the advertising agency across the street (not boarded up by then?). And the new Chief just accepts the explanation that she didn't do it because she was with James. No more investigation. Ho hum. Police station burned but oh well. And then a few scenes later, Dixon is apparently in the suppose to be burned down police station sitting there having a conversation with the new Chief.--Dixon is a complete jerk to the bone. He gets a letter postmortem from the now deceased Chief. Suddenly he's a good guy. Yeah right.I could go on and on with this but I'm afraid my word limit here is going to expire soon. I'll still give this film a 7 star rating because I DID enjoy watching it, but the writing here is really not all it's cracked up to be. It does feel like it's a big novel with a lot of twists, but in retrospect it's more like a parody of a big novel with a lot of twists, and the twists don't make a whole lot of sense.",beware p l ot holes near billboards,i will say that i enjoyed this film mostly due frances mcdormands performance it was surprisingly funny given its subject matter but after thinking about it few days after watching it i have say few words about writing because it seems everyone is raving about how oscar worthy writing here is at first glance i thought so too but thinking back it id have say writing is actually pretty sloppy theres lot stuff here that doesnt make whole lot sense i mean lot i cant explain this without revealing spoilers so be warned most strikingly deputy chief dixon violently attacks welby busts his face with his gun throws him out window proceeds kick him while hes down all eyes view new chief abercrombie sure he gets fired but not arrested not even sued as abercrombie he shows up morning after previous police chief died declares that they sent him as replacement they who is there some force outside ebbing that dictates who their police chief is that part really didnt make any sense me also replacing one main characters halfway through film character were starting get know with stereotype that we dont know anything about was rather odd someone lights billboards fire but apparently only paper them burns not old wood thats been sitting there decaying since 80s because they are able paste duplicate posters existing structures without any problems thats laughable that old wood would have been pile smoldering cinder mildred is portrayed as such tough ass assaulting dentist kicking children crotch with no repercussions i might add storming into police station spouting vulgarities but when shes confronted by guy who suggests hes actually one who killed her daughter she freezes seems helpless one might say fact that she didnt go psycho this scene is what makes this screenplay original but someone else like me might argue that its just out her character doesnt make lick sense chief willoughby some reason is old geezer but has young attractive australian wife he also has two young girls yet hes completely vulgar around them while instructing them about game fishing he invents he calls blanket they are sitting god dam blanked twice little four or five year old girls he says his wife later that its her turn clean horse hit out barn ok i actually have quite bit experience tending horses its not called hit its called manure you wouldnt even call it that youd just say clean barn if you really owned horses writing his character other than scene between him mcdormand while they were sitting swings was actually horrible mildred burns police station down throwing 5 molotov cocktails out still broken windows advertising agency across street not boarded up by then new chief just accepts explanation that she didnt do it because she was with james no more investigation ho hum police station burned but oh well then few scenes later dixon is apparently suppose be burned down police station sitting there having conversation with new chief dixon is complete jerk bone he gets letter postmortem now deceased chief suddenly hes good guy yeah right i could go with this but im afraid my word limit here is going expire soon ill still give this film 7 star rating because i did enjoy watching it but writing here is really not all its cracked up be it does feel like its big novel with lot twists but retrospect its more like parody big novel with lot twists twists dont make whole lot sense,0.45496494871494864,0.018661031161031173,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,"Extremely funny film about grief, anger, revenge and violence","It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters.

9.0,"A dark, twisted comedy about grief, tragedy and three billboards","Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.Three Billboards is a dark but also funny and heart-felt story about one woman's quest to get justice for her daughter's rape and murder. After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.The thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.The performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases.",dark twisted comedy about grief tragedy three billboards,having recently won peoples choice awards at tiff three billboards outside ebbing missouri is very easy see why it won three billboards is dark but also funny heart felt story about one womans quest get justice her daughters rape murder after mildred haynes buys three billboards with words written them accusing towns well liked sheriff having not found her daughters killer it sets series events that turns citizens cops against her thing i can say about three billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable one moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds dynamic between characters as pressure within town builds anger is pointed towards mildred we see many these characters evolve order deal with tragedy grief learn find peace movie goes through roller coaster emotions one moment you are laughing your butt off hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you gut with every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away because worlds unfairness injustice lesser hands mixture dark comedic tones would not work but director writer martin mcdonagh knows how balance them perfection performances here just through roof frances mcdormand delivers performance that will sure get her into lead actress awards race at oscars as mildred mcdormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line hate cynicism cursing towards everyone she feels doesnt truly understand internal pain she is going through but mcdormand does now then show soft side mildred it shows that mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way dealing with tragedy loosing her own child sam rockwell also gives one best performances his career as flawed very misguided cop dixon character dixon is short tempered volatile not bright with some baggage his own that locals accuse him but sam rockwell brings his charm sincerity what could be rather unlikable character latter half you see dixon go through tremendous arc learning care about others rather then just being angry towards them other great performances that should be called out are woody harrelson peter dinklage john hawk caleb landry jones three billboards outside ebbing missouri is easily one best movies this year is worth seeing once it comes out wide releases,0.5242545109211777,0.05451282051282051,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
4.0,Is this a masterpiece?,"Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? Three giant billboards THAT close to the road and THAT close together - I've driven all over the country and never saw that. Billboards in rural areas tend to be smaller and definitely not that close together for obvious reasons. WHO is this woman, Mildred? We know literally nothing about her beside the fact that her daughter was murdered. Eventually we find out she's divorced and has a son who lives with her, but if one is to care about the protagonist, character development is crucial. As it is, it's interesting to watch her do and say crazy stuff, but I couldn't care less about her.WHY is it, two male characters directly related to the protagonist have a girlfriend & wife 20+ years their junior? Do they live in a part of the country where such a thing is commonplace? What are the odds of that? Probably about the same as if your dentist won the lottery but then your mailman did also. Yes, possible, but very, very odd and distracting.Why does Willoughby's wife have an English accent? Was he in the military and met her while overseas? Is it common for a small town in Missouri to have British accented residents? If there was ANY character development, maybe we'd know these things. As it is, it's distracting and elicits questions that shouldn't have to be asked. $5000/month for three previously forgotten about, decrepit billboards on a road people don't use anymore? LOL. For someone who is supposed to be a savvy, tough, non-nonsense older lady with the wisdom of the Buddha, that's pretty dumb.A cop smashes office windows, assaults a man and throws him out a 2nd story window with no jail time. Really?! Why does Willoughby have fatal cancer? Seems as no more than a cheap device used to heap more disdain on Mildred. Yawn. Dixon ends up in the same hospital room as the man he assaulted? Is that supposed to be ironic? And again, what are the odds? Mildred firebombs the police station, nearly kills a cop, and then just says ""I didn't do it"" and that's the end of it?! Really? Some creepy stranger visits Mildred in her store and harasses her, THEN is overheard in a bar talking about committing a crime, maybe the crime in question, but alas even after Dixon cleverly retrieves dna from the guy, it turns out he's not even a local, and wasn't around when the crime occurred. Why then does the creepy guy know so much about the crime in question and WHY is he harassing Mildred!?!?!?! WHY?Then to top off ALL that nonsense, Dixon and Mildred decide to go murder the creepy guy anyway, LOL, how profound.",is this masterpiece,pretty cool cast interesting premise muddied by oddities implausibilities juvenile sense story is this film set world where crazy stuff happens as matter course or normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now then this film i see pretty normal people doing normal things having normal things happen them so why is it writer director chose litter what could have been very good film with so much bizarro bs with literally zero character development three giant billboards that close road that close together ive driven all over country never saw that billboards rural areas tend be smaller definitely not that close together obvious reasons who is this woman mildred we know literally nothing about her beside fact that her daughter was murdered eventually we find out shes divorced has son who lives with her but if one is care about protagonist character development is crucial as it is its interesting watch her do say crazy stuff but i couldnt care less about her why is it two male characters directly related protagonist have girlfriend wife 20 years their junior do they live part country where such thing is commonplace what are odds that probably about same as if your dentist won lottery but then your mailman did also yes possible but very very odd distracting why does willoughbys wife have english accent was he military met her while overseas is it common small town missouri have british accented residents if there was any character development maybe wed know these things as it is its distracting elicits questions that shouldnt have be asked 5000 month three previously forgotten about decrepit billboards road people dont use anymore lol someone who is supposed be savvy tough non nonsense older lady with wisdom buddha thats pretty dumb cop smashes office windows assaults man throws him out 2nd story window with no jail time really why does willoughby have fatal cancer seems as no more than cheap device used heap more disdain mildred yawn dixon ends up same hospital room as man he assaulted is that supposed be ironic again what are odds mildred firebombs police station nearly kills cop then just says i didnt do it thats end it really some creepy stranger visits mildred her store harasses her then is overheard bar talking about committing crime maybe crime question but alas even after dixon cleverly retrieves dna guy it turns out hes not even local wasnt around when crime occurred why then does creepy guy know so much about crime question why is he harassing mildred why then top off all that nonsense dixon mildred decide go murder creepy guy anyway lol how profound,0.5331388888888887,0.035819023569023584,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,A comedic masterpiece with a stellar leading performance from Frances McDormand.,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.Writer/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn't one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.Basically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that's coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. For the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. It seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you're laughing, it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.Also, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a cliché one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+.",comedic masterpiece with stellar leading performance frances mcdormand,three billboards outside ebbing missouri is dark comedy that has list cast with names like frances mcdormand woody harrelson sam rockwell john hawkes peter dinklage it centers around mildred hayes woman whose daughter was raped killed who believes that local police have not done enough about it reaction she erects three billboards outside her town that send message sheriff about state investigation writer director martin mcdonagh seven psychopaths bruges has outdone himself with this one my opinion if this isnt one top oscar contenders come awards season then hollywood has officially lost its mind basically everything about this film works acting writing direction mcdormand gives performance her career here giving us humor through all pain clearly shown her face rockwell also gives his best performance here as cop who isnt that bright is more than little racist three billboards outside ebbing missouri is probably most unpredictable film year thats coming year that includes films like baby driver logan there are scenes where you think that you know where plot is going but then midway through it completely flips script entire run time this film i was invested it has perfect run time it ends exactly when it needs there is not scene that feels out place it seems like one hardest things do film nowadays is balance comedy drama however this movie does it effortlessly each scene has just right amount comedy drama sometimes despite fact that youre laughing its easy forget that jokes are being made also message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after film finishes it makes you see good side humanity despite our flaws no character this film is clich one dimensional shell person everybody has reason being there which is more than some films recently have offered three billboards outside ebbing missouri is easily one best most enjoyable films 2017 it will make you laugh cry think all one sitting there are not any clear flaws with this film that i can find but i am still searching i give three billboards outside ebbing missouri,0.41697278911564634,0.2668061224489796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Inconsolable grief,"It's ironic that the first of Frances McDormand's Oscars came for her portrayal of a sheriff in Fargo. For her second one she plays the antagonist to a sheriff she feels isn't doing her job. The sheriff is a most popular individual in the town, Woody Harrelson. But this is a woman with a mission.None of the people in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri are of any kind of heroic stature. They're just I suspect as ordinary as any of us with our good points and bad. One of them, Deputy Sam Rockwell is one unapologetic racist who uses his badge to harass and assault folks of a different skin tone. He's McDormand's greatest antagonist and in the end the two come to an interesting relationship.McDormand is a mother who just can't accept the loss of her daughter. I'm the son of one who never got over the loss of her daughter. But my sister died of natural causes, McDormand's teen daughter went out one night against parental advice and was raped and murdered.That was months ago and there's no accepting her loss for McDormand. She got her Best Actress Oscar not just for words spoken, but for some incredible body language and facial expressions. Her rage at what she sees is the lack of interest by law enforcement will not be abated.So what she has done is out of whatever money she has scraped up together is pay for three large billboards outside the main thoroughfare of the town of Ebbing, Missouri calling attention to the lack of progress on her daugher's homicide and getting personal with Chief Woody Harrelson. Harrelson in turn has some personal problems of a serious nature which the town knows about and the sympathy that McDormand might have had is turning to resentment toward her.Her grief isn't the only thing that has turned McDormand into the unpleasant creature she is. Her husband John Hawkes who seems to be no great prize himself left her for a 19 year old chippie. Her son Lucas Hedges is also feeling alienated from both parents.There's no such place as Ebbing, Missouri but the uniformly fine ensemble of players sure makes you think you're in mid country America looking in on a place that's a cross between Grover's Corner in Our Town and Winesburg, Ohio in the 21st century. Of course the cast is topped by Oscar winners Frances McDormand for Best Actress and Sam Rockwell for Best Supporting Actor. Woody Harrelson also got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and the film was nominated in a bunch of other categories including Best Picture.See this one by all means.",inconsolable grief,its ironic that first frances mcdormands oscars came her portrayal sheriff fargo her second one she plays antagonist sheriff she feels isnt doing her job sheriff is most popular individual town woody harrelson but this is woman with mission none people three billboards outside ebbing missouri are any kind heroic stature theyre just i suspect as ordinary as any us with our good points bad one them deputy sam rockwell is one unapologetic racist who uses his badge harass assault folks different skin tone hes mcdormands greatest antagonist end two come interesting relationship mcdormand is mother who just cant accept loss her daughter im son one who never got over loss her daughter but my sister died natural causes mcdormands teen daughter went out one night against parental advice was raped murdered that was months ago theres no accepting her loss mcdormand she got her best actress oscar not just words spoken but some incredible body language facial expressions her rage at what she sees is lack interest by law enforcement will not be abated so what she has done is out whatever money she has scraped up together is pay three large billboards outside main thoroughfare town ebbing missouri calling attention lack progress her daughers homicide getting personal with chief woody harrelson harrelson turn has some personal problems serious nature which town knows about sympathy that mcdormand might have had is turning resentment toward her her grief isnt only thing that has turned mcdormand into unpleasant creature she is her husband john hawkes who seems be no great prize himself left her 19 year old chippie her son lucas hedges is also feeling alienated both parents theres no such place as ebbing missouri but uniformly fine ensemble players sure makes you think youre mid country america looking place thats cross between grovers corner our town winesburg ohio 21st century course cast is topped by oscar winners frances mcdormand best actress sam rockwell best supporting actor woody harrelson also got oscar nomination best supporting actor film was nominated bunch other categories including best picture see this one by all means,0.4280969634230504,0.19324534161490686,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

6.0,so many issues,"In the town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents three billboards on an isolated road to berate police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) for his failure to find her daughter's killer. Willoughby is actually dying from cancer and the town ostracizes her. Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is a volatile racist deputy living with his overbearing mother.British Irish filmmaker Martin McDonagh tackles Americana. He has incorporated plenty of American issues but it's done as an outsider looking in. I wonder if Rockwell starts his performing with an American director, he wouldn't be told to take it a different way. His action in the middle of the movie is absolutely crazy. The aftermath needs more expanding rather than a simple firing. I can't believe that he's not locked up. Then his character takes a 180 turn as the movie climaxes. He leaves the movie a two dimensional billboard rather than a fully formed human character. I am much more impressed with Mildred, Willoughby, and their connection. McDormand delivers a driven character of the first order and Harrelson is more human in his reservation. There is real power behind their performances whereas Rockwell is doing a cartoon. I am surprised at its critical love. Some of this is funny and there are plenty of intriguing characters. The issues are so important that I can't take this as satire.

3.0,"Overrated quirk-fest from playwright turned screenwriter, seeks redemption for vigilantes","Combine the quirky characters of the master of quirk, Wes Anderson, and sensibility of adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director Quentin Tarantino, and what do you end up with? The year's most overrated ""black comedy,"" Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the work of playwright by trade, Martin McDonagh, who's been quoted as saying that he prefers writing for film over theater (why couldn't he stick with the stage if that's his primary area of expertise?).McDonagh's strategy is to appeal to both liberals and conservatives but in the end he remains squarely in the liberal camp. He serves up absurd characters that appeal to the baser elements in our culture but infuses them with ""hearts of gold"" so they appear to straddle both liberal and reactionary fences, but actually exist in none.Take for example his main character, Mildred Hayes (played by a haggard-looking, one-note Frances McDormand) who puts up the three billboards outside of town, frustrated by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his small town police department's inability to catch the man who murdered her daughter seven months earlier. The foul-mouthed Hayes functions outside the law and McDonagh throws a bone to reactionaries, asking us to approve of Hayes' desire for revenge and endorsement of vigilantism.McDonagh's other rebel is Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a racist who tries to top Hayes in her quest to be the top-rated anti-social misfit in town. First he arrests Hayes' co- worker pal Denise on trumped up marijuana possession charges and after he learns of Sheriff Willoughby's suicide following the revelation of a cancer diagnosis, he goes after Red (the man responsible for renting the billboards to Hayes) and throws him out a second floor window (instead of arresting him, the new black police chief merely fires him! What's up with that?).Just like Hayes, Dixon finds a scapegoat to assuage his guilt over Sheriff's Willoughby's death. When Hayes finds her billboards ablaze, she naturally pins the blame on Dixon and firebombs police headquarters. It's at this point that McDonagh rather simplistically attempts to redeem his protagonists. The saintly, all- knowing Willoughby, in a letter he leaves for Dixon after his death, reassures the errant former officer that he's not such a bad guy after all, provided that he gives up his bigoted ways.After Dixon survives the firebombing at the police station where he went to read Willoughby's letter, he decides to help Hayes after overhearing a potential suspect who might have killed her daughter. During a fight with the suspect in the bar, he manages to obtain the man's DNA. In an original plot twist, the DNA does not match and the potential murderer is ruled out as a suspect in Hayes' daughter's death.With Hayes apologizing to Dixon for the firebombing of the police station (she escapes being charged aided by an alibi from a dwarf who lives in town), the two vigilantes make their way to Idaho to seek revenge on the now ruled out suspect in Hayes' daughter's death, as they are convinced he's guilty of other crimes of rape, and deserves punishment.McDonagh, however, is uneasy with the idea that Hayes and Dixon would actually go through with their extra-judicial act-so he throws in a caveat. As they're talking to one another in the car, it's probably the unheard voice of the goodly Sheriff Willoughby which is still in the air. Hayes and Dixon express doubts about actually going through with the plan-the implication of course is that they will not engage in another act of violence-that they in fact have ""learned their lesson,"" and now are ready to act as law-abiding citizens.It might be reassuring to a liberal audience that the bad guys suddenly become ""good""-that there is a measure of redemption for the two who have become unhinged by the deaths of people close to them. In reality, vigilantes remain vigilantes, and such reversals in outlook are highly unlikely. But even if one accepts the improbable Deus ex machina, McDonagh's willingness to excuse all the prior bad conduct, suggests a crack in the screenwriter's moral compass.Ultimately, McDonagh wants his quirk-fest both ways. He revels in the bad acts of vigilantism, appealing to the aforementioned ""baser instincts""; but offers up redemption for his bad actors, in the form of a martyred lawman, who like a saint from above, offers words of wisdom for the ages.",overrated quirk fest playwright turned screenwriter seeks redemption vigilantes,combine quirky characters master quirk wes anderson sensibility adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director quentin tarantino what do you end up with years most overrated black comedy three billboards outside ebbing missouri its work playwright by trade martin mcdonagh whos been quoted as saying that he prefers writing film over theater why couldnt he stick with stage if thats his primary area expertise mcdonaghs strategy is appeal both liberals conservatives but end he remains squarely liberal camp he serves up absurd characters that appeal baser elements our culture but infuses them with hearts gold so they appear straddle both liberal reactionary fences but actually exist none take example his main character mildred hayes played by haggard looking one note frances mcdormand who puts up three billboards outside town frustrated by sheriff willoughby woody harrelson his small town police departments inability catch man who murdered her daughter seven months earlier foul mouthed hayes functions outside law mcdonagh throws bone reactionaries asking us approve hayes desire revenge endorsement vigilantism mcdonaghs other rebel is officer jason dixon sam rockwell racist who tries top hayes her quest be top rated anti social misfit town first he arrests hayes co worker pal denise trumped up marijuana possession charges after he learns sheriff willoughbys suicide following revelation cancer diagnosis he goes after red man responsible renting billboards hayes throws him out second floor window instead arresting him new black police chief merely fires him whats up with that just like hayes dixon finds scapegoat assuage his guilt over sheriffs willoughbys death when hayes finds her billboards ablaze she naturally pins blame dixon firebombs police headquarters its at this point that mcdonagh rather simplistically attempts redeem his protagonists saintly all knowing willoughby letter he leaves dixon after his death reassures errant former officer that hes not such bad guy after all provided that he gives up his bigoted ways after dixon survives firebombing at police station where he went read willoughbys letter he decides help hayes after overhearing potential suspect who might have killed her daughter during fight with suspect bar he manages obtain mans dna original plot twist dna does not match potential murderer is ruled out as suspect hayes daughters death with hayes apologizing dixon firebombing police station she escapes being charged aided by alibi dwarf who lives town two vigilantes make their way idaho seek revenge now ruled out suspect hayes daughters death as they are convinced hes guilty other crimes rape deserves punishment mcdonagh however is uneasy with idea that hayes dixon would actually go through with their extra judicial act so he throws caveat as theyre talking one another car its probably unheard voice goodly sheriff willoughby which is still air hayes dixon express doubts about actually going through with plan implication course is that they will not engage another act violence that they fact have learned their lesson now are ready act as law abiding citizens it might be reassuring liberal audience that bad guys suddenly become good that there is measure redemption two who have become unhinged by deaths people close them reality vigilantes remain vigilantes such reversals outlook are highly unlikely but even if one accepts improbable deus ex machina mcdonaghs willingness excuse all prior bad conduct suggests crack screenwriters moral compass ultimately mcdonagh wants his quirk fest both ways he revels bad acts vigilantism appealing aforementioned baser instincts but offers up redemption his bad actors form martyred lawman who like saint above offers words wisdom ages,0.39301489470981016,-0.02918592706728298,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.44}"
7.0,Deceptive Ending Without a Conclusion,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a great crime movie in an environment of grief, anger, remorse, racism, violence, sympathy and a sophisticated black-humor. The performances are top-notch and it is hard to point out only one or two names in the cast, indeed a constellation of stars. Maybe the performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell may be highlighted since they are the lead. Unfortunatelly the deceptive ending without a conclusion throws cold water in this film. The redemption of Dixon finding the rapist killer would have given some hope to the story. But the author decided to keep a dark ending without conclusion. Claude Chabrol was a master in mystery films with open end; however his conclusion were subtle and ambiguous, giving the chance to the audience to discuss possibilities based on his or her interpretation of the storyline.

7.0,"Oscar-worthy performances, uneven movie","I'll say this: I very much enjoyed seeing """"Three Billboards"" and would recommend it to anyone that asks, but it's because of the talent involved onscreen. Everyone in the main cast is incredible and these players help keep the movie going when the story falters. McDormand, for her part, is a force of nature, and years' worth of this character's pain and unflagging determination reside on the actor's face; the smolder in her gaze does plenty of talking. It's why the first half of the movie is exhilarating. Tonally, it's a bit off, with that excitement waning at around the halfway point (almost precisely with the death of a major character) as sorrow and brutality take over. Sadly, we never get that opening power back, and this feeds into a complicated ending. But one thing I really liked about this movie is that it does become about more than McDormand's grieving and turns into a small-town drama; and empathy comes from the most unexpected of characters. Despite any of these issues, it's highly worthwhile and I doubt I'll forget about this anytime soon.7/10",oscar worthy performances uneven movie,ill say this i very much enjoyed seeing three billboards would recommend it anyone that asks but its because talent involved onscreen everyone main cast is incredible these players help keep movie going when story falters mcdormand her part is force nature years worth this characters pain unflagging determination reside actors face smolder her gaze does plenty talking its why first half movie is exhilarating tonally its bit off with that excitement waning at around halfway point almost precisely with death major character as sorrow brutality take over sadly we never get that opening power back this feeds into complicated ending but one thing i really liked about this movie is that it does become about more than mcdormands grieving turns into small town drama empathy comes most unexpected characters despite any these issues its highly worthwhile i doubt ill forget about this anytime soon 7 10,0.6196969696969697,0.17935606060606057,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.42}"
4.0,The best way to express your grief is by committing multiple felonies.,"First, let's all just accept the premise that police beat up random black people for no reason whatsoever. Also, police are inept, because they can't find someone to arrest for the murder and rape of your daughter, even though there is zero forensic evidence. Next let's take a moment to reflect on the time you told your daughter ""I hope you get raped on the way too"". Now it's time to start lashing out at the world because you are angry. Start by committing 2 felonies against a dentist. It's also a good idea to go into a police station and tell them what horrible people they are. When your signs get set on fire, climb onto one of the burning signs and stand at the top of the flames. Next, fire-bomb a police station, because you are still mad, even though there is still no evidence or suspects. Finally, if you can't find the actual person who committed the crime, instead go murder a complete stranger on a hunch. This is all very profound and heart-wrenching...can't you tell by the music?The police chief isn't so bad though, because he has cancer and is spitting up blood. He thinks it's best to leave the hospital, because what do doctors know about dealing with cancer. He doesn't want his wife and kid's final memories of him to be slowly dying in a hospital, so instead their final memories will be of him blowing his own brains out in the barn. Thankfully, a streetwise black police chief came in to take over for the inept and racist white police officers. Now things will finally get done.",best way express your grief is by committing multiple felonies,first lets all just accept premise that police beat up random black people no reason whatsoever also police are inept because they cant find someone arrest murder rape your daughter even though there is zero forensic evidence next lets take moment reflect time you told your daughter i hope you get raped way too now its time start lashing out at world because you are angry start by committing 2 felonies against dentist its also good idea go into police station tell them what horrible people they are when your signs get set fire climb onto one burning signs stand at top flames next fire bomb police station because you are still mad even though there is still no evidence or suspects finally if you cant find actual person who committed crime instead go murder complete stranger hunch this is all very profound heart wrenching cant you tell by music police chief isnt so bad though because he has cancer is spitting up blood he thinks its best leave hospital because what do doctors know about dealing with cancer he doesnt want his wife kids final memories him be slowly dying hospital so instead their final memories will be him blowing his own brains out barn thankfully streetwise black police chief came take over inept racist white police officers now things will finally get done,0.5246913580246914,-0.020370370370370365,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"

,3 Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri - Sells Little At All,"Lately, when many people see Awards being dished out to movies they begin to think twice about their worth, in much the same way as when advertisers spend up BIG to tell us their latest product is the BEST on the market - you can often expect a cop-out. With Francis McDormand heading up the cast you might expect the Cohen Bros may have been somewhere in the wings to push it along - in fact, this work offers many of the depressing earmarks of some lesser Cohen productions (maybe that's partly why the Academy selected it?) The overly sensationalistic mix contains all the ingredients that one could cram into a plot filled with a continuous succession of near impossible coincidences (not to mention some perverse PC agenda pushing) With little or no character development and too many stretched situations - we are taken through a series of shocking actions that would land anyone committing just half of them, in jail or would have the local community after the perpetuator's blood! - but no, our 'hero 'Francis violently assaults school kids, dentists, and near anyone she feels like with few saying little more than boo. And for those who attempt to excuse this as ""black humour"" - the 'humour' is just so 'simplistically' dark as to be virtually invisible.The local police (an unconvincing bunch of simplistic stereotypes) bash people near to death in broad daylight, and this is all taken as just another day in a town where every inhabitant tends to be on the edge of a mental meltdown. There's almost no-one the viewer can emotionally identify with or support - unless they too, are on the loopy side of Mental Health Denial. Add to the above, a lazy writer determined to create a swear fest - where all the foulest of outright mean language is paraded - in an attempt to out-shock any that's gone before. This is juvenile trendiness in the extreme.Viewers bright enough to see beyond a manipulative piece of exploitation - may see this rather pretentiously overrated concoction for what it is. While it attracted a lot of people to the ticket box, it's obvious from the Huge amount of viewer feedback - published on IMDb, etc; many of these audiences were bitterly disappointed and would like both their time and money back. And, lets not even get started on the pathetic ending.The end credits thank the local inhabitants for their co-operation but, I somehow doubt many would welcome them back - given the image painted of them!

9.0,"Rich in story, full of unconventional characters","No violence and blockbuster action, no definite forms or results of the crime, no division of a hero and a villain.. just pure power of the story, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is a smart crime movie. It contains many important events, stories, and messages, and not a single one is obscure or overly complex. Angela Hayes' murder, police's incompetence, domestic violence from her husband, and public getting tired from her constant request to find out the assaulter, Mildred has to fight against all the odds. Frances McDormand portrays a strong but painful mother with masterpiece performance. Her strength is not viewed as headstrongness, and her challenges against public force is not viewed as violent or irrational. The movie keeps the balance so audience can support the protagonist till the end where she drives to Idaho. Willoughby and Dixon.. They are the characters hard to hate. I love the fact that they are not described as evils but flawed human beings. Dixon is violent, authoritative, and discriminatory, but the movie provides the backstory and his point of view. It would be so much easier for the director to just sort characters into good or bad and stay in the box. However, McDonagh respects each character to have charms and flaws, so he or she is more truthful and realistic.",rich story full unconventional characters,no violence blockbuster action no definite forms or results crime no division hero villain just pure power story three billboards outside ebbing missouri is smart crime movie it contains many important events stories messages not single one is obscure or overly complex angela hayes murder polices incompetence domestic violence her husband public getting tired her constant request find out assaulter mildred has fight against all odds frances mcdormand portrays strong but painful mother with masterpiece performance her strength is not viewed as headstrongness her challenges against public force is not viewed as violent or irrational movie keeps balance so audience can support protagonist till end where she drives idaho willoughby dixon they are characters hard hate i love fact that they are not described as evils but flawed human beings dixon is violent authoritative discriminatory but movie provides backstory his point view it would be so much easier director just sort characters into good or bad stay box however mcdonagh respects each character have charms flaws so he or she is more truthful realistic,0.5140252976190475,0.006175595238095224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,"'All this anger, man, it just begets greater anger.'","Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement. The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred's son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother's foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the 'town midget' whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn't a weak member in this extraordinary cast.

1.0,Ebbing away,"I'm not much of a fan of the whole Coen Brothers non-linear method of film making I have to say and identified quite early on that this particular movie fell squarely into whatever category that might be. I guess I should have known from the offbeat title and cast that things would go every which way but loose and so it proves.The initial idea of angry mother Frances McDormand broadcasting her frustration at her local police division by paying for three adjacent billboards to highlight their inaction over the unsolved rape and murder of her daughter some seven months previously might have worked in my view, not least as a whodunit, but was soon swamped by the introduction of several unusual characters and as many unlikely situations.So we're introduced soon enough to Woody Harrelson's terminally ill chief of police who McDormand's character names and shames on the billboards, Sam Rockwell as his mother-fixated, redneck deputy, with many more minor characters too numerous to mention, like the dwarf who alibis MacDormand at an important moment in the story, her abusive ex-husband now dating a 19 year old pretty bimbo and the new black chief of police who takes over Harrelson's job and whose first action is to overlook Rockwell's near-murder of the homosexual young owner of the billboard company with whom it's fair to say, he doesn't see eye to eye.The movie is a succession of tangential plot shifts and unbelievable coincidence. No doubt the writer - director was presenting us with themes of forgiveness, redemption and guilt set in the backward-thinking, crazy-quilt Deep South just to double underline these issues and make the viewer think deeply about all this serious existential stuff y'all.Sorry, but I didn't buy any of it. The acting didn't impress me much either, and that includes McDormand's Oscar-winning turn. In the end, for me, it was just another of those eccentric, eclectic films that tries to implant what it thinks are memorable images or extraordinary characters into the viewer's consciousness and by its exaggeration and distortion somehow mirror society in some profound way. All I got from it in the end was a mixed sense of manipulation, confusion and cynicism and how easy it is to put a movie like this together and call it art.Sorry, not for me and you can broadcast that on any billboard you care to mention.",ebbing away,im not much fan whole coen brothers non linear method film making i have say identified quite early that this particular movie fell squarely into whatever category that might be i guess i should have known offbeat title cast that things would go every which way but loose so it proves initial idea angry mother frances mcdormand broadcasting her frustration at her local police division by paying three adjacent billboards highlight their inaction over unsolved rape murder her daughter some seven months previously might have worked my view not least as whodunit but was soon swamped by introduction several unusual characters as many unlikely situations so were introduced soon enough woody harrelsons terminally ill chief police who mcdormands character names shames billboards sam rockwell as his mother fixated redneck deputy with many more minor characters too numerous mention like dwarf who alibis macdormand at important moment story her abusive ex husband now dating 19 year old pretty bimbo new black chief police who takes over harrelsons job whose first action is overlook rockwells near murder homosexual young owner billboard company with whom its fair say he doesnt see eye eye movie is succession tangential plot shifts unbelievable coincidence no doubt writer director was presenting us with themes forgiveness redemption guilt set backward thinking crazy quilt deep south just double underline these issues make viewer think deeply about all this serious existential stuff yall sorry but i didnt buy any it acting didnt impress me much either that includes mcdormands oscar winning turn end me it was just another those eccentric eclectic films that tries implant what it thinks are memorable images or extraordinary characters into viewers consciousness by its exaggeration distortion somehow mirror society some profound way all i got it end was mixed sense manipulation confusion cynicism how easy it is put movie like this together call it art sorry not me you can broadcast that any billboard you care mention,0.5058088578088578,0.03918881118881119,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.38}"
