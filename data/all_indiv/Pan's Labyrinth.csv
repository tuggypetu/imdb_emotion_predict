10.0,Stop the Abuse,"An incredibly creative piece of cinema. It incorporates an amazing fantasy world with the realities of war. It gives its protagonist a way of surviving and continuing on with a life after she could have lost everything. The visuality is striking, creating a world like we've never seen. There is an amazing use of computer generated images. Everything in this film is in balance as it shifts between fantasy and the horrors of the civil war under Franco. Del Torro is a director of the first order. If you don't like him, try to realize that he takes chances and there are always naysayers out there who want to tear down that creativity. Imagine Stravinsky stopping after ""The Rite of Spring"" because the Philistines who are stuck in the past couldn't give it its due or at least have some optimism.",stop abuse,incredibly creative piece cinema it incorporates amazing fantasy world with realities war it gives its protagonist way surviving continuing with life after she could have lost everything visuality is striking creating world like weve never seen there is amazing use computer generated images everything this film is balance as it shifts between fantasy horrors civil war under franco del torro is director first order if you dont like him try realize that he takes chances there are always naysayers out there who want tear down that creativity imagine stravinsky stopping after rite spring because philistines who are stuck past couldnt give it its due or at least have some optimism,0.6052469135802468,0.1799382716049383,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,"A fey, beautiful and dark masterpiece","Set during Franco's mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale that, in a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents.This film is definitely not for young children. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero).Uncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan's Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.Apparently Pan's Labyrinth won a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes, when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film's magical dreamworld that haven't been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film's depiction of the Civil War that can't be read in Satre or Orwell; can't be viewed in Picasso's Guernica; or can't be watched in Land and Freedom.For all the evident truth of these observations, to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan's Labyrinth, which doesn't lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan's Labyrinth in a way that most won't watch Land and Freedom. In doing so, they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them: a dangerous world, where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death Â– a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet, part in terror, part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I've seen.The only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency (particularly at the end) for a Narnia-like moralism, and the fact that the faun is, perhaps, is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable, though. This is easily the best film I've seen this year, and a must see on the big screen.",fey beautiful dark masterpiece,set during francos mopping up exercise after spanish civil war guillermo del toros pans labyrinth is wonderful dark fairy tale that metaphor spain itself teeters edge nightmare dreamscapes corruption violence death innocents this film is definitely not young children although fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised are fairy tales truest sense that they are dark fey dangerous violent most story about three quarters it fact exists outside dreamland even more frightening sometimes shockingly violent world real life struggle ideas ideology sergi lopez is excellent as brutal possibly sadistic falangist captain tasked with routing out remaining leftists woods hills northern spain into this precarious situation come his new wife widow former marriage who is carrying his son his stepdaughter ofelia played absolute perfection by then 11 year old ivana baquero uncomfortable with her new surroundings suspicious her stepfather desperately concerned about worsening condition her mother ofelia uncovers strange alternative world chance escape forever pain uncertainty her everyday life thus film alternates between world civil war spain increasingly bizarre dark frightening world pans labyrinth as twin plots progress they intertwine with tasks ofelia becoming choices faced by spain at crossroads poignancy film lies partly fact that victories child are reflected so starkly by failures adult world apparently pans labyrinth won 20 minute standing ovation at cannes when it was shown this may be little bit over top i suspect when furore has died down some will choose swing pendulum back criticise it its more obvious faults much film is derivative there are few ideas films magical dreamworld that havent been seen before there are also few ideas films depiction civil war that cant be read satre or orwell cant be viewed picassos guernica or cant be watched land freedom all evident truth these observations accept them would be entirely miss majesty pans labyrinth which doesnt lie its originality but its absolute mastery execution people will watch pans labyrinth way that most wont watch land freedom doing so they will also discover world fairy tales which existed before disney sunk its claws into them dangerous world where nothing is as it seems every step is possible death place which may leave even adults shivering under duvet part terror part wonder all this backed up by finest cinematography ive seen only real faults i am prepared allow this film is slight tendency particularly at end narnia like moralism fact that faun is perhaps is not quite wild enough these are eminently forgivable though this is easily best film ive seen this year must see big screen,0.5520844033555898,0.04499443588426639,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.51}"
10.0,Just magical,"I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",just magical,i saw film at frightfest london couple days ago was pretty well sure id be seeing something special but i ended up seeing film that is downright extraordinary brutal but beautiful magical yet earthy it has remarkable cast with standout performances all round special mention must go sergi lopez whose captain vidal is indeed one most sadistic film creations ever seen yet he manages make audience understand why he is way he is astounding performance maribel verdus quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one strongest female roles ive seen many year she is supported by wealth talent young ivana baquero is surprisingly self assured as 12 year old ofelia i especially liked her almost alice like approach magical creatures she encounters labyrinth icing this warped fairy tale is doug jones who gives towering performance this case literally as well as figuratively as guardian labyrinth faun full grace charm latent menace although dubbed his spanish is perfect jones speaks not word language his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases cajoles harries ofelia fulfil her tasks he also plays devastatingly creepy disgusting pale man creature that almost equals vidal his terrorising habits but cast is just one facet this gloriously photographed film with javier navarretes hauntingly simple score weaving itself into fabric film perfectly edited written brutality post civil war spain contrasts with world magic which ofelia is drawn yet everywhere she goes she has choices make fact film is about choices good bad one discovers that no matter how desperate situation becomes choice is always available although that choice may mean ones death film is violent very violent but each moment brutality although graphic has purpose nowhere is it gratuitous i loved it as i knew i would if oscar voters dont give this film at least nod best foreign language film next year then i will know that they have lost any sense reason or comprehension because this film is truly masterpiece del toros greatest work date,0.6643456602499156,0.1750025329280649,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,A masterpiece,"1944. Franco's authoritarian fascist regime is a horrid world for a child, barely into her teens. Ofelia retreats into herself, finding in her fantasy world the lessons of courage, self-discipline and integrity she will need. With her, we travel beyond outward appearances, through a labyrinth of fears and uncertainties, from which Spain will not escape for several decades.A dark, brutal fairytale, chillingly set in the real world but full of hope and warmth, Pan's Labyrinth accomplishes a masterpiece.Our film opens with a momentary shot of Ofelia, blood from a nosebleed disappearing as the frames are introduced in reverse. A voice-over takes us back to the time of the Spanish Civil War. Ofelia arrives (with her pregnant mother) at a nationalist military base in the woods and is introduced to her stepfather, a vicious commanding officer. CapitÃ¡n Vidal dispenses arbitrary justice to anyone he suspects is against him. Two suspected rebels caught by his men are summarily executed. Only afterwards is a rabbit discovered in their bag, proving their claim that they are just woodsmen (and maybe also a throwaway reference to Alice in Wonderland). Ofelia is unwilling to accept this harsh adult world. She retreats into a labyrinth where she meets a strange Pan-like creatures, Fauno, who gives her a set of tasks where she has to face some of her darkest fears, winning a key for her next task. The story becomes more intense, both outside the labyrinth (where Vidal is busy torturing people) and inside, where Ofelia has to face the Pale Man - a creature that has plucked out its eyes and can only see by placing them in the stigmata on its hands. Around the walls of the room are pictures of people being cast into hell by the Pale Man (From inference or the director's comments, it is apparent that the Pale Man represents authoritarianism, whether that of the Fascists or the Church). In Pan's Labyrinth we have a parable about the journey of Spanish society from the 1940s to post-Franco, a magical fairytale of stunning beauty, a story of the struggle and character development of a child on the edge of puberty, and a tense story of battles between Nationalists and Republicans. That they are all welded together seamlessly and precisely in a multi-level narrative is a remarkable achievement and thrilling experience. The sheer artistry recalls Cocteau's La Belle at la BÃªte. Del Toro sweeps us into a dreamlike, poetic vision, with a minimum of CGI and a grasp of dialogue that seems almost transcendental. In a brave decision, an actor (Ivana Baquero) who is only as old as her character has been used to play the young Ofelia. But as the ethereal figure between two worlds, she is also there to cast the earthy characters involved in material battles into more visceral contrast. Editing is crisp throughout, without a single frame wasted. Rich colours and unflinching camera-work keep us rooted in the experience, whether it is Ofelia crawling face-down in the mud and covered with insects, or a hapless victim having his nose smashed in by the CapitÃ¡n. Yet scenes of tenderness and beauty are equally as moving - Ofelia retreating into her mother's arms, a nursemaid powerless to help her republican lover, or a doctor performing an act of mercy.The movies, like our dreams, folklore and imagination, are rich with symbols and images that can strike a chord in our deepest being. Artists, as well as creators of myths and religion, have long employed such symbols to guide and inspire, knowing that the conscious mind may accept a sign more easily than rational argument alone.In watching a movie, we combine ideas of the real, the imaginary and the symbolic to find an inner affinity. And, if the filmmaker has done his job properly, will feel truly moved.One of the things that can make or break a movie that makes extensive use of symbols is whether those symbols echo in the collective unconscious, often through time honoured association, or not. Knowledge of mythology or Jungian psychology can make all the difference. Much has been made of the title. Originally 'El Laberinto del Fauno', the translation at first appears sloppy, but Del Toro has done his research well. While quipping that it 'just sounded better', a little investigation of classical authorities shows Faunus as a form of the ancient god Pan (Lempriere). Pan, the goat-like god that represents a totality of possibilities, together with goat-like stubbornness and independence of thought, is the perfect symbol. In the film he says, ""I've had so many names... I am the mountain, the forest and the earth. . . . I am a faun. Your most humble servant, Your Highness."" In Greek Mythology, Pan also won the affections of a princess under the form of a goat. The freedom of thought (and sexuality) he advocated, with the rise of Christianity, caused him to be portrayed as the Devil; but we learn his intentions are good, whereas the holy-looking Pale Man offers temptation only as an excuse to rip his victims apart. As an aspect of the creative power, fauns in mythology also symbolise firm aspiration and human intelligence.The one symbol that Del Torro is less adept in using is that of dying. He tends to use the valid, if flawed connotation of redemption-through-death promoted by the religions he disavows, but it is a small point that in no way spoils the story.Pan's Labyrinth leads us through parallel stories and themes without once losing its internal consistency. Some audiences may be put off by the idea of using flights of fancy in such a blatant way or, sadly, by the fact that it is subtitled. Such minor monsters should not get in the way of enjoying the film on a simple entertainment level. Cinephiles, on the other hand, will not want to miss such a rare treat of talent.",masterpiece,1944 francos authoritarian fascist regime is horrid world child barely into her teens ofelia retreats

10.0,In Depth Analysis of Interpretations,"Sixth viewing: My appreciation only grows. Interpretations-1st interpretation: Ophelia's world is real- happy ending.If this interpretation is valid, we deal with themes of war and disobedience. Here, Pan's Labyrinth serves as an allegory against the totalitarian regime of Fascist Spain, symbolized by Vidal. Vidal is represented in the fantasy storyline by the Pale Man; they both sit at the end of the table at the feasts, and they are both violent and cruel. Furthermore, the Pale Man is an allegory to ""Saturn Devouring his Son"" by Fransisco Goya, as both Cronus and the Pale Man eat the heads off of their victims first. If Cronus represents the Pale Man, and the Pale Man represents Vidal, and Vidal represents Fascist Spain, Del Toro implies that Fascist Spain is just as cruel as Cronus; like how Cronus devours his own sons, Fascist Spain kills their own people.2nd interpretation: Ophelia's world is her imagination- tragic ending (or is it? Some might say that she was better off dead than having to live with her terrible hardships).If this interpretation is valid, we deal with themes of self-deception and how reality and fantasy can coexist. Here, Pan's Labyrinth explores how Ophelia creates a fantasy for herself to deal with the harsh realities of war. In this case, we can interpret the final fantasy sequence as Ophelia's imagination, her creation and the world she wished to live. Besides, you can tell she is still alive, as Del Toro shows her lips quiver right after the fantasy sequence.Observations-*The film features many smooth cuts, which Del Toro hides with trees and black screens. This could imply how reality and fantasy intertwine, supporting the second interpretation. BUT smooth cuts never go from fantasy to reality or reality to fantasy, only fantasy to fantasy or reality to reality. This could suggest the first interpretation, where reality and fantasy are separate.*Vidal sees the monster under the bed, which supports the 1st interpretation. Yet at the same time, he does not see the faun at the end, which supports the 2nd interpretation. But again, Vidal has just consumed some kind of poison, so it may be his hallucinations in which he does not see the faun.*Del Toro never cuts away from the violence, emphasizing the brutality of war.*Cinematography is magnificent- dark, gloomy, blue colors in reality sequences to depict its dreariness, while bright, vibrant reds and oranges to depict enthusiasm. In the final scenes, the reds of blood and explosions stand out because the blues have become so common with the eye. Del Toro consciously had the blood and explosions to stand out to emphasize the violence of war.*Notice how Del Toro establishes tension between Ophelia and Vidal; When Ophelia shakes with the wrong hand, Vidal points it out, forming an uneasy tone between them. This first encounter between the two main characters in their respective storylines is vital for their relationship in the future scenes, especially the climax.Bottom line is, both interpretations are valid, and Del Toro utilizes both of them to deliver both of their respective themes.As magnificent as this film is, there may be authenticity flaws. For example, why didn't Mercedes kill Vidal after she escaped? Is she still obedient to Vidal? Then why did he directly disobey his order at the end when Vidal asked to tell his son the time of his death? For me, it's clear why Del Toro left these authenticity flaws: to drive the story forward. Attempting to patch these flaws would've been at the expense of pacing, and the audience's engagement is more important than plot holes.After all, these flaws are more or less hidden; visible only to those who know where to look.",depth analysis interpretations,sixth viewing my appreciation only grows interpretations 1st interpretation ophelias world is real happy ending if this interpretation is valid we deal with themes war disobedience here pans labyrinth serves as allegory against totalitarian regime fascist spain symbolized by vidal vidal is represented fantasy storyline by pale man they both sit at end table at feasts they are both violent cruel furthermore pale man is allegory saturn devouring his son by fransisco goya as both cronus pale man eat heads off their victims first if cronus represents pale man pale man represents vidal vidal represents fascist spain del toro implies that fascist spain is just as cruel as cronus like how cronus devours his own sons fascist spain kills their own people 2nd interpretation ophelias world is her imagination tragic ending or is it some might say that she was better off dead than having live with her terrible hardships if this interpretation is valid we deal with themes self deception how reality fantasy can coexist here pans labyrinth explores how ophelia creates fantasy herself deal with harsh realities war this case we can interpret final fantasy sequence as ophelias imagination her creation world she wished live besides you can tell she is still alive as del toro shows her lips quiver right after fantasy sequence observations film features many smooth cuts which del toro hides with trees black screens this could imply how reality fantasy intertwine supporting second interpretation but smooth cuts never go fantasy reality or reality fantasy only fantasy fantasy or reality reality this could suggest first interpretation where reality fantasy are separate vidal sees monster under bed which supports 1st interpretation yet at same time he does not see faun at end which supports 2nd interpretation but again vidal has just consumed some kind poison so it may be his hallucinations which he does not see faun del toro never cuts away violence emphasizing brutality war cinematography is magnificent dark gloomy blue colors reality sequences depict its dreariness while bright vibrant reds oranges depict enthusiasm final scenes reds blood explosions stand out because blues have become so common with eye del toro consciously had blood explosions stand out emphasize violence war notice how del toro establishes tension between ophelia vidal when ophelia shakes with wrong hand vidal points it out forming uneasy tone between them this first encounter between two main characters their respective storylines is vital their relationship future scenes especially climax bottom line is both interpretations are valid del toro utilizes both them deliver both their respective themes as magnificent as this film is there may be authenticity flaws example why didnt mercedes kill vidal after she escaped is she still obedient vidal then why did he directly disobey his order at end when vidal asked tell his son time his death me its clear why del toro left these authenticity flaws drive story forward attempting patch these flaws wouldve been at expense pacing audiences engagement is more important than plot holes after all these flaws are more or less hidden visible only those who know where look,0.5333717357910904,0.06518991760927244,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.44}"
9.0,Wonderful combination of fantasy and reality,"Few would dispute that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it's also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren't many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.The combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone. Overall, a wonderful film and one of the best fantasy/adventures of the 00s.",wonderful combination fantasy reality,few would dispute that pans labyrinth is one best foreign language films 2000s but i would go one step further argue that its also one best modern day fantasy adventure films general there arent many films that manage blur lines between fantasy reality as effectively as pans labyrinth effortless transition between real world underworld way two worlds are interlinked really is something special ive never seen it done as well before combination convincing easy buy into storyline magical fantasy underworld works perfectly fact that both parts story could easily stand alone without other yet go together seamlessly is indicator just how good it is horror elements also bring something completely different unexpected film though they are tastefully added never overdone overall wonderful film one best fantasy adventures 00s,0.5437728937728937,0.4009157509157509,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,"Beautiful, violent, magical and sad....","I was fortunate enough to catch Pan's Labyrinth last night as part of the 'Fright Fest' programme in London and was completely blown away. Guillermo Del Toro himself was present to both introduce the movie and to answer questions afterwards. He spoke very passionately about the film, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. If you are the type of person who is put off by subtitled movies, don't be. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue.

7.0,"It's good, but nowhere near as good as the reviews would have you believe","I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film.

However, this is not only one of the most extraordinary films ever made, it is also a personal fave which I have seen many times.Comments include: * can Guillermo del Toro actually make a bad film? I don't think so. Because of his name on the credits I have checked out many films of his that, while not in the same class as this one, were nonetheless flawless in execution.* of many film I have seen about war (too many to count) this one manages to humanize the condition to a greater degree than I can recall. Each character is perfectly cast with perfectly written dialog to bring home the metaphor of trying to live your life while chaos reigns around you. A little girl with a sick pregnant mother who just lost her father and finds her step-father to be a monster ... perfect!* many films deliberately strive for that special ""ambiguous"" ending but this one nails it. I remember couples coming out out the theatre arguing over what the real purpose of the film was, what the real ending was, what the intent was, etc * the one single scene where the young girl has to enter a subterranean land and retrieve artifacts WITHOUT EATING THE FOOD ON THE TABLE is in many ways scarier than the scariest horror films you could name. Moreso because the audience knows how hungry she was and empathizes.

10.0,The best fantasy of the past decade,"Everyone's been raving about this. My opinion doesn't differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I'd developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was, and the whole ""20min ovation at Cannes"" thing. Really, who stands for that long? That said, it's an amazing work.Skipping the plot recap (find the briefest synopsis you can if you need to be filled in), I'll go straight to the tech specs. I'm not a huge Del Toro fan, Cronos was interesting but lacked something for me. Mimic was dross. Hellboy was enjoyable and Ron Perlman is always great on screen. But here, the director really outdoes himself. By far. He has wrapped together some amazing elements and somehow maintains a balance, that doesn't tip into the mundane or the ridiculous for a moment. And this is no mean feat. The story is part historical drama, part fantasy, part family melodrama. When it dips out of the fantasy, it still enchants.Sergi Lopez and Maribel VerdÃº really drive the story in the historical drama scenes. I haven't seen Lopez in anything other than a film called Lisbon, in which he played a character so completely opposite from the Captain. He is a fierce and terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic in a couple of scenes. Verdu is incredible as Mercedes, the head housekeeper (or something) who is Ofelia's closest friend in the house. The scenes with these characters and the civil war subplot never fail to hold your attention. Ivana Baquero is excellent as the main character Ofelia, her performance is very mature and believable and she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother and Mercedes.When the fairy tale elements return, it's astounding how naturally they fit into the story. I think that is the real magic of this film. The war drama and the fairy tale stem so naturally from each other.One thing that most reviews haven't mentioned is the violence. I think it's been firmly established that this is an adult's fairytale, but at times it is a very intense and brutal film. There are a couple of scenes in particular which are very disturbing and difficult to watch. These do not distract from the tone and theme of the film however so they don't seem exploitative at all. If you are squeamish, it may get a bit much for you.A final and obvious point I spose I can't get away without making: the set design, costumes and effects are superb. That's all.I was perhaps expecting a little more fantasy, but the unique blend of genres is absolutely compelling. There wasn't a false note anywhere or a plot hole, which are too often present in fantasy films. I can't recall a good, original fantasy film from recent years. Fortunately this blows MirrorMask out of the water. It doesn't share any of the contrivances, vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film.I just wish I'd seen it without already having read so much. I've tried very hard to not reveal any plot details at all as it does go to some surprising and unexpected places. Fortunately most of the reviews have done the same. I'd urge anyone with the chance to see it to do so immediately, and try not to read too much more.",best fantasy past decade,everyones been raving about this my opinion doesnt differ too much it did however suffer slightly overwhelmingly high expectations id developed based how brilliant everyone said it was whole 20min ovation at cannes thing really who stands that long that said its amazing work skipping plot recap find briefest synopsis you can if you need be filled ill go straight tech specs im not huge del toro fan cronos was interesting but lacked something me mimic was dross hellboy was enjoyable ron perlman is always great screen but here director really outdoes himself by far he has wrapped together some amazing elements somehow maintains balance that doesnt tip into mundane or ridiculous moment this is no mean feat story is part historical drama part fantasy part family melodrama when it dips out fantasy it still enchants sergi lopez maribel verd really drive story historical drama scenes i havent seen lopez anything other than film called lisbon which he played character so completely opposite captain he is fierce terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic couple scenes verdu is incredible as mercedes head housekeeper or something who is ofelias closest friend house scenes with these characters civil war subplot never fail hold your attention ivana baquero is excellent as main character ofelia her performance is very mature believable she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother mercedes when fairy tale elements return its astounding how naturally they fit into story i think that is real magic this film war drama fairy tale stem so naturally each other one thing that most reviews havent mentioned is violence i think its been firmly established that this is adults fairytale but at times it is very intense brutal film there are couple scenes particular which are very disturbing difficult watch these do not distract tone theme film however so they dont seem exploitative at all if you are squeamish it may get bit much you final obvious point i spose i cant get away without making set design costumes effects are superb thats all i was perhaps expecting little more fantasy but unique blend genres is absolutely compelling there wasnt false note anywhere or plot hole which are too often present fantasy films i cant recall good original fantasy film recent years fortunately this blows mirrormask out water it doesnt share any contrivances vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film i just wish id seen it without already having read so much ive tried very hard not reveal any plot details at all as it does go some surprising unexpected places fortunately most reviews have done same id urge anyone with chance see it do so immediately try not read too much more,0.5590540540540541,0.18240427927927924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,A labyrinth you don't want to leave,"I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.In my opinion, del Toro's ""...Labyrinth"" deserved to win at Cannes over the Ken Loach film, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"". Actually, everyone I knew at the Festival who had seen both agreed with me. And the 22 minute ovation speaks clearly for the effect on the audience. It's hard to imagine that any film could beat it in a context other than Cannes where they have marked preferences, bordering on obsession, for certain directors.Let's hope that the late December opening favors an Oscar nomination which it should win hands down, unless some other work of genius appears on the horizon. That doesn't seem likely because at Cannes the somewhat disappointing array of films was attributed to the fact that not much great product is being released this year. I might add that I had already seen Volver prior to Pan's Labyrinth, and I maintain that Pan is the better film. For me, it displaced all three of my top films of the year. I do love The Departed but, luckily, that's in another category which does not threaten Pan's access to Oscar. If I had to choose the very best picture of the year, without limitation by category, it would most assuredly go to Pan's Labyrinth for it demonstrates del Toro's originality and brilliance as both writer and director.",labyrinth you dont want leave,i saw this film toward end cannes film festival it edged out all others id seen 30 them because its wonderful story history politics fantasy woven into fabric spun by superlative creative team headed by guillermo del toro comparison this his latest effort del toros other films only hinted at depth breadth his talent this film much as i pride myself foreseeing outcome most stories i could not guess what would happen next film is quite long yet suspense is sustained throughout music is some best ive heard years so well suited action that you almost dont notice its specific effect because how well it is intertwined with visual emotional intellectual experience my opinion del toros labyrinth deserved win at cannes over ken loach film wind that shakes barley actually everyone i knew at festival who had seen both agreed with me 22 minute ovation speaks clearly effect audience its hard imagine that any film could beat it context other than cannes where they have marked preferences bordering obsession certain directors lets hope that late december opening favors oscar nomination which it should win hands down unless some other work genius appears horizon that doesnt seem likely because at cannes somewhat disappointing array films was attributed fact that not much great product is being released this year i might add that i had already seen volver prior pans labyrinth i maintain that pan is better film me it displaced all three my top films year i do love departed but luckily thats another category which does not threaten pans access oscar if i had choose very best picture year without limitation by category it would most assuredly go pans labyrinth it demonstrates del toros originality brilliance as both writer director,0.48218474426807756,0.2020943562610229,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Quite possibly the best foreign language film I have ever seen!,"Don't let the fact that it is in Spanish throw you. This is a dark, moving and sometimes terrifying masterpiece of a film. Director Guilliemo Del Torro directs with briskness and deep understanding of the film. The film looks gorgeous, very beautiful in one scene, and quite Gothic in another. Another director I can think of that directs visually stunning films is Ridley Scott. The music score by Javier Navarette is haunting, poignant and beautiful. The script is very mysterious, suspenseful and genuinely moving at times, and there are some genuinely memorable characters, the idealistic protagonist, the brutal stepfather, the pregnant mother and the caring housemaid. Here is one of the few fantasies where the images stay with you forever. There are beautiful costumes and a stunning forest set, the labyrinth is very Gothic and dark, as is the wise and mysterious faun, and the war and torture scenes are unashamedly graphic. Another honourable mention should go to the monster that tricks children into eating his food when he is asleep, and then he wakes up and eats them. He was so terrifying, the very look of him, made my blood run cold. He is one of the most terrifying creatures I have ever seen in the history of film. All in all, a visually stunning and absolutely magnificent film, with a definite 10/10.

,Not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006,"Carmen has married Captain Vidal and, pregnant with his son, travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man, perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the ""smallest cinema on earth"" (it wasn't but it must have been close). Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which, contrary to the marketing, is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging real-world horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where, like the real world, she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but, as much as I want to see this, it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story (although less so the real parts) and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the ""horror"" part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door (in the UK this was rated a 15). At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story (again specifically the fantasy).By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue (albeit subtitled) interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything. I also liked the references scattered across the narrative, such as Alice in Wonderland to name one in particular. He directs his cast well too, drawing a very good performance from Baquero in the central role. LÃ³pez could have hammed it up but, while he doesn't really make a person here, he avoids being a pantomime baddie. VerdÃº is strong as Mercedes while Gil is good but left with little to do outside of suffer and worry. Jones does well within his creatures to deliver the potential within the design.Overall then not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006. Visually impressive and very well delivered, I'm afraid I just found it hard to get over the disconnect between the two aspects of the story no matter how much I wanted to find it.",not strong enough important ways make it classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting engaging enough be one stronger films 2006,carmen has married captain vidal pregnant with his son travels with her daughter ofelia join him his woodland barracks where he is trying quash small bands rebellion against fascist regime carmen is not well vidal immediately puts her into care dr ferreiro who confines her her bed after short time vidal is cruel man perhaps hardened by battle he fights beliefs he holds ofelia finds him have no time her her no interest him while she tries cope with reality her new life she also finds herself taken by fairy into dark underworld where faun offers her new life as princess if she completes series tasks him with all papers amateur reviewers here putting this film high up list best films 2006 i rued that i missed my chance see film when it originally came out but got opportunity recently holiday cornwall at what my girlfriend called smallest cinema earth it wasnt but it must have been close perhaps weight expectation film played part but i confess have enjoyed it but not found masterpiece that majority have claimed film works pretty well has very strong central narrative which contrary marketing is actually real world not fantasy this is engaging real world horror that focuses struggle between guerrilla fighters fascists led by vidal other side coin we have fantasy involving ofelia where like real world she finds world darkness where she is not entirely sure who trust now my main problem with film is overlap between these two elements how they fit together i have read others say that fantasy echoes real world but as much as i want see this it just didnt ring true me very basic level i get it but that is different film cleverly weaving them together making it work this separation detracted both aspects story although less so real parts also saw fantasy be only partially explained harder become really engaged with my girlfriend said she felt story was simplistic enough work best older children that horror part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting door uk this was rated 15 at first i agreed with her but reflection it actually works other way because this is much more adult tale but just doesnt quite have intelligence complexity all parts story again specifically fantasy by this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used dissenting voice but those who have made it this far let me just say that it is very good film overall that i did enjoy it outside plot there is much enjoy as well writing is very good dialogue albeit subtitled interesting never clunky or obvious even if some scenes would have made it easy it be so fantasy world is wonderfully created engagingly dark with creatures mix wonder menace faun himself is good well used although it was shame see such terrifying vision such as pale man so briefly used with little expansion beyond lurching menace one scene del toro directs well across all aspects film keeps this sense dark menace across everything i also liked references scattered across narrative such as alice wonderland name one particular he directs his cast well too drawing very good performance baquero central role l pez could have hammed it up but while he doesnt really make person here he avoids being pantomime baddie verd is strong as mercedes while gil is good but left with little do outside suffer worry jones does well within his creatures deliver potential within design overall then not strong enough important ways make it classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting engaging enough be one stronger films 2006 visually impressive very well delivered im afraid i just found it hard get over disconnect between two aspects story no matter how much i wanted find it,0.48563181318131815,0.14727122712271223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
6.0,Entartaining but not one of the very best movies from last year,"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.I hoped and expected ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as ""The Devil's Backbone"" was. I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as ""Forbidden Games"", ""Spirits of the Beehive"" (which ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece"". One movie that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", his fairy tale for adults, his ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. ""Tideland"" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with ""Tideland"" but I found it much more interesting that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in ""Pan Labyrinth"". I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's ""Tideland"" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than ""Pan's Labyrinth"". I should admit that at least one scene in ""Labyrinth"" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, ""Saturn Devouring His Children"" and it was extremely imaginative.

,Thuggish,"I get annoyed at movies that preach one thing and are themselves another.The story here has two components, a real and fantasy thread. The real world thread is simple. By that I mean there are no dramatic complications at all. The characters are theatrical cartoons. The situation starts out brutally and stays that way without any arc, development, evolution. It is in fact a formula movie, this thread, and one that follows a formula that is based on strict, strict boundaries. One would suspect it was written by a German, it is so regimented. One would almost believe it to be written by ""The Captain,"" the bad guy here.It marches. Its unambiguous. Its final and brutal in its morality, just as the Captian is. There are only good and bad people and the bad are not only very, very bad but they get their deserts. Justice isn't nuanced here. In fact nothing at all is.I suppose people celebrate it for its fantasy thread. Yes, the effects are good. Yes the creepy eyeless man was creepy. Yes the Tinkerbells were Tinkerbelly. But is this in any way better than ""Dark Crystal,"" which was similarly banal in its cosmology?Look, I'm one of the ones who get depressed at things like ""The Matrix,"" but if lacking in imagination, is copying was deep, complex, manylayered.

10.0,Innocence and brutality,"I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it's one of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever). Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi LÃ³pez, Maribel VerdÃº and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro.",innocence brutality,i saw movie yesterday spanish premiere i confirm its one best guillermo del toros films if not best ever innocence brutality fantasy reality together wonderful fairy tale about power magic dark times performances are great mainly sergi l pez maribel verd big revelation film 12 years girl ivana baquero del toro repeats context film el espinazo del diablo devils backbone spanish post civil war with same philosophy supernatural invading daily life depressive environment innocence children trapped between both world but el laberinto del fauno is most compact most mature best done very aspects perhaps its most personal movie del toro,0.3511904761904761,0.26587301587301587,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.25}"
1.0,Recycled clichÃ©s in plodding storyline.,"I stuck around for this movie to serve something not yet seen or experienced in dozens of related films which I was so sure this movie would provide. Sadly, that moment never came.Although I have no complaints with the acting and setdesigns which were on par with any quality movie, there are basically three things that deprive this movie of being anything great.1. Though truly beautifully shot, Pan's two sided scenario with the Good vs Evil Children's-picture on the one side and a drama/war-movie on the other, provides no deeper layers. A 'what you see is what you get' type of film in which the fantasy part seemed more or less something that would look nice on the adverts in combination with a superabundance of very graphic violence in a foreign movie which offers a subterfuge to sell something slight and cursory as profound and insightful. 2. Since there is no thread running through both the scenario's it is like watching two different movies which bear very little to each other nor compliment the other. Because I liked the fantasy part zealously better than the war/drama bit, I was very disappointed that it had no follow-through and that it in the end just seemed like a shameless cloned-off short-impression of movies like Alice in Wonderland, The Wizzard of Ozz and The never Ending Story, to name but a few, but never with a meaningful reference of any kind. It is almost like the writers hit behind the fact that they never even saw these movies. 3.There is just nothing subtle in the story that draws you in, I found it all annoyingly superficial and clichÃ©. It never invites you to share the little girl's fantastic world or truly reject El Capitan's actions because it is all far too black and white. Plus the film leaves no room for any other interpretation aside from the one which is already painted elaborately on its cinematic walls. Something I find quite odd since most true children's pictures have a lot underlying messages and symbolism. The more I think about it, the more this story just seems lazily written or without any terribly interesting thought behind it. -In the end of it all, there is simply no hope-..nothing more than a flipflop of any and all sappy-happy-endings Hollywood has been laying on us for years on end. Furthermore, with style over substance as its fortÃ© the movie tends to plod tremendously at times. And since none of the characters are really focused on, they all just seem to be stereotypes and are hence neither likable nor unlikable despite their (too) obvious good or bad demeanors. Vidal is simply bad, mom is simply weak and Ofelia was nothing more than the little girl playing with imaginary friends in the corner of the room.This film is alas just another example of a movie where they just don't seem to be able to get it both ways (powerful story AND powerful cinematography) which is the Achilles' heel of many a film lately but which oddly doesn't seem to bother the average moviegoer nor professional movie-critic who somehow seem to think that foreign+different=Masterpiece.",recycled clich s plodding storyline,i stuck around this movie serve something not yet seen or experienced dozens related films which i was so sure this movie would provide sadly that moment never came although i have no complaints with acting setdesigns which were par with any quality movie there are basically three things that deprive this movie being anything great 1 though truly beautifully shot pans two sided scenario with good vs evil childrens picture one side drama war movie other provides no deeper layers what you see is what you get type film which fantasy part seemed more or less something that would look nice adverts combination with superabundance very graphic violence foreign movie which offers subterfuge sell something slight cursory as profound insightful 2 since there is no thread running through both scenarios it is like watching two different movies which bear very little each other nor compliment other because i liked fantasy part zealously better than war drama bit i was very disappointed that it had no follow through that it end just seemed like shameless cloned off short impression movies like alice wonderland wizzard ozz never ending story name but few but never with meaningful reference any kind it is almost like writers hit behind fact that they never even saw these movies 3 there is just nothing subtle story that draws you i found it all annoyingly superficial clich it never invites you share little girls fantastic world or truly reject el capitans actions because it is all far too black white plus film leaves no room any other interpretation aside one which is already painted elaborately its cinematic walls something i find quite odd since most true childrens pictures have lot underlying messages symbolism more i think about it more this story just seems lazily written or without any terribly interesting thought behind it end it all there is simply no hope nothing more than flipflop any all sappy happy endings hollywood has been laying us years end furthermore with style over substance as its fort movie tends plod tremendously at times since none characters are really focused they all just seem be stereotypes are hence neither likable nor unlikable despite their too obvious good or bad demeanors vidal is simply bad mom is simply weak ofelia was nothing more than little girl playing with imaginary friends corner room this film is alas just another example movie where they just dont seem be able get it both ways powerful story powerful cinematography which is achilles heel many film lately but which oddly doesnt seem bother average moviegoer nor professional movie critic who somehow seem think that foreign different masterpiece,0.5687977262977262,0.07474662162162159,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Guillermo del Toro is a visionary,It's 1944 in fascist Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going up to the mountains with her mother to live with her stepfather. Her father was a simple tailor who died during the civil war. Her mother married the cruel vicious Captain. She's pregnant with his son and he cares more about him than her. He is hunting the revolutionary hold outs hiding in the mountains. Ofelia finds odd looking ruins and sees a fantasy world in them. Meanwhile Mercedes (Maribel VerdÃº) is working at the house while helping the revolutionaries in the woods.This movie sets Guillermo del Toro up as a cinematic visionary. It is visually imaginative and unique. The acting is mostly well done headed by the always compelling Maribel VerdÃº. Ivana Baquero has the innocent look that is so essential. The violence can be brutal.

5.0,"Beautiful production, underwhelming story...","In 1944 Spain, as the Spanish Resistance is losing to the Fascist army, a pre-teen bookworm named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother come to stay with the girl's new stepfather, an icy army captain. While stopping for a break on their initial journey, the youngster fits the missing piece of a statue into its proper place; this unleashes a magical winged creature who leads the girl to the pale faun, a gargoyle-like guru who helps Ofelia understand she possesses the spirit of the Princess Moanna and will live eternal...that is, until she completes three heady tasks before the next full moon! Spanish-language fantasy begins well, combining elements of Grimm and 'Alice in Wonderland' with the modern, grotesque look of a BjÃ¶rk music video, but the elements of the story are hazy rather than coherent (if Ofelia hadn't put back the missing piece, would she still have Moanna's spirit?). Baquero is sublime as the child, but every segue from her to the evil captain halts the movie's momentum, and the incidentals (the captain's party, Ofelia ruining her new dress, the assistant sneaking medicine) aren't compelling. A film which bides its time between an incredible fantasy world and the harsh realities of the day is ultimately going to come up short (we can't wait for the preliminaries to be over with so that the real story can progress); despite a smoothly efficient direction and an able cast, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" simply feels too slight, too undemanding to garner status as a fantasy-classic. ** from ****",beautiful production underwhelming story,1944 spain as spanish resistance is losing fascist army pre teen bookworm named ofelia ivana baquero her pregnant mother come stay with girls new stepfather icy army captain while stopping break their initial journey youngster fits missing piece statue into its proper place this unleashes magical winged creature who leads girl pale faun gargoyle like guru who helps ofelia understand she possesses spirit princess moanna will live eternal that is until she completes three heady tasks before next full moon spanish language fantasy begins well combining elements grimm alice wonderland with modern grotesque look bj rk music video but elements story are hazy rather than coherent if ofelia hadnt put back missing piece would she still have moannas spirit baquero is sublime as child but every segue her evil captain halts movies momentum incidentals captains party ofelia ruining her new dress assistant sneaking medicine arent compelling film which bides its time between incredible fantasy world harsh realities day is ultimately going come up short we cant wait preliminaries be over with so that real story can progress despite smoothly efficient direction able cast pans labyrinth simply feels too slight too undemanding garner status as fantasy classic,0.4107444575626394,0.09037649219467402,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.21}"
5.0,Didn't do much for me at all.,"El Laberinto del Fauno is set in Spain in 1944 during the Civil War, a widow named Carmen (Ariadna Gil) marries Captain Vidal (Sergi LÃ³pez) the sadistic ruler of a group of Nationalist soldiers. Carmen & her 11 year old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) move out to an old Mill in the countryside where Captain Vidal & his men are stationed trying to crush local rebel resistance. There Ofelia is lured into an ancient stone labyrinth by a fairy & down some steps into a magical fantasy realm, there she meets a creature called a Faun (Doug Jones) who says she was once the Princess of the magical realm & gives her three task's so she can reclaim her rightful place once again...This American, Spanish & Mexican co-production was written, produced & directed by Guillermo del Toro & after winning innumerable awards, accolades & critical acclaim I was expecting something a bit special which unfortunately wasn't forthcoming. Known more commonly under the title of Pan's Labyrinth in English speaking territories all the hype & advance publicity surrounding El Laberinto del Fauno stated that it was one of the best fantasy films of all time & like a fool I brought into it. The script by Toro is much, much more of a war time drama as it spends the vast majority of it's duration on the frankly depressing real life conflict between Spanish soldiers & rebels. In fact El Laberinto del Fauno is more of a drama than anything else, the quaint & sometimes charming fantasy elements are few & far between with only three or four notable sequences. When it focuses on Ofelia's fantasy world then it's often spellbinding but when it switches to the war time dramas it's horrible. When I watch a film I want to be entertained, nothing more nothing less. Watching El Laberinto del Fauno I was throughly depressed, it's hardly an uplifting tale & one that left me rather down. That's not what I want to feel like when watching a film, I'm sorry buts that the way it is. Some moments are genuinely unsettling & even upsetting to the extent that I sometimes found it quite hard to watch. The script leaves a lot of things open to the viewers interpretation but I thought it was pretty clear, the fantasy elements never really gel with the grim war time dramatics & the two make for uneasy bedfellows.Director Toro does a great job although I must admit I don't quite get what he was trying to do here. It's a tale of a girls imagination & hope but in the end he seems to want to crush any hope of any uplifting message in favour of some truly horrible moments of real life brutality, violence, torture & death. Some of the scenes in El Laberinto del Fauno are very disturbing, from people beaten to death, tortured, sliced open mouths & lots of bad things happening to good people. Presented entirely in Spanish with English subtitles I don't know about anyone else but while I'm reading the subtitles I can't get a good look at what's happening on screen, it's impossible, very frustrating & annoying. The special effects are pretty good, some of the CGI effects are a little below par I suppose but the make-up effects & creature design is very good. I wouldn't say El Laberinto del Fauno is scary but some of the character's do some really horrific things.Technically the film is very good, actually shot in Spain the production values are great & it's well made. The acting is excellent which makes it all the more powerful, whether that's a good thing I am not sure.El Laberinto del Fauno is a film lots of people seem to like for reasons which escape me, I thought it was a throughly depressing & disheartening experience that I have no desire to revisit. It has it's moments on occasion & it's often quite powerful stuff but that doesn't mean it makes good entertainment which I happen to think it isn't.",didnt do much me at all,el laberinto del fauno is set spain 1944 during civil war widow named carmen ariadna gil marries captain vidal sergi l pez sadistic ruler group nationalist soldiers carmen her 11 year old daughter ofelia ivana baquero move out old mill countryside where captain vidal his men are stationed trying crush local rebel resistance there ofelia is lured into ancient stone labyrinth by fairy down some steps into magical fantasy realm there she meets creature called faun doug jones who says she was once princess magical realm gives her three tasks so she can reclaim her rightful place once again this american spanish mexican co production was written produced directed by guillermo del toro after winning innumerable awards accolades critical acclaim i was expecting something bit special which unfortunately wasnt forthcoming known more commonly under title pans labyrinth english speaking territories all hype advance publicity surrounding el laberinto del fauno stated that it was one best fantasy films all time like fool i brought into it script by toro is much much more war time drama as it spends vast majority its duration frankly depressing real life conflict between spanish soldiers rebels fact el laberinto del fauno is more drama than anything else quaint sometimes charming fantasy elements are few far between with only three or four notable sequences when it focuses ofelias fantasy world then its often spellbinding but when it switches war time dramas its horrible when i watch film i want be entertained nothing more nothing less watching el laberinto del fauno i was throughly depressed its hardly uplifting tale one that left me rather down thats not what i want feel like when watching film im sorry buts that way it is some moments are genuinely unsettling even upsetting extent that i sometimes found it quite hard watch script leaves lot things open viewers interpretation but i thought it was pretty clear fantasy elements never really gel with grim war time dramatics two make uneasy bedfellows director toro does great job although i must admit i dont quite get what he was trying do here its tale girls imagination hope but end he seems want crush any hope any uplifting message favour some truly horrible moments real life brutality violence torture death some scenes el laberinto del fauno are very disturbing people beaten death tortured sliced open mouths lots bad things happening good people presented entirely spanish with english subtitles i dont know about anyone else but while im reading subtitles i cant get good look at whats happening screen its impossible very frustrating annoying special effects are pretty good some cgi effects are little below par i suppose but make up effects creature design is very good i wouldnt say el laberinto del fauno is scary but some characters do some really horrific things technically film is very good actually shot spain production values are great its well made acting is excellent which makes it all more powerful whether thats good thing i am not sure el laberinto del fauno is film lots people seem like reasons which escape me i thought it was throughly depressing disheartening experience that i have no desire revisit it has its moments occasion its often quite powerful stuff but that doesnt mean it makes good entertainment which i happen think it isnt,0.578013296227582,0.05177283034425889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Closest Thing To Art That Film Has Experienced In Years,"I just finished the movie today and I must say that this is by far one of the most artistic and beautiful movies I have seen in years. The producers of the film were right to call this a modern fairytale, since it has all the ingredients for an authentic Brothers Grimm story. Just don't expect there to be lots of happy faces in the film. This is a real, bloody (very bloody), moody, emotional fairy tale just like the ones in the past.First of all, I have to say that the technical design in this film was astounding. The art direction was spot on for all the locations, whether its the imaginary world of the labyrinth or the mill that the fascists call their base. The music is some of the best I've heard in a film for a long time, drawing that fantasy feel of the movie perfectly and inspiring so many emotions in one chord than other films could in their whole screening. The sound was top notch as well, never sounding like just a compilation of reused sound effects. And of course, the make-up design is flawless and imaginative. The biggest shock was the cinematography. Now, I personally thought Children of Men should have got the Oscar for this, but understand now why this won. Each shot is beautifully staged, colored and detailed in a way that they cease to be movie shots and become portraits of art.Guillermo Del Toro really surprised me. Not only did he assemble a surprisingly talented cast, but he was able to make you really connect with the situation. The characters are all well developed and the symbolism, though subtle, is so delicious that it makes me tingle with the thought of it. The dialogue is natural and authentic and he handles the film expertly to convey that timeless feel even through some of the film's harsher moments. You really feel this is a labor of love, since it bears its fruits at every scene. I didn't even mind that I had to read subtitles (which I think Del Toro knew that he would have to use it wisely, since the scenes are designed so you are not distracted reading the text to enjoy the scene).If I had any complaints, its that some of the visual effect designs were sometimes inferior. They weren't bad, but they had some rough edges that should have been addressed.I recommend this for anyone who has a strong stomach, an eye for art and a heart. It deserved all its Oscar wins and noms and should have won for its amazing music. This is the new standard for film art for the modern generation.",closest thing art that film has experienced years,i just finished movie today i must say that this is by far one most artistic beautiful movies i have seen years producers film were right call this modern fairytale since it has all ingredients authentic brothers grimm story just dont expect there be lots happy faces film this is real bloody very bloody moody emotional fairy tale just like ones past first all i have say that technical design this film was astounding art direction was spot all locations whether its imaginary world labyrinth or mill that fascists call their base music is some best ive heard film long time drawing that fantasy feel movie perfectly inspiring so many emotions one chord than other films could their whole screening sound was top notch as well never sounding like just compilation reused sound effects course make up design is flawless imaginative biggest shock was cinematography now i personally thought children men should have got oscar this but understand now why this won each shot is beautifully staged colored detailed way that they cease be movie shots become portraits art guillermo del toro really surprised me not only did he assemble surprisingly talented cast but he was able make you really connect with situation characters are all well developed symbolism though subtle is so delicious that it makes me tingle with thought it dialogue is natural authentic he handles film expertly convey that timeless feel even through some films harsher moments you really feel this is labor love since it bears its fruits at every scene i didnt even mind that i had read subtitles which i think del toro knew that he would have use it wisely since scenes are designed so you are not distracted reading text enjoy scene if i had any complaints its that some visual effect designs were sometimes inferior they werent bad but they had some rough edges that should have been addressed i recommend this anyone who has strong stomach eye art heart it deserved all its oscar wins noms should have won its amazing music this is new standard film art modern generation,0.6069183902517236,0.25704465287798617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,There are small remnants of our democracy remaining to be found.,"Pan's Labyrinth, by Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (Mimic, Chronos, Hellboy), is a serious piece of work, making profound use of its fantasy.It is Spain, 1944. The brave resistance continues the fight against the fascists. Carmen - Ariadna Gil (Alatriste, Belle Epoque, Revolver), travels to meet her new husband, the fascist Captain Vidal - Sergi Lopez (Dirty Pretty Things, A Pornographic Affair). With her is Ofelia - Ivana Baquero (Rottweiler, Romasanta), her daughter by her first marriage.Captain Vidal wants his son to be born in Franco's ""new Spain""Â—which he will create by brute force if necessary. The fascists' sadistic repression is demonstrated by violent sequences, such as Captain Vidal beating a poacher to death with a bottle.Captain Vidal is only concerned for his son and orders the doctor to sacrifice Carmen, if necessary.Full of fascist disdain for women, Captain Vidal fails to notice that his trusted housekeeper Mercedes - Maribel Verdu (Y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n, Belle Epoque), is spying for the resistance. He also fails to understand why Dr. Ferreiro - Alex Angulo (The Day of the Beast), does not simply obeyed his orders.He also fails to understand why the democratic resistance opposes his fascist fantasies.Ofelia is attempting to return to a fantasy world where truth reins and fascist lies are not allowed. There is a heavenly turn in the end, where the reward for passing the final test is her elevation to a throne alongside her father and mother. But, just like Spain, that is all fantasy as the Catholic Church was aligned with the fascists and there is no heavenly reward for the democratic unbelievers.Fascists the world over, including those in our government are determined to crush all opposition and to demonstrate their victory. The themes of remembering the evils and the search for truth are woven throughout the film.There may be only small pockets of truth left in America, as there are in Spain, but we can seek them out as we seek the remembrances of the Princess' life on earth.
