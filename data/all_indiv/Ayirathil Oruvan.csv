9,Unsung movie in history of Indian cinema,"This movie is for, those who are always compare Indian movies with Hollywood cinema. Even Hollywood movie makers can not made movie like this in this budget. Movie is well crafted from start to end. There is no lag in the movie. If you feel lagging then you are not watching movie with your full concentration. Some people claim, AO is the movie for genius movie watchers? definitely not. This movie tells story in a layman's language. If you are still confused then you are watching this movie for name sake. After 5 years I am writing this review in IMDb. Because this movie is worth to talk and write for another decade. Some people says directors like S.S.Rajamouli and Sankar are the two directors who raised the Indian movies to Hollywood standard. But I would say that is utterly false statement. People admired about Naan E and Sankar's so called worthless expenses as Hollywood standard. But real fact is, why we are giving much important to Hollywood movies is, that is because of the concept and beyond level of thinking they have it in their BRAIN. AO is the answer to that THINK BEYOND concept in Indian cinema. If you watch this movie without any distraction you will feel what I felt. The reason I am dragging Sankar and S.S.Rajamouli into this context is, these two directors are worshiped as demi god of making Hollywood standard movie in Indian Cinema. But the truth is Selvaragavan done that without making much noise by giving Aayirathil Oruvan to Indian cinema. So please stop making Sankar and S.S.Rajamouli as big directors in Indian, they are giving masala movies with mix of some gimmick technology.If someone ask me which movie you can select, if you compete with Hollywood movie, I would say without any second thought ""Aayirathil Oruvan"" is the movie which would challenge the Hollywood film makers.Atlast the bitter truth is, this movie is the one real unsung movie in Indian cinema history. My heartiest thanks to real Hollywood thinker and director Selvaraghavan.",unsung movie history indian cinema,this movie is those who are always compare indian movies with hollywood cinema even hollywood movie makers can not made movie like this this budget movie is well crafted start end there is no lag movie if you feel lagging then you are not watching movie with your full concentration some people claim ao is movie genius movie watchers definitely not this movie tells story laymans language if you are still confused then you are watching this movie name sake after 5 years i am writing this review imdb because this movie is worth talk write another decade some people says directors like s s rajamouli sankar are two directors who raised indian movies hollywood standard but i would say that is utterly false statement people admired about naan e sankars so called worthless expenses as hollywood standard but real fact is why we are giving much important hollywood movies is that is because concept beyond level thinking they have it their brain ao is answer that think beyond concept indian cinema if you watch this movie without any distraction you will feel what i felt reason i am dragging sankar s s rajamouli into this context is these two directors are worshiped as demi god making hollywood standard movie indian cinema but truth is selvaragavan done that without making much noise by giving aayirathil oruvan indian cinema so please stop making sankar s s rajamouli as big directors indian they are giving masala movies with mix some gimmick technology if someone ask me which movie you can select if you compete with hollywood movie i would say without any second thought aayirathil oruvan is movie which would challenge hollywood film makers atlast bitter truth is this movie is one real unsung movie indian cinema history my heartiest thanks real hollywood thinker director selvaraghavan,0.3472222222222222,0.019444444444444434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9,Glorious movie of the decade,"This Movie was released during a Pongal. Had to over power crowd to get the tickets and was dumb struck by visuals, screenplay and non stereotypical variety. Not only that, it pushed me to learn more about these two rival kingdoms. But very unfortunate that many don't know their own history and viewers expect the director to ""TELL everything instead of SHOW"" The end result- movie which is supposed to be celebrated as the movie of the decade ended up as an average Venture. Feel sorry for the poor taste of the viewers at that time for this movie being ended up as Glorious Flops and celebrated now. But Its too Late.",glorious movie decade,this movie was released during pongal had over power crowd get tickets was dumb struck by visuals screenplay non stereotypical variety not only that it pushed me learn more about these two rival kingdoms but very unfortunate that many dont know their own history viewers expect director tell everything instead show end result movie which is supposed be celebrated as movie decade ended up as average venture feel sorry poor taste viewers at that time this movie being ended up as glorious flops celebrated now but its too late,0.7384615384615384,-0.044230769230769226,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8,A new genre to Indian Cinema,"Selvaraghavan one of the most versatile directors in Indian cinema has attempted a new genre and has succeeded. His imagination has no limits and has reflected on the screen very well. This movie shows the vast history of South India (something not seen before).The backbone of this film is around the cast consisting of Karthi, Reema sen and Andrea. All of them have given great performances especially Reema sen who has grown as an actor.The first half of the film is an adventure on tone with Indiana Jones but the obstacles and concept is purely Indian which makes this film unique. The comedy timing of karthi is exceptional which keeps the first half fast paced with some great visuals. The pre-interval scene sets the pace for a great second half.The second half of the movie is a little slower than the first half because the more detailed characterization. Parthiban plays the chola king to perfection and his dialogue delivery is flawless. Reema sen dominates the second half with less role for Karthi and Andrea.The battle scenes towards the end might not be the best we have seen but are great keeping in mind the budget constraint.The visual effects of the film are exceptional again keeping in mind the budget available.The cinematography by ramji is one of the best i have ever seen. His visualization of the battle scenes, kingdom , seas, deserts were so close to reality.G.V.Prakash's BGM score was good but not great which could be the only negative point i see in this movie.Finally the director of this venture Selvaraghavan needs a pat on the back for this great attempt. It might not be as great as his career best Pudupettai but is still one of his best Go and book your tickets as soon as possible !!!!

10,The Pride of Indian Cinema (A movie ahead of its time) - Celebrated after a Decade of its release,"Its a movie worth the word Magnum Opus. A movie with so much detailing. Technically strong movie. Every aspiring film maker should watch this movie. The music keeps lingering inside you for years, one of the finest albums. Its a visual treat, the camera works were amazing. No one would have pitched such a story line in Indian cinema. It is one of those close to reality adventure thriller movies. The colour tones in the movie were amazing especially for a movie shot using film. A unique story line none have explored. Keeps making u think throughout the 180 minutes time. Most unique feature is there are only a few dialogues post interval, none of the characters have long dialogues, just the emotions, the music the premise and art work do the talking. One of the best climax scenes ever in cinematic history. This film is the pride of Indian cinema which people forgot to celebrate and after a decade it is now hailed as a matchless Masterpiece. Definitely needs a sequel as it ended on a very promising and high note. Unlike 2010, now people are ready for it and will celebrate the sequel this time.",pride indian cinema movie ahead its time celebrated after decade its release,its movie worth word magnum opus movie with so much detailing technically strong movie every aspiring film maker should watch this movie music keeps lingering inside you years one finest albums its visual treat camera works were amazing no one would have pitched such story line indian cinema it is one those close reality adventure thriller movies colour tones movie were amazing especially movie shot using film unique story line none have explored keeps making u think throughout 180 minutes time most unique feature is there are only few dialogues post interval none characters have long dialogues just emotions music premise art work do talking one best climax scenes ever cinematic history this film is pride indian cinema which people forgot celebrate after decade it is now hailed as matchless masterpiece definitely needs sequel as it ended very promising high note unlike 2010 now people are ready it will celebrate sequel this time,0.5606349206349206,0.24301587301587302,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9,Aayirathil Oruvan,"""Aayirathil Oruvan is very good Adventure movie i never ever seen before in Tamil movie. Hats off to Selvaraghavan"" by prakash. B W some :With Aayirathil Oruvan, Selvaraghavan has inadvertently opened the Pandora box of a new genre as yet unknown to Tamil movies – Zombies. It is the case of Pirates of the Caribbean meets Dawn of the Death where the ancient Cholas, albeit with whatsoever no connection to the real Cholas as the disclaimer maintains, are reduced to dark-as-charcoal skinned tribesmen living in an unknown island in Vietnam, who are ready to gorge at raw flesh at the mere sight of it since they are starved.So the dark-skinned subjects largely set the tone of the movie and the darkness remains dominant throughout. There is blood and gore, but of a different kind: not the one that makes you squirm, but something that makes you gawk at.Thousands of years ago, when the Cholas were ousted from their homeland by the Pandias, their throne Prince was sent into exile to a secret location by the last Chola King. The Prince also carried with him a priceless statue of the Pandias. No efforts were fruitful at tracing the location and archeologists attempting the same simply disappear without a trace.Aayirathil OruvanAndrea's dad and archaeologist Prathap Pothen vanishes into thin air in his attempt to unravel the mystery. In comes the archaeologist-cum-gun-wielding-designer-sunglasses-sporting ultra modern chick Reema, employed by the Indian government to trace Pothen. Andrea, his daughter, obviously joins in and they employ Karthi and a gang of burly men as helps. Karthi looks as if he's stepped out of his Paruthiveeran sets to join Reema and Andrea in their quest.Their expedition unfurls nasty surprises after surprises - body-painted weirdos with strange weapons, quicksand, snakes. Lest we forget, there is also a cat fight between Reema and Andrea on the topic 'Karthi'. They finally reach the zombie land where Parthiban is the ruler whose raw-flesh-eating subjects take them into custody. Reema reveals her real self and exposes the self-centric purpose of her quest.Karthi has very little to spare for Aayirathil Oruvan. He plays the rustic help, who instantly falls for Reema and Andrea, who cracks witty one-liners much to our delight in the otherwise serious state of affairs. Being his forte, it comes much easier for him without even having to try.Despite having to mouth profound verses in ancient Tamil, Reema manages to only mime them with improper synchronization and it makes her appear as if she's in a Chinese movie. Andrea is multi-talented, but acting, sadly, is not one of those. But her meager dialogues in Madras Tamil are bang on otherwise.G V Prakash's music stands out in the 'Ommele Aasathaan' song and a word about the background score: it's a battle between the background score and the blood thirsty human screeches. We would've loved to write about Eerum Ali's costume designing if only Reema and Andrea were not strutting around in just one pair of satin-shirt-shorts-overalls and sleeveless top and baggies respectively. Karthi leaves no scope for Eerum squarely.Selva's frenziedly unleashed creativity makes you hallucinate towards the end of the movie and delirium sets in soon. It's not enough that a solid disclaimer is in place, a little bit of research about the subject would've helped things in the process. The underdeveloped script lacks everything - starting from strong plot twists to captive locations to graphics to credibility, above all.Aayirathil Oruvan also ends on a very scary end note: about the journey of the Chola prince continuing as Karthi takes up the mantle",aayirathil oruvan,aayirathil oruvan is very good adventure movie i never ever seen before tamil movie hats off selvaraghavan by prakash b w some with aayirathil oruvan selvaraghavan has inadvertently opened pandora box new genre as yet unknown tamil movies zombies it is case pirates caribbean meets dawn death where ancient cholas albeit with whatsoever no connection real cholas as disclaimer maintains are reduced dark as charcoal skinned tribesmen living unknown island vietnam who are ready gorge at raw flesh at mere sight it since they are starved so dark skinned subjects largely set tone movie darkness remains dominant throughout there is blood gore but different kind not one that makes you squirm but something that makes you gawk at thousands years ago when cholas were ousted their homeland by pandias their throne prince was sent into exile secret location by last chola king prince also carried with him priceless statue pandias no efforts were fruitful at tracing location archeologists attempting same simply disappear without trace aayirathil oruvanandreas dad archaeologist prathap pothen vanishes into thin air his attempt unravel mystery comes archaeologist cum gun wielding designer sunglasses sporting ultra modern chick reema employed by indian government trace pothen andrea his daughter obviously joins they employ karthi gang burly men as helps karthi looks as if hes stepped out his paruthiveeran sets join reema andrea their quest their expedition unfurls nasty surprises after surprises body painted weirdos with strange weapons quicksand snakes lest we forget there is also cat fight between reema andrea topic karthi they finally reach zombie land where parthiban is ruler whose raw flesh eating subjects take them into custody reema reveals her real self exposes self centric purpose her quest karthi has very little spare aayirathil oruvan he plays rustic help who instantly falls reema andrea who cracks witty one liners much our delight otherwise serious state affairs being his forte it comes much easier him without even having try despite having mouth profound verses ancient tamil reema manages only mime them with improper synchronization it makes her appear as if shes chinese movie andrea is multi talented but acting sadly is not one those but her meager dialogues madras tamil are bang otherwise g v prakashs music stands out ommele aasathaan song word about background score its battle between background score blood thirsty human screeches we wouldve loved write about eerum alis costume designing if only reema andrea were not strutting around just one pair satin shirt shorts overalls sleeveless top baggies respectively karthi leaves no scope eerum squarely selvas frenziedly unleashed creativity makes you hallucinate towards end movie delirium sets soon its not enough that solid disclaimer is place little bit research about subject wouldve helped things process underdeveloped script lacks everything starting strong plot twists captive locations graphics credibility above all aayirathil oruvan also ends very scary end note about journey chola prince continuing as karthi takes up mantle,0.5270000605455152,0.037900501014137375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9,A New Genre in Indian Cinema!!,"Aayiratthil Oruvan is a new Genre to Indian Cinema. No one has ever tried or attempted this kind of a Plot. Selvaraghavan has excelled in his part of screenplay and direction. Its really a tough one to direct. Actors have given their best. Karthi Reema Sen and Andrea have done their jobs perfectly. The First half of the movie is enjoyable for all people whereas to enjoy the second half you need patience and good observing powers. Selva has his own directorial touches. This Scene should surely be mentioned where a women shows how hungry she is. Coming to Visual Effects,this is the only place where we're lacking behind Hollywood People.The art director Santhanam has done a neat job. G.V.Prakash comes up with his best Music and BGM so far. The Movie as a whole is absolutely awesome, but could've been presented in a much understandable manner.Movie's Major Plus1. Screenplay and Direction 2. Background Music 3. Casting 4. Plot 5.Locations where the film is shotMovie's Major Minus1. Visual Effects(not so realistic) 2. Less Usage of the So called Hero Karthi 3. Too Much of Vulgarity which wasn't needed for this script 4. Incomplete Climax 5.Unable to deliver the plot to all classesNo one has the right to rate a film except the makers of it. Because they are the one who has taken the effort and faced the problems in making it. So i am not supposed to rate this film. But this tremendous effort should be appreciated.

8,Good Attempt......,"I went to this movie with lot of expectations but I was pretty much disappointed. There are so many goof ups in the movie and so many questions left unanswered or at least doesn't provide a clear explanation, like, has the king got magical powers for he is able to fight Reema by getting hold of her shadow, why do they run crazy when they reach the lost chola city, and Reema too seem to have got some magical powers for she is able to portray a tiger symbol at her back in a flash and is able to fight back the magical saint (or whomever is he) when people were trying to burn them, what exactly happens when Karthik is fighting the big guy in the fight-area organized by king for he cud see people around him as skeletons, at-times they are missing and suddenly our crying Karthik starts fighting like a legend etc etc. Also, there are few scenes in the movie that may seem illogical and unnecessary. Though, I feel, the story is very good, the graphic scenes are very poor. We could see the effects of few Hollywood movies with a poor attempt. The climax is rather disappointing with cholas fighting the army people. We understand the budget is very less, but some scenes could have been filmed in a better way, with the available budget. Some scenes like, Reema and Andrea holding Karthik to fight chillness in forest makes audience enjoy the movie for a short period, until they get puzzled why would something like that happen on another scene or get disappointed by poor graphic scenes.On the whole, I would say this is a very good attempt by the director, and could be a new beginning for Tamil cinema. I feel, a movie of this kind, that has a really good story should be filmed in high budget, rather than filming in a poor budget making the film prone to poor comments and a relatively bad cinematic experience. I would still give this movie a rating 8, for the very good attempt by the director.",good attempt,i went this movie with lot expectations but i was pretty much disappointed there are so many goof ups movie so many questions left unanswered or at least doesnt provide clear explanation like has king got magical powers he is able fight reema by getting hold her shadow why do they run crazy when they reach lost chola city reema too seem have got some magical powers she is able portray tiger symbol at her back flash is able fight back magical saint or whomever is he when people were trying burn them what exactly happens when karthik is fighting big guy fight area organized by king he cud see people around him as skeletons at times they are missing suddenly our crying karthik starts fighting like legend etc etc also there are few scenes movie that may seem illogical unnecessary though i feel story is very good graphic scenes are very poor we could see effects few hollywood movies with poor attempt climax is rather disappointing with cholas fighting army people we understand budget is very less but some scenes could have been filmed better way with available budget some scenes like reema andrea holding karthik fight chillness forest makes audience enjoy movie short period until they get puzzled why would something like that happen another scene or get disappointed by poor graphic scenes whole i would say this is very good attempt by director could be new beginning tamil cinema i feel movie this kind that has really good story should be filmed high budget rather than filming poor budget making film prone poor comments relatively bad cinematic experience i would still give this movie rating 8 very good attempt by director,0.5205242424242424,0.07579393939393936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.28}"

8,Still we need the real Aayirathil Oruvan,"So we have one of the most expected movies which were in the making for nearly 2 years has finally arrived. This time Selvaraghavan has chosen fantasy genre with a traveling adventure. Not just Selva, we have Karthi, Andrea and Reema adding to our expectations.It's an adventure fantasy to discover the Chola dynasty. Isn't it quite a simple plot? But Selva doesn't leave it there; he has utilized the genre very well to give a good gripping adventure throughout the first half. The basic adventure which always starts with a big gang and gradually gets reduce because of various obstacles on their journey is well scripted. Of course, any adventure movie will certainly get a share from the ace Indiana Jones and traces of National Treasure when the script deals with history treasure hunt. Aayirathil Oruvan is no exception. But the CG isn't satisfactory for this adventure fantasy. Did Selva by any chance thought whether he could at least get to this extent? The adventure goes through forest, sea, dessert, etc., and most of them where computer generated and it's quite evident from the poor graphics or at least not a satisfactory visuals. And when they finally discovers the dynasty where Chola live(d), we have a big surprise and then the story shifts from fantasy to a period movie. Selva, unveils too many things in the Chola episode that it makes the audience to squeeze their brains to know what is what and who is who? Of course, there are a few loop holes or rather illogical or how is it possible scenes in the movie, but let's not dig them hard in a fantasy movie as everything is left to our imagination. There are quite interesting scenes in the movie like the movie starts and ends with the same situation, where there will be a scene of elope of Cholo dynasty with different time intervals but with same intention by the same enemies. It was just beautifully designed by the director. It was a destiny for Karthi to be the 'Thoodhuvan'. Moving towards the Climax, there will be literally no dialogue and it's the scenes that speak for themselves.Talking about the performance, to be really honest, there isn't any big scope to unveil performance in the movie. But it doesn't mean that they have done a poor show either. They gave what the character needed. But it was certainly a big disappointment from Parthiban, as it was almost kept clueless about his get up in the movie and with minimum dialogue to the character, we couldn't see our usual non stop talking Parthiban. Reema Sen had a much more important role than Karthi and Andrea in the movie. She has done it neatly, though she still needs to improve on the accent and lip sync, but she had tried really hard to give that. Karthi had shades of Paruthiveeran with almost the same get up with the beard striking more Paruthiveeran. Andrea didn't have any big job for her role.Fantasy? What about the visuals? Ramji has handled the camera and he has done a very good job shooting in the dessert and a few dark shots with gloomy environment. Oh Eesa song, though it was not needed at that situation, it was shot well with vampire effect. Also the red indians shot sequences were also shot brilliantly with proper color correction. Being a travel adventure, the day night, gloomy evening color corrections have been carefully done and had made the end product good. But as I said earlier, the CG was not up to the standards. But considering the budget of the movie, I would probably say they have done a fair job with the budget given to them.It was a sheer disappointment from GVP when it comes to BGM. It was good in parts, only in certain scenes, but in most of the scenes, BGM sucked big time with poor instrumental. Being a fantasy film, it could have given some fantasy BGM for gripping adventure but it wasn't convincing for the audience to hear our typical stand alone BGM. I remember 3-4 songs being used from the album. Everyone disappointed with the exclusion of Maalai Neram song. Out of the 3-4 songs used, they aren't needed for the story. Though they were good, they stand as odd man out while watching the movie.Kola Bhasker has done a smooth editing, but even when he does his job to the perfection, we have our master editor Censor board has edited a lot of scenes because of which we had several jumps in the movie.GO FOR IT!!",still we need real aayirathil oruvan,so we have one most expected movies which were making nearly 2 years has finally arrived this time selvaraghavan has chosen fantasy genre with traveling adventure not just selva we have karthi andrea reema adding our expectations its adventure fantasy discover chola dynasty isnt it quite simple plot but selva doesnt leave it there he has utilized genre very well give good gripping adventure throughout first half basic adventure which always starts with big gang gradually gets reduce because various obstacles their journey is well scripted course any adventure movie will certainly get share ace indiana jones traces national treasure when script deals with history treasure hunt aayirathil oruvan is no exception but cg isnt satisfactory this adventure fantasy did selva by any chance thought whether he could at least get this extent adventure goes through forest sea dessert etc most them where computer generated its quite evident poor graphics or at least not satisfactory visuals when they finally discovers dynasty where chola live d we have big surprise then story shifts fantasy period movie selva unveils too many things chola episode that it makes audience squeeze their brains know what is what who is who course there are few loop holes or rather illogical or how is it possible scenes movie but lets not dig them hard fantasy movie as everything is left our imagination there are quite interesting scenes movie like movie starts ends with same situation where there will be scene elope cholo dynasty with different time intervals but with same intention by same enemies it was just beautifully designed by director it was destiny karthi be thoodhuvan moving towards climax there will be literally no dialogue its scenes that speak themselves talking about performance be really honest there isnt any big scope unveil performance movie but it doesnt mean that they have done poor show either they gave what character needed but it was certainly big disappointment parthiban as it was almost kept clueless about his get up movie with minimum dialogue character we couldnt see our usual non stop talking parthiban reema sen had much more important role than karthi andrea movie she has done it neatly though she still needs improve accent lip sync but she had tried really hard give that karthi had shades paruthiveeran with almost same get up with beard striking more paruthiveeran andrea didnt have any big job her role fantasy what about visuals ramji has handled camera he has done very good job shooting dessert few dark shots with gloomy environment oh eesa song though it was not needed at that situation it was shot well with vampire effect also red indians shot sequences were also shot brilliantly with proper color correction being travel adventure day night gloomy evening color corrections have been carefully done had made end product good but as i said earlier cg was not up standards but considering budget movie i would probably say they have done fair job with budget given them it was sheer disappointment gvp when it comes bgm it was good parts only certain scenes but most scenes bgm sucked big time with poor instrumental being fantasy film it could have given some fantasy bgm gripping adventure but it wasnt convincing audience hear our typical stand alone bgm i remember 3 4 songs being used album everyone disappointed with exclusion maalai neram song out 3 4 songs used they arent needed story though they were good they stand as odd man out while watching movie kola bhasker has done smooth editing but even when he does his job perfection we have our master editor censor board has edited lot scenes because which we had several jumps movie go it,0.4843444444444446,0.11238802308802313,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,Underappreciated Classical Histroical Period Drama with Depth,"Please correct the spelling of the title to ""Aayirathil Oruvan"". This movie takes a lot of facts from the tamil kingdom chola history , ponniyin selvan(well celebrated novel series by Kalki Krishnamoorty in 1920's) and mixes some amount of fiction coupled with a what if scenario of what would have transpired if the pandyas had tracked down the cholas(although there is a conjecture that it was found out, it remains to be verified if such an event did occur in the first place) Much like how Hey Ram was underappreciated and misconstrued movie of 2010 due to sheer ignorance and immaturity of the local audience to receive the movie( of which I was a part of ),ignorance about the tamil and tamil kingdom history of international community coupled with limited budget, lmited marketing led to its limited recognition it enjoys till date (if it had an extravagant budget, the translation from script to the screen could have been seamless, immaculate and impeccable such is the depth of the script). The movie literally translates to one among the thousand, which metaphorically represents that the messenger to the chola kingdom is among the party of people being a part of the rescue operation of Mr. Chandramouli (Pratap Poten), an archaelogist who goes missing during the excavation of primitive chola kingdom ruins found in Vietnam. The rescue party organised by the then government consist of Muthu (Karthi) and his entourage of workers as a labourers, Lavanya Chandramouli (Andrea Jeremiah), an archaeologist herself, Anita Pandian (Reema Sen) and her team from army. The movie opens with a reminiscence of the defeat of cholas in 1279 AD(which according to actual records marked the year chola fled to other southeast asian countries upon defeat) in hands of pandyas at Tanjore and fled with the family deity statue of the Pandyas to seek refuge in Vietnam. Although, the superficial reason was a rescue mission, the main underlying reason for a part of the entourage is to retrieve the family deity statue from the remnants of cholas believed to be still surviving in the caves of Vietnam. The entourage travel by sea, force their way through seven hurdles (similar to the seven paths under the tanjore siva temple in tamilnadu, believed to have served as underground catacombs for escape of the civilians and if need be the whole kingdom in the event of war. It even believed that many people were lost or died of hunger) tribals only to be attacked by red indian cannibals, the protection force for the king. However, they fail in the event only to commit suicide or seppuku(similar to what a samurai does) as they had failed in their duty, a honourable way to die. They are further confronted by mysterious sea creatures and hoard of poisonous snakes which attack humans. Very few of the entourage succeed in surviving these hurdles to reach a desert like area which has a Nataraja statue(Lord shiva striking a Dance pose) ensconced in a stone hedge like arrangement. The entourage realize they can only cross the sands which are bobby trapped , when the Nataraja statue casts its shadow when the sun is at a specific angle. The entourage are forced to survive scorching heat and cross this penultimate hurdle in the events of which they are followed by a mysterious being. As they reach the ruins they celebrate their success, they are drugged under the magical influence of the mysterious being who inspects the trio for being the possibility of messenger. They are taken to the current place of residence of the remnants of the chola kingdom, unconscious, where it is discovered that they had lost their refinement associated with civilized human being and are in a state of being totally impoverished, lack of food and are forced live like early human beings. We are then introduced to the then King(Partheiban.K), who rukes with a iron hand to the extent of punishing people who had not followed his command. Anita Tricks the king into believing that she is the true messenger, despite the apprehensions of the mysterious being revealed to advisor or Rajaguru of chola dynasty and is revealed to have sorcery abilities much more than Anita. The king then conducts a colloseum to recruit the most deserving person among the entourage, in which karthi emerges victorious concurrently finds the missing archaeologist who is now out of his mind. The advisor realizes that Muthu might be the messenger that the painting talk about. The events unfold as portrayed by the cave paintings which depicts the fall and resurgence of the chola kingdom. Upon realizing their betrayal, the followers contemplate suicide or sepukku, the king initially , only to be stopped by other. They are forced on to the war against the pandyas to defend their territory(much like the warfare techniques used back in days). Although they hold a temporary advantage intially (according the early warfare single retreat is considered as a defeat, the opposition retreats initially). The opposition consisting of army men use treachery and modern weaponry to easily over power the remnants. They stoop so low so as to rape and ill-treat the wives and women of the remnants whilst them being chained( this is a part of modern Indian History where it is believed to have been inspired from and ties into the issue of ill treatment of women and men belonging LTTE during the early days of protest in demand of a separate county for srilankan tamils). Lavanya saves the King and others chained. The King Haucinates to the arrival of ships and chants the name of almighty ""Thennarkuriya Sivane Potri(Hail lord Siva), along with the followers die drowning in the sea. The next heir to the throne is saved in knick of time by Muthu, who used sorcery gained from the then advisor to survive, bid for the time for his return to Tanjore and claim the rightful throne.

3,What a mess...,"I waited more than a year eagerly, after its announcement, to saw a great Historical movie.The title itself first disappointed me, with a disclaimer. I changed my mind to watch it as a Adventure film, instead of a Historical film by seeing some of the opening scenes.First half of the movie took me in front of the seat, with lots of adventures things. I didn't minded about the vulgarer scenes, I was crucial on cinematic's, and how extant they are on visual improvements. The top angle shots at the harbors, the cinematic views of rain forest are wonderful, but I saw lots of color depth differences on each shots, which made them very artificial.The First half made me think (with a re-mix of ""Atho andha paravai polla vazhavendum"") the 30 labors are going to smash the second half with hero Karthi against Cholas, so that it makes sense with the title ""Aayeratil Oruvan."" but thats not happened, OK thats the screen play.The acting of the main actors at the time of interval is awesome. The stunt scenes with Red people is OK, its not with any Hollywood standard.In second half, introduction of Chola king and the scenes around the king is very artificial and does not matches with the pried of Cholas (OK this is not a Historical film). The scenes next to the Kings introduction are Fantasy like Vitalachariya films. So I changed my mind to watch a Fantasy film. Here the mess up starts. Why these peoples are living in caves hiding themselves, even though they have setup traps? I guess no one can escape from that Psychological trap, thats the end right? the only way to escape it, is another magic. So why they can't live happily ever after without showing there real identity, mixing up with peoples of Vietnam, like the Pandians do in Tamil Nadu?I don't know why the lighting hits the Cholan solder when he tries to kill Karthi, and why the Magic of that old man fails with Cholan to show Karthi as a ""Thuduvan.""The peoples in the Caves are not able to go out and have fun so they have a stadium with in their premises (the scene reminds us Gladiator, if they have such plenty of outer space in the hidden cave I swear the Cholans will grow crops for there food, instead of eating meat). The game is rock swinger hits the Slaves to death. When the Chola King becomes very happy and throws golden ornaments to him. The rock swinger is not going to have anything with the ornament. Suddenly a heaven like thing opens on the sky which gives ability to Karthi to kill the rock swinger.If Cholan can hold (or hang) the girl Anitha (Reema) by holding her shadow, is it not possible for him to stop the bullets from the Machine guns like Neo do in Matrix? and to make Fantasy magical work against the Pandiyas to protect his daughter and wife from a gang rape? In these scenes it becomes a Historical action film, because the Cholas do not uses the magical powers against the week weaponed Pandians.If the Pandians let the Cholas or take Cholas to Tamil Nadu after grabbing their beloved Statue of the unknown god of Fantasy (or History?). The Cholas are not going to regain any power in Tamil Nadu they will be treated as Tamil diaspora, then why the Pandian troop wants to kill them and rape their womens, is Padians are that much crucial (OK its not a Historical film, so Selva wants me to change my mind once again watching a Masala film).At the climax the ""Thudhuvan"" i.e. Karthi makes some Fantasy magical thing and becomes vanished from the eyes of the Pandian solders (i.e. the Indian Military).Finally I found lots of loop holes, miss continuity, Mess up ... so and so... with this film.Selva I expected more from you! I don't know where you lost the Plot. You had a Brave heart to show the breast of a mother with blood instead of milk on Indian cinema, But failed to show a true historical subject, what we exactly expected. Why you hide behind a disclaimer? Why you hide behind a statue of unnamed God?Showing vulgar (as Indians thought) things on screen is not only bravery. You should show what you are about to, or you should not made such a press meet (Audio release). What kind of Historical work around you and your team made for this film? I don't find any relevance with Chola and Pandya war strategies, or life styles, or Civilization or anything?If you say just watch the film and enjoy! I can simply go to Vettaikaran.The entire Credit goes to the Producer to make such a turning point in Tamil Cinema, Hats off Dream Valley, Best of luck for next time.",what mess,i waited more than year eagerly after its announcement saw great historical movie title itself first disappointed me with disclaimer i changed my mind watch it as adventure film instead historical film by seeing some opening scenes first half movie took me front seat with lots adventures things i didnt minded about vulgarer scenes i was crucial cinematics how extant they are visual improvements top angle shots at harbors cinematic views rain forest are wonderful but i saw lots color depth differences each shots which made them very artificial first half made me think with re mix atho andha paravai polla vazhavendum 30 labors are going smash second half with hero karthi against cholas so that it makes sense with title aayeratil oruvan but thats not happened ok thats screen play acting main actors at time interval is awesome stunt scenes with red people is ok its not with any hollywood standard second half introduction chola king scenes around king is very artificial does not matches with pried cholas ok this is not historical film scenes next kings introduction are fantasy like vitalachariya films so i changed my mind watch fantasy film here mess up starts why these peoples are living caves hiding themselves even though they have setup traps i guess no one can escape that psychological trap thats end right only way escape it is another magic so why they cant live happily ever after without showing there real identity mixing up with peoples vietnam like pandians do tamil nadu i dont know why lighting hits cholan solder when he tries kill karthi why magic that old man fails with cholan show karthi as thuduvan peoples caves are not able go out have fun so they have stadium with their premises scene reminds us gladiator if they have such plenty outer space hidden cave i swear cholans will grow crops there food instead eating meat game is rock swinger hits slaves death when chola king becomes very happy throws golden ornaments him rock swinger is not going have anything with ornament suddenly heaven like thing opens sky which gives ability karthi kill rock swinger if cholan can hold or hang girl anitha reema by holding her shadow is it not possible him stop bullets machine guns like neo do matrix make fantasy magical work against pandiyas protect his daughter wife gang rape these scenes it becomes historical action film because cholas do not uses magical powers against week weaponed pandians if pandians let cholas or take cholas tamil nadu after grabbing their beloved statue unknown god fantasy or history cholas are not going regain any power tamil nadu they will be treated as tamil diaspora then why pandian troop wants kill them rape their womens is padians are that much crucial ok its not historical film so selva wants me change my mind once again watching masala film at climax thudhuvan i e karthi makes some fantasy magical thing becomes vanished eyes pandian solders i e indian military finally i found lots loop holes miss continuity mess up so so with this film selva i expected more you i dont know where you lost plot you had brave heart show breast mother with blood instead milk indian cinema but failed show true historical subject what we exactly expected why you hide behind disclaimer why you hide behind statue unnamed god showing vulgar as indians thought things screen is not only bravery you should show what you are about or you should not made such press meet audio release what kind historical work around you your team made this film i dont find any relevance with chola pandya war strategies or life styles or civilization or anything if you say just watch film enjoy i can simply go vettaikaran entire credit goes producer make such turning point tamil cinema hats off dream valley best luck next time,0.4616238630283574,0.1090308380757819,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8,Flawed but great attempt,"Indian cinema doesn't have much fantasy-adventure movies. This is probably one of a kind in history of Indian movies. This could've been so much better if it had better cinematography, greater budget, and a refined screenplay. It's the budget that prevents them from having better VFX. But the action sequences could've been done different. They should've used a really terrifying sword fighter instead of that ball throwing guy. It was even unnecessary. The scene is clearly copied from Gladiator. And there is so many plot holes. I won't be mentioning any since it would spoil the movie for you. But we have to appreciate the effort by Selvaraghavan. I hope he overcomes his flaws in the sequel.",flawed but great attempt,indian cinema doesnt have much fantasy adventure movies this is probably one kind history indian movies this couldve been so much better if it had better cinematography greater budget refined screenplay its budget that prevents them having better vfx but action sequences couldve been done different they shouldve used really terrifying sword fighter instead that ball throwing guy it was even unnecessary scene is clearly copied gladiator there is so many plot holes i wont be mentioning any since it would spoil movie you but we have appreciate effort by selvaraghavan i hope he overcomes his flaws sequel,0.5595238095238094,0.17142857142857146,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9,One of the rare tamil films,"Firstly I would like to congratulate the director for his bold effort in making this movie.We often see commercials flicks and never get a chance to see an epic movie in Tamil Let me start from the 1st half. all the way entertaining and every song in the 1st half is choreographed differently. u will see some brilliant visuals. the background music is also great in this movie. the last song of the 1st half Un Melaa Asaa thaan is very catchy. Karthi, Andrea and Reema have understood the story so well and u will see them getting along with the plot so well and the movie moves around with rapid pace. Enter 2nd half and Parthiban. He is definitely in line to get an award for his role.To construct such a set and to dress up so many people like nomads requires a lot of time and patience. The director has spent so much thought to visualise the people of chola dynasty and his efforts can be seen on the screen. The last twenty minutes will leave the viewers wondering should the movie end like this. But the director is clearly winning from this strategy. U go and watch a visual great epic tamil movie and think it was the best way to end the movie. The camera and director make this movie work.I have seen the movie twice and im definitely going to watch it again and only in the cinema hall only. A must watch movie for all south indians.",one rare tamil films,firstly i would like congratulate director his bold effort making this movie we often see commercials flicks never get chance see epic movie tamil let me start 1st half all way entertaining every song 1st half is choreographed differently u will see some brilliant visuals background music is also great this movie last song 1st half un melaa asaa thaan is very catchy karthi andrea reema have understood story so well u will see them getting along with plot so well movie moves around with rapid pace enter 2nd half parthiban he is definitely line get award his role construct such set dress up so many people like nomads requires lot time patience director has spent so much thought visualise people chola dynasty his efforts can be seen screen last twenty minutes will leave viewers wondering should movie end like this but director is clearly winning this strategy u go watch visual great epic tamil movie think it was best way end movie camera director make this movie work i have seen movie twice im definitely going watch it again only cinema hall only must watch movie all south indians,0.446551724137931,0.1971264367816092,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7,"Bold attempt, disappointing climax","Selvaragavan has made a bold attempt in making an historic movie without the usual clichés of Tamil cinemas. I also want to mention that this movie is a complete fantasy and no records suggests the authenticity of the facts mentioned in the movie. As i've established the movie is a pure fantasy there are places in the movie where you are bound to see various clippings from Hollywood movies like the war scene where the tactics were taken from last samurai and also the famous gladiator scene.But apart from that the movie's first half has some awesome visuals and settings which is a revolution in Tamil cinema. The first half of the film while make you sit on your edge and also it is made in an adventure type. But the second half of the movie was ridiculous, first of all showing the Tamil people as cannibals was not good and also there were some silly magic present in the second half. If Selvaragavan would have concentrated more on the cinematography rather than the visual settings the movie would have been a perfect one. There were lots of plot holes in the second half, and as the movie progresses you get irritated in Reema Sen's role and also the director pathetically copy the Lara Croft, yes, thats true. Andrea's character has no real importance and it was totally eliminated at the end. Some scenes were really unbelievable and not in a good way, the scene were Reema Sen's blood poisons the soldiers made me laugh.The most foolish character was the leader of the mercenary team. The Indian army or the mercenaries were just crawling at the end war scene. Apparently the director didn't think about the amount of opposition in just moving a single gun. would sanction the massacre of all those people at the climax war. The guy was not even holding his gun correctly and made a very foolish attempt at the scene were he was wearing a traditional Pandian dress and giving orders. Also I didn't think professional soldiers would behave in that way at the end and this proves that the guys were mercenaries and not the Army. In reality no government would allow the recruitment of mercenary and it is done only as a last resort, but i'm going to let go of this logic as majority of the audience would not notice it.Karthi made a memorable performance at the beginning of the movie but his character was also reduced at the end. Also I think the director had so much confidence in himself, he believed that the movie would be a success and a sequel would be taken later. I'm hoping the sequel would be much better than this.",bold attempt disappointing climax,selvaragavan has made bold attempt making historic movie without usual clich s tamil cinemas i also want mention that this movie is complete fantasy no records suggests authenticity facts mentioned movie as ive established movie is pure fantasy there are places movie where you are bound see various clippings hollywood movies like war scene where tactics were taken last samurai also famous gladiator scene but apart that movies first half has some awesome visuals settings which is revolution tamil cinema first half film while make you sit your edge also it is made adventure type but second half movie was ridiculous first all showing tamil people as cannibals was not good also there were some silly magic present second half if selvaragavan would have concentrated more cinematography rather than visual settings movie would have been perfect one there were lots plot holes second half as movie progresses you get irritated reema sens role also director pathetically copy lara croft yes thats true andreas character has no real importance it was totally eliminated at end some scenes were really unbelievable not good way scene were reema sens blood poisons soldiers made me laugh most foolish character was leader mercenary team indian army or mercenaries were just crawling at end war scene apparently director didnt think about amount opposition just moving single gun would sanction massacre all those people at climax war guy was not even holding his gun correctly made very foolish attempt at scene were he was wearing traditional pandian dress giving orders also i didnt think professional soldiers would behave that way at end this proves that guys were mercenaries not army reality no government would allow recruitment mercenary it is done only as last resort but im going let go this logic as majority audience would not notice it karthi made memorable performance at beginning movie but his character was also reduced at end also i think director had so much confidence himself he believed that movie would be success sequel would be taken later im hoping sequel would be much better than this,0.4187857142857143,0.09785714285714285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.42}"
4,Not so much as expected...,"We (Me and My brother) go to theater to watch this film one and only for Selvaragavan. But this time Ayerathil Oruvan, become a fail.Yes today we gone to Ayerathil Oruvan. I guess the director of the film is not Selvaragavan. Because Its not a bit equal to his previous films, except the usual A rating things. WE are totally upset. 1. Before the film starts they advices us that ""This film is 100% Imagination, The words Chola and Pandya mentioned are not the exact dynasties"". But we are not able to, while seeing the movie.2. There is No story like Mahadeera, happened in TELUGUS (Andhra), But they made there people to proud them self, about there dynasty, by showing this FICTION in a fantastic way.The story of Spartans (300) was not real that was a naval written by Frank Miller, But many of my surrounding believes that it was happened once.The CHOLA's were once the night mares for the Pirates in the Indian ocean protecting the Silk route. We can have lots of incidents from them. But not like this worst. 3. I was angry on Mheal Gibson because of Apocalypto, the Mayans are not that much crucial to make human sacrifices (even they lived 5000yrs before),But in Ayerathil Oruvan we (TAMILS) are showed as Cannibals, I was totally upset seeing those scenes. And it bothered others too while watching those scenes.4. The Story starts and moves to a narrow point till the Interval. The main Actors (Karthi, Remasen, Andrea) are brilliant (ex-specially the psychotic scene at the Interval), except Parthiban he is not fit for the Mighty Cholan character.5. This film was planned to release 2 yrs before, but I say it should be released 25 yrs before because the Climax war scenes are the biggest comedy I ever seen in Tamil Cinema. The Stupid, Bloody military officer Ravi he made some serous scenes to a comedy one, he even don't know how to hold the MACHINE GUN's, big stupidity we always do in Tamil cinema. He must be trained for that. Not only him all the Military officers are not holding the guns properly even in a single scene. 7. CG works are brilliant, but not on all scenes. The scenes are not detailed well and the artificial lightings are too bad.8. There are lots of Loop holes and unsolved questions. ex: The Cholas spread culture, architecture, to entire south east Asia and one of the oldest civilization, still in life. Then why the descendant of Chola and his peoples are behaving like Cannibals? Why they they are so Drak? don't tell me ""This film is 100% Imagination.""***Spoiler***8. Climax rape scenes are unwanted and unrelated to the story, that gave a A grade to the film (I guess Selvaragavan wants it). *************9. Music and Background score are OK, not as much as Selvaragavans previous films.2012 is also a visual treat, it could be a block buster. But it failed to full fill the Quests. ITS SAME for Ayerathil Oruvan.This film is a big turning point to TAMIL cinema, only on Visual things with CG. Not with story, screen play, direction etc.,",not so much as expected,we me my brother go theater watch this film one only selvaragavan but this time ayerathil oruvan become fail yes today we gone ayerathil oruvan i guess director film is not selvaragavan because its not bit equal his previous films except usual rating things we are totally upset 1 before film starts they advices us that this film is 100 imagination words chola pandya mentioned are not exact dynasties but we are not able while seeing movie 2 there is no story like mahadeera happened telugus andhra but they made there people proud them self about there dynasty by showing this fiction fantastic way story spartans 300 was not real that was naval written by frank miller but many my surrounding believes that it was happened once cholas were once night mares pirates indian ocean protecting silk route we can have lots incidents them but not like this worst 3 i was angry mheal gibson because apocalypto mayans are not that much crucial make human sacrifices even they lived 5000yrs before but ayerathil oruvan we tamils are showed as cannibals i was totally upset seeing those scenes it bothered others too while watching those scenes 4 story starts moves narrow point till interval main actors karthi remasen andrea are brilliant ex specially psychotic scene at interval except parthiban he is not fit mighty cholan character 5 this film was planned release 2 yrs before but i say it should be released 25 yrs before because climax war scenes are biggest comedy i ever seen tamil cinema stupid bloody military officer ravi he made some serous scenes comedy one he even dont know how hold machine guns big stupidity we always do tamil cinema he must be trained that not only him all military officers are not holding guns properly even single scene 7 cg works are brilliant but not all scenes scenes are not detailed well artificial lightings are too bad 8 there are lots loop holes unsolved questions ex cholas spread culture architecture entire south east asia one oldest civilization still life then why descendant chola his peoples are behaving like cannibals why they they are so drak dont tell me this film is 100 imagination spoiler 8 climax rape scenes are unwanted unrelated story that gave grade film i guess selvaragavan wants it 9 music background score are ok not as much as selvaragavans previous films 2012 is also visual treat it could be block buster but it failed full fill quests its same ayerathil oruvan this film is big turning point tamil cinema only visual things with cg not with story screen play direction etc,0.5341350826044706,-0.06557337220602526,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1,"Very bad, horrible cinema","I wish I could give it less than 1 on 10. This movie is disgusting to say the least. Right from the screenplay to the post production stuff like graphics and special effects, everything is absolutely poor. Selvaraghavan , who built himself good reputation with romantic movies like 7/G Rainbow colony and Adavari Maatalakku Arthalu Verule and dark movies like Pudhupetai and Kadhal Kondein just loses it all with this movie. You definitely don't expect a movie which was in the making for over 2 years to be this bad! Selvaraghavan challenged that if someone could prove that Aayirathil Oruvan was inspired/copied from another movie, he would quit directing movies. Well, if Aayirathil Oruvan is going to be the kind of movies he is going to make in the future, then he might as well quit cinema right now. Accepting his challenge, I can prove that this movie was copied from not just one other but at least 3- 4 other Hollywood films (The Mummy, Mackenna's Gold, Apocalypto, Gladiator to name a few) The screenplay is poor in the first half and gets worse and worse progressively with every scene in the 2nd half of the movie. The movie beats logic completely. I would have bought the idea of time travel (which was what the movie was initially said to be based on) to this uninteresting idea where the writer wants us to believe that Cholas lived as cannibals feeding on each other in a far off land for 1000 years completely unaffected by the external world. One particularly funny scene (which was obviously not intended to be funny) was that Reema Sen, a lady from the Paandiya clan converses with the Chola King Parthiban in ancient Tamil but suddenly starts singing in Telugu. And graphics; this movie scores the all time low in the special effects department. Having spent so much money on unnecessary and badly choreographed war scenes, the producer could have forced the director to give better special effects by chipping in a little more money, at least to make serious scenes look serious and not funny or disgusting. Worst graphics you'll ever see. And after giving the worst movie in ages, Selvaraghavan actually had the audacity to call James Cameron's Avatar meaningless and devoid of a plot. Avatar is a zillion times better than this crap that Selvaraghavan has given. GV Prakash's soundtrack is impressive and it gives u a feel of the movie. It was definitely an important element that created expectations before the movie was released. However, Selvaraghavan fails to utilize the best song of the album ""Indha Paadhai"" sung by Prakash himself. This movie is bad. Very bad. Very Very bad.",very bad horrible cinema,i wish i could give it less than 1 10 this movie is disgusting say least right screenplay post production stuff like graphics special effects everything is absolutely poor selvaraghavan who built himself good reputation with romantic movies like 7 g rainbow colony adavari maatalakku arthalu verule dark movies like pudhupetai kadhal kondein just loses it all with this movie you definitely dont expect movie which was making over 2 years be this bad selvaraghavan challenged that if someone could prove that aayirathil oruvan was inspired copied another movie he would quit directing movies well if aayirathil oruvan is going be kind movies he is going make future then he might as well quit cinema right now accepting his challenge i can prove that this movie was copied not just one other but at least 3 4 other hollywood films mummy mackennas gold apocalypto gladiator name few screenplay is poor first half gets worse worse progressively with every scene 2nd half movie movie beats logic completely i would have bought idea time travel which was what movie was initially said be based this uninteresting idea where writer wants us believe that cholas lived as cannibals feeding each other far off land 1000 years completely unaffected by external world one particularly funny scene which was obviously not intended be funny was that reema sen lady paandiya clan converses with chola king parthiban ancient tamil but suddenly starts singing telugu graphics this movie scores all time low special effects department having spent so much money unnecessary badly choreographed war scenes producer could have forced director give better special effects by chipping little more money at least make serious scenes look serious not funny or disgusting worst graphics youll ever see after giving worst movie ages selvaraghavan actually had audacity call james camerons avatar meaningless devoid plot avatar is zillion times better than this crap that selvaraghavan has given gv prakashs soundtrack is impressive it gives u feel movie it was definitely important element that created expectations before movie was released however selvaraghavan fails utilize best song album indha paadhai sung by prakash himself this movie is bad very bad very very bad,0.5290200138026225,-0.13610593512767422,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
