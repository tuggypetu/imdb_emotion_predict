10.0,Entertaining and Thought-Provoking.,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""Look closer.10/10",entertaining thought provoking,250 films ive seen rated imdb only one other schindlers list is as good as american beauty film like this not only entertains while youre theater but also drops subtle questions your head about nature human behavior gulf between fantasy reality after watching this movie viewers will think long hard about their own lives as well as lives people around them movie spells out social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but cant really grasp american beauty reminds us that like lester we really have no idea what we really want were not rational creatures as economists assume we are our instinct might lead us perform one action yet our brains might tell us perform complete opposite we may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them lester may lust after angela yet once he feels her his hands finds out truth about her sexuality entirely different feeling comes over him ricky fits drug dealing boy next door is able look beyond conventional notions attractiveness find beauty non promiscuous solemn girls as well as plastic bags floating wind when many criticize movie they say wheres beauty plastic bag thats point we live world aesthetic subjectivism what one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet urge is there people assume aesthetic absolutism its just plastic bag how can there be beauty it well human being is just aggregation tissues bones blood how is that attractive it depends how you look at it reality is shaped by perspective some people criticize ricky fits character because he records his life experiences tape doesnt actually experience them but time moves inexorably one direction time cannot be stopped physical sense past future dont exist we are only conscious present everything we do everything we achieve every bit happiness we experience they are all eventually buried past by time recording subjective beauty is means by which one can attempt salvage beauty past into present because time eventually destroys all beauty if you dont believe me walk into pre school then walk into nursing home remember that all old men women nursing home were once little kids another profound element american beauty is tag line look closer individuals behavior is not independent his environment humans are conformists by nature humans will modify their behavior assimilate into existing social categories if any individual dares stray category which he has been assigned he is shouted down ostracized no one can resist urge conform so why bother everyone is nice public yet streets they blare their horns scream swear some boys i know pretend hate american beauty because surface it seems like chick flick they force themselves watch gory horror movies show off others how they can stomach intense violence excessive sex scenes american beauty angela acts like total slut as many girls seem be nowadays end however she is not what she makes herself out be colonel fits tries act like such man yet end its all just giant facade civilization is but one giant movie members society must start acting their parts if they want belong this civilization otherwise theyre outsiders try walking into job interview without tie youll be thrown out that is power convention what if i asked you this question what do you want life most people would say happiness but is happiness worth deluding yourself carolyn burnham shields herself sadness by adopting positive thinking philosophy philosophy self affirming mantras harsh self discipline positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you reality is it wise or moral change channel when you hear about mass starvation africa so you can enjoy moments fleeting happiness cheap romance movie self help is just euphemism self deception all humans need some complex fraud distract them harsh nihilistic realities life whether its religion money or even love spite american beautys greatness there are problems characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless theyre ultra critical anyway exaggeration is essential satire so that certain points are made obvious viewers furthermore alan balls original screenplay is slightly edited ending is more optimistic problems aside sam mendes debut movie is one greatest ive seen not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas its important film society because theres so much society needs learn one boy i knew refused watch american beauty because as he said im not gonna watch movie with name like that look closer 10 10,0.46454876142376134,0.12513772396584896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,An Oscar well deserved.,"This film is one of a kind. After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach. It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism. However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny. Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty. But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating: 10/10",oscar well deserved,this film is one kind after seeing this film last week i was left with hole pit my stomach it left many questions my mind most them cannot be answered my view film that makes me think after i watch it is second none this film certainly delivers that aspect i was amazed with vivid imagery this movie as well as with symbolism however what makes this film best 1999 is acting kevin spacey shines as lester burnham annette bening carolyn burnham isnt far behind supporting cast members such as wes bentley ricky fitts thora birch jane burnham mena suvari angela hayes chris cooper col frank fitts only add drama this film i think most special aspect this film is how all characters intertwine way that is believable yet fantastic at same time i congratulate sam mendes his direction this film as well as alan ball writing it i dont think it could have been any better rated r u s strong sexuality language drug content violence film obviously deserves its rating however none causes r rating are overbearing all them add plot line this film while i dont think that this is film children i would suggest that adults should view it with open mind i believe that traits which many characters this film have are found many people around world perhaps that is why this film hits close home so many viewers while billed by some as comedy drama i dont see anything about this film as funny sure there are some comedic moments but by end those moments were all but forgotten when faced with grim reality conclusion events portrayed this film if you want watch light hearted film with some elements comedy some elements drama dont see american beauty but if you enjoy films that make you think are entertained by excellent cast excellent directing excellent screenplay this film should be at top your list my rating 10 10,0.5514933166248955,0.2928884711779449,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,An American Masterpiece,"This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves ""the precious moments in his stupid little life."" You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is ""in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times"". You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.The supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol's daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie's best friend, Lester's crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky's mom, and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says ""I'm sorry, what?"". Ricky says ""Mom, no one said anything"". When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says ""Mom, I'm leaving"". Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says ""OK. Wear a raincoat"". Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.10/10",american masterpiece,this is by far one best if not movies 90s american beauty stole my vote immediately as i started watching it idea concept american beauty is just some ordinary people ordinary block with ordinary lives kevin spacey plays lester burnam middle aged married man who has lost some hope life he has job that is degrading wife who refuses show any type loving emotion towards him daughter who practically hates herself is judged constantly as looser but all sudden he sees his daughters friend angela something snaps him do something with his life he quits his job takes dreaded by most americans fast food cook job he starts working out doing some illegal substances even though this sounds like he is ruining his life it actually helps him makes him realize how much he loves precious moments his stupid little life you have no idea what he is talking about im sure but dont worry you will some day kevin spacey was by far best actor 1999 deserved this oscar 100 annete benning plays carol burnam lesters wife she is very fake unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get sale her image life is order be successful one most project image success at all times you can tell she is not happy with her marriage starts have affair with big boss real estate company again seems horrible but it helps her end annete was unfortunately robbed oscar this film supporting cast thora birtch who plays janie lester carols daughter is extremely depressed hates her body herself but when she notices strange boy next door develops relationship with him she realizes how precious life is starts communicating with her family mena suvari plays angela janies best friend lesters crush girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side every guy town wes bentley plays ricky next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as bag being tossed wind as something beautiful some say that this was very stupid scene but i disagree his dialog was perfect made us look twice at something so simple he won most our hearts despite having somewhat arrogant attitude wes without doubt got robbed nomination this movie chris cooper plays rickys father col frank fits he is military sergent who is very abusive his wife son is obvious homophobic that turns into ironic situation end chris also shouldve been nominated most stunning character actually me was allison janney who played barbara fits rickys mom franks wife she was so beautiful perfect her scene front room with frank ricky everything is so quite she says im sorry what ricky says mom no one said anything when ricky gets kicked out by frank after horrible accusation ricky says mom im leaving instead being like average mom trying stop him or say things will get better she knows this is best says ok wear raincoat allison was just amazing didnt get enough credit her role if there could have been nominations every role this movie they were well deserved this is terrific movie that should be watched by every adult itll make you look again at your life think what great movie 10 10,0.5615929705215419,0.14196428571428574,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Beautiful...so beautiful,"American Beauty is the greatest movie ever made.If you haven't already, watch American Beauty by yourself and give yourself some time afterwards to think it over. You will never, ever look at life the same way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a window into ourselves, and American Beauty does that better than any other film has ever done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated, everything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you should know that already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Beauty in every frame, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty in everything around you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the movie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Lester Burnham of change, the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Jane, the defeated Barbara, the false control of Angela and the Colonel, and the real control of Ricky. To me Ricky, not Lester, is the center of this story; he somehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth and downfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every time I see it, and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that scene is simply the greatest monologue ever written.I listened to the message of American Beauty - look closely and you can find Beauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Beauty in the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to burst.This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.",beautiful so beautiful,american beauty is greatest movie ever made if you havent already watch american beauty by yourself give yourself some time afterwards think it over you will never ever look at life same way it does exactly what movies are meant do give us window into ourselves american beauty does that better than any other film has ever done no word dialogue is unnecessary no character exaggerated everything is perfect but if you have seen american beauty you should know that already once you look closer at this movie see beauty every frame it becomes so much easier look closer see beauty everything around you you think im waxing poetic then you must not have seen movie every character is part each us lester burnham change carolyn uncertainty failure rebellion jane defeated barbara false control angela colonel real control ricky me ricky not lester is center this story he somehow controls or sets motion heart lesters rebirth downfall there are several parts this movie where i lose control every time i see it none more so than paper bag scene me that scene is simply greatest monologue ever written i listened message american beauty look closely you can find beauty anything it changed my life i rose out long deep depression started out into world sometimes there is so much beauty world i cant even stand it it feels like my heart is going burst this is most beautiful movie i have ever seen,0.4783333333333334,0.23277777777777775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Could be the best movie of the year.,"And there were a lot of great ones this year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is saying a LOT, given this man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky enough to see a free screening this afternoon and boy, am I glad I had the privilege. In fact, this review might not even be that coherent- it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you have trouble even putting your feelings into words. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself as a loser, with Annette Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the fact that you can understand why she turned out this way, with her as a mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in the world outside of ""Happiness"", you find out about the family who just moved in next door. At first, the strange son seems like the most messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military, abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase mother, you realize he is the most normal member of the household by far. Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun, entertaining, and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he is having the most entertaining, amusing midlife crisis ever seen in the history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he does.I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of it horrified, amazed laughter at what is happening and the things that are coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual applause and cheers. I can't say enough good things about this movie. You think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end. Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the events unfold in a way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you can see what a character is going to do next, what violent or self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's theme/tagline of ""...look closer"". THe characters are not what they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two characters that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something that turns all your preconceptions of them upside down, while making your jaw drop, and your heart ache. You will leave the movie with a smile, though, and that is maybe what I expected least of all.Words just cannot do this movie justice. See it for yourself.",could be best movie year,there were lot great ones this year i will also say something even possibly bolder that kevin spacey gives performance his career all us movie geeks know that is saying lot given this mans past roles his talent i used think he was overrated as actor then i figured ok i see what all fuss is about now hes up there with my favorite actors all time with james woods steve buscemi robert deniro probably top 5 i was lucky enough see free screening this afternoon boy am i glad i had privilege fact this review might not even be that coherent its one those movies that blows you away so much that you have trouble even putting your feelings into words plotline sounds trite when you first describe it it did me when i first heard about it spacey plays man who describes himself as loser with annette bening as his horrible shrewish self absorbed pathetic b tch wife his daughter is not all that likeable either despite fact that you can understand why she turned out this way with her as mother just when you think youve met most dysfunctional family world outside happiness you find out about family who just moved next door at first strange son seems like most messed up member their brood but after you get meet his ex military abusive homophobic terrifying father his withdrawn sad headcase mother you realize he is most normal member household by far then filmwriters toss kevin spaceys lustful obsession with his daughters sexkitten cheerleader friend which trust me is lot more fun entertaining amusing than it sounds when you read about it soon he is having most entertaining amusing midlife crisis ever seen history cinema he just doesnt give k about what he does or says anymore you only wish you could get away with doing things he does i found myself laughing out loud this movie so many times most it horrified amazed laughter at what is happening things that are coming out characters mouths especially spaceys he had at least dozen lines that had every member audience hysterics actual applause cheers i cant say enough good things about this movie you think after first five minutes that you know how movie will end well spaceys opening narrative does give it away but trust me events unfold way that you will never see coming you will swear you can see what character is going do next what violent or self destructice act they will commit but you turn out be wrong without getting too pretentious here movie lives up its theme tagline look closer characters are not what they seem up until end even then they surprise you at least two characters that you are positive you have figured out do or say something that turns all your preconceptions them upside down while making your jaw drop your heart ache you will leave movie with smile though that is maybe what i expected least all words just cannot do this movie justice see it yourself,0.5618815271357643,0.13483136449238142,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,A little masterpiece...,"""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.Having seen ""Happiness"" only recently, I could not help but draw comparisons: both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people, in their own unique way, all strive to be successful or simply 'happy'. But here the similarities end: the characters in ""Happiness"" undergo a self-realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence, and go on to wallow in their own depravity. ""Happiness"" shows no signs of redemption; whereas in ""American Beauty"" the audience is offered a sense of hope, of salvation, though the characters must endure a similar fate, or more accurately, they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.The pivotal character upon which this theme centres, is the father Lester, played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption, Lester transforms from being a loser.Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well: he shows Lester on his 'path to enlightenment' pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced, forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial-like vignettes which prove very comical, if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film: ""My life is like a commercial"". And how this rings true: like in ""Happiness"", all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability, yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite: depressed, depraved and desperate.Lester's wife, played by Annette Benning, is the most success-driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film's tone of moral conviction. ""In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success"" is the maxim she adopts from the 'king' of real estate, Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film: for Benning's pawn, life is all about keeping-up appearances. This is where Lester differs from her: his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of 'normal life' and following what his heart desires.Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit (as does his daughter and Ricky) or pay the price (as does his wife and the Colonel). The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.This film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realisation, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.",little masterpiece,american beauty is tour de force cinema sam mendes brilliant debut feature depicts web characters who yearn their own american dream yet end only one character truly attains it having seen happiness only recently i could not help but draw comparisons both films centre around microcosm society which people their own unique way all strive be successful or simply happy but here similarities end characters happiness undergo self realisation process through which they become increasingly aware their meaningless existence go wallow their own depravity happiness shows no signs redemption whereas american beauty audience is offered sense hope salvation though characters must endure similar fate or more accurately they must endure way life which they are trapped pivotal character upon which this theme centres is father lester played impeccably by kevin spacey he is presented us as bit loser who plays subjugated figure home at work he appears resigned unhappy life which he is treated badly by his wife daughter his boss at work seemingly beyond redemption lester transforms being loser mendes portrays this transformation admirably well he shows lester his path enlightenment pushed up against grim background suburbanite existence these early scenes are well balanced forming steady rhythm tv commercial like vignettes which prove very comical if at times unsettling as lester reflects film my life is like commercial how this rings true like happiness all characters hide underneath this veneer normality respectability yet they are all revealed be nothing but opposite depressed depraved desperate lesters wife played by annette benning is most success driven character story which renders her most hopeless films tone moral conviction order be successful life one must project appearance success is maxim she adopts king real estate buddy king it is phrase which resonates throughout film bennings pawn life is all about keeping up appearances this is where lester differs her his emancipation is enabled by him discarding constraints normal life following what his heart desires lester is catalyst this narrative which ancillary characters either follow suit as does his daughter ricky or pay price as does his wife colonel irony inherent this film it grows with resonance as film draws conclusion is that only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything order achieve it yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able afford surviving characters glimpse hope life this film left me gasping air its hyper realism conveys at same time portrait suburban comedy jolting shock realisation cathartic sense hope mendes depicts certain people who varying degrees all strive certain american dream yet so few actually attain it though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with feel good label beauty american beauty is that it sits half way between desperate cry help reassuring sense happiness fulfilment that is cinema at its best,0.4837425595238096,0.19165736607142858,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,"A deep, wonderful, penetrating film; extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about the American life.","I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice. Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes. Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film. The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors. The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors.An amazing movie, strongly recommended. 10/10",deep wonderful penetrating film extraordinary irony psychological drama about american life,i have come see movie with certain prejudice everyone saying that it was so wonderful so touching so excited i usually tend go with movies that nobody likes nevertheless this one was certain exception it is wonderful psychological drama satire about american community about american life dark painful irony cynicism descriptions life characters deep sarcasm types people community habits behaviour such as if you want succeed you always have seem successful or never stop smiling parasites community most importantly treatment people who are different who are freaky some extent eventually there is no character film that is not odd its way although we have wait very ending film discover this with very deep accurate exaggeration most characters movie demonstrate worst darkest sides their personality while still remaining very human very touching very involving observer everyone can find certain similarity with characters persons who he met his life characters described film tragi comical events little pieces funny disturbing irony dripping almost every episode lead observer exploration american beauty beauty life way that we fail find it all our life way we hide our feelings emotions even behind sullen walls our sepulchre acting is truly brilliant episodes are built logically coherently dialogues are deep thrilling intriguing every sentence every word is deeply constructed containing profound irony intelligent elements humors plot is very intelligently built constructing true indication sad situation american society excellent ground actors amazing movie strongly recommended 10 10,0.5844812925170066,0.20203018707482995,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Beautiful...,"Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; ""a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused..."". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms - not that you'd be able to guess from the tone of this film).The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10.",beautiful,probably best film 1999 this dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with alan ball as writer sam mendes as director both winning oscars their sterling efforts kevin spacey plays lester burnham man brink mid life crisis who suddenly becomes obsessed with one his teenage daughters friends played by mena suvari his daughter thora birch is as lester tells us typical teenager angry insecure confused his wife caroline annette bening has obsession her own her public appearance life starts off downer burnhams their new neighbours fitts despite their lives looking good outside as life begins improve with most main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships it soon all comes crashing down climactic final day writing is nothing short brilliant made even more amazing by knowing that it comes first time feature film screen writer alan ball who had had years prior experience writing tv sitcoms not that youd be able guess tone this film directing is par with writing sam mendes manages get some brilliant performances great cast who are all faultless no doubt mendes theatre directing past played huge part directing actors so well another person worthy mention is late director photography conrad l hall another one five oscar recipients this film all elements this film gel perfectly together make one superb masterpiece not one person either cast or crew steals this film or does anymore than anyone else make this film what it is truly ensemble effort 10 10,0.6107828282828284,0.26876262626262626,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Close To Perfection,"The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went.

10.0,One of my faves of the year...simply great.,"This movie was a joy to watch. I didn't know what to expect when I came into it. I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.Kevin Spacey plays this part to a ""T"". He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed. His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well. I think they both should be nominated.The support cast is also spectacular. Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled ""Teenagers"" in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition. When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty. Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life. He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.The music in this film is also very well chosen. There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go. I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.My Rating (1 - 10): 10",one my faves year simply great,this movie was joy watch i didnt know what expect when i came into it i had heard buzz acting story etc but weve all heard that before had been disappointed but not so with this one kevin spacey plays this part t he is strong when it requires meek when it is needed his emotional rollercoaster ride is trip partake annette bening is marvelous as well i think they both should be nominated support cast is also spectacular thora birch wes bentley mena suvari all give great performances as troubled teenagers film particular mention is wes bentleys performance worthy supporting nomination as well this is dramatic funny tale man his life state turmoil transition when he happens see beautiful friend his daughters at cheerleading exhibition he is completely infatuated with her beauty using this as his inspiration he attempts change all aspects his life he confronts his marriage his job his ego his libido music this film is also very well chosen there are moments when music fits so perfectly with scene that they meld together as one present perfect emotion plot can get rather involved but you will follow it endlessly see where you go i was simply involved hook line sinker see this movie more than once skip some other movies out now that are dare i say trash this should be top many critics lists this year it is certainly top mine my rating 1 10 10,0.603528911564626,0.29821428571428577,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"
4.0,A quick look at perverted normalcy.,"Kevin Spacey will always be the teacher in ""Pay It Forward"" for me, but that doesn't make him any less of a versatile actor. The entire cast was great, including Chris Cooper as a closeted homosexual and the young Wes Bentley as an abnormal deceiver. While the infamous ""plastic bag"" scene both awful and stupid, pretty much everything else was fantastic. From the Smiley's discovery to the disturbing videos Ricky shot, pretty much all of the movie is important, interesting and quite thought-provoking. And what I think to be the best part: the lack of a resolution. Since the movie is from Lester's POV, it makes sense that he wouldn't know how it ended. I liked this movie, as weird as it was, and would probably recommend it.",quick look at perverted normalcy,kevin spacey will always be teacher pay it forward me but that doesnt make him any less versatile actor entire cast was great including chris cooper as closeted homosexual young wes bentley as abnormal deceiver while infamous plastic bag scene both awful stupid pretty much everything else was fantastic smileys discovery disturbing videos ricky shot pretty much all movie is important interesting quite thought provoking what i think be best part lack resolution since movie is lesters pov it makes sense that he wouldnt know how it ended i liked this movie as weird as it was would probably recommend it,0.6864035087719299,0.08245614035087719,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,"Look closer at this dazzling, powerful masterpiece of a drama.","On a scale of 0 to 100; I gave American Beauty a score of 99.Wowno, I mean that. American Beauty is a film that takes my breath away each time I watch it, and every time I do watch it, I notice something newer, something more exciting and something more funny. There is honestly no other movie like this, and if you haven't seen it, there is something donged in your head, and you must do so now.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in a mid-life crisis, caused by his stressed wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and rebelling teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). When Lester and Carolyn go watch Jane cheerleading, they meet Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and Lester, caught in sudden lust for Angela, decides to change his life. Angela and Jane's friendship is not all it seems, too, because Angela only brags about how many times she's done it with guys and stuff. That doesn't help an already insecure Jane very much but she finds solace in the arms of the next-door-neighbours' son, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Ricky, himself from a broken home as well, and Jane find they have a lot in common and eventually turn out to be soulmates.Everything about this film is so darkly clear, it is extremely obvious why the Academy loved it, and it is very obvious to see that I love it. Spacey brings Lester wildly to life in a performance reminiscent of Spacey's acting coach Jack Lemmon. Also on top form is Annette Bening, in an over-controlled performance that is just so instantly loveable. While all the attention went to these performers, it is also Thora Birch (especially), Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and a quiet Allison Janney that manage to steal the show just as much. Sam Mendes is an excellent director, this is his first feature, and he is a British man directing an American-based film! And he won an Oscar for it! That's an amazing achievement, ditto to Alan Ball, who's script is effectively a stunner and an instant winner.The best film of 1999, the best film of its decade and for now anyways, American Beauty stands tall as the best film ever made.",look closer at this dazzling powerful masterpiece drama,scale 0 100 i gave american beauty score 99 wow no i mean that american beauty is film that takes my breath away each time i watch it every time i do watch it i notice something newer something more exciting something more funny there is honestly no other movie like this if you havent seen it there is something donged your head you must do so now lester burnham kevin spacey is mid life crisis caused by his stressed wife carolyn annette bening rebelling teenage daughter jane thora birch when lester carolyn go watch jane cheerleading they meet angela hayes mena suvari lester caught sudden lust angela decides change his life angela janes friendship is not all it seems too because angela only brags about how many times shes done it with guys stuff that doesnt help already insecure jane very much but she finds solace arms next door neighbours son ricky fitts wes bentley ricky himself broken home as well jane find they have lot common eventually turn out be soulmates everything about this film is so darkly clear it is extremely obvious why academy loved it it is very obvious see that i love it spacey brings lester wildly life performance reminiscent spaceys acting coach jack lemmon also top form is annette bening over controlled performance that is just so instantly loveable while all attention went these performers it is also thora birch especially mena suvari wes bentley quiet allison janney that manage steal show just as much sam mendes is excellent director this is his first feature he is british man directing american based film he won oscar it thats amazing achievement ditto alan ball whos script is effectively stunner instant winner best film 1999 best film its decade now anyways american beauty stands tall as best film ever made,0.4895740740740741,0.22286111111111112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,a very well done film that continues to amaze me...,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her ""typical teenager"" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His ""purpose"" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to ""move"" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.",very well done film that continues amaze me,when i first saw this movie theaters i found it be very funny when i rented it at home i found it be very sad complex looking at it now i realize that it is surely one most extraordinary films ever come out hollywood some it may look trite or cliched or maybe too un ordinary be worthy its praise but overall impact this film is extremely powerful after youve seen it you know youve seen something few notable elements stand out direction is superb this is visually superior film director understands subtle changes tone writing is equally compelling story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories create one amazing movie haunting music is also notable lastly is acting kevin spacey has done excellent films before he can add this one list he may be little witty suggest overshadowed character he portrays but he simply disappears into role annette bening is also fine less strong role but she is magnificent none less as teenagers thora birch is able mesmerize us with one intense look her typical teenager role is fleshed out completely i enjoyed mena suvaris character equally it seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim but her performance evokes both innocence experience her scenes toward end give her depth unlike any other character wes bentley as video taping boy next door is easily most original character at first he seems little tense but like spacey he sinks into role his purpose film unlike anyone elses is mystery thus making him most enigmatic person most films are able make lasting impression its audience but never has movie been known move its viewers as much as this movie it truly says something about life no matter how predictable or tacky it appears this film disturbingly shows us how appreciate our individual lives so therefore when they are over we each have something remember,0.5278586125808348,0.18796296296296292,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,"Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie","I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too.

10.0,For anyone who has ever wondered what the future might hold or questioned what could have been.,"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42, has spent years trapped in an unhappy marriage and an unsatisfying job. His relationship with his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is almost as strained as that with his career-driven realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.Full of heart-rending pathos, yet told with an irresistible streak of dark humour, American Beauty is a thoroughly absorbing bittersweet drama, a poignant tale that peels back the layers of suburban life to reveal the pains of growing up and the disappointments of growing old. The big-screen debut of director Sam Mendes, the film boasts superb performances from an incredible ensemble cast (Spacey is particularly great, but no-one puts a foot wrong), excellent cinematography, and wonderful music (both score and soundtrack).10/10: one of the finest films of the 90s and well deserving of its five Oscars.",anyone who has ever wondered what future might hold or questioned what could have been,lester burnham kevin spacey 42 has spent years trapped unhappy marriage unsatisfying job his relationship with his teenage daughter jane thora birch is almost as strained as that with his career driven realtor wife carolyn annette bening when lester becomes infatuated with his daughters friend angela mena suvari it marks beginning severe mid life crisis that sees him revisiting carefree ways his youth but at cost full heart rending pathos yet told with irresistible streak dark humour american beauty is thoroughly absorbing bittersweet drama poignant tale that peels back layers suburban life reveal pains growing up disappointments growing old big screen debut director sam mendes film boasts superb performances incredible ensemble cast spacey is particularly great but no one puts foot wrong excellent cinematography wonderful music both score soundtrack 10 10 one finest films 90s well deserving its five oscars,0.45108695652173914,0.18260869565217389,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.19}"

10.0,My Favorite Film From the 90s,"American Beauty is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film, and you never know if it has more 'love it' or 'hate it' viewers. Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.The film is deep, dark, and tragic. The title is American Beauty but it is more like Universal Sadness. It is not about superheroes - it is about very flawed, tired, and shallow people  but just as the tag line says  one must look closer.I live in a town like the one in American Beauty too - nice houses, brick, vinyl, neatly cut grass and flowers. ""The air is fresh and sweet like a child's kiss"". I jog in the mornings or in the evenings and people often sit on their porches or water their lawns or jog just as I do. We always smile at each other and say ""Hi, how are you?"" I always think to myself - what goes on beyond the closed doors of these people that I see? They could be happy with their families and with their jobs. They do look happy. Or, they may be tired and disappointed with their lives, trying to do something to change it - or just letting the days pass by.Leo Tolstoy opened his novel Anna Karenina with the words, ""All happy families are happy in the same way; each unhappy family is unique in its unhappiness"". That's why it is much more interesting for me to try and understand each unhappy family  why did it happen? The family in American Beauty used to be happy - there is even proof - the photograph with three of them, happy, laughing. Where did it go? When? Why? When was the moment in time when two loving people became strangers and prisoners in their own nice house with the beautiful roses outside? These are the questions I kept thinking about when I saw AB for the first time, and I still can not find the answers. Can something be changed? How? What do you do to wake up from the lethargic dream that your life has become? How do you reach the people who are the closest to you? What the hell do you need a $3000 couch for if you can not make love to your wife on it? What is the purpose of material possessions if they become more important than the smile of your daughter? When did you start to think that giving your children the best toys possible would substitute for a talk, for a sincere and honest interest as to what they really worry about? I did not find American Beauty patronizing and simplistic - it asks difficult questions but does not provide you with any easy answers. I still look for those answers. I don't blame the movie for imperfection of its characters - I know they do exist. We don't like them - but can one be mad when looking in the mirror? I want to add a couple of words about Spacey's character, Lester Burnham (BTW, Spacey may stop acting right now, and he probably should after all the flops he has produced since AB, but he will always be remembered for Lester). Lester could say about himself what another flawed but unforgettable character did 25 years before him: ""Well, I tried, didn't I? Goddamnit, at least I did that."" Lester Burnham died a happy man; the last words he heard in his life were that his daughter was in love - it meant for him that she could feel, that she was alive because love changes us and makes us better. His last sight was that of a picture where happiness and joy were captured forever. In death, he had at last captured that for which he had longed for the most in life  happiness.He died a happy man - not many do.",my favorite film 90s,american beauty is love it or hate it film you never know if it has more love it or hate it viewers personally i love it first sight last sight eternal sight it is my favorite film 90s one my personal twenty favorites ever i think that american beauty is instant classic it will stay that way as long as people watch movies film is deep dark tragic title is american beauty but it is more like universal sadness it is not about superheroes it is about very flawed tired shallow people but just as tag line says one must look closer i live town like one american beauty too nice houses brick vinyl neatly cut grass flowers air is fresh sweet like childs kiss i jog mornings or evenings people often sit their porches or water their lawns or jog just as i do we always smile at each other say hi how are you i always think myself what goes beyond closed doors these people that i see they could be happy with their families with their jobs they do look happy or they may be tired disappointed with their lives trying do something change it or just letting days pass by leo tolstoy opened his novel anna karenina with words all happy families are happy same way each unhappy family is unique its unhappiness thats why it is much more interesting me try understand each unhappy family why did it happen family american beauty used be happy there is even proof photograph with three them happy laughing where did it go when why when was moment time when two loving people became strangers prisoners their own nice house with beautiful roses outside these are questions i kept thinking about when i saw ab first time i still can not find answers can something be changed how what do you do wake up lethargic dream that your life has become how do you reach people who are closest you what hell do you need 3000 couch if you can not make love your wife it what is purpose material possessions if they become more important than smile your daughter when did you start think that giving your children best toys possible would substitute talk sincere honest interest as what they really worry about i did not find american beauty patronizing simplistic it asks difficult questions but does not provide you with any easy answers i still look those answers i dont blame movie imperfection its characters i know they do exist we dont like them but can one be mad when looking mirror i want add couple words about spaceys character lester burnham btw spacey may stop acting right now he probably should after all flops he has produced since ab but he will always be remembered lester lester could say about himself what another flawed but unforgettable character did 25 years before him well i tried didnt i goddamnit at least i did that lester burnham died happy man last words he heard his life were that his daughter was love it meant him that she could feel that she was alive because love changes us makes us better his last sight was that picture where happiness joy were captured forever death he had at last captured that which he had longed most life happiness he died happy man not many do,0.5475369458128081,0.1944108573418918,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,Look Closer...,"The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice.

10.0,Far and away the best film of the year,"What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster. I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price. Boy was I happy when I left. Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times. This film is virtually perfect. The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes). What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done. In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography. With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about. In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc... Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all. Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.

10.0,"""Never underestimate the power of denial.""","I've read a number of the pro and con reviews of this movie and in a strange way, both sides of the argument seem to have it right. Perhaps that's the power of the film, it's ability to present opposing viewpoints as if they were two sides of the same coin. Personally, I thought the film was brilliant in it's portrayal of how vapid society has become in it's examination of wealth, success and having to get it right here and right now. That's where the Annette Bening character comes in, as the self-actualizing real estate salesperson measuring success by projecting the appearance of success. Caricaturing that position is her husband's (Kevin Spacey) complete disconnect from reality by blackmailing his employer, quitting his job, and looking for the least possible amount of responsibility in a burger flipping career. Along the way, Lester Burnham entertains grand delusions of buffing up and following through on his mid-life fantasies while those around him, daughter Janie (Thora Birch), Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and creepy neighbor Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) all dance to the different drummer in their own lives.Notwithstanding which side of the fence you come down on, I think that by the time you reach Lester Burnham's age, you've managed to entertain some of the kind of fantasies he has. The responsible ones among us don't carry it any further; the ones who do wind up on the front page of their local newspaper or have their name show up in the police blotter. It's probably irrelevant in the grand scheme of things that Lester himself wound wind up in the obituaries. What the picture does, most of the time uncomfortably, is force the viewer to examine their own life and declare a response to the events on screen. In that regard, I'm drawn to a line by the poet Keats, 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'. 'American Truth' doesn't seem to have the same ring to it as 'American Beauty', but the sentiment expressed by the film is about the same.",never underestimate power denial,ive read number pro con reviews this movie strange way both sides argument seem have it right perhaps thats power film its ability present opposing viewpoints as if they were two sides same coin personally i thought film was brilliant its portrayal how vapid society has become its examination wealth success having get it right here right now thats where annette bening character comes as self actualizing real estate salesperson measuring success by projecting appearance success caricaturing that position is her husbands kevin spacey complete disconnect reality by blackmailing his employer quitting his job looking least possible amount responsibility burger flipping career along way lester burnham entertains grand delusions buffing up following through his mid life fantasies while those around him daughter janie thora birch angela hayes mena suvari creepy neighbor ricky fits wes bentley all dance different drummer their own lives notwithstanding which side fence you come down i think that by time you reach lester burnhams age youve managed entertain some kind fantasies he has responsible ones among us dont carry it any further ones who do wind up front page their local newspaper or have their name show up police blotter its probably irrelevant grand scheme things that lester himself wound wind up obituaries what picture does most time uncomfortably is force viewer examine their own life declare response events screen that regard im drawn line by poet keats beauty is truth truth beauty american truth doesnt seem have same ring it as american beauty but sentiment expressed by film is about same,0.45197310405643737,0.11532186948853616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,Powerful,"""My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood; this is my street; this is my life. I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet, and in a way, I am dead already.""""American Beauty"" is placed in an indefinite suburb somewhere in America (there are indications that it is Chicago), where a seemingly harmonious and quite ordinary family is going through the turbulence caused by the middle age crisis of both parents, as well as the puberty of their teenage daughter.A patriarchal family, ruled by a conservative father, a military man, moves next door to them. While the daughter of our antihero Lester starts a relationship with the neighbor's weird son, and his wife has an affair at work, he, not so secretly, obsessively falls for his daughter's girlfriend.This black humor drama is only seemingly extreme and eccentric, while in fact, it shows quite realistically what many of us go through at various moments in our lives. Admittedly, most only in their heads, and those who dare to take drastic steps usually hide it better. But the fact that most of us would never admit such thoughts and actions does not prevent, but perhaps only makes it easier for us to better connect with the characters and feel their drama more deeply.A strong, well-written story needs actors capable of bringing it to life before our eyes. ""American Beauty"" did not fail in that field either. The excellent character study on paper makes the job much easier, but you can always rely on Kevin Spacey for a really impressive role. A man who somehow manages to be at the same time a nerd and a macho, slimy and sexy, a villain and a victim. Sexual and emotional frustration and the middle age crisis are by no means an excuse for Lester's actions, and yet, Spacey awakens sympathy and compassion in the viewer, rather than repulsion and disgust.Annette Bening skillfully keeps pace with Spacey in the role of a frustrated woman, trapped in a long-extinguished marriage. A woman who, with the last twitches of common sense, tries to balance between a family in disarray and a career that she can never raise to a level that would satisfy her.There is also Thora Birch, an unpopular teen, escaping from the collapse of her family home in a relationship with the eccentric Wes Bentley, as well as the insecure Mena Suvari, who is hiding under the mask of a confident and popular cheerleader. Her transformation from ""Lolita"" that seduces Lester to one of the most impressive scenes in the film, where she is half-naked, trembling under Spacey, does not deserve to remain unmentioned. Although her character is secondary to the others I mentioned and only serves as a support for Spacey's, Mena's performance is unfairly underrated. And last but not least, Chris Cooper who convincingly played a homophobic colonel and stole every scene in which he appears.For me, the two most striking things in this film are the use of red and the unusual disturbing sounds that accompany Lester's fantasies, in contrast to the mainstream rock music that fills the rest of the movie. And of course, the ending is a bit over-the-top, but it perfectly rounds off the story and adds to its strength.The film won five Oscars for best picture, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and Spacey's performance, and was also nominated for editing, music, and leading female role. Each well deserved.10/10.",powerful,my name is lester burnham this is my neighborhood this is my street this is my life i am 42 years old less than year i will be dead course i dont know that yet way i am dead already american beauty is placed indefinite suburb somewhere america there are indications that it is chicago where seemingly harmonious quite ordinary family is going through turbulence caused by middle age crisis both parents as well as puberty their teenage daughter patriarchal family ruled by conservative father military man moves next door them while daughter our antihero lester starts relationship with neighbors weird son his wife has affair at work he not so secretly obsessively falls his daughters girlfriend this black humor drama is only seemingly extreme eccentric while fact it shows quite realistically what many us go through at various moments our lives admittedly most only their heads those who dare take drastic steps usually hide it better but fact that most us would never admit such thoughts actions does not prevent but perhaps only makes it easier us better connect with characters feel their drama more deeply strong well written story needs actors capable bringing it life before our eyes american beauty did not fail that field either excellent character study paper makes job much easier but you can always rely kevin spacey really impressive role man who somehow manages be at same time nerd macho slimy sexy villain victim sexual emotional frustration middle age crisis are by no means excuse lesters actions yet spacey awakens sympathy compassion viewer rather than repulsion disgust annette bening skillfully keeps pace with spacey role frustrated woman trapped long extinguished marriage woman who with last twitches common sense tries balance between family disarray career that she can never raise level that would satisfy her there is also thora birch unpopular teen escaping collapse her family home relationship with eccentric wes bentley as well as insecure mena suvari who is hiding under mask confident popular cheerleader her transformation lolita that seduces lester one most impressive scenes film where she is half naked trembling under spacey does not deserve remain unmentioned although her character is secondary others i mentioned only serves as support spaceys menas performance is unfairly underrated last but not least chris cooper who convincingly played homophobic colonel stole every scene which he appears me two most striking things this film are use red unusual disturbing sounds that accompany lesters fantasies contrast mainstream rock music that fills rest movie course ending is bit over top but it perfectly rounds off story adds its strength film won five oscars best picture directing screenplay cinematography spaceys performance was also nominated editing music leading female role each well deserved 10 10,0.49537037037037013,0.11990740740740741,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.42}"
6.0,"The closer I look, the worse it gets","I first saw this in theaters back in 1999. I loved it. I really really loved it. I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less. I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over. At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD. It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn't know what it wants to say. It takes a bunch of characters, constructs various relationships between them, and sets them loose to run around for two hours, at the end of which, what have we learned? I've heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate: Fight Club. Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism. With Fight Club, the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece, who seeks to replace it with fascism. In American Beauty, the anti-consumerist is, first of all, a total hypocrite, and second of all, has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death, but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was.On the hypocrisy charge, consider the oft-quoted scene when Lester Burnham (magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey) yells at his wife Carolyn (played in an over-the-top caricature by Annette Bening) for placing too high a value on material things, in this case, a sofa. Fine. He makes a good point. No one else seems to have noticed, however, that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird. Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car, the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself, which is the very apex of materialism.There are lots of other things that we don't see, and I never noticed until I ""looked closer"" how conspicuous they are in their absence. We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene. They never make any reference to being cheerleaders. The whole concept of cheerleading, then, is merely a mechanism (and quite a contrived, not to mention cliched mechanism at that) to introduce Lester to Angela. I also noticed, when I looked closer, how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is. ""Lame-o"" ""Geekboy"" ""Take a whizz"" It's just horrid. And why, exactly, was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website? First of all, her breasts don't appear to need augmenting (when I saw this in theaters, I thought she must want to reduce her breasts, but upon looking closer, the computer monitor clearly says ""augmentation"", which means a process of adding to).The worst flaw of the film, by far, is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act. The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual, and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin. For the love of God, who let those two howlers slip through. Bad enough that either made the final cut, but both?!! It defies understanding.The scene that made me turn the film off, this final time that I watched it, was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together. I was never very comfortable with this scene, because, call me conservative, I'm just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen (or so) and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend. But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary. Fair enough, Angela had it coming. But for Ricky to not only accept Angela's principle that ordinariness is bad, but to use it against her... that bothered me. Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being. Ricky, having been set up (clumsily) as a heroic character, shouldn't have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle.The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along. It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go. The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester's murder. Now, that subplot is a bit ridiculous, and was cut for a good reason, I agree. But why leave the set up if you're cutting the payoff? [Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says ""You know I'm joking, right?""]The sequence where Col. Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of ""Three's Company."" Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw, and nothing else. That's a classic example (and the most blatant I can recall from any film) of bad, contrived plotting. What exactly was up with Mrs. Fitts? Presumably, her scenes meant something in some previous, unreleased version of the story. The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences... Ricky just happens to be working there, and he works there just long enough to meet Lester!!! And what self-respecting drug dealer would give a man $2,000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he'd be willing/able to pay for it later? It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have $2,000 in cash while jogging, but ""I know you're good for it"" isn't much better.This film is ambitious. There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it. There are a lot of really good ideas. But on a fundamental level, it just doesn't work.",closer i look worse it gets,i first saw this theaters back 1999 i loved it i really really loved it ive seen it four or five times since each time i like it less i just saw it again couple days ago i stopped it before it was over at that moment i decided sell my dvd it has now been excised my dvd collection about which i have considerable pride main reason is that i have come feel very strongly that this film doesnt know what it wants say it takes bunch characters constructs various relationships between them sets them loose run around two hours at end which what have we learned ive heard lots people make comparisons between this film another highly acclaimed movie 1999 which i hate fight club both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques materialism with fight club critique materialism is made by character who turns out be villain piece who seeks replace it with fascism american beauty anti consumerist is first all total hypocrite second all has life changing epiphany moment before his death but never gets chance expound upon what that epiphany was hypocrisy charge consider oft quoted scene when lester burnham magnificently portrayed by kevin spacey yells at his wife carolyn played over top caricature by annette bening placing too high value material things this case sofa fine he makes good point no one else seems have noticed however that this is precisely same scene where it is revealed that lester has bought 1970 pontiac firebird since we at no time see lester enjoying use his car implication is that possession object is good itself which is very apex materialism there are lots other things that we dont see i never noticed until i looked closer how conspicuous they are their absence we never see angela or jane don cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene they never make any reference being cheerleaders whole concept cheerleading then is merely mechanism quite contrived not mention cliched mechanism at that introduce lester angela i also noticed when i looked closer how painfully bad much dialogue given younger characters is lame o geekboy take whizz its just horrid why exactly was jane looking at breast augmentation website first all her breasts dont appear need augmenting when i saw this theaters i thought she must want reduce her breasts but upon looking closer computer monitor clearly says augmentation which means process adding worst flaw film by far is fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice space minutes final act homophobic marine turns out be repressed homosexual slutty cheerleader turns out be virgin love god who let those two howlers slip through bad enough that either made final cut but both it defies understanding scene that made me turn film off this final time that i watched it was scene were jane ricky decide run off together i was never very comfortable with this scene because call me conservative im just not thrilled about girl dropping out school at tender age seventeen or so running off with her drug dealer boyfriend but what really got my goat was when ricky ridiculed angela by calling her ordinary fair enough angela had it coming but ricky not only accept angelas principle that ordinariness is bad but use it against her that bothered me ordinariness or lack thereof is not valid criterion judging worth human being ricky having been set up clumsily as heroic character shouldnt have descended such twisted hateful principle whole film has feel having been made up as it went along it is radically different how it was originally planned go prelude sequence scene later film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since removal subplot about jane ricky being blamed lesters murder now that subplot is bit ridiculous was cut good reason i agree but why leave set up if youre cutting payoff sequence where col fitts spies ricky lester is straight out threes company fitts sees just enough draw conclusion that writer wants him draw nothing else thats classic example most blatant i can recall any film bad contrived plotting what exactly was up with mrs fitts presumably her scenes meant something some previous unreleased version story initial meeting between lester ricky is built numerous coincidences ricky just happens be working there he works there just long enough meet lester what self respecting drug dealer would give man 2 000 worth merchandise assumption that hed be willing able pay it later it would have been more contrived if lester happened have 2 000 cash while jogging but i know youre good it isnt much better this film is ambitious there are lots individual pieces greatness it there are lot really good ideas but fundamental level it just doesnt work,0.5049101242400211,0.05745770552471586,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.41}"
