10.0,"Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once","I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a ""crazy house"" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10",both uplifting disheartening sometimes both at once,i went into this film with knowledge that it had been second film history win top five oscars best picture best actor best actress best director best screenplay has been praised as one jack nicholsons finest roles one classics 70s naturally after hearing all this i had high expectations one flew over cuckoos nest but nonetheless i was surprised at how easily film surpassed my expectations easily led me understand how it merited all that praise based novel by ken kesey story follows randle patrick mcmurphy jack nicholson who attempt get out spending more time prison pleads insanity his crime is therefore sentenced time mental institution this was mcmurphys intention as he believes conditions crazy house will be significantly easier contend with than another harsh stay prison however he quickly finds out that surviving institution with its desolate patients including christopher lloyd danny devito vincent schiavelli absolutely brilliant brad dourif as stuttering billy bibbit monstrously repressive nurse ratchet louise fletcher career defining role is considerably harder than he imagined mcmurphy plays pranks horseplay is generally defiant rules institution attempt raise spirits his constant optimism reckless defiance out date rules institution can be very uplifting often quite funny as well but much movie can be very depressing generally decrepit state institution is consistently intentionally bleak background superb story with truly bittersweet ending jack nicholson is at his best here head shoulders above other excellent performances such as chinatown or as good as it gets mcmurphy is apparently unquenchable optimist refusing succumb defeated spirit all other patients his livewire antics inspiring patients are generally uplifting when his indomitable spirit is finally broken we really feel him his fellow patients nicholson conveys essence mcmurphy perfection demonstrating his excellent understanding interpretation character when mcmurphy announces that he is going lift huge stone fountain hurl it through window escape other patients are so caught up his intoxicating spirit freedom that they honestly believe he can do it despite fact it would be impossible man much stronger than him when mcmurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts he cannot lift fountain he is so openly crushed that we cant help but feel him beneath frequent profanities livewire antics there are real human emotions which come across as truly touching what can be said about one flew over cuckoos nest which hasnt already been said it has excellent storyline top notch acting painfully bleak visuals perfectly setting tone movie alternates between being truly uplifting devastatingly depressing it features perhaps most memorable film ending ever next man his horse riding off into sunset leaves viewer beaten down by conflicting emotions unaware what think picture next reveling its glorious entirety its hard produce final outcome any better than this 10 10,0.5453599374021908,0.23332550860719878,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,The spirit of freedom vs. the spirit of legal-ism,"Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn't that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about inward reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of ""Chief"" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A",spirit freedom vs spirit legal ism,set early 60s story involves r p mcmurphy jack nicholson his arrival at mental institution salem oregon where film was shot he plays mental illness card get out prison time thinking itll be piece cake but hes wrong very wrong everything appears well at hospital nurse ratched louise fletcher seems be benevolent overseer mcmurphys ward but there are sinister things going beneath surface one flew over cuckoos nest 1975 is film youll appreciate more as you mature i saw it when i was younger while i thought it was good i didnt get lot insights film conveys movie criticizes way institutions deal with mental illnesses their therapy is futile only makes patients dependent institution itself thereby creating its need existence often at taxpayers expense mcmurphy is threat establishment therefore must be dealt with lot people criticize film by suggesting that nurse ratched isnt that bad or that she was only trying do her job etc i had same reaction first couple times i saw it this reveals aspect films brilliance ratcheds malevolence is so subtle that filmmakers allow possibility complete misinterpretation yes administrative point view she seemingly does good job shes authoritarian without being sadistic she cares residents as long as they follow rules more this below yet she is demonic as robotized arm dehumanizing system she maintains residents state oblivion marginalization they are deprived their dignity because system sees them as subhuman filmmakers fletcher not mention author book ken kesey make nurse ratched more effective antagonist by showing restraint compare her say faye dunaways portrayal joan crawford mommie dearest which pretty much turned her into cartoon villain ratched isnt such obvious sadist yet she uses rules tyrannize men reduce them almost infantile state dependency subservience her crowning achievement is billy bibbit brad dourif mcmurphy despite his obvious flaws is protagonist story although hes impulsive has weakness female gender which got him into prison first place he has spirit freedom life his problem is that he needs learn bit wisdom then he can walk his freedom without causing unnecessary harm himself others nurse ratched other hand represents legal ism which is authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules this is clearly seen world series sequence even though mcmurphy gets final vote he needs his ward watch series ratched refuses allow it technicality when mcmurphy then pretends watch game works guys up into state euphoria ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval thats because legalism is opposite spirit freedom life joy legalism is all about putting appearances enforcing letter law rule problem with this is that appearances are not about inward reality worse letter kills despite his folly mistakes mcmurphy does more good guys his ward than ratched institution could do lifetime how so not only because he has spirit freedom life but because he loves deeply but only those who deserve it humble not arrogant abusers when you cast restraint wind love with all your heart youll reap love return as long as person is worthy certain person hugs mcmurphy at end because he loves him mcmurphy set him free shackles mental illness worse institution that refuses actually heal because it needs mentally ill people exist it only goes through motions caring healing not that there arent any good people such institutions course no review this film is complete without mentioning notable character chief bromden played effectively by will sampson film runs 2 hours 13 minutes grade,0.5344494047619047,0.07170758928571429,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience","Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10",touching moving great cinematic experience,jack nicholson is great actor no not great actor spectacular actor this is film fairly early his career as well as it is several other actors this film who later have had long great careers too including danny devito christopher lloyd brad dourif film has some unforgettable moments who could forget louise fletchers icy stare jack nicholsons smart aleck remarks or will sampsons impressive almost entirely silent performance film portrays horrible truth about how patients were treated mental institutions back then tells story someone who desperately wanted break out rebel change things himself others i was compelled by this film very first frame i never took my eyes off it i will definitely be thinking about this film while i thought it was great way one very first frames depicted institution as something far more similar prison than hospital milos forman did great job making that contrast very powerful viewer film is very moving truly beautiful cinematic experience every single actor gives stellar performance every single character is perfectly written every single line every single frame is absolutely perfect i wouldnt change thing this film it has great pace you never lose interest but it never seems be rushing get through it either its simply perfect i have not read original book but if i ever come across it i might check it out i have only seen this film once but i will definitely watch it many times years come i recommend this amazing piece great cinema anyone who has at least slight interest drama genre or any fan any actors as they are all their absolute prime this film 10 10,0.5629084967320261,0.26082166199813256,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,"""What an excellent movie"" is all that went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece","What a movie, what an excellent movie!!! That is what first went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece. I've seen many movies, but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.This movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...When the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people's eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10.",what excellent movie is all that went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece,what movie what excellent movie that is what first went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece ive seen many movies but there arent much movies which had such impact me nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make good movie by adding loads special effects lots huge explosions this movie is so good so convincing without them actors played their roles such convincing way that you would think these werent actors at all but real psychiatric patients this movie may be 30 years old but it hasnt lost any its relevancy ok we dont put our mentally ill people that kind prisons anymore bars front windows have gone now we call it hospitals stead nut houses but treatment hasnt changed all that much i once worked such hospital as volunteer still saw things like forced feeding giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are when movie first came out some people were shocked because when you watch movie you cant help it feeling more attached patients than doctors nurses this movie shows that cinema can make difference it can help open peoples eyes if there is movie that should be seen by everyone this sure is one i give it well deserved 10 10,0.597392290249433,0.27346938775510204,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10.0,Poetic - Powerful - Simple: The Greatness of Cuckoo's Nest.,"The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak glance at an Oregon morning. Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches. Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.  ""Randle McMurphy"" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as ""McMurphy"", is something of a paradox. Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be? That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.Milos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later. It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds. Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax. Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me. You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward. The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson has his greatest moments in this picture. One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV. It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity. ""McMurphy"" immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the ""normal routine"". He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a ""date"". Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as ""Nurse Mildred Ratched"". She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win. Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional. That's perfect because that is exactly who she is. Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited ""McMurphy"" in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated. Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together. Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused. He seems to love his compadres in the hospital. He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST. The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the ""Chief"" is great as Nicholson's right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on. The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning. NOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version. Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.

,Jack Nicholson Finally Wins the Oscar,"Jack Nicholson had been nominated four times, he had lost four times. Each time he probably should have won, but he never did. Just when you thought there was no justice in the world, Jack finally came through with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". The film is exceptional in every sense imaginable. Nicholson stars as a prisoner who is sent to an insane asylum. While there, Nicholson creates an atmosphere which gives his fellow inmates a sense of self-worth and a glimmer of happiness. Throughout, it is never made clear whether Nicholson is truly insane or just acting crazy to get out of manual labor at the regular prison. Whatever the case, Nicholson is creating a place that head-nurse Louise Fletcher (Oscar-winning) is finding unsuitable for the other patients. She is quietly evil and amazingly cruel to those within the asylum. Nicholson and Fletcher are getting ready for a head-on-collision that will prove to be the decisive factor at the end of the movie. Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif (Oscar-nominated) are all great in supporting turns as Nicholson's fellow inmates.

9.0,You have to be crazy to hate this movie! This movie is a masterpiece,"Put a straightjacket on me, because I think this movie is insanely good! Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film. The movie has aged well, with newer DVD copies, putting out the best quality for it. Overall: The film is powerful, and moving. It's a must-watch. I recommended it.",you have be crazy hate this movie this movie is masterpiece,put straightjacket me because i think this movie is insanely good based off ken keseys novel same name directed by milos forman one flew over cuckoos nest tells story randle p mcmurphy jack nicholson convicted criminal admitted mental ward when he pleads insanity escape labor duties prison once there rebel wild man mcmurphy bump heads against authority figure head administrative nurse oppressive nurse mildred ratched louise fletcher way she treats her patients mcmurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom while ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom would lead chaos anarchy death my opinion while she play as villain shes fact she was somewhat right correct by her judgment but way she enforced order mentally disable highly crude inhuman fact by egging mcmurphy she made things much much worst one might view this movie as anti institution anti religion or anti government one flew over cuckoos nest was written 1959 published 1962 midst civil unrest it deeply changes way psychology psychiatry were being approached america while also challenging how government should treat its people by end 1960s controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become real deal while trust government officials were all time low when 1975 came most mentally ill found themselves untreated living streets government being highly criticism corruption overused power 1970s were bit anarchism at time it wasnt until later that things became more balance confinement way social institutions do serve purpose movie serves as allegory tale showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off balance movie really goes into deep detail how different authorities mcmurphy ratched control individuals through subtle coercive methods supporting character like chief will sampson talks about combine reference mechanistic way both manipulate process individuals nurse ratched controls inhabitants novels mental ward through combination emasculation subtle shame while mcmurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them be wild men challenge conformism it was no surprise that both louise fletcher jack nicolson won best actor actress at academy awards that year as both delivered such gripping gritty genuine performances movie has just as good supporting cast with several unknown actors time stars like christopher lloyd danny devito brad dourif helping i like how movie was shot formans direction is dead as he manages capture monotony routine ward without allowing film drag you get how eerily quiet it is order is impose patients with almost religious cult like rigor when medicine is delivered its like communion its so zombie like animal running along man made chain fence representing wild vs civilize movie is full hidden gem themes like those examples yet movie was missing few things novel such as fog which symbolize lack insight escape reality mcmurphys moby dick boxer shorts which interpretation as phallic symbol blatant sexuality it can also represents pervasive evil that inspires ahabs obsessive futile pursuit both ratched mcmurphy is trying humiliation other by exposing faults each others gender third interpretation is that moby dick stands power nature signifying mcmurphys untamed nature that conflicts with controlled institution although its hard find fault its certainly possible overpowering women are seem evil by writers weak women are shown act like sex object its somewhat noticeable that movie is bit misogyny another thing is movies love letter message society anarchy black white approach when it comes hospital vs patients another fault film is how chief was cut down as narrator put into much smaller role much his life prior hospital was not shown you see lot native american themes throughout film despite that music by jack nitzsche sounds something out western its represented struggles true freedom over confinement despite its dark strong drama undertones there were some comedic tendencies it was lot fun watch as drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion its wasnt slow painful it was very entertaining well rounded film movie has aged well with newer dvd copies putting out best quality it overall film is powerful moving its must watch i recommended it,0.45376027921208634,0.01705010518263529,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,A great order vs. chaos tale that everyone can relate to,"Based on the amazing novel by Ken Kesey, Randall Patrick McMurphy is an antisocial and dangerous man no different than a petty criminal, placed in a mental ward to have his behavior studied. He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital, much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched, the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.The movie exists to show not only how corrupt and poorly-constructed society's approach to the ""mentally unstable"" is, but it creates characters that we have all met in life and shows how the McMurphy-like figure that we all wish we had fights for freedom of choice and basic human rights. In addition to the movie's great spirit, the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role ( which he absolutely triumphs in ). And of course, there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very well-done, as the camera-work is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used. What really impressed me was the editing, especially as far as the use of audio goes: some parts just made me go ""...wow.""My only complaint is that I believe the movie could've been slightly more effective if it were based more closely on the novel at certain points, but the modified point of view of the film does make a great point; anyone who has ever hated their job, been accused of something, had some person so self-righteous and convinced of their own authority and dependency on order get in your way, or attended the American public school system at any point in their life should be able to identify with this movie.",great order vs chaos tale that everyone can relate,based amazing novel by ken kesey randall patrick mcmurphy is antisocial dangerous man no different than petty criminal placed mental ward have his behavior studied he makes friends with lunatics starts his own circle admiration within hospital much dismay nurse ratched central authority figure story one greatest movie villains ever movie exists show not only how corrupt poorly constructed societys approach mentally unstable is but it creates characters that we have all met life shows how mcmurphy like figure that we all wish we had fights freedom choice basic human rights addition movies great spirit acting is fantastic jack nicholson is at his best danny devito can be seen his very first acting role which he absolutely triumphs course theres unforgettable chief bromden directing by milos forman is very well done as camera work is excellent follows pace movie perfectly how it is used what really impressed me was editing especially as far as use audio goes some parts just made me go wow my only complaint is that i believe movie couldve been slightly more effective if it were based more closely novel at certain points but modified point view film does make great point anyone who has ever hated their job been accused something had some person so self righteous convinced their own authority dependency order get your way or attended american public school system at any point their life should be able identify with this movie,0.6112244897959185,0.2533163265306122,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,A perfect mixture of entertainment and drama.,"Czech director Milos Forman seems to be obsessed with rebellious characters that don't like to go with the flow. Just think about Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or Andy Kaufman in ""Man on the Moon"", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.The movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.Yes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.Really one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",perfect mixture entertainment drama,czech director milos forman seems be obsessed with rebellious characters that dont like go with flow just think about larry flynt people vs larry flynt or andy kaufman man moon two most recent movies forman central character one flew over cuckoos nest played by jack nicholson is also one those characters that wants break routine even starts revolt against staff nurse ratchett particular mental institution movie is perhaps more comedy entertainment than heavy drama still that doesnt mean that movie isnt filled with some powerful emotional sequences tension between patients staff gets more more notable grows throughout movie which eventually leads wonderful ending which im not going spoil yes jack nicholson is truly splendid his role it seemed like he was improvising all his lines actions during entire movie it was really oscar worthy performances which he also received another oscar winner her performance was louise fletcher which my opinion is bit too much credit she plays her role well but nothing more than that she did not deeply impressed me or anything this movie also marks debut some today well known actors such as danny devito he looked so young different christopher lloyd brad dourif who also received oscar nomination really one those movies that you must have seen at least once your life 9 10,0.5665277777777776,0.20069444444444443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,The Ultimate Backfire,"It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.Louise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched. It took her years, but she did get another career role in television as the ruler of Bejor, Kai Winn on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one timeless classic, it will be popular a millenia from now.",ultimate backfire,it took dozen years one flew over cuckoos nest make it big screen broadway 1962 kirk douglas made his one only return broadway star as randall p mcmurphy stage with joan tetzel as his nemesis nurse ratched douglas bought screen rights but by time anyone was interested doing film version kirk was too old part that may have been break movie fans because as much as i like kirk douglas i cant see anyone but jack nicholson doing this role as free spirited mcmurphy mcmurphys low level career criminal type who statutorily raped girl as he put it 15 going 35 he decides fake crazy act while prison get out work farm hes assigned so nicholsons goes mental hospital where he meets odd assortment people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves there mainly because its easier stay there not take all your psychological baggage into society thats crucial difference that nicholson finds out hard way his new friends most them can pack up leave anytime they want hes sent there by state state determines when hes ready go even if its past allotted jail time he was sentenced state this case is louise fletcher as nurse ratched one great dickensian names ever given movie character louise is ultimate control freak these people whove shut themselves away life are her ultimate tools when nicholson comes he hasnt given up life like rest these poor souls he becomes threat fletchers little empire its hard believe that such smart guy like mcmurphy would not have known rules about commitment still it doesnt detract bit overall quality one flew over cuckoos nest though topic is not fixed one any era script does leave many oblique references sixties film electroshock treatment lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer use they were pretty barbaric mental health profession discarded these but not before too many lives were shattered with them one flew over cuckoos nest swept main oscar categories it won best picture best director milos forman best actor jack nicholson best actress louise fletcher best adapted screenplay lawrence hauban bo goldman brad dourif was nominated best supporting actor but he lost george burns sunshine boys louise fletcher never got career mileage she should have playing nurse ratched it took her years but she did get another career role television as ruler bejor kai winn star trek deep space nine one flew over cuckoos nest is one timeless classic it will be popular millenia now,0.4888347763347763,0.17631561147186148,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"

The whole cast are excellent actors. The constant mental battle between McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) is a delight to watch. You feel so much hate for nurse Ratched. All the other actors are brilliant in their roles. You kind of want to slap them in the face and wake them up to face reality.

9.0,Now I know why they closed?,"This film is a brutal commentary and observation about mental health services in the United States. Many of these facilities have since closed. Many of these patients would be homeless on the streets. I only saw bits and pieces of the film in the past. Finally to see it altogether, Jack Nicholson is perfect as McMurphy. Nurse Ratched is well played by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched is seen as the villain and labeled one of film history's villains. I don't see Nurse Ratched that way though. I don't know her enough. I believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading a psychiatric ward. I guess we see her coldness and true nature at the end when she discovers Bill's indiscretion. She uses it against him cruelly which leads him to tragedy. But I still don't think Nurse Ratched is this monster.",now i know why they closed,this film is brutal commentary observation about mental health services united states many these facilities have since closed many these patients would be homeless streets i only saw bits pieces film past finally see it altogether jack nicholson is perfect as mcmurphy nurse ratched is well played by louise fletcher nurse ratched is seen as villain labeled one film historys villains i dont see nurse ratched that way though i dont know her enough i believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading psychiatric ward i guess we see her coldness true nature at end when she discovers bills indiscretion she uses it against him cruelly which leads him tragedy but i still dont think nurse ratched is this monster,0.6285714285714287,-0.04107142857142857,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,One Flew Over One of the Best Movies Ever Made!!! (And that person was me),"First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to stand up and cheer.I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.The supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic, intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.The second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay.

,Storytelling that Imprisons,"Spoilers herein.This film is hypnotic. The actors lead with skill, Nicholson is just right, the story is very accessible and the combination hits home. Why should I be unhappy?Because I know the book. Now, I have no illusion about books and translation into film. But it bothers me when I think about why I am drawn into this film, and the book helps me understand why.Kesey's work was from the perspective of the damaged mind of the Indian. It was Nabokovian in dealing with created realities, realities that did not exist but were confabulated as an artifact of us entering some diseased eye. The whole point was there is no anchor of right and wrong.Forman is a talented storyteller, but before he is an artist, he is a Czech. And Czechs (at least in those days) live in only one world: a world where some forces in society unjustly imprison the rest in ways that imprison all. It is a real world, a dark broken world illuminated only by brief flashes of tenacious individualism. Self-immolation. Svankmajer stuff -- check him out. The problem with this vision of 1975 is that it uses the very same techniques it rails against: there really is a good -- it says -- there really is an institutional bad in Forman's world. Cartoonish films are as common as grass, but this one rankles. The institution of Hollywood selfishly changed the ambiguous, morally shifting world of Kesey into a simple morality play knowing that we would be hypnotized with its very clarity.

9.0,Just a Cinema Classic,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a Drama film that is just a classic of cinema and contains performances that are near unmatched. With clashes between characters and the stories delve into the mind of mental patients, the film succeeds in bringing a sweet story with also a dramatic one, even a little humour seasoned in as well. Overall I did have a hard time giving this it's score but in the end I felt this was solidly a sublime film, and here below is why I felt that way.The story is pretty neat, kind of different I felt from many other Oscar winners in the sense that the characters are not dark people and the movie is never scared of being funny quite a bit. It is fascinating to watch too, just to see such a rich storyline play out in front of you, you realise why this film makes many of the best films of all time lists. One other thing I loved about it was that it is also so smartly done, it's lead character brings the story smart lines and also brings the best out in the other characters, just sensational stuff.Jack Nicholson is superb in this, completely crazy yet funny, dark yet excitable, he just brings a wealth of expertise to the movie and his character is one I shall remember for a long time to come in cinema history. Louise Fletcher is great too, she is very calm, and I mean VERY calm yet the way she portrays it just makes it so great to see and her chemistry with Nicholson is movie gold. Look out for Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others, truly bringing even more quality to the already high quality film.Milos Forman directs well in truth, I did feel that altogether Nicholson among others steal the show and you kind of forget about the directing involved, but looking back it is done to a good standard. I enjoyed the script as well, as said before it contains humour, and that means the film is never too serious or something that is always dark, it has a few sweet spots in it. Even the score for the film is haunting, yet it is also very dreamy and really works well to say it is in a mental hospital with patients constantly taking drugs to help them, score goes with it excellently. So hard to find much wrong with it, but the reason I don't think this is a perfect film is mostly down to the last maybe quarter of the movie, it just slows down a lot and although not bad stuff, the quality we are used to at the beginning affects it's slightly less good end(the actual end of the film is fantastic though). I could say that not all the actors are great but well we can't expect everything, to be fair to them Nicholson and Fletcher get most scenes and dialogue so it isn't there fault.If you like a classic piece of cinema, go watch it, this epitomises legendary plot lines and characters and serves as a real way to do movies. If your looking for Oscar films, again this is probably for you, this has to be one of the best Oscar winning films around and trust me, some people may find this their favourite film of all time. For Nicholson fans, well where else to start or end than with possibly his best performance, he rules this film and stays with you way past the 2 hours this film lasts, just great really.Overall it is Solidly a Sublime film as said, I will add I nearly gave the a Perfect mark showing just how amazing this movie really is. This film is always worth a watch if your compiling the best movies of all times, truly is one the best and the performances are also some of the best.

10.0,A wonderful film,"Before I discuss this exceptional film, I need to point out that there is a lot of truth to this film if you are looking for what it was like in psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s and into the 60s. The hellish practices and dehumanization was definitely true of many facilities during this era. However, today, many of the horrific abuses are no longer relevant. So, while some will point to this film as proof that psychiatry in general is evil personified (such as the Scientologists), for the most part, this isn't the case today. Shock treatment is rarely done today and when it is, it's nothing like it is portrayed in the film and it actually has therapeutic value when all else fails. Lobotomies are also thankfully a thing of the past. So, while debating the pros and cons of hospitalization and medications is reasonable today, don't assume the film is in any way like psychiatric institutions today--many of which have been closed or severely reduced in size as well as the length of stay of the average patient.The film begins with a cocky sociopathic criminal, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), being sent to a psychiatric hospital from prison. It seems McMurphy thinks that by ""playing crazy"" he'll have an easier time and shorter stay in a hospital instead of prison. However, over time, he comes to see that a mental hospital is a pretty sick place--particularly when it comes to the crazy staff who run the place. McMurphy responds to this system by constantly fighting it and trying to subvert their needless rules and control. Some of this is very funny (such as the fishing trip) and you can understand why he would fight the oppressive ways of the hospital. In the end, however, the system ultimately crushes him like so many others. The conclusion is certainly something you won't forget!Although Jack Nicholson was great in the film as were the rest of the ensemble cast, the star in the film was Louise Fletcher. She played the coldest and most awful nurse in the history of film. Her tough performance truly made the film. Otherwise, if she hadn't been so utterly devoid of humanity, the film just wouldn't have worked. Oddly, the film's producers had a hard time accepting her for the job--and she was the last one cast in the film.Exceptional in every way--the writing, acting and direction. The only reservation I have regards the misuse of the film by anti-psychiatry groups. However, I am glad the film was made as the abuses of the industry need to be understood and not forgotten.",wonderful film,before i discuss this exceptional film i need point out that there is lot truth this film if you are looking what it was like psychiatric hospitals 1950s into 60s hellish practices dehumanization was definitely true many facilities during this era however today many horrific abuses are no longer relevant so while some will point this film as proof that psychiatry general is evil personified such as scientologists most part this isnt case today shock treatment is rarely done today when it is its nothing like it is portrayed film it actually has therapeutic value when all else fails lobotomies are also thankfully thing past so while debating pros cons hospitalization medications is reasonable today dont assume film is any way like psychiatric institutions today many which have been closed or severely reduced size as well as length stay average patient film begins with cocky sociopathic criminal mcmurphy jack nicholson being sent psychiatric hospital prison it seems mcmurphy thinks that by playing crazy hell have easier time shorter stay hospital instead prison however over time he comes see that mental hospital is pretty sick place particularly when it comes crazy staff who run place mcmurphy responds this system by constantly fighting it trying subvert their needless rules control some this is very funny such as fishing trip you can understand why he would fight oppressive ways hospital end however system ultimately crushes him like so many others conclusion is certainly something you wont forget although jack nicholson was great film as were rest ensemble cast star film was louise fletcher she played coldest most awful nurse history film her tough performance truly made film otherwise if she hadnt been so utterly devoid humanity film just wouldnt have worked oddly films producers had hard time accepting her job she was last one cast film exceptional every way writing acting direction only reservation i have regards misuse film by anti psychiatry groups however i am glad film was made as abuses industry need be understood not forgotten,0.6279761904761905,0.017995169082125582,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Get Mad If You Want To! This Is Very Realistic!,"This is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. In 1975, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" swept all four major academy awards... Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) Best Direstor (Milos Foreman) and, of course, Best Picture!! Only on very rare occasion does this occur... Only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is a stunning portrayal of mental illness, and how even the most affluent nation on earth (The U.S.A.) is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... The array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. The emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers, directors, actors or actresses could partake in this film!! Such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the ""Booby Hatch"" you will be when you get out of it!! In the case of Jack Nicholson's character, he seemed relatively non-culpable for any intense psychiatric affliction, it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! It is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! The talent in this movie is incredible.. I liked the television show ""Taxi"" and it stands to reason why... So many of the actors who starred in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were in the T.V. Show ""Taxi"" too!! The gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! The line I remember in particular was ""Do me a favor and don't be on my side, okay""... In the ""normal"" world, the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! In the case of a poorly funded mental health facility, this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously, and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! Authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding, so they are quick to generalize!! The overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as ""sad"" and platitudes such as ""we will do all we can"" are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! Mental illness gets a generic label, and, from there, becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! Here is where the film ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was based on a true story!! Mr McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was a lone rebel from start to finish with this film!! Whatever the orderlies or the nurses would say, he would disagree with!! It was always an issue that could not be looked at rationally by one patient or the other that compounded the dilemma of mental anguish... Such a plight became the culprit to a lack of thorough communication, and thus invoked an overreaction from the administration of the hospital!! You are branded mentally ill and that is all anyone has to know!! The total lack of egalitarian commiseration with administration was why McMurphy was so belligerent!! The status quo was to subject patients to grave consequences for their actions... Are the nurses and administrators wrong for doing this? Usually not!! It was the gray matter in this film that made it so intellectually riveting!! Mental health patients are often times aware of the fact that they are vilified in the same manner you would a bunch of seven year old kids for not doing their school work!! Their self respect gets relegated to a bureaucratic mandate, and all of this is subconsciously and consciously demoralizing!! If someone were to have a conversation with Charles Manson, they would realize so many depraved patterns of illogical behavior to him, however, if Charles Manson were to say that two plus two equals four, the correct answer does not get changed to five!! What is the point of this example? Mental health patients are not inaccurate in every assessment that they make, just because they are labeled mentally challenged!! What was Mr McMurphy's contention with so many issues is that he would assume a premise of mutual self respect when engaging in an argument with an orderly... This is not a case of defiance, rather an instance of a one on one debate... How quickly the administration would then resort to the cop out of ""Well!!"" ""What do you expect!!"" ""This guy is mentally ill""I have never seen a film like this one!! ""Woman Under The Influence"" which was made around the same time was incredibly spellbinding as well... ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" however, is something which should be put in a category all by itself!! Director, Milos Foreman articulates cerebral despondence to a state of dissonant plausibility with this film!! This becomes an avenue for political debate... Foreman's movie breaks ground on mental illness being one big cacophony of our nation's failure to communicate!! Louise Fletcher is tremendous as Nurse Ratched, her dedication to the tenets of disciplinary policy became vicariously ruthless, her devotion to this standard was extremely deep rooted!! Nurse Ratched's insolence was an aspect of infuriation that was in of itself amazingly thought provoking!! As I have previously mentioned, Jack Nicholson was excellent as McMurphy, the mental health patient who reoriented the ideology of what it means to deal with mental illness... Tremendous film, maybe the best American film ever made... Do you think that sounds strong? Watch the movie first and then tell me I am exaggerating!! REMARKABLE!! UTTERLY REMARKABLE!!",get mad if you want this is very realistic,this is undeniably one best films ever made history movie making 1975 one flew over cuckoos nest swept all four major academy awards

8.0,"Looking At This Famous Film Then, And Now","Like most people, when this film came out in the mid '70s, I thought it was great. Being still young and Liberal, I, too, looked at the rebel as the good guy and the authority figure as the bad guy....just as Hollywood has wanted us to do for a half century. Over the years, I watched a couple of more times and then stopped maybe 20 years ago.A funny thing happened when I looked at it again a few years ago as someone in their mid 50s: I looked at the two main characters in a totally different light.For the first time, now that my Left Wing rebel days are over, I didn't see Nurse Mildred Rachet (Louise Fletcher) as an evil person. On the contrary, the woman was just doing her job. I also appreciated Fletcher's performance more in here. She is outstanding, especially with her facial expressions. The only negative I could find on her was late in the film when she threatened to tell on ""Billy."" Jack Nicholson's character, ""Randle Patrick McMurphy,"" was generally an obnoxious ass. He must have set the Hollywood record at that time for most usages of the Lord's name in vain. I lost count on all the GDs. But Nicholson's performance was still outstanding: that hasn't changed in my eyes. He was also the perfect actor for that role.Who could argue with either of those actors getting Academy Awards for their performances?Yes, the story was good but it was the acting in general which made this such a memorable film. Without Nicholson, Fletcher, Will Samson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito (I didn't recognize him!) and Christopher Lloyd, this film wouldn't have reached the heights it did.This is an unpleasant film in parts. Mental illness is not pretty, but it sure was a memorable film, I'll give it that. Unlike most reviewers, I don't love this film, but I respect it. It hasn't lost its power, either, nor is it dated.",looking at this famous film then now,like most people when this film came out mid 70s i thought it was great being still young liberal i too looked at rebel as good guy authority figure as bad guy just as hollywood has wanted us do half century over years i watched couple more times then stopped maybe 20 years ago funny thing happened when i looked at it again few years ago as someone their mid 50s i looked at two main characters totally different light first time now that my left wing rebel days are over i didnt see nurse mildred rachet louise fletcher as evil person contrary woman was just doing her job i also appreciated fletchers performance more here she is outstanding especially with her facial expressions only negative i could find her was late film when she threatened tell billy jack nicholsons character randle patrick mcmurphy was generally obnoxious ass he must have set hollywood record at that time most usages lords name vain i lost count all gds but nicholsons performance was still outstanding that hasnt changed my eyes he was also perfect actor that role who could argue with either those actors getting academy awards their performances yes story was good but it was acting general which made this such memorable film without nicholson fletcher will samson william redfield brad dourif danny devito i didnt recognize him christopher lloyd this film wouldnt have reached heights it did this is unpleasant film parts mental illness is not pretty but it sure was memorable film ill give it that unlike most reviewers i dont love this film but i respect it it hasnt lost its power either nor is it dated,0.5753229974160207,0.15406976744186046,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,One of the Greatest Ever Made,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) **** (out of 4)What can one say about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Winner of five Academy Awards, director Milos Foreman's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is without question one of the greatest movies ever made and I think it also contains some of the greatest assembled acting that you're ever going to witness.Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is put into a hospital where he's going to be evaluated and right from the start this rebel butts heads with the main nurse (Louise Fletcher). That's pretty much all you need to know about the story because the great characters and the remarkable story just captures you and doesn't let you go until the end credits.There's a lot of credit that deserves to be shared in why this film is so special but you really have to start with Nicholson. If you look at his filmography during this period, it's really remarkable to see the type of roles he was doing. It's also easy to see how these type of films certainly wouldn't be made in today's age and time. Today rebels are shown to be tough guys with no weak spots but films like FIVE EASY PIECES, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE and this one show that the tough rebel can also be highly flawed and not always win.Nicholson's performance here is simply flawless and there's not one false move throughout. It doesn't matter if he's just laughing at what's going on around him or connecting with one of the other characters. It's really hard to think of anyone in the history of cinema doing more with the role than what Nicholson did. Fletcher is also extremely good but for other reasons. It's not so much her ""performance"" but the simple ways she looks at the other characters. She expresses so much with her eyes that you can see why she's able to get the Nicholson character to bring out so much anger and rage. The supporting cast members are all flawless in their own right and really make this one of the most memorable assemble pieces ever put together. Brad Dourif certainly deserves special attention as the troubled Billy.Everything from the music score to the editing to the way the story is build is done with such perfection that I really have no problem in calling this one of the greatest films ever made. The film is full of emotional highs and lo's but this is yet another reason it's so memorable.",one greatest ever made,one flew over cuckoos nest 1975 out 4 what can one say about this masterpiece that hasnt already been said winner five academy awards director milos foremans one flew over cuckoos nest is without question one greatest movies ever made i think it also contains some greatest assembled acting that youre ever going witness randle mcmurphy jack nicholson is put into hospital where hes going be evaluated right start this rebel butts heads with main nurse louise fletcher thats pretty much all you need know about story because great characters remarkable story just captures you doesnt let you go until end credits theres lot credit that deserves be shared why this film is so special but you really have start with nicholson if you look at his filmography during this period its really remarkable see type roles he was doing its also easy see how these type films certainly wouldnt be made todays age time today rebels are shown be tough guys with no weak spots but films like five easy pieces carnal knowledge this one show that tough rebel can also be highly flawed not always win nicholsons performance here is simply flawless theres not one false move throughout it doesnt matter if hes just laughing at whats going around him or connecting with one other characters its really hard think anyone history cinema doing more with role than what nicholson did fletcher is also extremely good but other reasons its not so much her performance but simple ways she looks at other characters she expresses so much with her eyes that you can see why shes able get nicholson character bring out so much anger rage supporting cast members are all flawless their own right really make this one most memorable assemble pieces ever put together brad dourif certainly deserves special attention as troubled billy everything music score editing way story is build is done with such perfection that i really have no problem calling this one greatest films ever made film is full emotional highs los but this is yet another reason its so memorable,0.599952380952381,0.28681349206349194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Insanely perfect,"This will probably be regarded as a very blunt and unpopular statement, but I think that almost one third of the films listed in this website's top 250 do not belong there. Particularly among the first 50-100, there are far too many movies that are either vastly overrated and/or only listed so high because they have large and obsessive fanbases that vote continuously to keep them up there. The opinion naturally doesn't count for a handful of films that are - and forever will remain - undisputable masterpieces. ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is such an undisputable masterpiece, and it actually hurts to see that a landmark like this is getting pushed back in the ranking. I remember, a couple of years ago, this was #5 and all of a sudden, it's only at #18 now.Anyway, I certainly do not always concur with the choices of the Academy Awards committee, but it was the right decision that ""One Flew..."" triumphed in the five main categories, and this in spite of the tough competition that year (""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Jaws"", ""Barry Lyndon"", ...). When your film is considered the best in those five areas, including best script and best film altogether, you can safely conclude it's pretty close to perfection. The story is definitely one of the most absorbing ones ever told, with courageous themes and utmost fascinating characters, and strengthened by the flawless performances of the ensemble cast.

9.0,An Instant Classic,"The 1975 instant classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a blistering and intense comedy-drama that was the first film since 1934's It Happened One Night to sweep the top six major Oscars.This film, based on a novel and play by Ken Kesey, is the story of one Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a career criminal who has been given the option of going to jail or going to a mental institution and his swift and immediate battle of wills with the institution's iron- fisted head nurse, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who he challenges at every turn, not to mention his Pied Piper effect on his fellow patients, which doesn't help endear him to Nurse Ratched either.Kirk Douglas starred in the play on Broadway and his son, Michael Douglas, won an Oscar as one of the producers of this film. Milos Foreman's meticulous direction also won him an Oscar, but it is the electrifying performance by Jack Nicholson that, after four previous nominations, finally nabbed him an Oscar, as he created a truly original character in McMurphy who is a consistent enigma throughout the film, specifically in the sense of whether or not McMurphy is really mentally defective. Nicholson presents a character that allows us to ponder throughout without never being richly entertained for every moment he is on screen. McMurphy induces cheers when he gets overruled to watch the World Series on TV and he pretends to watch the game on TV anyway without turning it on...there is such a joy in watching the other inmates figuring out what he's doing and joining in the game. His final climactic confrontation with Nurse Ratched also will induce cheers.Louise Fletcher won the Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her bone- chilling performance as Nurse Ratched. Fletcher beautifully underplays this extremely unsympathetic character, never resorting to scenery- chewing histrionics, but never forgetting that Ratched is clearly the villain of this piece. It's sad that Flecther's career did a swift downhill after this film because it's a masterful performance of such subtlety and delicacy. Meryl Streep is the only other actress I can think of who could have pulled this role off.Brad Dourif was robbed of one of the few Oscars the film didn't win, Best Supporting Actor, for his moving and riveting performance as Billy Bibbit, the soulful, stuttering manchild with mother issues whose hero worship of McMurphy helps him to develop some backbone up to a point. Mention should also be made of the performances of William Redfield, Danney De Vito, Vincent Schiavelli as fellow patients and especially Will Sampson as the quiet giant Chief Bromden, on whom McMurphy has a remarkable effect.A one of a kind motion picture experience with one of the most beautifully optimistic endings I can recall in a motion picture. 9/10",instant classic,1975 instant classic one flew over cuckoos nest was blistering intense comedy drama that was first film since 1934s it happened one night sweep top six major oscars this film based novel play by ken kesey is story one randle p mcmurphy jack nicholson career criminal who has been given option going jail or going mental institution his swift immediate battle wills with institutions iron fisted head nurse nurse ratched louise fletcher who he challenges at every turn not mention his pied piper effect his fellow patients which doesnt help endear him nurse ratched either kirk douglas starred play broadway his son michael douglas won oscar as one producers this film milos foremans meticulous direction also won him oscar but it is electrifying performance by jack nicholson that after four previous nominations finally nabbed him oscar as he created truly original character mcmurphy who is consistent enigma throughout film specifically sense whether or not mcmurphy is really mentally defective nicholson presents character that allows us ponder throughout without never being richly entertained every moment he is screen mcmurphy induces cheers when he gets overruled watch world series tv he pretends watch game tv anyway without turning it there is such joy watching other inmates figuring out what hes doing joining game his final climactic confrontation with nurse ratched also will induce cheers louise fletcher won oscar outstanding lead actress her bone chilling performance as nurse ratched fletcher beautifully underplays this extremely unsympathetic character never resorting scenery chewing histrionics but never forgetting that ratched is clearly villain this piece its sad that flecthers career did swift downhill after this film because its masterful performance such subtlety delicacy meryl streep is only other actress i can think who could have pulled this role off brad dourif was robbed one few oscars film didnt win best supporting actor his moving riveting performance as billy bibbit soulful stuttering manchild with mother issues whose hero worship mcmurphy helps him develop some backbone up point mention should also be made performances william redfield danney de vito vincent schiavelli as fellow patients especially will sampson as quiet giant chief bromden whom mcmurphy has remarkable effect one kind motion picture experience with one most beautifully optimistic endings i can recall motion picture 9 10,0.5846296296296296,0.16898148148148145,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.39}"
5.0,"""You're not a goddamn loony now!""","The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for ""hidden"" meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see – Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife – are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that ""something"" is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the ""chronics"" in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene – for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent – a fact that should not be overlooked – but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.",youre not goddamn loony now,1970s were golden age politicised cinema race sexuality militarism all came under fire more than ever before meanwhile loosening up codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex violence other taboos while this was generally good thing what it really brought out was that all social advancement going women were still very much losers sexual revolution case point is one flew over cuckoos nest picture spiteful misogyny wrapped politics mental health now im not normally one pick apart movie hidden meanings but this case subtext is unequivocal unpleasant has rarely been discussed it begins as early as excusing mcmurphys criminal past first scene at doctor spiveys office his conviction statutory rape is played down passed off as natural fault girl any case ward it is tyranny women authority that keeps all male patient group down preventing them enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards watching baseball going fishing course getting laid even handful females story whom we never see billys overbearing mother hardings unfaithful wife are portrayed as villains causes patients being committed only acceptable women this worldview are ones like candy they dont answer back arent educated arent fussy who they sleep with but course one flew over cuckoos nest is hailed as passionate plea rights dignity mental patients it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation it gets lot things wrong too though idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated side note isnt it interesting how mid 70s was also time when anti psychiatric cult scientology first began gain currency hollywood its also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people vegetative state while i would never condone procedure implication that lobotomy renders someone fit only euthanasia is insult all living people who have undergone one surely message movie is somewhat blunted by fact that its set fifteen or twenty years before it was made during which time there had been significant reform mental health provision course movies defenders may say exact accuracy psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant as it is supposed be metaphor something more wide reaching i suspect that something is little more than ken keseys misogyny spite all this however one flew over cuckoos nest is admittedly very well made milos forman is superb director one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use multiple camera set ups his shots while not exactly glaring close ups are nevertheless composed focus us entirely people with very few wide shots this has effect that we become barely aware dimensions set but become totally absorbed human story one most brilliantly crafted scenes is first ward meeting where they discuss hardings problems with his wife forman keeps several chronics background those talking head shots both remind us their existence also dynamics scene example bancinis twitching arm which sets pace mounting tension formans coverage magnificent editing by richard chew create very rhythmic form visual storytelling scenes conclusion as we cut agitated bancini being lead away by orderlies vincent schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke jack nicholsons accusing glance at louise fletcher her steely self satisfied glare its as if every shot is subtle comment one that went before it speaking nicholson fletcher one cannot ignore superlative acting this picture lead role nicholson is completely unbridled simply letting his trademark wild man act run riot yet he tempers it with moments seriousness dropping act becoming compellingly real example when he proposes rip out hydrotherapy unit escape fletcher by contrast is model understatement just below icy exterior you can see her anger resentment bubbling away even when she does give way her emotions you can see her character trying restrain them maintain that professional gloss spitting out her lines through clenched teeth each patient characters is superbly cast with performances that range between attention grabbing craziness devastating realism this goes men playing so called chronics as well one flew over cuckoos nest is massively popular highly acclaimed movie though i have some huge reservations about it i can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed its themes ideologies are often abhorrent fact that should not be overlooked but it is undoubtedly stunning piece cinema,0.4837458471760796,0.11435723514211885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"
