8.0,An Alternate Kannada Cinema of Thriller Genre,"Watched the much awaited, much hyped, crowd funded Kannada film ""Lucia"". Was/Is it worth the hype? Why did it win the audience award? Read on!!I have been following on this film right from its initial days. Probably a time-line which goes couple of years back. There were many positives as well as fears on the process of how this film was made. Many in my friends circle doubted about the film but they wanted the process of crowd funding to succeed. But i stuck myself on the aspect of how this film will come-by as an end product and how it will look like on the silver screen. I have had little bit conversation on Lucia with Pawan before and for me thriller is one genre if not made well, immediately gets me angry, dissatisfied and feel like being cheated. Pawan Kumar surprised me today with Lucia. He exceeded my expectation. Its not about the process of crowd funding nor the stars who came to watch this but the film itself is so brilliant that my eyes went moist just because of the joy of cinema. Believe me i mean it when i state that this kind of film script attempt has never ever been tried before, forget about Sandalwood, not even in Tollywood or Bollywood. Pawan will be envied as a filmmaker as he has raised his bar too high and it will be challenging for him and interesting for us to see how he breaks this bar with his next ventures. ""Lucia"" is path-breaking. There are no big stars in the film but it works because of the strong script, the twisted narration, outstanding cinematography (every frame was magical), honest performances by the entire star-cast no matter they played major or minor roles. Technically this is extremely well handled film. Even the art direction is brilliant. I do not have to say about the music as it is already popular. One important aspect about songs is that the songs fit in sync with the script. It is hard to get a sync of song and the script. Only a thoughtful filmmaker can handle this efficiently. If you still think that this did not convince you here are more reasons on why you should watch this film. - You like movies by Chris Nolan (Inception),David Fincher (Fight Club), Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Diparadiso), Alejandro Amenabar (Open Your Eyes) then Lucia is a must watch. - You follow world cinema and appreciate thrillers then here is an Indian regional movie of that caliber. You ought to try this one. It has English subtitles so it should not matter for you the fact that this is a Kannada or regional film. - You like to be surprised while you watch a movie then do watch this. This is not an edge of seat thriller but a profound and surreal psychological thriller. - This is a ""bring your brain to theater"" movie very much in contrast to Rohit Shetty / SRKs Chennai Express. I have not mentioned anything about the story-line as i want you to experience ""Lucia"", the ALTERNATE KANNADA CINEMA all by yourself.",alternate kannada cinema thriller genre,watched much awaited much hyped crowd funded kannada film lucia was is it worth hype why did it win audience award read i have been following this film right its initial days probably time line which goes couple years back there were many positives as well as fears process how this film was made many my friends circle doubted about film but they wanted process crowd funding succeed but i stuck myself aspect how this film will come by as end product how it will look like silver screen i have had little bit conversation lucia with pawan before me thriller is one genre if not made well immediately gets me angry dissatisfied feel like being cheated pawan kumar surprised me today with lucia he exceeded my expectation its not about process crowd funding nor stars who came watch this but film itself is so brilliant that my eyes went moist just because joy cinema believe me i mean it when i state that this kind film script attempt has never ever been tried before forget about sandalwood not even tollywood or bollywood pawan will be envied as filmmaker as he has raised his bar too high it will be challenging him interesting us see how he breaks this bar with his next ventures lucia is path breaking there are no big stars film but it works because strong script twisted narration outstanding cinematography every frame was magical honest performances by entire star cast no matter they played major or minor roles technically this is extremely well handled film even art direction is brilliant i do not have say about music as it is already popular one important aspect about songs is that songs fit sync with script it is hard get sync song script only thoughtful filmmaker can handle this efficiently if you still think that this did not convince you here are more reasons why you should watch this film you like movies by chris nolan inception david fincher fight club giuseppe tornatore cinema diparadiso alejandro amenabar open your eyes then lucia is must watch you follow world cinema appreciate thrillers then here is indian regional movie that caliber you ought try this one it has english subtitles so it should not matter you fact that this is kannada or regional film you like be surprised while you watch movie then do watch this this is not edge seat thriller but profound surreal psychological thriller this is bring your brain theater movie very much contrast rohit shetty srks chennai express i have not mentioned anything about story line as i want you experience lucia alternate kannada cinema all by yourself,0.5387390670553935,0.2115962099125365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,Donot forget your brains,"Well let me make it clear. I am a fan of any sensible cinema be it a mainstream one like Bacchan or an art-house/parallel cinema like Lucia.I went into the theatre having almost no background information or hype and this movie pleasantly surprised me being a rarity in Kannada. Made like an edge of the seat thriller with a great twist at the end,this blink and you miss movie demands your complete attention right from the word go.Definitely not for the popcorn masala loving club sitting in the front row, one of whom who nearly got killed in the interval for recommending this to his friends!In case you do want to know about the story, its about a common man who takes a pill called Lucia sold to him as a dream pill and his journey through it.The director needs to be commended to have taken this challenge and its worth a watch just for his efforts to bring a difficult script come alive almost near perfection.The technical aspects are A class, comparable to any Hollywood creation, the non linear editing, the colors, the camera-work, cinematography and music (which surprisingly strikes a cord with the audience)Not to forget the earnest performances by the entire star cast especially Satish Neenasam who is completely believable as Nikki.The only pitfalls in the movie come (after the exhilarating 1st half)in the early to mid part of 2nd half when the script gets repetitive and tends to drag the movie and the climax where its not clear what makes the hero come to terms with reality.That apart, this movie is ground breaking in many ways and its heartening to watch such stuff on the big screen which was probably unimaginable a few yrs ago.

9.0,India's Answer to INCEPTION!,"Oh my god what a movie! and Why don't these movies come into the mainstream cinema? and if i'm correct this is the first film to be ""crowd funded"" in India. The script is an exceptional one and the way it is executed takes the cake! This is such a technically brilliant movie in more than one dimension; not only Editing, choreography, BGM etc.. but also the story telling is just mind blowing and the treatment of the script is fresh as a blooming flower! Although there is a clear difference between the two parallel story lines as one part is in black & white, but still the way the script is executed you should have the thinking cap on your head firmly! Last but the not least this movie would invariably become a cult classic and miss this film at your own risk because invariably there will be so many clones spewed out in the near future but it would require a touch of genius as well as madness to repeat this kind of brilliance!",indias answer inception,oh my god what movie why dont these movies come into mainstream cinema if im correct this is first film be crowd funded india script is exceptional one way it is executed takes cake this is such technically brilliant movie more than one dimension not only editing choreography bgm etc but also story telling is just mind blowing treatment script is fresh as blooming flower although there is clear difference between two parallel story lines as one part is black white but still way script is executed you should have thinking cap your head firmly last but not least this movie would invariably become cult classic miss this film at your own risk because invariably there will be so many clones spewed out near future but it would require touch genius as well as madness repeat this kind brilliance,0.48464912280701755,0.24561403508771926,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,Mind Blowing Entertainer!,"One of the best movies I've watched in recent times. It keeps you engaged and guessing until the last leg of the movie after which story unravels in a coherent manner. Screen play is terrific and songs/music are pretty impressive. Special mention needs to be done on hero of movie for his versatility - ease with which he lives in two contrasting worlds couldn't have got better. Also, Kudos to the director who has shown immense talent in depicting a complicated story line in the most lucid way possible.Although movie will be much appreciated by viewers who understand Kannada, I believe others with help of sub titles too will find the movie a master piece.PS: This is my first movie review online and I couldn't resist from sharing it here since for the first time I saw audience after the movie clapping in admiration.",mind blowing entertainer,one best movies ive watched recent times it keeps you engaged guessing until last leg movie after which story unravels coherent manner screen play is terrific songs music are pretty impressive special mention needs be done hero movie his versatility ease with which he lives two contrasting worlds couldnt have got better also kudos director who has shown immense talent depicting complicated story line most lucid way possible although movie will be much appreciated by viewers who understand kannada i believe others with help sub titles too will find movie master piece ps this is my first movie review online i couldnt resist sharing it here since first time i saw audience after movie clapping admiration,0.6034226190476191,0.26919642857142856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.57, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,A Brainy from Pawan Kumar. A movie perfectly suits with 'Nee Mayeyolago Maye Ninnolago'.,"The movie was very well narrated with an awesome screenplay showing the comparison of a Poor & Rich thinking in one Man in his own stream with an Illusion concept, A True message about the dreams which must be watched on screen. All the Characters in the film performed very well. A thriller turn at the end of the movie which never be expected by anyone and which makes us to think entire movie in totally opposite way, Probably a surprise Package. The plus for the movies is Music, Background scores & Camera work which are at peaks. Surely as Pawan said 'If you miss a blink, you loose a link' means even a small seconds in the movie are very important to watch. The Movie will be played with subtitles, for those who don't know Kannada can also watch this movie. A must watch movie for all. All the best Team Lucia.",brainy pawan kumar movie perfectly suits with nee mayeyolago maye ninnolago,movie was very well narrated with awesome screenplay showing comparison poor rich thinking one man his own stream with illusion concept true message about dreams which must be watched screen all characters film performed very well thriller turn at end movie which never be expected by anyone which makes us think entire movie totally opposite way probably surprise package plus movies is music background scores camera work which are at peaks surely as pawan said if you miss blink you loose link means even small seconds movie are very important watch movie will be played with subtitles those who dont know kannada can also watch this movie must watch movie all all best team lucia,0.5926949786324787,0.3073798076923077,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Lucia - A wonderful dream. Live n love the dream...,"My review on LUCIA (Kannada film) :The 1st word that comes to my mind when I think about LUCIA is ""DREAM"", cos for many reasons : 1. Firstly, its a dream project of Director Pawan Kumar and the entire team of LUCIA. 2. It was also the audiences' dreams to have funded in the film, first of its kind, a crowd funded film- which is a dream come true. 3. We all dream in our lives as we are normal human beings, after I watched this film I have 3 things to say : "" I saw the dream, I loved the dream and I'm still living in that dream"" Presenting to you 1 of the best movies ever made in Kannada and Indian cinema, a special thanks to Pawan Kumar and his entire team for trusting, investing and instilling this dream into our lives.Please note : I've watched this film twice yesterday once at PVR and once at Veeresh, to also understand the public reactions. Also request to all the people who don't know Kannada to watch this film as there are sub-titles.Firstly, Director Pawan Kumar : This man is an extraordinary n unbelievable magician, he has proved with Lucia that he can give tough competition to Upendra who is known for his different, unique brain- teasing concepts and editing. Lucia teases your brain, n please carry your brain to this film as its a no-nonsense movie with full on entertainment. What I liked about Lucia is its a simple thought very cleverly/brilliantly told with the necessary entertaining/commercial aspects be it songs, humor, making, emotions. It is very difficult to package all the things n yet come up with a unique n brilliant product. We normally have seen many directors in the past who have tried to say so many things/characters in 1 plot but have failed miserably. But Pawan excels n succeeds with this, 1 of the most brilliant narratives and editing ever. My prediction "" Lucia will sweep most of the awards for the year 2013"".Hero Satish Neenasam : Satish ""Neenu Awesome"". Truly this guy deserves a huge round of applause. Excellent screen presence, confidence, expressions, dialog delivery. Normally he is known for his comical roles, but he has excelled with Lucia. In few sequences he underplays himself so much by giving the right kinda expression, 1 scene where I loved his acting is at the Pizza joint where he meets the heroine n gets disappointed n then leaves with the money on table, I swear I was in tears. That scene touched my heart and also the theater renovation process.Heroine Sruthi Hariharan: Pretty, Bold, Beautifulyet soulful, this girl also surprises with her varied looks n expressions. She is a perfect mix of class n mass. I loved the sequences which portray ""emotional vs practical"" between hero n heroine. Very practical, yet emotional. This girl has a bright future. In few angles she looks similar to Sindhu Loknath.Achyuta Kumar : One of the finest actors, for me if any1 who has replaced the veteran Ananth Nag its got to be this great man ""Achyuta Kumar"". He has put in his life to the character 'Shankaranna'. The best on-screen chemistry in this film is not the hero-heroine's , but its Achyuta Kumar-Satish's. Extraordinary performance.Cinematography by Siddharta Nuni and Gomtesh Upadhye is mind-blowing, both indoor&outdoor sequences have been well shot with excellent lighting system.Music by the débutant Poornachandra Tejasvi, is soulful, magical, engaging, foot-tapping n will haunt you even after you've left the cinema hall. The background score is out of the world. Singers : Naveen Sajju, Bappi Blossom, Udith, Ananya Bhat n others have given a lot of life with their voice.way to go people. All the best n congrats.The support cast n crew also doesn't go unnoticed, I'm unaware of their names but remember each n every character, the detective, cops, item;), The tall scary villain, the foreigners; all in all very good performances.Few things which I thought could've been better : 1. Second half seems to be little longer with few lengthy scenes, though the film's duration is 138 minutes, I thought at least 8-10 minutes of the movie could've been shot. 2. Helu Shiva song could've been shot better, for me it wasn't that impactive as others. 3. Only 1 scene in which Sruthi doesn't look too good is when Satish n his parents come to see her at her house, make-up could've been better.All in all L-Lovable, U-Unique, C- Clever, I- Involving, A – Amazing. Don't miss this dream, you'll enjoy it. A milestone in Kannada cinema. My rating : 4.75/5.",lucia wonderful dream live n love dream,my review lucia kannada film 1st word that comes my mind when i think about lucia is dream cos many reasons 1 firstly its dream project director pawan kumar entire team lucia 2 it was also audiences dreams have funded film first its kind crowd funded film which is dream come true 3 we all dream our lives as we are normal human beings after i watched this film i have 3 things say i saw dream i loved dream im still living that dream presenting you 1 best movies ever made kannada indian cinema special thanks pawan kumar his entire team trusting investing instilling this dream into our lives please note ive watched this film twice yesterday once at pvr once at veeresh also understand public reactions also request all people who dont know kannada watch this film as there are sub titles firstly director pawan kumar this man is extraordinary n unbelievable magician he has proved with lucia that he can give tough competition upendra who is known his different unique brain teasing concepts editing lucia teases your brain n please carry your brain this film as its no nonsense movie with full entertainment what i liked about lucia is its simple thought very cleverly brilliantly told with necessary entertaining commercial aspects be it songs humor making emotions it is very difficult package all things n yet come up with unique n brilliant product we normally have seen many directors past who have tried say so many things characters 1 plot but have failed miserably but pawan excels n succeeds with this 1 most brilliant narratives editing ever my prediction lucia will sweep most awards year 2013 hero satish neenasam satish neenu awesome truly this guy deserves huge round applause excellent screen presence confidence expressions dialog delivery normally he is known his comical roles but he has excelled with lucia few sequences he underplays himself so much by giving right kinda expression 1 scene where i loved his acting is at pizza joint where he meets heroine n gets disappointed n then leaves with money table i swear i was tears that scene touched my heart also theater renovation process heroine sruthi hariharan pretty bold beautiful yet soulful this girl also surprises with her varied looks n expressions she is perfect mix class n mass i loved sequences which portray emotional vs practical between hero n heroine very practical yet emotional this girl has bright future few angles she looks similar sindhu loknath achyuta kumar one finest actors me if any1 who has replaced veteran ananth nag its got be this great man achyuta kumar he has put his life character shankaranna best screen chemistry this film is not hero heroines but its achyuta kumar satishs extraordinary performance cinematography by siddharta nuni gomtesh upadhye is mind blowing both indoor outdoor sequences have been well shot with excellent lighting system music by d butant poornachandra tejasvi is soulful magical engaging foot tapping n will haunt you even after youve left cinema hall background score is out world singers naveen sajju bappi blossom udith ananya bhat n others have given lot life with their voice way go people all best n congrats support cast n crew also doesnt go unnoticed im unaware their names but remember each n every character detective cops item tall scary villain foreigners all all very good performances few things which i thought couldve been better 1 second half seems be little longer with few lengthy scenes though films duration is 138 minutes i thought at least 8 10 minutes movie couldve been shot 2 helu shiva song couldve been shot better me it wasnt that impactive as others 3 only 1 scene which sruthi doesnt look too good is when satish n his parents come see her at her house make up couldve been better all all l lovable u unique c clever i involving amazing dont miss this dream youll enjoy it milestone kannada cinema my rating 4 75 5,0.5946453373015871,0.2774774155242905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Lucia is awesome . . .,"#Lucia - People who have watched #Inception are saying that Lucia is India's own Inception but I say ' there is only one Lucia in the whole world and it is original '. Inception was about ' a dream within a dream ' but Lucia is about ' lucid dreaming ' so there is no way that these both EPIC movies can be weighed on the same scale because it would seem a stubborn act. #PawanKumar is a man who stands in a league where #ChristopherNolan #StevenSpielberg etc stand, for me. Even if you want to try finding flaws in this movie it is 'Mission Impossible', Pawan Kumar should be an inspiration to the whole industry, he has come out of the box of the age old Indian movie formulas and has done a film that stands unique in the whole world (at least what I know of). You reach out for the characters in the movie and that is something great. He makes the people think, 'what you think is a dream is actually a reality but what you think is reality is actually a dream'. You will be 'Mind Fu..ed'. Pawan Kumar, he with his film and his team need to be nominated to the #OSCARS (am not here to over exaggerate). No wonder it won an award at The London Indian film festival. Cinematography by #SiddharthNuni needs a special mention, shot in a 5d camera, he has made an already classic script into a masterpiece movie on screen. He captures every emotions in its own shade. #PoornaChandraTejaswi the music director is a true find and is a bright prospect to the Kannada industry. He delivers justice through songs and lifts the movie to another level through his BGM which is apt to each and every scene. #NeenasamSatish - now who would have ever thought he had such wide range of emotions hidden in him as an actor? The emotions that he portrays as a normal torch guy or the way he carries the attitude of a film star is mind blowing. #ShrutiHariharan the heroine is convincing and has delivered justice to her role. #AchyuthKumar as the owner of the theater which doesn't see audience or as the manager of a film star is flawless, a true actor. Editing - don't really know him it is but gives you the feel of a Hollywood film with his cut and paste work. It goes razor sharp transporting the movie at a brisk pace so that it doesn't bore you anywhere and yet keeps the suspense going along. Now all said and done about the movie, I am gonna talk as a Kannadiga now - Saw some page today posting watch Lucia at your own risk and I like to rephrase it saying ' miss Lucia at your own risk '. ' The movie is strictly not for fools '. People who hate Kannada movies take this..!.. Finally thanks to the audience who produced this movie. Lucia - an evergreen movie . . . Lucia isn't actually a person if you think it is but it is something else, if you wanna know it watch the movie at a theater . . . The only film where I saw people clap after it ended was #Avatar after that it is only Lucia . . .",lucia is awesome,people who have watched are saying that lucia is indias own inception but i say there is only one lucia whole world it is original inception was about dream within dream but lucia is about lucid dreaming so there is no way that these both epic movies can be weighed same scale because it would seem stubborn act is man who stands league where etc stand me even if you want try finding flaws this movie it is mission impossible pawan kumar should be inspiration whole industry he has come out box age old indian movie formulas has done film that stands unique whole world at least what i know you reach out characters movie that is something great he makes people think what you think is dream is actually reality but what you think is reality is actually dream you will be mind fu ed pawan kumar he with his film his team need be nominated am not here over exaggerate no wonder it won award at london indian film festival cinematography by needs special mention shot 5d camera he has made already classic script into masterpiece movie screen he captures every emotions its own shade music director is true find is bright prospect kannada industry he delivers justice through songs lifts movie another level through his bgm which is apt each every scene now who would have ever thought he had such wide range emotions hidden him as actor emotions that he portrays as normal torch guy or way he carries attitude film star is mind blowing heroine is convincing has delivered justice her role as owner theater which doesnt see audience or as manager film star is flawless true actor editing dont really know him it is but gives you feel hollywood film with his cut paste work it goes razor sharp transporting movie at brisk pace so that it doesnt bore you anywhere yet keeps suspense going along now all said done about movie i am gonna talk as kannadiga now saw some page today posting watch lucia at your own risk i like rephrase it saying miss lucia at your own risk movie is strictly not fools people who hate kannada movies take this finally thanks audience who produced this movie lucia evergreen movie lucia isnt actually person if you think it is but it is something else if you wanna know it watch movie at theater only film where i saw people clap after it ended was after that it is only lucia,0.6288533834586466,0.21488095238095237,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,Beautiful Movie and Beautiful execution,"If you admire movies like Inception, Illusion, Fight Club then this movie is a must watch. I cant imagine anyone other than Satish as Nikhil(Suddep and Diganth were considered for this role). Even Sudeep wouldn't have matched Satish performance as Nikhil, and Diganth thank god they didn't cast him in this movie. Otherwise this movie would have been a BIG joke. Shruthi is cute and bubbly, perfect as Shwetha. Making is so good never felt like its a low budget movie. Pawan has given attention to every detail in the movie that's incredible may be we wont see this kind of perfection in Kannada Directors (may be not even Bollywood directors). Its confusing in few scenes when Nikhil looks at Lucia bottle etc... but it becomes clear during the last 10 minutes. You will start correlating Nikhils real life and his dreams once you are done with watching. This will keep you busy for a while :). Enjoyed each and every bit of movie for the last 10 minutes I just uttered ""what the f***"" and I was awestruck. Pawan has increased his bar. We will be expecting the unexpected from this guy.

8.0,"Go experience this movie and allow it to teach you a lesson or two, while you get entertained.","Which is of greater importance; the cozy, familiar world of reality or the dizzying, intoxicating world of dreams? Which has higher stakes? Which would you rather lose? Lucia experiments two different world with aplomb. Nikki is our average small-town boy, who ventures into the big city. He lives in a shack, in a rundown street and works as the torch-bearing usher at his uncle's (Shankranna) old, crumbling talkies. He is the good-natured, happy-go-lucky person who breezes his way into your hearts. You are soon laughing at his silly pranks, sympathizing with his troubles and rooting for him as he woos his lady love (Swetha), a waitress at the pizza outlet. Nikki, like most of us, also simultaneously inhabits the grand world of his dreams; where he can 'choose' to be what he likes. There he is a successful (all-in-one) movie star. He is always in the spotlight, mobbed by throngs of fans and the press, pursued by extortionists; as you cheer along. But as the movie progresses, his dreams begin to outweigh reality and his life, apparently simple; is now in doldrums. The line between the two blurs and his 2 worlds are about to collide and destroy each other. Can Nikki survive this tug-of-war with his own-self? This film excels in every department. The presentation and treatment of the story by the director, is commendable. The screenplay keeps you at the edge of your seat, as you try to comprehend the roller coaster journey of the protagonist's life. The pace of the movie slackens in between, burdened with too many songs; but your patience will be rewarded as the movie races to a thrilling finish. The cast comprises of relatively fresh faces, all of them delivering superlative performances. Made on a small budget, it proves that a movie sans a popular cast, foreign locales can still capture a large audience; which in turn lends credibility to the idea of crowd-funded cinema. Lucia has surpassed the 'Superhit' phase to become a milestone in the history of Kannada movies.

10.0,Lucia (2013) - What I felt about the movie,"This is not a review, just what I felt about the movie.1. The basic theme of the film is relatively away from the typical storyline of Indian cinemas. If you have noticed carefully, the film starts with some lines by a poet called Kanakadasa, which said the entire theme and plot of this story. One of the lines goes like this 'Are you a creature of illusion, Or illusion is your creation?' You get carried away by the film that you almost forget that they have said this, until the very end of the story where they break it. Just like the film sixth sense, where bruce asks the child 'what is your problem'. He says 'I see dead people'. Then they show a close up of bruce willis for 30 seconds, but you will not get that until the end of the story.2. Other thing that is very different from usual films is that the story is non-linear. A typical Indian film will have the story told like this: A-------Z (just plain story); or if it has a flash back then J--------M, A----------I, M-----------Z. When you take this story, there are three streams, a present, a past and an alternate past. And these three streams are interchanged frequently producing non-linear screenplay. If I take events in the present as M-----Z and events in the past as A-------M and A'---------M'(real past and alternate past respectively) then the screenplay goes like this: M----N, A----B, A'-----B', N-----O, B------C, B'------C' and goes on till Y------Z. Now this is quite complex, which we don't see frequently. Compared to the other English films (memento, prestige, triangle, 12 monkeys, and some other crazy time travel related movies) this screenplay is relatively easy to understand. But still not a usual occurrence.3. I heard that including the hero, all the actors are new to the acting, which I found very hard to believe. Especially, the hero. He has two different roles (one in the real past and other in the alternate past). Luckily they showed his transformation from one to other very early in the film. Otherwise it would have been difficult to identify that both are done by same person. Now the point is he did not do any make up gimmicks to stay different, but he used his body language, pronunciation of dialogues, to make the difference. And you know what, it worked. When he say finally in the interview 'I just want to disappear and be invisible in the crowd' it looked as though he really meant it. At no place, it looked like he or others overacted or anything. When you finish the movie, just see his interview in black and white again, you will get what I wanted to say.4. The director gives some clues for you identify here and there. I usually get offended when a film like this doesn't have clues and finally in the climax they just explain plainly giving us reasons. You can see all these clues in films like prestige, sixth sense and usual suspects which are scattered throughout the film. Giving clues is a win-win situation for the director. If we find the clues, we are happy that we found that even before they showed it. If we did not find, again we will think how foolish we were to miss that and praise the director for his smartness. In both situations, director gets what he want which is the appreciation of the movie.5. There is one good moment in the film prestige, where they explain the three acts of a magic trick, about showing something everyone knows and about people who wants to get fooled. Here also the same thing happens. The director presents to you something which is a very common occurrence, and make you believe it. Finally he gives some reason to change everything. You know you are fooled, but you feel happy for the same. (SPOILER: we always think that if they show something what we usually see, we take it for reality. The director used it. We take the coloured story as real (just because it was colorful) and take the grey one as dream because it was not natural. Finally when he answers in the interview that he lost his ability to see colours from childhood and he dreams in colours, everything comes into perspective).6. No dialogues, no songs, no scenes seemed forced in this movie. They were careful enough to not get comments like 'oh.. that song is unnecessary. Or Why did they even place this scene here' 7. The cinematography was so good in the first few minutes with lots of new techniques, just like arnofsky's requiem for a dream. Then it went on for usual filming style. Note that the movie was funded only by audience. Probably they did not have enough money to continue the same till the end.8. The ideas of this movie are original. Some concepts like (SPOILER) killing the alternate ego to wake him up from the dream state is loosely based on inception (kill and u come back to reality), or being in the dream world for longer makes him think that THAT is the reality (inception). But nowhere it looked it was copied.9. Finally the theme of the movie is so different and philosophical it makes you think at that end. They finally say 'One man's life is other's dream'. We can take this like anything. A. Your life is someone else's dream. Which means someone else is longing to live your life. Which means your life is so much better. Why do you want to attain a dream life? Or B. Why do you want to dream and live an alternate dream life. Try to make your dreams happen and make your dream life, the reality. Whatever it is, it definitely makes you think and for a long time.",lucia 2013 what i felt about movie,this is not review just what i felt about movie 1 basic theme film is relatively away typical storyline indian cinemas if you have noticed carefully film starts with some lines by poet called kanakadasa which said entire theme plot this story one lines goes like this are you creature illusion or illusion is your creation you get carried away by film that you almost forget that they have said this until very end story where they break it just like film sixth sense where bruce asks child what is your problem he says i see dead people then they show close up bruce willis 30 seconds but you will not get that until end story 2 other thing that is very different usual films is that story is non linear typical indian film will have story told like this z just plain story or if it has flash back then j m i m z when you take this story there are three streams present past alternate past these three streams are interchanged frequently producing non linear screenplay if i take events present as m z events past as m m real past alternate past respectively then screenplay goes like this m n b b n o b c b c goes till y z now this is quite complex which we dont see frequently compared other english films memento prestige triangle 12 monkeys some other crazy time travel related movies this screenplay is relatively easy understand but still not usual occurrence 3 i heard that including hero all actors are new acting which i found very hard believe especially hero he has two different roles one real past other alternate past luckily they showed his transformation one other very early film otherwise it would have been difficult identify that both are done by same person now point is he did not do any make up gimmicks stay different but he used his body language pronunciation dialogues make difference you know what it worked when he say finally interview i just want disappear be invisible crowd it looked as though he really meant it at no place it looked like he or others overacted or anything when you finish movie just see his interview black white again you will get what i wanted say 4 director gives some clues you identify here there i usually get offended when film like this doesnt have clues finally climax they just explain plainly giving us reasons you can see all these clues films like prestige sixth sense usual suspects which are scattered throughout film giving clues is win win situation director if we find clues we are happy that we found that even before they showed it if we did not find again we will think how foolish we were miss that praise director his smartness both situations director gets what he want which is appreciation movie 5 there is one good moment film prestige where they explain three acts magic trick about showing something everyone knows about people who wants get fooled here also same thing happens director presents you something which is very common occurrence make you believe it finally he gives some reason change everything you know you are fooled but you feel happy same spoiler we always think that if they show something what we usually see we take it reality director used it we take coloured story as real just because it was colorful take grey one as dream because it was not natural finally when he answers interview that he lost his ability see colours childhood he dreams colours everything comes into perspective 6 no dialogues no songs no scenes seemed forced this movie they were careful enough not get comments like oh that song is unnecessary or why did they even place this scene here 7 cinematography was so good first few minutes with lots new techniques just like arnofskys requiem dream then it went usual filming style note that movie was funded only by audience probably they did not have enough money continue same till end 8 ideas this movie are original some concepts like spoiler killing alternate ego wake him up dream state is loosely based inception kill u come back reality or being dream world longer makes him think that that is reality inception but nowhere it looked it was copied 9 finally theme movie is so different philosophical it makes you think at that end they finally say one mans life is others dream we can take this like anything your life is someone elses dream which means someone else is longing live your life which means your life is so much better why do you want attain dream life or b why do you want dream live alternate dream life try make your dreams happen make your dream life reality whatever it is it definitely makes you think long time,0.42651623628896357,0.005984444848081207,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,His Master's Voice,"Had planned to watch this multiple times, but finally was able to do so, along with 5 other audience members this morning in the sole multiplex this one's playing at, in the city of Bengaluru. 2 of them walked out a little after the interval. One of the people I met last night, on coming to know I planned to watch this, said it was too boring and confusing, and had to be re-watched 2-3 times in order to understand. He also mentioned that the entire movie was shot using a mobile phone camera.The reviews have been focusing on 2 aspects, 1 more than the other, which is the crowd funded nature of this endeavor. The other being the fact that this is very similar to various other movies in the mind&*^) genre, including Memento, Inception, Machinist, Donnie Darko et al.I had not seen this director's earlier work. All I had were the above intros. I was also worried that I'd have a problem understanding the movie, considering 2 things - 1, being I don't speak the language, and 2, I had a similar problem with a Malayalam movie last week, which did not have subtitles, but which I understood better, and which also had a significant portion of its narrative in other languages I understood like English, Hindi and Tamil.At various points while watching this one, esp. the spectacularly mind-bending and spell-binding climax, I was totally bowled over, and thought that everything that has been spoken of this magnificent piece of work has been cruelly unfair to the screenplay, and the finished product. Forget the fact that it was crowd-funded, forget the fact that there are @$$4013$ in the audience that walk out/find this boring (let them lap up the drudgery of Bollywood/Sandalwood/Tollywood/Mollywood. Let them dream of those lives. This is Not art-house cinema for the pretentious. This is pure commercial cinema (sample the 5 songs, that Do NOT clutter/interrupt the smooth narrative) with all the bells/whistles in place (the right place, that is). But, it is intelligent commercial cinema, that demands nothing but attention from the viewer. Most movies have made me cynical/jaded from appreciating the assembly- line output, but movies like this, and Shahid-Lunchbox-xxxx re-affirm my faith in making that trek to the multiplex, and doling out hard-earned money to watch masterpieces such as this. I'm absolutely gonna watch it again (it Has subtitles too, btw), purchase the Blu/DVD when that releases, and purchase the music CD of its songs (though I enjoyed the 1st one only). And oh, lest I forget, everything's just about perfect - the score, the casting and the performances (all), the cinematography, locations yada yada yada.....

9.0,Lucia - Kinship of Life and Dream !,"I had an intransigent negative view as regards the Kannada movies and its standards. I had firmly believed that the movie industry hadn't still broken the aura of 80's. Someone had suggested me to watch the movie 'Lucia'. To be frank, I was not at all interested. Movies which doesn't have the class and quality used to ruin my mood in the initial stages of the play itself. We can compromise on the storyline provided the movie is an entertainer or if the movie delivers at least peace of mind and happiness. Also if it delivers a good message and theme, we can adjust as well. But some movies which show crap phenomenon can kill your mood and day as well. Here I was afraid of that. And as a Bengalurian I had a bad feeling on Kannada movies as a result of seeing old-style movie posters on the road sides, and after watching some absurd and ludicrous dance performances and movie - scenes in television; spare not the costumes as well. When I was apprised of the fact that the movie 'Lucia' comes in genres 'Sci-fi' and 'Thriller', I was doubtful and had a predisposed mentality in my mind that I would not be watching the movie for not more than half an hour, which also happens to be the maximum limit that I had set in my mind. The information from my 'adviser' that the movie went to some film festivals on international basis prompted me to watch the movie. So I sat and gave a try. And boy was I not flabbergasted. The way the movie started promised me that the director is good. And the way the movie ended proved me on not just the script but on the quality of the movie and its merit to have gone to standard Film festivals. The movie is all about a drug 'Lucia' which has the ability to create vivid pictures in perfect juxtaposition through dreaming. And not just dreams rather dreams which can be controlled. Once the movie made its quarter way through I doubted whether it was just psychedelics and drug addiction which was all that the movie had in it. But it's not! The movie revolves around a person who had some unsatisfactory meaning for his life. The person ends up laying his hands on the drug 'Lucia' and suddenly finds himself in an avenue of a dream which he had fantasized since childhood. The drug 'Lucia' has a symptom – the dreams will be your life and your life will be just like your dream but once you stop consuming it then life would get mixed with the dream and the dream would end up as a nightmare. The movie is a kinship of these two that is the dream and life – a wee bit comparable with 'Fight Club'. If the story line is to be just given in concrete the viewer would lose the momentum and Thrill in watching it for which reason I prefer not to reveal anything on it. But for the sake of satisfaction for my heart I will put it as this – two personalities are involved, one who is a dreamer and one who is the protagonist in the dream, who is but the same person ending up winded up over the unavailability of' Lucia', which mandates the need for both to get killed or lost. One can never understand that the movie runs in retrograde. Only after the movie ends the viewer gets to discern as to what portrayed as reality was and which one the dream was. Adding to that one has to put in his full concentration and interest in order to understand the movie. If not the viewer has to just clap hands alongside the people who were successful in imbibing the life and meaning of the movie. The direction is awe-inspiring and one would never be able to accept that the movie was taken from a 5D camera. The mixing is so perfect. People have a tendency. When they hear it's a Sci-Fi, they spurn the very need to watch the movie no matter how good it is as it might not provide them the entertainment of their own taste they look for. And some people who come to know that drugs and dreaming is involved they would abstain themselves from watching movie for the fear of getting affected by it or maybe due to the protective mind of not letting to know their wards or beloved ones on the negative concepts involved in drug-addiction. Likewise all the people have separate interests towards choosing a movie to watch. Be it Scary ones, romance, Crime or anything. But here the beauty is that the movie isn't coming in any of these categories. That means any person can watch. No negative atmosphere or no negative message is involved. The movie in fact provides a happy ending but in a very different and new way. So all are welcome. The movie is a pleasure to the eyes and an informative guide for a lot who have shunned themselves out of some intricate and negative realities involved in this generation. The movie all together is beautiful and genuine and has some down to earth realities of life clubbed in the best way possible. Had it been furbished a little bit more after scrutinizing and omitting minor flaws, it would have won World-reputation like the movies 'Inception' and 'Fight Club'. And trust me flaws can't be spotted as it's only in the end that the eyes open. It's a must watch movie.",lucia kinship life dream,i had intransigent negative view as regards kannada movies its standards i had firmly believed that movie industry hadnt still broken aura 80s someone had suggested me watch movie lucia be frank i was not at all interested movies which doesnt have class quality used ruin my mood initial stages play itself we can compromise storyline provided movie is entertainer or if movie delivers at least peace mind happiness also if it delivers good message theme we can adjust as well but some movies which show crap phenomenon can kill your mood day as well here i was afraid that as bengalurian i had bad feeling kannada movies as result seeing old style movie posters road sides after watching some absurd ludicrous dance performances movie scenes television spare not costumes as well when i was apprised fact that movie lucia comes genres sci fi thriller i was doubtful had predisposed mentality my mind that i would not be watching movie not more than half hour which also happens be maximum limit that i had set my mind information my adviser that movie went some film festivals international basis prompted me watch movie so i sat gave try boy was i not flabbergasted way movie started promised me that director is good way movie ended proved me not just script but quality movie its merit have gone standard film festivals movie is all about drug lucia which has ability create vivid pictures perfect juxtaposition through dreaming not just dreams rather dreams which can be controlled once movie made its quarter way through i doubted whether it was just psychedelics drug addiction which was all that movie had it but its not movie revolves around person who had some unsatisfactory meaning his life person ends up laying his hands drug lucia suddenly finds himself avenue dream which he had fantasized since childhood drug lucia has symptom dreams will be your life your life will be just like your dream but once you stop consuming it then life would get mixed with dream dream would end up as nightmare movie is kinship these two that is dream life wee bit comparable with fight club if story line is be just given concrete viewer would lose momentum thrill watching it which reason i prefer not reveal anything it but sake satisfaction my heart i will put it as this two personalities are involved one who is dreamer one who is protagonist dream who is but same person ending up winded up over unavailability lucia which mandates need both get killed or lost one can never understand that movie runs retrograde only after movie ends viewer gets discern as what portrayed as reality was which one dream was adding that one has put his full concentration interest order understand movie if not viewer has just clap hands alongside people who were successful imbibing life meaning movie direction is awe inspiring one would never be able accept that movie was taken 5d camera mixing is so perfect people have tendency when they hear its sci fi they spurn very need watch movie no matter how good it is as it might not provide them entertainment their own taste they look some people who come know that drugs dreaming is involved they would abstain themselves watching movie fear getting affected by it or maybe due protective mind not letting know their wards or beloved ones negative concepts involved drug addiction likewise all people have separate interests towards choosing movie watch be it scary ones romance crime or anything but here beauty is that movie isnt coming any these categories that means any person can watch no negative atmosphere or no negative message is involved movie fact provides happy ending but very different new way so all are welcome movie is pleasure eyes informative guide lot who have shunned themselves out some intricate negative realities involved this generation movie all together is beautiful genuine has some down earth realities life clubbed best way possible had it been furbished little bit more after scrutinizing omitting minor flaws it would have won world reputation like movies inception fight club trust me flaws cant be spotted as its only end that eyes open its must watch movie,0.5621744227994228,0.1245828823953824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
6.0,Too many likes to be true,"I was checking that IMDb score and though. Did I miss something last year? Nope. I am not even sure why it is tagged sci-fi. I found it slow and got bored after a while, just waiting for the story to unfold, with little surprises, and no real twist. The viewer can probably go to the loo without missing much of the story. Although there is potential for reality/dream scenarios, this movie hardly exploits it. I was intrigued when a second user was introduced to the screen, hoping for the story to develop in complexity, only to go back to the romance storyline after a second. Maybe a missed opportunity. In fact the budget is probably the most impressive aspect of this movie, and it shows that one doesn't need multi-million budget to get good quality images on screen. But like most Indian movies, it seems that the director can't get away from Bollywood love stereotypes stories, as if stuck in time. Don't get me wrong, the film was reasonably pleasant to watch with typical Indian humour all the way through, but if the director wants to explore some new genre, he is going to need to make a bigger effort in his writing to satisfy the effervescence of the human mind.What the production did get right, was managing a score of 8.5, but we all know India can make miracles when it comes to the internet. ;)",too many likes be true,i was checking that imdb score though did i miss something last year nope i am not even sure why it is tagged sci fi i found it slow got bored after while just waiting story unfold with little surprises no real twist viewer can probably go loo without missing much story although there is potential reality dream scenarios this movie hardly exploits it i was intrigued when second user was introduced screen hoping story develop complexity only go back romance storyline after second maybe missed opportunity fact budget is probably most impressive aspect this movie it shows that one doesnt need multi million budget get good quality images screen but like most indian movies it seems that director cant get away bollywood love stereotypes stories as if stuck time dont get me wrong film was reasonably pleasant watch with typical indian humour all way through but if director wants explore some new genre he is going need make bigger effort his writing satisfy effervescence human mind what production did get right was managing score 8 5 but we all know india can make miracles when it comes internet,0.49497064238443544,0.13308889386475595,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
7.0,A good movie for people who are interested in lucid dreaming and etc. stuff,"It is sometimes nice to watch other than Holywood movies as they have a different way of telling the experience. Here, the dream and reality were told through a romantic relationship. Some musical scenes were hard to stand but cinematography was well done thoughout the movie, so the movie shows its artistic side in both content and way of telling. You can watch it as an artistic and romantic expression of the experience with Lucia, which blurs the lines between the reality and the dream. It comes hard to separate them at some point for the audience too, but that does not scare away much as it is very artistic and warm. At least, that was the case for me. I also like the message the movie gave: Like your destiny, it could be the best for you. Therefore, it makes you question the logic behind wishing to live another life. Shall we live in a dream or make our dreams come true? This is the take-home message I got from the movie. All in all, it is a nice movie especially if you are bored with Holywood and want to see something different. I like the artistic side of the movie and the message given. It is very hard to make a movie in that the lines between reality and dream is blurred. The movie is successful in that sense.

8.0,"A major breakthrough in Indian independent film-making, well supported by some inventive content and execution.","Regional cinema in India witnesses a major, eye opener breakthrough with LUCIA, which though has its own set of drawbacks, but is still a very brave, inventive and path breaking attempt by the writer director Pawan Kumar, without any second thoughts. As far as the commercials of film business are concerned, LUCIA literally makes fun of those 10-20 crores projects by displaying an outstanding result on the screen, shot with its limited technical resources within the budget of mere 50-70 lakhs and that too crowd-funded by about 100 investors from the director's own social network.The end result, doesn't let you even imagine of such a modest budget, featuring a fine cinematography, intelligent editing and great background score, perfectly matching the basic requirements of the film's unusual theme. Narrated in a non-linear pattern, it revolves around the distinctive lives of two contrasting characters, operating under the influence of a dream pill called LUCIA. And the secret behind their real identities is later revealed in the climax following a complex build up (using different colour tones). So far so good, but unfortunately LUCIA does have some drawbacks which actually restrict it from becoming a true masterpiece as desired.Beginning on an appreciable off-beat note saying, ""Are you a creature of Illusion? Or Illusion is your creation"", it starts incorporating too many routine sub-plots hampering its main focus. The suspense factor about the pill gets killed pretty fast and the catchy yet unwanted dance-song insertions further confuse its basic premise of an ""out of the routine project"" unexpectedly. The over length of the film also adds to its shortcomings and the performances range between great, good and average. Sathish as Nikki plays his part convincingly and so does Achuth as Shankrana supporting him superbly. But Shruthi as the leading lady is just OK and the same can be said by the supporting cast including the strange detective.Having said that, the one winning stroke in its execution remains that despite all these overstuffed tracks the film never drags and keeps moving at a constant pace with compelling references of lucid dreams and hallucination till the revealing climax. Hence keeping in mind the limited setup, in which the film was surprisingly made, LUCIA does give rise to a new debate in the Indian Film Industry and surely deserves to be noticed, seen and studied for its strong worth praising merits already mentioned before.",major breakthrough indian independent film making well supported by some inventive content execution,regional cinema india witnesses major eye opener breakthrough with lucia which though has its own set drawbacks but is still very brave inventive path breaking attempt by writer director pawan kumar without any second thoughts as far as commercials film business are concerned lucia literally makes fun those 10 20 crores projects by displaying outstanding result screen shot with its limited technical resources within budget mere 50 70 lakhs that too crowd funded by about 100 investors directors own social network end result doesnt let you even imagine such modest budget featuring fine cinematography intelligent editing great background score perfectly matching basic requirements films unusual theme narrated non linear pattern it revolves around distinctive lives two contrasting characters operating under influence dream pill called lucia secret behind their real identities is later revealed climax following complex build up using different colour tones so far so good but unfortunately lucia does have some drawbacks which actually restrict it becoming true masterpiece as desired beginning appreciable off beat note saying are you creature illusion or illusion is your creation it starts incorporating too many routine sub plots hampering its main focus suspense factor about pill gets killed pretty fast catchy yet unwanted dance song insertions further confuse its basic premise out routine project unexpectedly over length film also adds its shortcomings performances range between great good average sathish as nikki plays his part convincingly so does achuth as shankrana supporting him superbly but shruthi as leading lady is just ok same can be said by supporting cast including strange detective having said that one winning stroke its execution remains that despite all these overstuffed tracks film never drags keeps moving at constant pace with compelling references lucid dreams hallucination till revealing climax hence keeping mind limited setup which film was surprisingly made lucia does give rise new debate indian film industry surely deserves be noticed seen studied its strong worth praising merits already mentioned before,0.551106488997114,0.23153916396103894,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5.0,"Good story, not well directed",This movie starts strongly. But like most Indian Movies drags it a bit long. It had all the ingredients to make it good.But watching the movie makes you feel it could have been done so much better than it was. Like there are sequence of unnecessary songs. Like most Indian movies they are not required. Great story line but not so great direction doesn't quit make it a movie to watch out for. Still something new for an Indian movie. Also the climax of the movie makes you think a lot about it. All in all a great try but not quite there yet if you are expecting a Chritopher Nolan type movie.,good story not well directed,this movie starts strongly but like most indian movies drags it bit long it had all ingredients make it good but watching movie makes you feel it could have been done so much better than it was like there are sequence unnecessary songs like most indian movies they are not required great story line but not so great direction doesnt quit make it movie watch out still something new indian movie also climax movie makes you think lot about it all all great try but not quite there yet if you are expecting chritopher nolan type movie,0.6198232323232323,0.4516414141414142,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.24}"

8.0,Psychological thriller that blurs the line between dreams and reality,"Move over Christopher Nolan, India has its own top-notch dream based psychological thrillers. While Nolan's 'Inception' was widely acclaimed, there has hardly been anyone who understood the film in entirety; reason being, the story was inherently flawed. The latest Kannada film by Pawan Kumar, 'Lucia' plays around the concept of dreams and the blurring between reality and dream states; without the pizazz of special effects, but with better storytelling and editing. The film begins with a patient, Nikki (Satish Neenasam) in a coma and a debate around euthanasia. Cut to flash back, Nikki is an average Joe, unnoticeable in the Bangalore crowd. He works at his uncle's decrypt movie hall as an usher and suffers from insomnia. The love of his life is Shweta (Sruthi Hariharan) who works at a local Pizza outlet who seems to want more from life than poor Nikki. He is soon introduced to a wayside drug 'Lucia' that promises to cure his sleeplessness, but with other side effects that let him dream about the life he seeks. And lo, he turns into a movie star Nikki who also seems to have issues with a newbie actress Shweta; the track played out in monochrome. How Nikki deals with his life in both worlds forms the rest of the story, a suspense best left undisclosed. The concept of lucid dreaming, in a way, reminded me of 'Vanilla Sky' where Tom Cruise's character who loses touch with reality and is lost under the dreamy skies like in the famous Monet painting. But the similarities end there. Another semblance is with Nolan's 'Memento' with two tracks, one in color and the other in Monochrome that merge into a logical ending. The editing in ""Lucia"" is as good as in 'Memento' and keeps the audience hooked; truly world-class editing there!'Lucia' is a landmark film in the Kannada filmdom as it is the first crowd-funded independent film in Kannada. The opening credits show more than a hundred people who responded to Pawan Kumar's facebook post. The film was made with only INR 50 Lakh, a pittance as compared to the usual big budget blockbusters with top stars, foreign locales and cars blowing up in action stunts. To its credit, Lucia doesn't have any stars but each of them did well. For Satish Neenasam, it was his first as a lead actor and convincingly plays the regular local dude who may be seen in a down-market movie hall having big dreams. Sruthi Hariharan who is said to have had origins in dance and then moved on to films, does a decent job, both as the simple neighborhood waitress and as a budding actress. Apart from the drugs and dreams, the underlying story in 'Lucia' deals with the needs and wants of its various characters who have two roles, one in the real world and then another one in the dream world with its own set of metaphors. What plays out includes the inherent conflicts in romance, class, language and other issues as well as an investigative undertone that begins with the first scene. Songs from the film come with entertaining everyday lyrics composed by Poornachandra Tejaswi, a software engineer turned music director; and this is his first attempt. While some like 'Helu Shiva' come with a very modern touch, 'Thinbedakami' is funny and has a rustic feel. So, does 'Lucia' lack anything? There is nothing that is grossly amiss as such. The only element of finesse which is left wanting is the dubbing, which seems mismatched in a couple of scenes. 'Lucia' premiered at the London Indian Film Festival this July and won the Best Film Audience Choice award. Already, the film is drawing enough attention in screens nation-wide as it has been released with English subtitles. So, even if you don't know Kannada, the subtitles are there to assist you. Verdict: Those of you who may have given up on Kannada films, or others who think that all South Indian movies are about fat, dark actors dancing with fair skinned babes, prepare to get overwhelmed. 'Lucia' will keep you occupied with its story, every single second of its screen-time.",psychological thriller that blurs line between dreams reality,move over christopher nolan india has its own top notch dream based psychological thrillers while nolans inception was widely acclaimed there has hardly been anyone who understood film entirety reason being story was inherently flawed latest kannada film by pawan kumar lucia plays around concept dreams blurring between reality dream states without pizazz special effects but with better storytelling editing film begins with patient nikki satish neenasam coma debate around euthanasia cut flash back nikki is average joe unnoticeable bangalore crowd he works at his uncles decrypt movie hall as usher suffers insomnia love his life is shweta sruthi hariharan who works at local pizza outlet who seems want more life than poor nikki he is soon introduced wayside drug lucia that promises cure his sleeplessness but with other side effects that let him dream about life he seeks lo he turns into movie star nikki who also seems have issues with newbie actress shweta track played out monochrome how nikki deals with his life both worlds forms rest story suspense best left undisclosed concept lucid dreaming way reminded me vanilla sky where tom cruises character who loses touch with reality is lost under dreamy skies like famous monet painting but similarities end there another semblance is with nolans memento with two tracks one color other monochrome that merge into logical ending editing lucia is as good as memento keeps audience hooked truly world class editing there lucia is landmark film kannada filmdom as it is first crowd funded independent film kannada opening credits show more than hundred people who responded pawan kumars facebook post film was made with only inr 50 lakh pittance as compared usual big budget blockbusters with top stars foreign locales cars blowing up action stunts its credit lucia doesnt have any stars but each them did well satish neenasam it was his first as lead actor convincingly plays regular local dude who may be seen down market movie hall having big dreams sruthi hariharan who is said have had origins dance then moved films does decent job both as simple neighborhood waitress as budding actress apart drugs dreams underlying story lucia deals with needs wants its various characters who have two roles one real world then another one dream world with its own set metaphors what plays out includes inherent conflicts romance class language other issues as well as investigative undertone that begins with first scene songs film come with entertaining everyday lyrics composed by poornachandra tejaswi software engineer turned music director this is his first attempt while some like helu shiva come with very modern touch thinbedakami is funny has rustic feel so does lucia lack anything there is nothing that is grossly amiss as such only element finesse which is left wanting is dubbing which seems mismatched couple scenes lucia premiered at london indian film festival this july won best film audience choice award already film is drawing enough attention screens nation wide as it has been released with english subtitles so even if you dont know kannada subtitles are there assist you verdict those you who may have given up kannada films or others who think that all south indian movies are about fat dark actors dancing with fair skinned babes prepare get overwhelmed lucia will keep you occupied with its story every single second its screen time,0.40022889216919066,0.12858445865908552,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"

8.0,India's answer to Nolan's INCEPTION,"Psychological thrillers that bend your mind with a thin blurred dividing line between dream and reality have always been fascinating stories to shake & shock cinema-lovers across globe. Christopher Nolan's much acclaimed INCEPTION was the last most-talked venture in the said genre and the latest has just arrived. Not from the other side of the world but from our very own Kannada film industry.Pawan Kumar's LUCIA is a small film (made merely in a shoestring budget of 70 lac, funded by hundreds of cinema-enthusiasts on social networking sites) that never restricts or limits itself from being big in aspiration, execution or projection.An usher/ torch-shiner in a dying talkies (not multiplex or theater mind you!) in the town finds it difficult to have a good sleep in nights, thanks to his 'a little too much to be comfortable with' room mates of every kind, and soon develops symptoms of insomnia. Next in the line comes an illegal drug-distributor who, as an ultimate solution, provides him a set of sleeping pills named 'Lucia' that could miraculously not only helps him in getting good sleep but also allows him to live his personalized dreams like a one big movie of his own. Eventually, you see our protagonist leading two separate lives respectively one in reality and the other in alternate reality aka dream (clearly shown divided with sequences in color and in b/w).So, whatever in one life he can't do is now doing in the other to entertain his soul. The girl of his dreams, the career he always has looked up to and everything elsebut who really can tell if what you see is reality or a dream or it is just both within you? Best unanswered for you to explore at your own!LUCIA is a brilliant example of what a far-reaching vision can create- achieve & celebrate despite having cumbersome obstacles largely called here as age-old 'business norms'. Leave Kannada alone, I am still looking for examples to equal this effort in all of Bollywood. Cinematography by Siddharth Nuni is exceptionally good and of qualities that could take it to bigger platforms proudly and profoundly. Siddharth plays with lights and well-designed shots that are bound to leave you awestruckand to complement it evenly, there is crispier than ever scissoring hands of (sadly, did not find the name of film-Editor anywhere).Watch out for the opening-montage where the addictive Lucia capsules are shown being experimented, manufactured and later consumed but in an innovative reverse order. Though performances are not so overwhelming, you also don't complain as it is very very satisfactory.Ironically, the biggest strength and the biggest limitation in this case are the same. The screenplay does provide to promises of huge expectations but the story quite doesn't fulfill your appetite as it decides to remain mass-entertainer for most parts, keeping the entertainment need of commercial Kannada audiences, I guess. And to some extent, I personally consider it the need of hour to reach and to bring more people to this kind of cinema than just being a complicated experience for few hardcore art-cinema fans; they sure will find it a little distracted 2 hour 15 min long effort which could easily get trimmed by 20 odd min, at present, deeply dedicated to masses only.Having said that, I must recommend it to all of you who are not constrained and classified in terms of language when it comes to good quality cinema! It has shines and glares of 'Cinema Paradiso', 'Memento' and 'Inception' but stands out at its own because of technical excellence and a sheer example of gripping story-telling.",indias answer nolans inception,psychological thrillers that bend your mind with thin blurred dividing line between dream reality have always been fascinating stories shake shock cinema lovers across globe christopher nolans much acclaimed inception was last most talked venture said genre latest has just arrived not other side world but our very own kannada film industry pawan kumars lucia is small film made merely shoestring budget 70 lac funded by hundreds cinema enthusiasts social networking sites that never restricts or limits itself being big aspiration execution or projection usher torch shiner dying talkies not multiplex or theater mind you town finds it difficult have good sleep nights thanks his little too much be comfortable with room mates every kind soon develops symptoms insomnia next line comes illegal drug distributor who as ultimate solution provides him set sleeping pills named lucia that could miraculously not only helps him getting good sleep but also allows him live his personalized dreams like one big movie his own eventually you see our protagonist leading two separate lives respectively one reality other alternate reality aka dream clearly shown divided with sequences color b w so whatever one life he cant do is now doing other entertain his soul girl his dreams career he always has looked up everything else but who really can tell if what you see is reality or dream or it is just both within you best unanswered you explore at your own lucia is brilliant example what far reaching vision can create achieve celebrate despite having cumbersome obstacles largely called here as age old business norms leave kannada alone i am still looking examples equal this effort all bollywood cinematography by siddharth nuni is exceptionally good qualities that could take it bigger platforms proudly profoundly siddharth plays with lights well designed shots that are bound leave you awestruck complement it evenly there is crispier than ever scissoring hands sadly did not find name film editor anywhere watch out opening montage where addictive lucia capsules are shown being experimented manufactured later consumed but innovative reverse order though performances are not so overwhelming you also dont complain as it is very very satisfactory ironically biggest strength biggest limitation this case are same screenplay does provide promises huge expectations but story quite doesnt fulfill your appetite as it decides remain mass entertainer most parts keeping entertainment need commercial kannada audiences i guess some extent i personally consider it need hour reach bring more people this kind cinema than just being complicated experience few hardcore art cinema fans they sure will find it little distracted 2 hour 15 min long effort which could easily get trimmed by 20 odd min at present deeply dedicated masses only having said that i must recommend it all you who are not constrained classified terms language when it comes good quality cinema it has shines glares cinema paradiso memento inception but stands out at its own because technical excellence sheer example gripping story telling,0.5322939769515111,0.16111620115044772,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
