9.0,Mr India- Salim- Javed's last classic,"This movie was a firm childhood favourite of mine and it still hasn't lost its magic. This was the movie that sent Anil Kapoor into stardom and the pairing of Anil Kapoor and Sridevi was used in other movies. The scripting was absolutely perfect, the songs were brilliant (my favourite was Hawaa Hawaii) and add to a mammoth budget and you have a bollywood classic.This is essentially a kids film, which is a market rarely catered to in Bollywood. Amrish Puri gave the performance of a lifetime( who can forget his Mogambo Khush Hus dialogue). There are many other memorable characters, like for instance Sridevi's boss or Mogambo's henchman Goga and Daga. This movie ranks amongst other Salim Javed's best work, for instance Sholay and Shaan.

9.0,Superb classic,"This Classic from the eighties is one of the few sci fi films to be produced in India incidentally it is also one of the best. Directed by shekhar kapur of ""Elizabeth"" fame Mr India is one of his earlier works. The cinematography may not be great but the rest sure is! An interesting and intelligent story that makes for full on family entertainment. This movie will make you smile laugh and cry and bring out all the other various emotions in you. Sridevi players the bubbly cheerful news reporter and Anil kapoor the Super Hero who upon discovering the invisibility formula sets out to avenge the worlds evils. Aka Mogambo played by the greatest villain ever to grace the Indian screen Amrish puri. His mogambo still strikes terror into the hearts of kids. Anil Kapoor & Sridevi's relationship is more of a homage to the Louis lane Clark Kent type relationship seen in several superhero movies. The rain and wind dance number by sridevi. could easily give the new crop of actresses a run for their money. brilliantly acted and executed her dance with the invisible man is simply unforgettable and who can forget her cheeky ""hava hawi"" number. you can watch this film time and time again and not get bored. The special effects may be basic but the story and acting are just brilliant. directors and actors of today take a note.

10.0,Excellent,"""Mugambo Kush Hua (Mugambo is pleased,"" is the famous line that was repeated several times by the late Amrish Puri in this 1980's classic movie. The movie stars Anil Kapoor as ""Mr India,"" who can turn invisible when he needs to fight against the villain, Mugambo, but has to be very careful of ""red light"" at all times, Sri Devi as journalist who believes that Mr India exists and tries to find him, Satish Kaushik, as Anil Kapoor's friend ""Calendar,"" who helps him to look after a bunch of orphaned children, one of which is none other than Aftab Shivdasani, now a Bollywood heartthrob. The movie itself is a science fiction, which was first for its type from Bollywood and what has made it even more memorable was the special effects used by the director, Boney Kapoor. The songs and the music are also very memorable and especially: ""Hum Karte Hai Pyar Mr. India Se (I Love Mr India), ""Hawa Hawaii,"" and not to mention the seductive song by the late Kishore Kumar, ""I Love You,"" which enabled him to receive a film fare award for the best song.Conclusion: Excellent movie which can be enjoyed with your family. Watchout for the re - make of this movie.",excellent,mugambo kush hua mugambo is pleased is famous line that was repeated several times by late amrish puri this 1980s classic movie movie stars anil kapoor as mr india who can turn invisible when he needs fight against villain mugambo but has be very careful red light at all times sri devi as journalist who believes that mr india exists tries find him satish kaushik as anil kapoors friend calendar who helps him look after bunch orphaned children one which is none other than aftab shivdasani now bollywood heartthrob movie itself is science fiction which was first its type bollywood what has made it even more memorable was special effects used by director boney kapoor songs music are also very memorable especially hum karte hai pyar mr india se i love mr india hawa hawaii not mention seductive song by late kishore kumar i love you which enabled him receive film fare award best song conclusion excellent movie which can be enjoyed with your family watchout re make this movie,0.6281055900621118,0.3203830227743271,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.07}"
,the movie has soul,"As a wise young fellow mentioned, what makes this movie so watchable today is that it has soul. Watching it after 15 years, it brings back a lot of childhood memories. The movie is just full of entertainment and does not look outdated at all. Shekar Kapur's direction is fantastic. Because of his direction, the movie moves on a constant pace and the scenes aren't overdone in a silly way. Sridevi's performance is, as always, top-notch. Anil Kapoor is very likable. The kids are good too (but annoying in the songs and dances). The songs are funny and catchy giving us Sridevi's memorable Hawa Hawai and the sensual sari dance in Kaate nahi. Of course, who could forget one of Amrish Puri's most memorable roles as Mogambo? In my humble opinion this is definitely one of the most entertaining movies that I could watch over and over again with friends or family. If you want to be entertained and have a good time, watch Mr. India.",movie has soul,as wise young fellow mentioned what makes this movie so watchable today is that it has soul watching it after 15 years it brings back lot childhood memories movie is just full entertainment does not look outdated at all shekar kapurs direction is fantastic because his direction movie moves constant pace scenes arent overdone silly way sridevis performance is as always top notch anil kapoor is very likable kids are good too but annoying songs dances songs are funny catchy giving us sridevis memorable hawa hawai sensual sari dance kaate nahi course who could forget one amrish puris most memorable roles as mogambo my humble opinion this is definitely one most entertaining movies that i could watch over over again with friends or family if you want be entertained have good time watch mr india,0.640079365079365,0.2357142857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.19}"
,The best villain the world has ever seen!,"""Mogambo Khush Hua"" is the signature line of the villain Mogambo played by Amrish Puri in the classic ""Mr. India"". I must say, Mogambo is a kind of villain which will remain immortal in every hearts. Amrish Puri displays the act of villainy with perfection. He shows the required amount of menace and that helps to make his character a classic. Apparently, this movie is not about Mogambo. It's about ""Mr. India"" played by Anil Kapoor who has inherited a magical watch from his father with which he can become invisible. But here, the hero is overshadowed by the villain. Anil Kapoor does his job pretty well and I guess no actor would've been able to pull off that role with aplomb like him. Sridevi is truly the devi of India. Her ""Hawa Hawaii"" dance number is also the highlight of ""Mr. India"" and she was also likable as a reporter. Like most of her movies, Sridevi gets her comic timings and the scene where she disguises as Charlie Chaplin is hilarious! ""Mr. India"" is one of the best movies of Bollywood as it created an immortal villain by the name of Mogambo. Every kid in India is scared of the name ""Mogambo"" and every mothers use this name to lure their children to sleep in India. What an impression! The only thing I didn't like about this movie is the scene where the little girl dies in a bomb explosion. This scene was unnecessary and made the film quite heavy. Barring this scene, almost all the scenes are memorable and are worth repeat-viewing. I rate it 9/10.",best villain world has ever seen,mogambo khush hua is signature line villain mogambo played by amrish puri classic mr india i must say mogambo is kind villain which will remain immortal every hearts amrish puri displays act villainy with perfection he shows required amount menace that helps make his character classic apparently this movie is not about mogambo its about mr india played by anil kapoor who has inherited magical watch his father with which he can become invisible but here hero is overshadowed by villain anil kapoor does his job pretty well i guess no actor wouldve been able pull off that role with aplomb like him sridevi is truly devi india her hawa hawaii dance number is also highlight mr india she was also likable as reporter like most her movies sridevi gets her comic timings scene where she disguises as charlie chaplin is hilarious mr india is one best movies bollywood as it created immortal villain by name mogambo every kid india is scared name mogambo every mothers use this name lure their children sleep india what impression only thing i didnt like about this movie is scene where little girl dies bomb explosion this scene was unnecessary made film quite heavy barring this scene almost all scenes are memorable are worth repeat viewing i rate it 9 10,0.5951754385964912,0.31557017543859645,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"

The film also was one of the first films of Anil-Sridevi The film starts off well, the scenes amongst the kids, the problems Arun faces, the entire Mogambo part which seems an extension of SJ's own SHAAN(1980).There are several great scenes like Sridevi spoofing Charlie Chaplin, the fight scene when Sridevi is kidnapped, The Annu Kapoor scene and the climax though a bit lengthy and similar to SHAAN(1980) yet it's goodDirection by Shekhar Kapur is great Music by LP is amazing, Zindagi Ki Yehi Reet is my fav song sung by Kishore Kumar, I Love You, Karte Hai Hum Pyaar and other gems are really wonderfulAnil Kapoor in a role supposed to be done by Big B is simply lovable and suits it to the T, he also wears just 1 costume throughout Sridevi is amazing in her role, her pairing with Anil is simply magical Amongst child artists, Aftab, Karan Nath, Ahmed Khan and all are amazing Amrish Puri is simply terrific in a role only he could play, what with those expressions and the booming baritone, he is fab,Annu Kapoor is simply class in the role of a troubled editor Sharat Saxena, Bob Christo, Ajit Vachnani,Harish Patel and rest are good too",awesome film,some films never get aged mr india is one them film is set simple premise but way its handled its superb last film salim javed together they had split after shakti but returned write this film film also was one first films anil sridevi film starts off well scenes amongst kids problems arun faces entire mogambo part which seems extension sjs own shaan 1980 there are several great scenes like sridevi spoofing charlie chaplin fight scene when sridevi is kidnapped annu kapoor scene climax though bit lengthy similar shaan 1980 yet its gooddirection by shekhar kapur is great music by lp is amazing zindagi ki yehi reet is my fav song sung by kishore kumar i love you karte hai hum pyaar other gems are really wonderfulanil kapoor role supposed be done by big b is simply lovable suits it t he also wears just 1 costume throughout sridevi is amazing her role her pairing with anil is simply magical amongst child artists aftab karan nath ahmed khan all are amazing amrish puri is simply terrific role only he could play what with those expressions booming baritone he is fab annu kapoor is simply class role troubled editor sharat saxena bob christo ajit vachnani harish patel rest are good too,0.6197802197802199,0.3048076923076923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.23}"
,The Indian family version of 'The Invisible Man',"From the film industry which releases the largest number of movies in the world (more than Hollywood can even dream!), Mr. India was the perfect mix of dreams and reality. On the one hand is Arun, the caretaker of orphans, trying to have a living for everyone out of his non-existent income, and on the other is Mocambo (or Mogambo), the villain who wants to destroy India and take over control.Things change for Arun when he discovers a secret to become invisible. The magic band does wonders for his love life and comes in handy to do good for the humanity.. fighting the bad guys and ultimately saving the world!Mr. India can be described as the 'Indian twist' to 'The Invisible Man', where the hero can never do anything bad. Shekhar Kapoor (The Director) has done a good job in mixing adventure, comedy, drama and romance, while retaining the original flavor of the 'good old' Indian film musical.

8.0,"Pure, quality entertainment for the entire family; a classic indeed","Mr. India is a very good film by Shekhar Kapur, which is highly enjoyable and actually very interesting as a story. Yes, it is quite groundbreaking and iconic in being one of the first sc-fi films from India, but the film has an added value of kindness, comedy and sometimes wholesome, mindless fun which actually works. Kapur's direction is very good; he directs this feature with heart and even though there were some minor technical glitches, the overall product is quite good. The story of an invisible man who uses his power for a good cause works really well, and the kids are a big part of the film's charm. Anil Kapoor is an excellent lead and plays the part with gusto. It is Sridevi of course who gives the film most of its comic weight, and she's wonderful. Her imitations are fun, and even more so is her virtuoso performance in the ""Hawa Hawaii"" song which has her at her best - humorous, self-deprecatory, presenting a million of different, hilarious expressions. The same is true of the number ""Kaate Nahi"" where we see again how uninhibited and spontaneous this actress was in front of the camera. The third part of this great cast is the brilliant Amrish Puri, who steals the show with his hilarious villainous turn as Mogambo, one of his most famous memorable roles. Mr. India is a classic film worth revisiting, it holds nostalgic value and I'm sure will appeal to different audiences and not just from India.",pure quality entertainment entire family classic indeed,mr india is very good film by shekhar kapur which is highly enjoyable actually very interesting as story yes it is quite groundbreaking iconic being one first sc fi films india but film has added value kindness comedy sometimes wholesome mindless fun which actually works kapurs direction is very good he directs this feature with heart even though there were some minor technical glitches overall product is quite good story invisible man who uses his power good cause works really well kids are big part films charm anil kapoor is excellent lead plays part with gusto it is sridevi course who gives film most its comic weight shes wonderful her imitations are fun even more so is her virtuoso performance hawa hawaii song which has her at her best humorous self deprecatory presenting million different hilarious expressions same is true number kaate nahi where we see again how uninhibited spontaneous this actress was front camera third part this great cast is brilliant amrish puri who steals show with his hilarious villainous turn as mogambo one his most famous memorable roles mr india is classic film worth revisiting it holds nostalgic value im sure will appeal different audiences not just india,0.5503535353535354,0.37312770562770564,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
