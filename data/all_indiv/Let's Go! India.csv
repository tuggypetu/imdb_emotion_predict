8.0,Bollywood's First of its kind.......Perfection Personified,"Aha..Finally Bollywood has a full fledged sports movie.This one is certainly worth a watch for every movie lover.This is a very well made movie with nothing unnecessary being added.Being an SRK fan I love to see him in all sorts of roles but these are the ones which bring the real actor out of him, Swades being another example.Role of a coach is perfectly portrayed by SRK.He is the most energetic actor around and he has put it all into it.The story of this movie moves very subtly and augments the excitement every next second.For a country like India with its national game as hockey this movie was long due.Finally, when it has arrived,it hasn't disappointed.It has also indirectly displayed the crippled Indian sports system which needs much improvement.Lets hope concerned people learn something from it.This movie can really do wonders for the next generation of aspiring hockey players.CDI is entertaining,insightful,inspiring and yet very simple which is its greatness.This movie succeeds in bringing out tears and giggles and also lets the adrenaline flow in full pace.The cinematography and editing are equally good.They succeeded in capturing each moment with its complete emotion.The director has treated the subject extremely well and has brought 100% from all the new actors.The character selection was spot on too.

8.0,"A full cup, a nice surprise from SRK & YRF","Having originally planned to both not see Chak De and also to hate it, I went to see the first show and I now love it very much!!Two nights ago I saw Kal Ho Naa Ho for the 100th time. I found it beautiful, as always, but also realized it never makes me want to cry. Chak De!, on the other hand, is relatively ""plain"" to look at, and understated (at least for Bollywood), and I felt that wonderful emotional brimming-up-but-not-quite-over time and again throughout the story.The whole thing about this team of girls from all over India who have to be made into a team really works - you get to know enough about several girls to have a secure sense of the essence of each -- the one with the bad temper, the one whose husband wants her to come home and cook, the senior player who resents the new coach's control, the ones who are out for themselves -- and the problem each presents in relation to SRK's task of making a team out of a collection of individuals Of course this is any coach's job, but I like the moral resonance with the sad back-story of Shah Rukh Khan's character. Kabir Khan, like the real Indian player on whom the story is based, is an Indian Muslim. He was unjustly accused of throwing a match to Pakistan, and lost his career. A team where all have the identity ""India"" is an actual team; implicitly I think a country with the identity ""India"" doesn't engage in persecutory projection and hatred toward a member perceived as ""other.""A note about the photography, I like the use of a dusty tone for the first half of the movie, and then a much brighter color skin for the second half, when we leave India and practice fields and go to Australia. The girls' exposure to the bigness and luxury of the west was handled so nicely - we're given their pleasure in all that's new to their eyes--giant swimming pools, exercise machinery, lavish hotel buffets -- but in passing: the Bollywood Visual Excess machine is not in operation, and the shed has several locks on the door. At some official function, we get to see them all in saris and a bit of makeup, but here too it's all under control, they're all dressed alike and half of them hate it.Shah Rukh is great. There is no sentimentality in the movie and his character is restrained. The music -- no ""songs"" -- is varied and good -- if I could do without the rap music (for life!!), I loved the Sufi refrain that turns up over and over, that seems to express SRK's character's anguish in separation, longing for reunion (with God).I've always felt that sadness was quite nearby for Shah Rukh -- here he neither conceals nor dramatizes it, he just lets us feel it. On a more mundane note, though I love Shah Rukh in all his Karan-Johar-selected beautiful clothes, I found it relaxing to see him in a small number of normal coach's costumes, shirts, khakis, and blazers that appropriately looked bought off the racks in Macy's.The movie really never hits a wrong note. It's also just wonderful in its feminist position. Generally speaking I feel just boredom and agitation at movie violence; in this one, when the girls beat up boys who'd been harassing them, I felt joy.",full cup nice surprise srk yrf,having originally planned both not see chak de also hate it i went see first show i now love it very much two nights ago i saw kal ho naa ho 100th time i found it beautiful as always but also realized it never makes me want cry chak de other hand is relatively plain look at understated at least bollywood i felt that wonderful emotional brimming up but not quite over time again throughout story whole thing about this team girls all over india who have be made into team really works you get know enough about several girls have secure sense essence each one with bad temper one whose husband wants her come home cook senior player who resents new coachs control ones who are out themselves problem each presents relation srks task making team out collection individuals course this is any coachs job but i like moral resonance with sad back story shah rukh khans character kabir khan like real indian player whom story is based is indian muslim he was unjustly accused throwing match pakistan lost his career team where all have identity india is actual team implicitly i think country with identity india doesnt engage persecutory projection hatred toward member perceived as other note about photography i like use dusty tone first half movie then much brighter color skin second half when we leave india practice fields go australia girls exposure bigness luxury west was handled so nicely were given their pleasure all thats new their eyes giant swimming pools exercise machinery lavish hotel buffets but passing bollywood visual excess machine is not operation shed has several locks door at some official function we get see them all saris bit makeup but here too its all under control theyre all dressed alike half them hate it shah rukh is great there is no sentimentality movie his character is restrained music no songs is varied good if i could do without rap music life i loved sufi refrain that turns up over over that seems express srks characters anguish separation longing reunion with god ive always felt that sadness was quite nearby shah rukh here he neither conceals nor dramatizes it he just lets us feel it more mundane note though i love shah rukh all his karan johar selected beautiful clothes i found it relaxing see him small number normal coachs costumes shirts khakis blazers that appropriately looked bought off racks macys movie really never hits wrong note its also just wonderful its feminist position generally speaking i feel just boredom agitation at movie violence this one when girls beat up boys whod been harassing them i felt joy,0.4886587957497047,0.14139590712317987,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,"Lots of goosebumps, adrenaline rush and hot Segarika Ghatge","What's in a name? Although initially this movie drew some amount of controversy outside India among viewers of non-Indian origin, the final movie just falsifies all those who advocated that the title ""Chak De! India"" was non-representative and was supposed to mean to only a niche of moviegoers. This movie would've been just what it is no matter what is was called or which country made it. Director Shimit Amin's entry in YRF simply transforms the entire perspective of movie-making and movie watching, both for the production house and the viewers.Generally, you enter the theatre for a Yashraj movie expecting foreign locales, lots of song and dance, impossible and unbelievable characters, poor storyline, bad performances and a helluva investment but this movie delivers what no other Yashraj film ever did. Initially a sports movie, Chak De is rather a story of hope, courage, unity, integrity and the dreams. This film finally proves that you don't need Preity or Rani opposite SRK, and he all by himself, with a great screenwriter, great director and a good cast of the hockey team can make a great movie. There are lots of heroes in the movie - the women's team and these ladies simply steal the show. Mainly Bindiya, Balbir, Priya (the hot chic) and Komal.See it gets very hard when there is an incredible amount of character development to do. There is a ghost that follows Kabir throughout the film and writer Jaideep Sahani makes a very good use of it. I do admit the fact that he's watched an incredible amount of Hollywood sports flick to develop this script, but he adds his very homely formulas and successfully manages to retain this film as an original Indian movie. Some parts of the film are directly lifted like the part of Kabir's ghost and few of the women, but all in all I refuse to say this is a Hollywood copy.All in all, this is the best summer Hindi movie I've watched so far, not because it's got SRK but I love the script, the witty one-liners where sometimes with double meanings, every girl with her story (but I feel at most points the characters don't fully grow), well coordinated game sequences (though the practise scenes may bore you because there are a LOT), and above all the message the film delivers - when united, there's nothing you can't win over. The message is pretty well conveyed. You feel the adrenaline rush through the World Cup matches, a lot of goosebumps thanks to the great scoring by the Salim Sulaiman duo, well crafted script and good direction. Shimit's work is original contrary to the reservations I carried for him being a product of Ram Gopal Verma's school of direction.SRK, as usual is great with his acting (and beard,) Vidya Malvade is the overly publicised captain but unfortunately other girls outdo her, the Jharkhand girls provide a dimension against contrasting Bindya and her queen bees. Segarika Ghatge's character Priya Saberwal is most memorable for her looks, style and for being hot and everything. The North East girls do answer some of vital questions of the North East Indians about their existence in their country as foreigners. The class conflict, egoistic chicks and their attitude problem and stuffs are absolutely well portrayed in the film.All in all a well worth. Requires basic knowledge and enthusiasm in hockey. But avoid if you're looking for SRK as the lover-boy - he's the tough coach.",lots goosebumps adrenaline rush hot segarika ghatge,whats name although initially this movie drew some amount controversy outside india among viewers non indian origin final movie just falsifies all those who advocated that title chak de india was non representative was supposed mean only niche moviegoers this movie wouldve been just what it is no matter what is was called or which country made it director shimit amins entry yrf simply transforms entire perspective movie making movie watching both production house viewers generally you enter theatre yashraj movie expecting foreign locales lots song dance impossible unbelievable characters poor storyline bad performances helluva investment but this movie delivers what no other yashraj film ever did initially sports movie chak de is rather story hope courage unity integrity dreams this film finally proves that you dont need preity or rani opposite srk he all by himself with great screenwriter great director good cast hockey team can make great movie there are lots heroes movie womens team these ladies simply steal show mainly bindiya balbir priya hot chic komal see it gets very hard when there is incredible amount character development do there is ghost that follows kabir throughout film writer jaideep sahani makes very good use it i do admit fact that hes watched incredible amount hollywood sports flick develop this script but he adds his very homely formulas successfully manages retain this film as original indian movie some parts film are directly lifted like part kabirs ghost few women but all all i refuse say this is hollywood copy all all this is best summer hindi movie ive watched so far not because its got srk but i love script witty one liners where sometimes with double meanings every girl with her story but i feel at most points characters dont fully grow well coordinated game sequences though practise scenes may bore you because there are lot above all message film delivers when united theres nothing you cant win over message is pretty well conveyed you feel adrenaline rush through world cup matches lot goosebumps thanks great scoring by salim sulaiman duo well crafted script good direction shimits work is original contrary reservations i carried him being product ram gopal vermas school direction srk as usual is great with his acting beard vidya malvade is overly publicised captain but unfortunately other girls outdo her jharkhand girls provide dimension against contrasting bindya her queen bees segarika ghatges character priya saberwal is most memorable her looks style being hot everything north east girls do answer some vital questions north east indians about their existence their country as foreigners class conflict egoistic chicks their attitude problem stuffs are absolutely well portrayed film all all well worth requires basic knowledge enthusiasm hockey but avoid if youre looking srk as lover boy hes tough coach,0.5523653395784545,0.1916712204007286,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Very enjoyable movie with an excellent ensemble cast,"I have always loved good melodramatic underdog sports movies such as Remember the Titans,Invincible etc and now we have the bollywood version with Chak De India.Hats off to the production team and the director for coming out with a fresh and very high quality product with excellently filmed hockey scenes that are quite realistic. I loved the wonderful cast of unknown girls who make up the Indian national women's hockey team. All of them had a part to play and they played them beautifully while executing some rigorous hockey action. They were excellent and gave wonderfully natural performances that should shame some of the already established actresses. Special mention should be given to the actress playing Bindya Naik. My favourite was the actress who played the spirited but pint sized forward from Haryana, she was really cute and funny in a tomboyish sort of way.Shahrukh Khan was excellent in this movie..... his best performance since Swades in my opinion as he played against type. Had some wonderful moments with the girls and drew lots of cheers and laughs from the audience. If the movie succeeds then a lot of the credit has to go the King khan's crowd pulling power.If this film succeeds and I sincerely hope it does, I think Amin (director) and Yashraj films are going to start a whole new trend a la DDLJ with a whole slew of sports related movies coming from Bollywood. I am sure cricket will be next on the agenda.A thoroughly enjoyable ride....go watch it.P.S. - some interesting trailers shown as well Laga Chunari Main Daag, Aaja Nachle and Goal (the Indian bend it like beckham maybe?)",very enjoyable movie with excellent ensemble cast,i have always loved good melodramatic underdog sports movies such as remember titans invincible etc now we have bollywood version with chak de india hats off production team director coming out with fresh very high quality product with excellently filmed hockey scenes that are quite realistic i loved wonderful cast unknown girls who make up indian national womens hockey team all them had part play they played them beautifully while executing some rigorous hockey action they were excellent gave wonderfully natural performances that should shame some already established actresses special mention should be given actress playing bindya naik my favourite was actress who played spirited but pint sized forward haryana she was really cute funny tomboyish sort way shahrukh khan was excellent this movie his best performance since swades my opinion as he played against type had some wonderful moments with girls drew lots cheers laughs audience if movie succeeds then lot credit has go king khans crowd pulling power if this film succeeds i sincerely hope it does i think amin director yashraj films are going start whole new trend la ddlj with whole slew sports related movies coming bollywood i am sure cricket will be next agenda thoroughly enjoyable ride go watch it p s some interesting trailers shown as well laga chunari main daag aaja nachle goal indian bend it like beckham maybe,0.6189579880437023,0.4881382807668522,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,well done Shahrukh!!!!!!!,"As Shahrukh khan is trying do work in different type of movies than he has done till now(mostly romantic) he makes an attempt at the sports genre and delivers yet another brilliant performance.The story is of the Indian women hockey team which because of its poor performance and lack of sponsors is unable to find a good coach.Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan ) a former national hockey team player steps in to take the responsibility of the new coach .The rest of the movie shows how he takes Indian women hockey team to a new hight and how he regains his lost dignity The plot of the movie is linear and predictable without any twist or surprises, in fact it is quality of direction and acting by Shahrukh khan ( well supported by the rest of the cast),which sucks you in the movie and does not let you get bored. Music of the movie is good including the title song which is quite inspirational.It has to be said that good level of effort has been put into every part of the movie whether it is casting or hockey(matches)choreography (which is acceptable).Although the winning streak of the team at the world cup may seem to an extent unrealistic but overall Chak De India can be said as an entertaining and inspirational movie and is a must watch for every Shah Rukh Khan fan and critic for his brilliant performance.",well done shahrukh,as shahrukh khan is trying do work different type movies than he has done till now mostly romantic he makes attempt at sports genre delivers yet another brilliant performance story is indian women hockey team which because its poor performance lack sponsors is unable find good coach kabir khan shahrukh khan former national hockey team player steps take responsibility new coach rest movie shows how he takes indian women hockey team new hight how he regains his lost dignity plot movie is linear predictable without any twist or surprises fact it is quality direction acting by shahrukh khan well supported by rest cast which sucks you movie does not let you get bored music movie is good including title song which is quite inspirational it has be said that good level effort has been put into every part movie whether it is casting or hockey matches choreography which is acceptable although winning streak team at world cup may seem extent unrealistic but overall chak de india can be said as entertaining inspirational movie is must watch every shah rukh khan fan critic his brilliant performance,0.5981404958677685,0.1714876033057851,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,MY views on CHak De India,"In plain and simple words, I loved CDI. Heck, even if you take SRK out of it, I would still love it! This movie is about a man trying to prove his dedication and love for his sport, his people, and his country. This is about a man scorned by the nation, shunned by his close ones, and his redemption in the way he knows best. Its this main underlying theme that makes CDI special. This theme is so universal, and so identifiable, that your heart connects instantly.CDI is about Indian sportswomen coming to the forefront, about the stark and grim realities staring at our national sport, and the reasons behind that. It is about unity in diversity, strength in weakness, and putting the team above oneself. Its about the sacrifices one has to make in order to achieve his goals. Its about the success of true sporting spirit! Its real, yet entertaining. Its patriotic without being jingoistic. Its international, yet soaked in Indianness. Its a collage of the different states of India, and the difficult but fruitful formation of this collage.I have never played or watched or been interested in hockey! But this movie does not need that to touch your heart. All it needs is some patriotism, humility and goodness in your heart. If thats in abundance, I am sure you will love it.As for the performances, I would just say the entire team rocks. the keyword here is TEAM, as thats what this film is all about! Enjoy !",my views chak de india,plain simple words i loved cdi heck even if you take srk out it i would still love it this movie is about man trying prove his dedication love his sport his people his country this is about man scorned by nation shunned by his close ones his redemption way he knows best its this main underlying theme that makes cdi special this theme is so universal so identifiable that your heart connects instantly cdi is about indian sportswomen coming forefront about stark grim realities staring at our national sport reasons behind that it is about unity diversity strength weakness putting team above oneself its about sacrifices one has make order achieve his goals its about success true sporting spirit its real yet entertaining its patriotic without being jingoistic its international yet soaked indianness its collage different states india difficult but fruitful formation this collage i have never played or watched or been interested hockey but this movie does not need that touch your heart all it needs is some patriotism humility goodness your heart if thats abundance i am sure you will love it as performances i would just say entire team rocks keyword here is team as thats what this film is all about enjoy,0.5129482657260435,0.14850088183421517,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.26}"
7.0,Extremely formulaic but also quite enjoyable.,"""Chak De India!"" is a sports film, and like MOST other sports films, it's nearly 100% predictable. However, while it very closely follows the expected formula and has many of the usual sports films clichés, it manages to be enjoyable and worth while.The film begins with a world championship match between the Indian and Pakistani field hockey teams. Kabir misses what seems like a sure goal and then he is treated abominably by the Indian press and his community--as if he WANTED his team to lose! Seven years pass. Now Kabir wants to redeem himself but not as a player but as a coach for a new Indian WOMEN'S field hockey team. His odds look pretty much impossible except for one important thing--it's a sports film and you pretty much know how it's all going to occur! But, as I said above, the plot does offer a bit more. Some nice performances and a few tiny plot twists help it to be a good film.By the way, although you might expect the usual song and dance numbers like you usually see in Bollywood films, this one has none. My aunt was actually pretty disappointed. She really liked the film but wanted the musical numbers as well!",extremely formulaic but also quite enjoyable,chak de india is sports film like most other sports films its nearly 100 predictable however while it very closely follows expected formula has many usual sports films clich s it manages be enjoyable worth while film begins with world championship match between indian pakistani field hockey teams kabir misses what seems like sure goal then he is treated abominably by indian press his community as if he wanted his team lose seven years pass now kabir wants redeem himself but not as player but as coach new indian womens field hockey team his odds look pretty much impossible except one important thing its sports film you pretty much know how its all going occur but as i said above plot does offer bit more some nice performances few tiny plot twists help it be good film by way although you might expect usual song dance numbers like you usually see bollywood films this one has none my aunt was actually pretty disappointed she really liked film but wanted musical numbers as well,0.5005760732323231,0.1373342803030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,"A superior sports film, brilliantly led by Mr. Khan","Chak De India is without a doubt a one-of-a-kind Hindi film, one that you'd hardly ever expect to see in Indian cinema, and one that is at par with any great foreign production. It is an exceptional sports film, more because there's much more to it than just a series of games, and you never care about the fact that the ending is easy to predict. Shimit Amin, who previously directed Ab Tak Chapphan, directs the film with great skill, care, and feeling for the subject. Jaideep Sahni is responsible for the fantastic script, and that's where we get an original example of expert storytelling.This is the story of Kabir Khan, once a hockey star and a captain of the Indian team. Seven years ago, he was accused of treason in favour of Pakistan because he missed a crucial penalty against them. Being a Muslim and being good sport about it did the job and, branded a traitor, Kabir left his ancestral home in shame. We know nothing about what he's been through in these seven years, but we do know that he's got a new chance to prove his innocence when he comes back as the coach of the Indian woman's field hockey team. A chance as crucial as this damned penalty stroke.The second half is much stronger than the first (not that this one's bad), but that's the case with most sports films as the most enjoyable sequences are often in later portions, when the matches finally take place. And well, it is just full of suspense, tension, and even though I could easily predict the ending, the script and direction were good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and give me quite a few goosebumps throughout it. In fact several moments throughout the matches were so exhilarating and overwhelming that I found myself jumping up off my seat with sheer joy.Technically the film is superb. The cinematography is amazing, with the camera moving intelligently to focus the viewer's attention on the proceedings. The film is efficiently edited, and the background score more than contributes to the film, building tension where necessary, and making everything so much more captivating. The title track, ""Chak De India"" is really a treat. It is patriotic, joyful, and very well used in the film. That the film's songs atypically play only over montage sequences, as opposed to the traditional style of song and dance, is certainly a great plus.Shahrukh Khan is tremendous. This is one of his most restrained performances, yet his charismatic presence is as evident as ever. He is perfectly natural and controlled in a most nuanced portrayal that never fails to convey the inner pain, the frustration, the hope and the quiet determination to clear his name and finally make a place in the sun. The supporting cast is roundly good, and the girls are great as a group. Shilpa Shukla enjoys the meatiest part, an assertive girl driven by ego and jealousy, and she is excellent. Sagarika Ghatge and Vidya Malvade are pretty and convincing.Chak De India can be described as patriotic, feminist, but for me it's more than anything about willpower and the importance of hard and collaborative work. It teaches and reaffirms that what really makes such games work--and for that matter, many other things in life--is lots of training, patience, and team work, without which nothing would quite click. According to me the best Hindi film of 2007; a thrilling and inspiring cinematic experience which is worth many a repeat viewing for more than one reason.

Most of the times, movie successfully manages to overshadow the predictable nature of the story, but the ending sequence was absolutely the same what i thought of before the movie started.

9.0,There's only room for one bully on this team! And that bully is me.,"I am not what you would call a sports fan. I do not get any vicarious thrill watching someone else do what I can't. I appreciate great sportsmen/women like Tiger Woods or Lorena Ochoa or Danica Patrick, but I generally avoid watching unless it is a national event like the World Cup or the Olympics.Having said that, I am a huge fan of sports movies. They are a source of excitement and inspiration if they are done well. This one is one of the best that I have seen.It has so many good points, that it is hard to list them all. The obsession with national pride and the fact that a star player is scapegoated for a loss is first and foremost in this film. We are all allowed to make one mistake, aren't we? Not if your mistake costs the country to lose a title and lose face to a huge enemy. Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) made such a mistake and it caused him to leave his home and go into exile for seven years.He returned to take a job that no one wanted. He would coach a women's hockey team to the World Championships. No one wanted it because it was a women's team, and we all know that is usually just a Title IX requirement and not to be taken seriously. In fact, they didn't even want to fund the trip to the World Championships after he trained the team. Money was to be used for a men's team. Women belong barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen, as one Arkansas politician put it some years ago.To watch 150+ minutes of women's hockey, you have to have one hell of a story and some very interesting characters. The challenge of Khan transforming sixteen championship players from all over India into a team that puts India first, was mesmerizing. You know how the story will end. It ends as all sports movies do, but it is the journey that is fascinating. To see the neanderthal attitudes of the country transformed through excellence in sport is both exciting and sad. (Don't be so smug, America, your record on women isn't too much better.) If you are looking for an exciting movie that will thrill you beyond belief, then this is the one. Do not miss it.",theres only room one bully this team that bully is me,i am not what you would call sports fan i do not get any vicarious thrill watching someone else do what i cant i appreciate great sportsmen women like tiger woods or lorena ochoa or danica patrick but i generally avoid watching unless it is national event like world cup or olympics having said that i am huge fan sports movies they are source excitement inspiration if they are done well this one is one best that i have seen it has so many good points that it is hard list them all obsession with national pride fact that star player is scapegoated loss is first foremost this film we are all allowed make one mistake arent we not if your mistake costs country lose title lose face huge enemy kabir khan shahrukh khan made such mistake it caused him leave his home go into exile seven years he returned take job that no one wanted he would coach womens hockey team world championships no one wanted it because it was womens team we all know that is usually just title ix requirement not be taken seriously fact they didnt even want fund trip world championships after he trained team money was be used mens team women belong barefoot pregnant kitchen as one arkansas politician put it some years ago watch 150 minutes womens hockey you have have one hell story some very interesting characters challenge khan transforming sixteen championship players all over india into team that puts india first was mesmerizing you know how story will end it ends as all sports movies do but it is journey that is fascinating see neanderthal attitudes country transformed through excellence sport is both exciting sad dont be so smug america your record women isnt too much better if you are looking exciting movie that will thrill you beyond belief then this is one do not miss it,0.6306818181818182,0.2753787878787879,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"

9.0,"Subtle, yet powerful. A must watch!","How often do we get a very simple story that makes the biggest impact possible? How often does a dull colorless looking film put a huge smile on your face by the end of the screening? You don't see much of that in Hindi cinema. Chak De does not preach, it does not bore, in fact it's just telling you a story with one sequence or another the viewer can relate to.Kabir Khan, once a caption of the Indian hockey team is accused of match fixing due to a leaked picture of a casual handshake between him and the Pakistani Captain. One circumstance leads to another, having Kabir fired and out of the team. Not only is Kabir fired but also heavily criticized and labeled as a traitor.Years later, Kabir returns to hockey. Not to play, but to coach a group of young girls from various states. Then starts Kabir's journey to lead his team to victory and regain his lost respect. As they say, the journey is more important than reaching the destination. Chak De is one tough journey of a coach and his group of girls who don't even know how to play as a team.Chak De talks about a good number of issues that we all see in our everyday lives. However, it's not the talk of the issues that win you over but it's how subtly the writer points it all out.Let's analyze: Chak De talks about India's national sport - No, not cricket. Very few know that field hockey was known as India's national sport in which we have received Olympic honors decades ago. Since the cricket wave hit, Indians forgot about their national sport.Chak De talks about the role of women in our country. Normally seen as housewives, Indian woman in sports is frowned upon. Chak De mentions that in scenes when a player talks to Kabir about her husband. Or when the girls are rejected permission to go to the tournament.Finally, Chak De is basically about playing for your country over anything else. Whether your Punjabi, Gujrati, Tamil, Bengali or Bihari - It's about I-N-D-I-A. As mentioned in a striking scene in the initial reels.there are so many remarkable scenes in the movie. To name a couple, the McDonalds scene is genius. Of Course the climax is electrifying.The writing is flawless. Screenplay glues you. The dialogues are touching, fresh and not a tad bit cheesy. Bravo Jaideep Sahni! Salim-Suleman's music is underrated. The title song and Maula mere are bout gems. Background score is amazing.Shimmit Amin's direction is top notch. It was his second film after a thrilling Ab Tak Chappan. Hard to believe? All girls are natural. Some are hockey players in real life and some are in reel life. They all play their parts flawlessly. Especially the one's that play Balbir, Komal, Vidiya, Alia and Preeti, respectively.Shah Rukh Khan is the heart and soul of Chak De India. Every expression, dialogue, mannerism, smile, cry, it's flawless. He carries Chak De all the way. A subtle act that speaks so loudly about the man's talent. One of his best performances. (Says a lot since he's got a great resume of performances) Aplaudworthy! Overall - Chak De is poetic, controversial and nothing short of a classic.",subtle yet powerful must watch,how often do we get very simple story that makes biggest impact possible how often does dull colorless looking film put huge smile your face by end screening you dont see much that hindi cinema chak de does not preach it does not bore fact its just telling you story with one sequence or another viewer can relate kabir khan once caption indian hockey team is accused match fixing due leaked picture casual handshake between him pakistani captain one circumstance leads another having kabir fired out team not only is kabir fired but also heavily criticized labeled as traitor years later kabir returns hockey not play but coach group young girls various states then starts kabirs journey lead his team victory regain his lost respect as they say journey is more important than reaching destination chak de is one tough journey coach his group girls who dont even know how play as team chak de talks about good number issues that we all see our everyday lives however its not talk issues that win you over but its how subtly writer points it all out lets analyze chak de talks about indias national sport no not cricket very few know that field hockey was known as indias national sport which we have received olympic honors decades ago since cricket wave hit indians forgot about their national sport chak de talks about role women our country normally seen as housewives indian woman sports is frowned upon chak de mentions that scenes when player talks kabir about her husband or when girls are rejected permission go tournament finally chak de is basically about playing your country over anything else whether your punjabi gujrati tamil bengali or bihari its about i n d i as mentioned striking scene initial reels there are so many remarkable scenes movie name couple mcdonalds scene is genius course climax is electrifying writing is flawless screenplay glues you dialogues are touching fresh not tad bit cheesy bravo jaideep sahni salim sulemans music is underrated title song maula mere are bout gems background score is amazing shimmit amins direction is top notch it was his second film after thrilling ab tak chappan hard believe all girls are natural some are hockey players real life some are reel life they all play their parts flawlessly especially ones that play balbir komal vidiya alia preeti respectively shah rukh khan is heart soul chak de india every expression dialogue mannerism smile cry its flawless he carries chak de all way subtle act that speaks so loudly about mans talent one his best performances says lot since hes got great resume performances aplaudworthy overall chak de is poetic controversial nothing short classic,0.5671781305114639,0.16823045267489714,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"

9.0,A highly spirited thrilling ride.,"""The next 70 minutes are yours. Not even God can take it away from you. Go get them"". As Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) gives the speech to its hockey team, you feel the moment with him. As if you are standing in that locker room and you are going to play that hockey match with the rest of the crew. This feeling will follow you on a fantastic ride called as Chak De-India. This is not a story of champions. This is not a story of freedom. This is not a story of strength to win. This is not a story of extraordinary people who fight against out numbered enemies. But this is a story of gaining high spirits among individuals who come together and achieve something they never knew how to.Kabir Khan is a newly appointed coach of Indian women's hockey team who are preparing themselves for upcoming World Cup championship. The hurdles for the coach are not just to bring the team together and train and teach what they exactly need to, but also to answer to the criticism from his fans about his missed stroke when he played in Men's hockey finals. Not to mention his fight against himself about that lost game. As the team is introduced at the signup desk, the women from every corner of India make you laugh and curious. They can be wearing a bully's attitude, I-am-so-hot attitude or just plain simple girls lived under the shadow of the family. But they have one thing in common. The passion and talent for the game. They can make friends or enemies among themselves, even though they are in the same team, but the journey ahead towards the final glory is extraordinary.There was a movie. Ab Tak Chhappan, (2004) that shook so many audiences and critics. Shimit Amin, the same director, now handled Chak De, and surprisingly his knife feels as sharp as his last cut in 2004. The whole tone and attitude of excitement, pain, zyst and glory is so unbelievable that it feels as if Bollywood is waking up and breathing. The expressions on each player's face are captured magnificently and straight to the core. Jaideep Sahani, the writer who previously wrote Ram Gopal Verma's gangster thriller Company (2002) does a memorable comeback with Chak De. I mean the MacDonald's scene, the coach's speech, the final goal and the diligence of keeping away from any cheesy dialogues just makes me say one word. WOW!Thank You Aditya Chopra for bringing this team together.Now definitely Shah Rukh Khan has to be mentioned here. He is not the usual, mindless college boy who whines over some troubled relationships just to shake those faint hearted who worship him. He is a tough and determined hockey player who knows what he is talking about. With a rough stubble and Ray Ban aviator sunglasses he makes his appearance felt. No clichés, just passion.Well, the hockey team is rather something to watch, than to read right here. So just go ahead and walk in to this locker room and listen to the coach and chat with these passionate women.My rating: 9/10.",highly spirited thrilling ride,next 70 minutes are yours not even god can take it away you go get them as kabir khan shah rukh khan gives speech its hockey team you feel moment with him as if you are standing that locker room you are going play that hockey match with rest crew this feeling will follow you fantastic ride called as chak de india this is not story champions this is not story freedom this is not story strength win this is not story extraordinary people who fight against out numbered enemies but this is story gaining high spirits among individuals who come together achieve something they never knew how kabir khan is newly appointed coach indian womens hockey team who are preparing themselves upcoming world cup championship hurdles coach are not just bring team together train teach what they exactly need but also answer criticism his fans about his missed stroke when he played mens hockey finals not mention his fight against himself about that lost game as team is introduced at signup desk women every corner india make you laugh curious they can be wearing bullys attitude i am so hot attitude or just plain simple girls lived under shadow family but they have one thing common passion talent game they can make friends or enemies among themselves even though they are same team but journey ahead towards final glory is extraordinary there was movie ab tak chhappan 2004 that shook so many audiences critics shimit amin same director now handled chak de surprisingly his knife feels as sharp as his last cut 2004 whole tone attitude excitement pain zyst glory is so unbelievable that it feels as if bollywood is waking up breathing expressions each players face are captured magnificently straight core jaideep sahani writer who previously wrote ram gopal vermas gangster thriller company 2002 does memorable comeback with chak de i mean macdonalds scene coachs speech final goal diligence keeping away any cheesy dialogues just makes me say one word wow thank you aditya chopra bringing this team together now definitely shah rukh khan has be mentioned here he is not usual mindless college boy who whines over some troubled relationships just shake those faint hearted who worship him he is tough determined hockey player who knows what he is talking about with rough stubble ray ban aviator sunglasses he makes his appearance felt no clich s just passion well hockey team is rather something watch than read right here so just go ahead walk this locker room listen coach chat with these passionate women my rating 9 10,0.6162491190979562,0.042241937648914395,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,"Each girl stands out, and in their own way, shine above SRK...","Chak De! India is a sports film, made by Indians, for Indians, (well, not necessarily!), and is one of the better films of 2007 so far. I was reluctant to see the movie because of hype and criticism, but upon seeing it, I have realised that this movie is fantastic - and nothing can take that away.Shah Rukh Khan - how can I describe this wonderful actor? His role was about undying love for the sport, and undying love for your country - something inspirational, beautiful, and so universal. It is so easy to relate to his character, heck, the guy had been despised, shunned, and loathed by his whole country, forced to leave his home, hated by one and all. He should have been scarred for life! But no, Chak De! India shows that with a little faith, your whole life will come spinning back to you.It was clever to choose hockey, being our national sport - even though majorly overshadowed by cricket - it worked wonders. There were also no song/dance sequences in this movie, something I thought interesting and expertly handled. It takes skill to take the song and dance out of a Hindi movie and still have it being a hit, but Shimit Amin has handled this with great finesse. The hockey scenes were handled with such amazing expertise and know-how, it is close to Hollywood standards. (Note I said close) The real tone and plot of CDI is about proving that women are just as capable as men. However, CDI is not a feminist film. There is talent, brain, beauty, and practicality available in a woman, she should not be taken for granted. And I am glad to say that after seeing this film, she probably won't be! Shimit Amin has made an amazing film. I am very proud to call myself an Indian, this movie is excellent. The ending is extremely predictable, but it was handled very well - there is so much tension building up to it, and each minute you clench your fists and lean forward in your chair, waiting for that goal to be scored.My favourite part: the 16 girls. Each one uniquely has their say in the movie, though the few from further regions of India etc, had lesser to do. Yet they all played their parts and added the one thing CDI needed - grace. The focus was mainly on a few girls, for example Vidya Malvade, Sagarika Ghatge. But I liked the way all the girls worked so well together - they became a real TEAM, which is what CDI is all about. I also admired the way each girl in a way had her own personal storyline behind her, which all added to the tension of winning the World Cup! My personal favourite would be the little one, Chitrashi Rawat as Komal, I thought she showed fabulous potential and her gutsy little performance had me grinning.So move over guys, the girls are here!",each girl stands out their own way shine above srk,chak de india is sports film made by indians indians well not necessarily is one better films 2007 so far i was reluctant see movie because hype criticism but upon seeing it i have realised that this movie is fantastic nothing can take that away shah rukh khan how can i describe this wonderful actor his role was about undying love sport undying love your country something inspirational beautiful so universal it is so easy relate his character heck guy had been despised shunned loathed by his whole country forced leave his home hated by one all he should have been scarred life but no chak de india shows that with little faith your whole life will come spinning back you it was clever choose hockey being our national sport even though majorly overshadowed by cricket it worked wonders there were also no song dance sequences this movie something i thought interesting expertly handled it takes skill take song dance out hindi movie still have it being hit but shimit amin has handled this with great finesse hockey scenes were handled with such amazing expertise know how it is close hollywood standards note i said close real tone plot cdi is about proving that women are just as capable as men however cdi is not feminist film there is talent brain beauty practicality available woman she should not be taken granted i am glad say that after seeing this film she probably wont be shimit amin has made amazing film i am very proud call myself indian this movie is excellent ending is extremely predictable but it was handled very well there is so much tension building up it each minute you clench your fists lean forward your chair waiting that goal be scored my favourite part 16 girls each one uniquely has their say movie though few further regions india etc had lesser do yet they all played their parts added one thing cdi needed grace focus was mainly few girls example vidya malvade sagarika ghatge but i liked way all girls worked so well together they became real team which is what cdi is all about i also admired way each girl way had her own personal storyline behind her which all added tension winning world cup my personal favourite would be little one chitrashi rawat as komal i thought she showed fabulous potential her gutsy little performance had me grinning so move over guys girls are here,0.6091503267973856,0.23774509803921567,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,Ab tak 2,"Chak de is the finest sports flick India has produced. It works because of the writer Jaideep , director Shmit , actor SRK, and the girls.It is modern and the format of the movie is nice. Jaideep must have seen a lot of Hollywood sports flicks and written a nice script with an Indian touch.Shmit did his job well. Considering he has worked for lot of Hollywood movies and been in Ramu's school and made a stunning debut with Ab Tak 56 as a director, he was destined to make Chak de with such a determination.Chak de is new in lot of respects. Hats off to Shmit for having tried two different genres but not just sticking to the Gangster genre.I don't want to go into the intricacies of the film. Just go and watch it.

10.0,Now that's called a movie,"Frankly, i had come across only a few bollywood flicks, on my fingertips, which can be defined as a movie. Now i don't say a rom-com isn't a one but inevitably, its only exaggeration which comes out from them at the end and nothing more: the same style of feature film.Chakde India is a Sports movie and it has all the elements which you expect from one such experiment: lots of moral values, songs only to motivate your spirit, adrenaline rush, things which matter in a match and of-course, the sarcasms when you are blamed for a loss.If in one part it's SRK who did justice to the role, the side characters equally performed well as hockey players. And above all, hats off to writers and creators, the movie didn't deviate any place from its path.I still remember it was one such movie which was for all the ages and a group or a team referred it as an example on how to work in unity and its benefits. Even our office team went to watch it in Cinema and everybody got that Josh at the end.10/10 and no less.",now thats called movie,frankly i had come across only few bollywood flicks my fingertips which can be defined as movie now i dont say rom com isnt one but inevitably its only exaggeration which comes out them at end nothing more same style feature film chakde india is sports movie it has all elements which you expect one such experiment lots moral values songs only motivate your spirit adrenaline rush things which matter match course sarcasms when you are blamed loss if one part its srk who did justice role side characters equally performed well as hockey players above all hats off writers creators movie didnt deviate any place its path i still remember it was one such movie which was all ages group or team referred it as example how work unity its benefits even our office team went watch it cinema everybody got that josh at end 10 10 no less,0.4916666666666666,0.029487179487179487,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"Chak de Chak de, Ek Hockey doongi main Rakh ke!","Yes I went to see the film because I saw Shahrukh looking super good in the promos (what can I say - I am a shallow person!). But what kept me glued to the seat with my eyes fixed on the screen was a motley crew of ordinary girls with extra-ordinary attitude. AND I like hockey, wish the glory days were back.Chak de India is an out and out sports film, there is a disgraced coach, there is a team that is fragmented and needs team spirit, and there are matches to be won and glory to reap. The film follows a rather linear path and does not dish out any surprises except one - it is unpredictably wonderful! My football and basketball fanatic little nephew was shouting ""goal"" at every score and the audience was as mesmerized at this tournament being played out on celluloid as they would have been at the live event. There were cheers and claps at every win. Why? Because this team was real, we watched them turn into a team and we yearned for their day in the lights as much as they did. Of course it was a Cinderella story - but what made the story poignant was the fact that all this happened for real, that there was indeed an extraordinary player who was disgraced and redeemed himself in exactly this fashion. The script was taut, the editing was superb, there were no unnecessary moments in the film. There were no cringe inducing dialogs, no useless song and dance routines, no romance backdrop of the coach falling for the star (a la Bend it Like Beckham). The music was uplifting and extremely well integrated into the narrative - Kuch Kariye was inspirational, Maula mere haunting, Badal Pe Paon a most exuberant transition from stuck in the back waters to out in the happening place of the World Cup! The girls were superbly cast - they represented the true face of India, with all its diversity and its problems that relate to this diversity. Their bickering, their in fights, quest for personal glory and how this slowly changed into a camaraderie was extremely well done. Komal Chautala (Chitrashi Rawat) was CUTE, Bindiya Nayak (Shilpa Shukla) was awesome as the bad girl of the team, Preeti Sabharwal (Segarika Ghatge) was hot, Tanya Abrol was awesome as the Hockey Doongi Balbir, Vidya Sharma (Vidya Malvade) was good as the conflicted housewife turned goalie/captain, but my personal favorite was SoiMoi (Nisha Nair) the girl from Jharkhand. Every one was given their moments to tell us why we should care about them. The other supporting cast of the assistant coach and the federation people did their job well. Of course I had gone in expecting to see SRK in a hot new incarnation. What I saw was a man who was a coach, a haunted man with agony in his eyes, a fire in his belly and a desire to redeem himself at all costs. After about the first 10 minutes I did not even care that Mr. Khan was looking the best he has done in years - he was coach Kabir Khan, the tarter, the disciplinarian, the psychologist, the motivator and above all the man who was in for the long haul and was going to make a miracle happen.Shimit's direction was superb, Jaideep Sahni wrote a stirring tale, and together with the actors they made sure that this was not just another sports Cinderella story. This was a tale about the empowerment of women, and showcased their ability to triumph in the face of innumerable hurdles both in the home and outside.

6.0,"Clichéd, but in a good way","A disgraced hockey player (Shah Rukh Khan) has stayed out of the limelight for years after his team lost an important match. But now he has returned to coach a women's hockey team during the World Cup, hoping to regain his honour.Chak de! India is a pretty by the numbers sports film. You have an underdog team of misfits. You have a tough, but fair coach with unconventional methods. You have the cool kids. You have the odd kids. You have the big kid. You have the small kid. Well, they're all adults in this case, but this might as well be a teenage flick.That being said, I do like what the film does with its clichés. Like the cliché where the players don't initially get along at all and have to learn to play with each other. Well, India is such a huge country and these women have been gathered from all over, so it makes sense that they don't necessarily understand one another right from the start. They barely even speak the same language, after all. And when they do start to become a team, it's a good message for India as a whole.Still, if there's one thing I'd wish, it's that the film had dodged at least some of the clichés. Now it seems set on collecting them all. And I mean all. Every single sports film cliché you can think of, it's in this film. Sure, they're done well and they're fun for the most part, but they're still clichés.Nevertheless, I had fun with Chak de! India. Not the best sports film I've seen, but it has passion. And that's often enough.",clich d but good way,disgraced hockey player shah rukh khan has stayed out limelight years after his team lost important match but now he has returned coach womens hockey team during world cup hoping regain his honour chak de india is pretty by numbers sports film you have underdog team misfits you have tough but fair coach with unconventional methods you have cool kids you have odd kids you have big kid you have small kid well theyre all adults this case but this might as well be teenage flick that being said i do like what film does with its clich s like clich where players dont initially get along at all have learn play with each other well india is such huge country these women have been gathered all over so it makes sense that they dont necessarily understand one another right start they barely even speak same language after all when they do start become team its good message india as whole still if theres one thing id wish its that film had dodged at least some clich s now it seems set collecting them all i mean all every single sports film clich you can think its this film sure theyre done well theyre fun most part but theyre still clich s nevertheless i had fun with chak de india not best sports film ive seen but it has passion thats often enough,0.48826628352490425,0.12142172961138478,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.27}"
