1.0,Cage Left Behind by good movies,"Was it the money? Did he owe someone a favour? Cage why are you in this terrible movie ? Left Behind is even worse than the Kirk Cameron version ,which also sucked. The book I am sure is better, since many have read it. This movie is a career killer ...it is sad to see Cage left behind by Hollywood. The acting is bad , Cage tries hard to make work out of a script that was seemingly penned by 8 year old's . I mean the dialogue is terrible. Why waste your money making a film that is just bad. Cage needs to really rethink his career . Honestly I felt ashamed for Nick .

3.0,If I Had Been Raptured While Watching This Movie I Wouldn't Have Minded,"As a non-fundamentalist Christian, I remember when the Tim LaHaye book (on which this is based) came about. It stirred a lot of excitement in those fundamentalist circles. I was never especially interested in it; never read it. To be honest I wasn't especially interested in the movie either (and never watched the earlier Kirk Cameron version.) But - hey - it's on Netflix; I had a free afternoon. How bad could it really be? Well, pretty bad. It isn't as awful as some people say it is. To be honest, the actual moment of rapture was kind of well done. People's clothes just dropping to the ground as they disappear leaving everybody else with either mouths agape or screaming in terror. It was kind of cool. And it's true that millions of people (whether Christians or anyone else) just simply disappearing all at the same time would cause chaos around the world - although we didn't see much of the world. Just a bit of New York City and mostly the airplane.You see, most of this movie is set on an airplane. Nicolas Cage plays the pilot - Captain Ray Steele (which is a kind of a cool name - kudos to LaHaye for coming up with it in the novel.) The Steele family is divided. Ray and his daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) are non- believers (Ray's having an affair with a flight attendant played by Nicky Whelan), while Irene (mom) and Raymie (young son) must be believers - 'cause they get taken to heaven, meaning we don't see much of them. I thought the scenes on the plane were semi- believable at times. Passengers had a variety of reactions - aliens or time travel or conspiracy or whatever. There were times of panic - although by the end everybody seemed surprisingly calm. There's a wee bit of suspense as the plane approaches New York City with no fuel. But overall the story and characters were pretty weak.As for the theology, or at least the moral message? Well, first of all all children go to heaven. Because we get told that there are no children left. No age was attached. Do you get a free pass to heaven until you're - 10? 13? 16? I don't know. And, boy, once those Christians are gone it turns out that most of those who are left are looters or related thug-like folks, because there's lots of looting. And most of the Christians who were portrayed before the rapture were of the - shall we say - extremist variety, so this is clearly a triumphalistic sort of message from the fundamentalist community - come over to our side because we're gonna win! And there was really no great attempt to explain the idea of the rapture. It's not an idea that's universally accepted among Christians, and it's really a kind of bizarre idea. This is obviously supposed to be a sort of religious propaganda; an evangelistic tool meant to unfortunately scare people into believing that they better believe or this terrible thing is going to happen and you're gonna be ""left behind."" But scaring people into faith rarely works in my experience, and if it does it calls into serious question the very reason why a person would believe. The Christian faith as I understand it is supposed to put the focus on caring for others; this kind of evangelism tells you that you should be worried about yourself. And there's that irritating song that closed the movie out that I hadn't heard in years. ""I wish we'd all been ready. ... The Son has come, and you've been left behind.""This isn't as absolutely horrible as some people say it is - although I wouldn't have objected to being raptured during it. I could have seen that as an act of divine mercy. Of course, I wasn't raptured during it, but I will confess that I fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of it - but I was interested enough to go back and see how it ended. Everything's kind of left up in the air - maybe leaving open the possibility of a sequel, since there have been Lord knows how many books in the series. I doubt that will happen. I would think this has a very niche market. Fundamentalist Christians might yearn for more. Others (like me) might check it out on Netflix, but I certainly wouldn't pay to see a sequel in a theatre or specifically rent a DVD of a sequel. (3/10)",if i had been raptured while watching this movie i wouldnt have minded,as non fundamentalist christian i remember when tim lahaye book which this is based came about it stirred lot excitement those fundamentalist circles i was never especially interested it never read it be honest i wasnt especially interested movie either never watched earlier kirk cameron version but hey its netflix i had free afternoon how bad could it really be well pretty bad it isnt as awful as some people say it is be honest actual moment rapture was kind well done peoples clothes just dropping ground as they disappear leaving everybody else with either mouths agape or screaming terror it was kind cool its true that millions people whether christians or anyone else just simply disappearing all at same time would cause chaos around world although we didnt see much world just bit new york city mostly airplane you see most this movie is set airplane nicolas cage plays pilot captain ray steele which is kind cool name kudos lahaye coming up with it novel steele family is divided ray his daughter chloe cassi thomson are non believers rays having affair with flight attendant played by nicky whelan while irene mom raymie young son must be believers cause they get taken heaven meaning we dont see much them i thought scenes plane were semi believable at times passengers had variety reactions aliens or time travel or conspiracy or whatever there were times panic although by end everybody seemed surprisingly calm theres wee bit suspense as plane approaches new york city with no fuel but overall story characters were pretty weak as theology or at least moral message well first all all children go heaven because we get told that there are no children left no age was attached do you get free pass heaven until youre 10 13 16 i dont know boy once those christians are gone it turns out that most those who are left are looters or related thug like folks because theres lots looting most christians who were portrayed before rapture were shall we say extremist variety so this is clearly triumphalistic sort message fundamentalist community come over our side because were gonna win there was really no great attempt explain idea rapture its not idea thats universally accepted among christians its really kind bizarre idea this is obviously supposed be sort religious propaganda evangelistic tool meant unfortunately scare people into believing that they better believe or this terrible thing is going happen youre gonna be left behind but scaring people into faith rarely works my experience if it does it calls into serious question very reason why person would believe christian faith as i understand it is supposed put focus caring others this kind evangelism tells you that you should be worried about yourself theres that irritating song that closed movie out that i hadnt heard years i wish wed all been ready son has come youve been left behind this isnt as absolutely horrible as some people say it is although i wouldnt have objected being raptured during it i could have seen that as act divine mercy course i wasnt raptured during it but i will confess that i fell asleep missed last 20 minutes it but i was interested enough go back see how it ended everythings kind left up air maybe leaving open possibility sequel since there have been lord knows how many books series i doubt that will happen i would think this has very niche market fundamentalist christians might yearn more others like me might check it out netflix but i certainly wouldnt pay see sequel theatre or specifically rent dvd sequel 3 10,0.500898679379692,0.10463518548961585,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1.0,Basic and Boring...,"Once again I was deceived by the trailers as they made this movie look absolutely amazing; however, the trailers were the only good things that came out of this movie, and that says a lot.First of all, we have the common Christian movie stereotype where some of a family is for God, and some of it is against God. Than we are provided with the frequent misunderstandings non-Christians face regarding the meaning of scripture due to Christians who have almost 0 theological education. So because the Christians fail to provide an adequate answer, the non-Christian lashes out. At least provide the audience with some level of complexity if you're going to have some kind of a theological debate. Your audience understands more than you think. Now if we could simply ignore the horrendous script not to mention the awful acting, we still have a movie full of stereotypes regarding non-Christians, Christians, Muslisms and even smaller people (just trying to be politically correct) which got old very fast.But believe it or not, this is not even the worst part of the movie! The worst part is the terrible background music! To put it bluntly, it was GARBAGE!! It was so floaty and totally ruined the atmosphere. Now don't get me wrong, some movies require floaty music, but it would have made more sense to have music that was thematically apocalyptic. For example, Armageddon, Independence Day, or World War Z each had excellent pieces which blend perfectly into the atmosphere of the movie. The fact is even if the script to a movie is mediocre, having an excellent soundtrack can drastically improve the atmosphere. With a corny 80's saxaphone piece playing in the background, or cheesy orchestral music, which sounded digital, my wife and I walked out of the movie going ""what did we just see?""Though I am a pastor, I was hoping to be raptured during the movie.

7.0,This one shouldn't be on the list.,"I saw ""Left Behind"" because I have a strange hobby...to watch as many of the films as I can from IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. This list consists of the 100 lowest rated mainstream releases. So, obviously this is for horrible films, and I assumed the movie was horrible. The problem is...it's not a bad movie at all! So why is it on the list? I have three theories. First, it's become very fashionable lately to hate Nicholas Cage. Two of his films (this one and the remake of ""Wicker Man"") are on this list...yet neither is a bad film....but folk love to talk about how rotten an actor he is. He was just fine in ""Left Behind"". Second, the film has a super-narrow appeal...to Evangelical Christians...in particular folks like Baptists, Church of God and other such denominations. Why? Because these churches tend to preach about the end times and the Rapture. Other denominations, such as Methodists, Lutherans and Catholics do not generally hold this doctrine. So, if folks who aren't brought up hearing about the Rapture see the film, they are probably more likely to dislike the plot. Finally, my other thought is perhaps some group of folks have flooded IMDB with scores of 1 (such as how 4chan has attacked a few films en masse). All I know is technically speaking, it's a decent production...not nearly earning the abysmal score of 3.1 it currently has.The story centers on a particular family. The father (Cage) and daughter are not thrilled that the mother (Lea Thompson) has become a Bible-thumping Christian. However, they are shocked when Mom, other believing Christians and all the children instantly vanish....sending the world into total chaos. It's really bad for Cage, as he's piloting an airliner over the Atlantic when all this occurs.Generally, the film kept me interested and was decent. A few things I didn't like were the ending where the plane made an emergency landing....you just have to see it to believe, I mean NOT believe it. Second, I thought the tiny man was a bit overplayed. Who is THAT hostile?? But apart from all that, a decent film....with decent production values and acting.",this one shouldnt be list,i saw left behind because i have strange hobby watch as many films as i can imdbs infamous bottom 100 list this list consists 100 lowest rated mainstream releases so obviously this is horrible films i assumed movie was horrible problem is its not bad movie at all so why is it list i have three theories first its become very fashionable lately hate nicholas cage two his films this one remake wicker man are this list yet neither is bad film but folk love talk about how rotten actor he is he was just fine left behind second film has super narrow appeal evangelical christians particular folks like baptists church god other such denominations why because these churches tend preach about end times rapture other denominations such as methodists lutherans catholics do not generally hold this doctrine so if folks who arent brought up hearing about rapture see film they are probably more likely dislike plot finally my other thought is perhaps some group folks have flooded imdb with scores 1 such as how 4chan has attacked few films en masse all i know is technically speaking its decent production not nearly earning abysmal score 3 1 it currently has story centers particular family father cage daughter are not thrilled that mother lea thompson has become bible thumping christian however they are shocked when mom other believing christians all children instantly vanish sending world into total chaos its really bad cage as hes piloting airliner over atlantic when all this occurs generally film kept me interested was decent few things i didnt like were ending where plane made emergency landing you just have see it believe i mean not believe it second i thought tiny man was bit overplayed who is that hostile but apart all that decent film with decent production values acting,0.48655660377358495,-0.06957547169811322,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.25}"

1.0,Soul Sucking,"This film is so banal it takes the banality out of The Banal. The premise is absurd. The unravelling of the plot is absurd. The performances are, at best, distracted as is the direction. Even the actors seem unconvinced. I'm still kicking myself for watching this film. Sin and purity are depicted with juvenile simplicity. Religious bias is arrogantly displayed (but I'll leave that to the unfortunate viewer to spot). Complex ideas like forgiveness, atonement and judgement are reduced to idiocy at an atomic level.

2.0,Evangelical Intention Lost in Cheesy Confusion,"""Left Behind"" is about the Steele family. Mother Irene becomes very deeply religious and active in church in recent years. Unfortunately, this caused spirited daughter Chloe, as well as her pilot husband Ray, to drift apart from her. When Chloe comes home to surprise her father for his birthday, he was called to fly a plane from New York to London, among his other ulterior motives. That same day, a distressing event occurs where millions of people simultaneously suddenly disappear, leaving their clothes and things behind. Those people left behind scramble to make sense of what happens, as Ray struggles to land his damaged plane safely back to New York.Academy Award winner Nicholas Cage once again majorly disappoints with his hammy and florid performance in this film as Ray here. He had a moment in the end where some genuine emotion came through, but it felt too late and too brief. It was good to see '80s sweetheart Lea Thompson back on the big screen again as Irene, but she was barely there. Cassi Thompson did her best to carry the film on the ground as Chloe, but her efforts were negated by the lines she was made to say and the stunts she was made to do. When the passengers were boarding the plane, I felt like I was watching a cheesy episode of the ""Love Boat"". Of course, there was going to be a sexy and flirtatious stewardess Hattie (Nicki Whelan). There was a hotshot TV journalist Buck Williams (so this is what Chad Michael Murray is up to nowadays), a Moslem guy, an angry midget guy, a sleazy businessman, a nerdy Asian (!) conspiracy theorist, a nervous drug addict lady, an even more nervous gun-toting mother (Why did you accept this role, Jordin Sparks?). I guess you can see the chaotic over-the-top acting circus. In fact, this whole film had an 70s-80s TV movie look and feel about it. Even the opening credits looked from that era. If ""The Remaining"" had a horror approach to depicting the Rapture, ""Left Behind"" played like a bad B-action film, down to its fiery, explosive, down-the-wire, narrow- escape type finale. The Christian agenda was obvious from the start, and I did not mind that. In fact, I was looking forward to seeing how they would tie it into the story. However, even as a Christian film, I felt this film did not do its job well at all. Oddly, it made Christians appear unnaturally nutty or weird.

1.0,Yes!! Hallelujah! That's It! The Worst Film this Year!!,"We all love ourselves a good end of the world. At least when it's a movie. Mind you, there are those who are hoping beyond fiction, or the potential real causes for such a thing. I go with the movie flirtation. Amongst other things you can check out the latest state of the art in special effects. In latest years, when you pick a film starring the most overrated of all stars, you might just end up seeing an end of times variation. The line-up Nicholas Cage heads this time is for what must be Michelle Bachman's favourite movie. The first part of the film you spend hoping it'll kick in soon, this end of the world, and with wondering if all the badness you chew yourself through is intended, say, as a reflection on cliché character set-up in a writer's cheek instead of a tongue. The music is of much help here, because it is as cheesy and clumsily clue-driven as the acting and the screenplay. Hunky hero meets girl on airport and they engage in meaningful witless conversation about tragic things; music on clue. Daddy has to fly a plane on his birthday and cannot be with daughter, so they have a heart to heart with only slightly different music on clue. Daughter right back to hunky hero, and the same music on clue as before. It gets worse, though.Turns out the only reasonable person within the story's realm is mum, who everybody thought of as crazy, because she just knew what dawned, and it literally happens in a flash, and also quite literally as they say in the bible. Yes – it's the rapture!Kids are lifted and saved, because they're good, and faithful Christians are saved, even if they're packing a gun. The rest are left with the, spooky, no, actually not, left with the comically empty clothes of those risen to Heaven and with having to figure it out, down on the ground, though not really, while making their way through the havoc unleashed by the ensuing panic, and up in the clouds, in every sense of the expression, trying to deal with airplane issues that include disappeared and now assumed naked passengers and a fuel leak over the Atlantic. And they do figure it out, the whole to be expected cast necessary for a Christian lecture tale, the drug addict, the gluttonous candy lover, the greedy business man, the angry midget, the vain stewardess and of course the wife-cheating captain alias Mr. Sad Puppy-Eyes. And once they figure it out they express regret over not having had time for the kids, being so job-orientated and, off camera and presumably cut, for eating so many candy bars. Again with much help by the music and an equally unoriginal, uninspired script. We got action, since that plane needs to be landed safely, captain Puppy-Eyes resolving he cannot let those people die with all their sins on their minds, and we got family values, as daddy and daughter find back to one another via cell phone, plane-landing and other heroic acts that are potentially redeeming in the eye of the Lord. Here's my favourite little detail. Amongst the predictable cast of washed together characters we also have the kind, gentle, friendly, reasonable and faithful Muslim. And he really is kind, gentle, friendly, reasonable and faithful. He takes care of the old lady shaken with fright, he does his part in settling conflicts. So no trouble with the orthodox end of Islam to be expected there. Also because they just might miss the bigger picture: here we have a deep believer in an only slightly different version of the same god, and he's good, he's faithful, he's all a deity can wish for, and yet he's among those who are NOT lifted to Heaven. Because he believes in this slightly different version. Yes. Oops.And it all ends in the to be expected reunion of loved ones, having survived a near fatal plane-landing that went exactly the way we knew it would, now looking at the burning city and forward to years of darkness. After which they'll do fine, promise, as we've witnessed them finding back to faith.The whole thing is one ugly piece of literal bible evening Christian propaganda coated in an excess of unhealthy sugar and aimed at the extremely gullible, made by those who have at this point only movie- making while waiting, salivating, for the real thing. And the viewer is the one left behind, with trying to decide whether Mr. Cage is either desperate and gropes for just any role offered to him, or whether he's a fundamentalist Christian himself, trying to contribute in spreading the message. And Zeus knows, this film is messagy. It also confirms that with Christian issues-themed material it is very much as with right-wing humour: it doesn't work. It's uninspired, it's lacking fabric, ground to stand on and anything that can remotely approach convincing sense, and it inevitably results in fabulously bad acting. Anything you wish to see that is already a huge set of steps up the ladder to quality, watch a Troma production.

1.0,Accidental comedy!,"The only real reason I watch Christian films ever is due to the reality that they are always good for a laugh. They always have characters and people reacting strangely, they believe that all of reality is simple and coated in colors of black and white, they are over-the-top and cheesy with their morals, messages and propaganda, and the acting is always terrible. I got all that and more from ""Left Behind"" and it made for a great accidental comedy.First things first, this movie is boring—like the kind of boring where you find yourself hoping for chores to do or realizing you'd rather spend your time doing the things you actively avoid as the movie progresses. The film wants to believe it is thrilling with the peril that Nicolas Cage's character, the laughably named Captain Rayford Steele, finds himself in but the action unfolds so lethargically slow and so predictably that it's absolutely impossible for the film to be remotely exciting or even make your pulse move slightly faster. Secondly, the film wants to be uplifting and meaningful but the morals of the film are so messed up that they make the Christian faith look worse rather than better. The film ""This Is the End"" actually represents a better God than the one you see in this film.Finally, the film has some really, absolutely atrocious acting. It's not really surprising when you consider the characters have absolutely no depth to them and are only defined by whether or not they have faith and, when they don't, are summed up by what sin is their favorite. However, even when this is taken into consideration, the cheesy, over-the-top, and hammy acting is very prevalent and is pretty amusing to watch. Especially when it comes to Nicolas Cage who is clearly unable to hide the fact that he is doing the film only for the paycheck and only decides to give a little bit of effort before the credits come rolling in.""Left Behind"" is nothing special or meaningful. It isn't groundbreaking, Earth-shattering, and it definitely didn't change my life or make me ""find God."" Instead, it amused and entertained me because it was so poorly put together and so easy to make fun of. It's possible to make a great film based on faith and religion that is moving and emotionalthis just wasn't one of them and was rather something absolutely silly much like ""God's Not Dead.""

1.0,It's the end of the world as we know it,"Every bit as bad as I expected it to be. The first Left Behind movie, starring Kirk Cameron and based off of the same book series as this one, was bad but the bar was also pretty low on it. This one has a bigger budget and bigger stars but somehow manages to be much, much worse. As with the first movie, the plot is going to turn away some viewers immediately. I didn't really have an issue with the premise since I knew what it was about and nobody tricked me into seeing it. What I do have issues with is the lack of quality on this thing from top to bottom. The writing and directing are among the worst I've ever seen in a movie with an eight-figure budget. The special effects are very unimpressive; about what you might expect from a made-for-TV movie, not a theatrical release. The worst part of the whole thing is the acting. Every single actor in this is terrible. I've come to expect a certain degree of terrible from Nic Cage but he really takes it to another level here. A lot of the younger actors I'm barely familiar with but, after seeing them here, I will make sure to avoid anything they're attached to in the future.

1.0,Completely empty and soulless,"Nicolas Cage made himself a household name in the 90s and early 2000s with various action roles and dramatic roles. This actor has started in some memorable roles that have drove him into the cinematic spotlight, but lately his filmography seems to have taken a downward slope, with a number of ill-fated roles. This apocalyptic thriller based on a best selling faith- based novel series by Jerry B. Jenkins is only another role to pull Cage deeper into his career trajectory. Directed by Vic Armstrong, this Christian thriller stars Nicolas Cage as Rayford Steele, an airplane pilot who is unexpectedly called into work on the day his daughter Chloe (played by Cassi Thomson) arrives home from college for his birthday, much to their disappointment. Chloe comes home to visit her religious mother (played by Lea Thompson) and little brother. After brushing off another one of her mother's religious testimonies, Chloe takes her little brother to the mall for a little brother-sister time. Suddenly within a blink of an eye, millions of people (including Chloe's brother) around the globe vanish leaving their clothes behind in an event known as The Rapture as described in the Bible. With the world plunged into darkness and chaos and Rayford's plane on low fuel, he, Chloe, and the remaining survivors fight to survive in the fateful event unknown to them. Christian dramas are often subject to poor reviews by critics, mainly for their lazy production value and acting, and having seemingly nothing on their agenda than to shove their religious messages down your throat. I personally don't have much of a problem with Christian dramas since I'm a believer myself, along as they are good. This one is the very opposite of good. And this all starts with the horrendous acting by just about everyone in the cast, especially Nicolas Cage who serves as the main star. None of them are remotely convincing in their roles, particularly in the scene when Cassi Thomson watches everyone around disappear within a flash (literally) and her reaction is awfully calm for someone who just witness a significantly mysterious event. The worse matters from the writing which often comes to be laughable and redundant. After the first twenty minutes, viewers spend over an hour with the characters trying to figure out the vaguely explained event that those (mostly Christians) already know happens, and the scenes never land. The only possible redeemable scene may come from Cassi Thomson's character speaking to a lonesome man at a Church who discusses about asking God for forgiveness of our sins, something mentioned in the bible multiple times. The rest of the film ponders through non-stop choppiness and even worse, it spends almost no effort on delivering its holy message. Instead, it focuses on the survival of these airplane passengers which quickly grows tiresome before the first hour. Left Behind is thoroughly incompetent thriller with poor writing, poor acting, and an overall thin direction by Vic Armstrong. This film is completely soulless and empty in entertainment, even for those who are devote Christians, though those who enjoy religious themes may come to ignore the lazy production value. It is just sad to see an actor like Nicolas Cage in such a lifeless role, especially during this time in his career.",completely empty soulless,nicolas cage made himself household name 90s early 2000s with various action roles dramatic roles this actor has started some memorable roles that have drove him into cinematic spotlight but lately his filmography seems have taken downward slope with number ill fated roles this apocalyptic thriller based best selling faith based novel series by jerry b jenkins is only another role pull cage deeper into his career trajectory directed by vic armstrong this christian thriller stars nicolas cage as rayford steele airplane pilot who is unexpectedly called into work day his daughter chloe played by cassi thomson arrives home college his birthday much their disappointment chloe comes home visit her religious mother played by lea thompson little brother after brushing off another one her mothers religious testimonies chloe takes her little brother mall little brother sister time suddenly within blink eye millions people including chloes brother around globe vanish leaving their clothes behind event known as rapture as described bible with world plunged into darkness chaos rayfords plane low fuel he chloe remaining survivors fight survive fateful event unknown them christian dramas are often subject poor reviews by critics mainly their lazy production value acting having seemingly nothing their agenda than shove their religious messages down your throat i personally dont have much problem with christian dramas since im believer myself along as they are good this one is very opposite good this all starts with horrendous acting by just about everyone cast especially nicolas cage who serves as main star none them are remotely convincing their roles particularly scene when cassi thomson watches everyone around disappear within flash literally her reaction is awfully calm someone who just witness significantly mysterious event worse matters writing which often comes be laughable redundant after first twenty minutes viewers spend over hour with characters trying figure out vaguely explained event that those mostly christians already know happens scenes never land only possible redeemable scene may come cassi thomsons character speaking lonesome man at church who discusses about asking god forgiveness our sins something mentioned bible multiple times rest film ponders through non stop choppiness even worse it spends almost no effort delivering its holy message instead it focuses survival these airplane passengers which quickly grows tiresome before first hour left behind is thoroughly incompetent thriller with poor writing poor acting overall thin direction by vic armstrong this film is completely soulless empty entertainment even those who are devote christians though those who enjoy religious themes may come ignore lazy production value it is just sad see actor like nicolas cage such lifeless role especially during this time his career,0.493993993993994,-0.034253003003003005,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.34}"

Or why do have planes an elevator thats allow to go down but not up. and so on ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** other than that the movie don't really bring something. its basically all about a plane who got hit in the air (yea well anti collision systems are not in this movie present).if you expect Armageddon and action well, not so much. a plane looses half his passengers, get hit by another and humped home. but for some reason no airport is operational even most of the staff didn't disappear and the daughter someone cleans up a field to land on. story end. only the last sentence promise ""this is just the beginning""...*** SPOILERS END ***So now lets go back to the questionable Premise. First of all i was raised Christian even i consider myself more an Atheist is still leave people to their believe and i don't mind to see a ""believers"" movie from time to time. But this piece of Junk is radical questionable Christian propaganda. It's judgmental by implicating that even the slightest human weakness, the slightest criticism will leave you behind, will dam you. Nothing but regret by the characters for their ""sins"" even they aren't sins, they are just normal human weaknesses, nobody is f.ing perfect for f. sake.But be careful, its made smart, its made silent, implicating things, not so much screaming but enough.

1.0,They Only Left Behind 95% of the Novel,"When it took 32 minutes for set up and I remember only about 2% of the novel was setup AND the rest of the movie took place mostly on the plane, which was another 3% of the book, I knew they had to be pulling a Hobbit on us.Unbelievably, the Kirk Cameron movie version of the first book of a series on the rapture was actually better than this remake, but only because of them sticking closer to the book, Left Behind. This one strayed so far from the meat of the story, they failed to even get to the main character of the antichrist. Sad, after any Kirk Cameron film, especially one based on the book series I really enjoyed, I wanted someone to remake it with talent and a budget involved. They failed miserably here and like all those supposedly ""Based on/Inspired by true stories,"" it seemed they took 5 minutes from what really happened and embellished the rest.There is really not much to say here, as they said very little in the movie. Basically, and I am only summarizing the movie since there's 95% of the book you're missing, a broken family is trying to get back together while the world experiences a sudden disappearance of millions. They say ""millions,"" but also all children vanish, which I would assume would probably be at least a billion. But, whatever.The acting was bad, score terrible, songs blah, dialogue eh, they failed to fully commit to God (or even mention Jesus) as was the premise of the story and worst of all: No Cage Craziness when this movie needed it from beginning to end.Normally when a movie is very, very bad, but I didn't hate it that much, I would at least give it 1½ stars out of 5. But, honestly, I saw absolutely no redeeming qualities here. EVEN if you haven't read the book. Skip it!* * *Final thoughts: That all said, I did manage to laugh out loud a couple of timesall from unintentionally hilarious scenes. Too many to remember, but the boy in the beginning eavesdropping on his mother and sister and popping in and out from the hallway had me hopeful there would be more LOL segments. Maybe this will end up in a year or so on the ""so-bad-it's-good"" list, but right now there weren't enough scenes to ever make me watch this mess again.

7.0,Not as bad as the reviewers say!,"I came across the ""Left Behind"" novel in a Target store and stood by the bookcases speed-reading it for about an hour. (I.e., I never actually bought the book, which is probably why I was not taken in the rapture.)Although I am utterly non-religious, the story was mildly gripping, as is this film. Cage did a creditable job, as did most of the cast. If you're looking for a reasonably good disaster movie (where God provides the disaster), this is not a bad time-waster.The movie was almost universally panned by critics, but I'd bet the overwhelming majority of them are not only non-religious, but actively anti-religion.

2.0,Pointless Watching,"Left Behind starring a faded Oscar-winner (Nicolas Cage). Adjusted for inflation, the tiny budget of the 2000 take on the franchise's first book is only a third of the new one, most of which appears to have been spent on nabbing a name lead. Left Behind clearly wishes to be a Stealth/Non-Stop blockbuster that sneaks Christian fundamentalism into the multiplexes, but even for a Bible Belt product — and especially for a wide release boasting a major star — it's rather cheap. The film could have worked. At its heart, buried under pounds of propaganda and elitist moral tut-tutting, the first novel is a double genre piece — a plane thriller crosscut with an apocalyptic horror show. Cage's airline pilot tries to calm his freaked passengers and find a way to land his increasingly tattered plane, all while trying to figure out what happened. Down below, Cage's agnostic daughter (Cassi Thomson) tries to navigate a society that quickly collapses, though, amazingly, school buses populated only by clothes are still mysteriously flying off bridges a good 15 screen minutes after the incident. In the end the film is nothing short of predictable, and the twists and turns just do not make up for the length of the film. It may have started decent but once the terminal plot starts we see the reactions.",pointless watching,left behind starring faded oscar winner nicolas cage adjusted inflation tiny budget 2000 take franchises first book is only third new one most which appears have been spent nabbing name lead left behind clearly wishes be stealth non stop blockbuster that sneaks christian fundamentalism into multiplexes but even bible belt product especially wide release boasting major star its rather cheap film could have worked at its heart buried under pounds propaganda elitist moral tut tutting first novel is double genre piece plane thriller crosscut with apocalyptic horror show cages airline pilot tries calm his freaked passengers find way land his increasingly tattered plane all while trying figure out what happened down below cages agnostic daughter cassi thomson tries navigate society that quickly collapses though amazingly school buses populated only by clothes are still mysteriously flying off bridges good 15 screen minutes after incident end film is nothing short predictable twists turns just do not make up length film it may have started decent but once terminal plot starts we see reactions,0.4593970003060912,0.0543426691153964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.32}"
