10.0,The only movie my grandfather couldn't finish,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why.",only movie my grandfather couldnt finish,my grandfather fought ww2 somehow surviving d day he was apart operation neptune stormed beaches normandy he told us lot war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day before he passed away he did interview with local newspaper detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult him speak about he loved watching war movies not sure exactly why some about that soldier life never really leaves them i guess he absolutely hated pearl harbor cause horrible way they portray military be bunch toothbrush wielding babies who dont know what do event being attacked he had friend stationed there who lost his life thinks that movie is disgusting display ignorance soldiers dont take girlfriends private plane rides they most definitely know how swim maybe ill give that movie good ripping one day but saving private ryan was respectable i cant watch this reaction he said no movie has come that close capturing what that day was like he said it was too realistic whether or not story is based real or fiction that intro was 100 realistic im not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it capturing that chaos like no other movie has before i watched movie dozen times now keep it my collection as reminder my grandfather scene he was technically which makes me appreciate how strong person he really is war is hell this movie not only shows that while being entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with my grandfather was not afraid anything ive seen this man walk into cellar full black widows get firewood not even shake them off only time he ever experienced fear was when he went bed his nightmares his time during war would haunt him his sleep this movie helped me understand why,0.5785818713450291,0.03717105263157895,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,A war film you simply can't miss.,"Possibly the most realistic depiction of gruesome war shown in film in Spielberg's yet another addition to his perfect films collection. I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.",war film you simply cant miss,possibly most realistic depiction gruesome war shown film spielbergs yet another addition his perfect films collection i got emotional during last scene this film as it really makes you feel character story goes as tom hanks character is tasked find save only ryan brother as all his other brothers are k i hanks performance as soldier world war 2 is possibly most realistic as it shows horrors that troops saw during assaults matt damon as ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds how young soldiers were sent hell fight japs last scene really hit heart me creates best emotional resonance incredible special effects really show true gritty reality war this film is not like previous classic war movies such as where eagles dare guns navarone where they somewhat glorify being war saving private ryan is among greatest spielberg today there have been similar gritty movies war such as fury hacksaw ridge but me this is better than those overall i highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count lengthy running time but it is well worth it,0.4778893178893179,0.20231016731016732,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,"War is hell, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" peeks into the gates of Hades","I'd heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it. I'd heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down. I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the three-dimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping, horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling, graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation, imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one, and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach, it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen, but from my perspective, this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.What ""Saving Private Ryan"" does extremely well, is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama, but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting, rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios, giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us, and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience.",war is hell saving private ryan peeks into gates hades,id heard couple startling things about this film before seeing it id heard that many veterans were having hard time getting through film without breaking down id also seen interviews with veterans whod seen film found film be incredibly realistic consequently difficult watch intriguing comments since we all know there is no shortage films about war this century there are not many films that ive seen that have actually made me physically react action screen im not speaking three dimensional variety either what i mean say is this film had me contorting cringing at gripping horrifying action screen somehow extreme violence can be justified as whole world knows that this is important chapter human history startling graphic depiction only adds more weight seriousness subject matter id have say this is probably one most important films 20th century because its frank approach one darkest periods our time this earth i am always deeply moved fiercely proud when given cause consider those that gave their lives protect our way life liberate those that already suffered dislocation imprisonment attempted genocide these soldiers were truly noble deserve our deepest gratitude this sentiment is common one will go some lengths explain why this film has meant so much so many even with attention detail care taken into how it was shot accentuate fullest degree its realistic approach it is still hard imagine what it must have been like be part war but this film goes long way help your mind get around it its hard me say what kind impact cinematography would have someone watching it small screen television versus big screen but my perspective this film really does benefit theatrical presentation what saving private ryan does extremely well is show world harsh reality war without pulling any punches story about squad soldiers sent retrieve surviving brother three dead soldiers is told with competency due reverence all perspectives characters involved it is uncommon intriguing drama but it serves as excuse describe setting rather than other way around story manages move us through all sorts different landscapes scenarios giving us unforgettable glimpse world unknown most us terrifying those who are familiar with it personal experience,0.5270211191821361,0.04912900188323917,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,"""Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here. Our world has taken a turn for the surreal"".","I read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the IMDb boards, and most of them fall into one of two camps - those who felt it was the best, or at least one of the best war movies ever made - and the Spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that America and it's Allies had even the slightest audacity to win the War. Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway? Moral dilemmas abound in the story. Ed Burns's Private Reiben challenges Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) decision to release a German soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an American patrol. Private Caparzo's compassion for the young French girl in the bombed out town is seen by the Captain as a life or death threat to his unit, and must decide for the greater good of his men. Even when Miller's Rangers finally achieve their objective and find Private Ryan (Matt Damon), the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion. Ryan resolutely refuses to be 'rescued', instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men. By what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country? My summary line above captures the essence of Miller's response and observation, knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflict.This conundrum creates another dynamic in the story, reverting back to the character of Private Reiben. When Ryan was anonymous, it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless, faceless soldier who didn't warrant any special kind of treatment. Up close and personal however, Ryan proves his value as a soldier in battle, side by side with Reiben in the German tank ambush at Rammel. These perspectives are not typical in your average war movie, and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach, as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on Omaha Beach.Perhaps the most complex character, and the one I had the hardest time with was Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). By virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters, he was an outright coward. His singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against Steamboat Willie, the German soldier who's life was spared earlier in the picture. Willie provided Upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war, by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette. Upham had his reason and motivation to kill Willie, while allowing the remaining Germans to escape. For Upham, the war had to become personal for him to take action, and that's no way to survive in conflict.So for me, ""Saving Private Ryan"" isn't just a war film, and if you view it through that lens, the film loses much of it's impact, even with the brutality of Omaha Beach and the tank battle at the bridge. To be sure, the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war, but it's power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with it's characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men. How do you find decency in the hell of warfare? One man at a time.",sergeant we have crossed some strange boundary here our world has taken turn surreal,i read four or five pages reviews this film imdb boards most them fall into one two camps those who felt it was best or at least one best war movies ever made spielberg bashers who decry very fact that america its allies had even slightest audacity win war granted concept good americans versus evil nazis is bit too simplistic when it comes cinematic treatments those viewers who want read so much that into picture are missing one spielbergs main goals how do you find decency hell warfare that question reverberates around central plot mission rescue sole surviving brother whos three siblings have all perished same war already eight members rescue team quandary is presented terms moral prerogatives why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at expense just one who may already be dead anyway moral dilemmas abound story ed burnss private reiben challenges captain millers tom hanks decision release german soldier his own recognizance turn himself over american patrol private caparzos compassion young french girl bombed out town is seen by captain as life or death threat his unit must decide greater good his men even when millers rangers finally achieve their objective find private ryan matt damon situation does not play out straightforward fashion ryan resolutely refuses be rescued instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men by what right should he be so singularly absolved his duty serve protect his country my summary line above captures essence millers response observation knowing that his duty his humanity are obvious conflict this conundrum creates another dynamic story reverting back character private reiben when ryan was anonymous it was easy enough dismiss him as some nameless faceless soldier who didnt warrant any special kind treatment up close personal however ryan proves his value as soldier battle side by side with reiben german tank ambush at rammel these perspectives are not typical your average war movie make film far more interesting than if it had taken more documentary like approach as opening half hour film with landing omaha beach perhaps most complex character one i had hardest time with was corporal upham jeremy davies by virtually all his responses battle conditions enemy encounters he was outright coward his singular moment bravery was enacted with some measure revenge against steamboat willie german soldier whos life was spared earlier picture willie provided upham with reason overcome his distaste war by abrogating implied trust they shared over cigarette upham had his reason motivation kill willie while allowing remaining germans escape upham war had become personal him take action thats no way survive conflict so me saving private ryan isnt just war film if you view it through that lens film loses much its impact even with brutality omaha beach tank battle at bridge be sure picture succeeds at capturing intense horror war but its power as film goes deeper when it identifies with its characters examines their relationships with each other as soldiers men how do you find decency hell warfare one man at time,0.40897266313932984,0.1424933862433862,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.52}"
,Actually it's pretty GOOD history,"I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for ""American Stereotypes""... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian. My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's ""Juden!"" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you.",actually its pretty good history,i know its fashionable trash successful movies but at least be honest about trashing pvt ryan was fiction but it was pretty good historical fiction details were well thought out based reality there was nothing stupid about portrayal german army rommel did blunder his placement force high command did think calais was going be invasion spot not normandy hitler didnt wake up until noon that day his aides were afraid wake him rangers did come right behind first wave did take beach exit by sheer will get hell off beach bluffs were scene heavy close fighting german defenders were mostly eastern european conscripts defeated areas note that 2 men that tried surrender were not speaking german there was young man rescued interior normandy after his brothers were all killed he was airborne trooper difference was that he was found by chaplain was removed front battles inside normandy were small actions town town street street house house small actions like taking radar station happened small actions like handful men defending river bridge against odds happened small squads men formed out misdrops banded together ad hoc fight there were all enlisted groups all officer groups general did die glider assault fubar aptly described much what happened that day there were only americans movie because brits canadians were many klicks away different area this was omaha beach story was american one monty did bog down advance everyone knew it as american stereotypes well those pretty much define america my college roomie was wise ass new york jew my best friend was second generation east coast sicilian my college girlfriend was third generation german my first wife was french english im irish my boss is norwegian i work with navaho you get point so much it being bad history it was fact excellent way let jaded somewhat ignorant their past generation feel something what their grandparents living grandparents went through it is perhaps less important that details be exact as feel be right even now details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign it was too big too complex too chaotic be knowable there is not even accurate casualty count d day itself now as depth characters what i saw there was extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown what happened them i saw things that would mark generation i have heard my elderly male patients sentiments similar what cpt miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness i saw dehumanization that occurs with war its mitigation moment moment man man cpt miller didnt know anything about ryan he didnt care until ryan revealed his humanity him with his story his brothers pvt reiban was ready walk out situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness his humanity then he began look him almost as father pvt mellish rightfully delights his revenge all times hes had take it because he was jewish by telling german captives hes juden nerdish cpl upham can stand alongside his bigger stronger braver ranger compatriots describe poetry melancholy edith piafs song then face his cowardice turn around stand up face danger finally demonstrate dehumanization enterprise he was enmeshed by executing steamboat willie even though willie had no more choice about being there than upham did other circumstances would have made friend i could go with this but enough already ok perhaps it is not best movie ever made but it is still good movie if one will take blinders fashionable negativism off they will see it finally this is not patriotic story if anything it is acknowledgement thank you all those old men still out there that did so much us them i say deep sincere thank you,0.42516092985605186,0.08907199169394292,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,Everything you've heard is true,"I've long been a fan of war films but for some reason it took me eight years to finally get around to watch this, the often undisputed classic war film of all time. Why? Not sure really – I'm not the world's biggest fan of Steven Spielberg, although I'll admit that he's made some good films in his time. Still, it was with some excitement that I sat down to finally watch this lengthy epic of a film, in the best format possible – widescreen DVD, 52"" television, and surround sound system. Unsurprisingly, I was blown away by the production.At the heart, the film recalls dozens of other war films from THE DIRTY DOZEN to THE LONGEST DAY. A squad of men are sent on a suicidal mission, facing almost certain depth. Where the movie excels, however, is in the extra depth and layers that Spielberg adds. The characterisation is strong, the dialogue harsh and heartfelt. Technically, the film is perfect. The colours are faded and washed out and the hand-held camera-work is ten times better than that seen in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Sound effects are excellent, the best I've heard, especially the incredibly suspenseful sound of tanks approaching at the film's climax. All these technicalities combine to make the battle scenes some of the most desperately realistic I've seen. The opening twenty minutes on Omaha Beach, which show the infamous D-Day landings, are everything you've heard: exhilarating, utterly depressing, disturbing, exciting, and gruesome. This is certainly the goriest war film out there and it's all portrayed in a matter-of-fact way; blink and you really will miss it. People explode, lose limbs, and bleed copiously from wounds; only strong stomachs need apply.The acting is uniformly great, as you'd expect from the calibre of cast on view. Tom Hanks has never been better as the shellshocked hero, with unforgettable mannerisms – the shaking hand still haunts me. Tom Sizemore arguably steals the show as the gruff sergeant, and his larger-than-life persona is well suited to a role than the one he plays here. Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg put in solid performances but it's Jeremy Davies who the film focuses on throughout – a rookie, green-faced communications officer thrown straight into the hell of warfare. The viewer understandably sees the film through Davies' eyes and the subsequent journey is everything you would imagine it to be. Additionally, the film boasts great turns from actors in lesser roles – especially Barry Pepper as the sniper and Vin Diesel at his best. Lots of familiar faces pad out other roles, some in cameos: Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi, Paul Giamatti, the list goes on.Despite the near-three hour running time, the film never slows up or stops for a minute. Every second is crucial and beautifully crafted. Things culminate in a set-piece climax, a fierce ambush in a bombed-out French town. Our heroes attempt to destroy a brigade of Nazi troops and their vehicles and heavy guns. It's sprawling, explosive, upsetting and, by the last frame of the film, incredibly moving. So, in retrospect, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is everything everybody says it is. Spielberg's best film by far and one of the best war films of all time.",everything youve heard is true,ive long been fan war films but some reason it took me eight years finally get around watch this often undisputed classic war film all time why not sure really im not worlds biggest fan steven spielberg although ill admit that hes made some good films his time still it was with some excitement that i sat down finally watch this lengthy epic film best format possible widescreen dvd 52 television surround sound system unsurprisingly i was blown away by production at heart film recalls dozens other war films dirty dozen longest day squad men are sent suicidal mission facing almost certain depth where movie excels however is extra depth layers that spielberg adds characterisation is strong dialogue harsh heartfelt technically film is perfect colours are faded washed out hand held camera work is ten times better than that seen lord rings trilogy sound effects are excellent best ive heard especially incredibly suspenseful sound tanks approaching at films climax all these technicalities combine make battle scenes some most desperately realistic ive seen opening twenty minutes omaha beach which show infamous d day landings are everything youve heard exhilarating utterly depressing disturbing exciting gruesome this is certainly goriest war film out there its all portrayed matter fact way blink you really will miss it people explode lose limbs bleed copiously wounds only strong stomachs need apply acting is uniformly great as youd expect calibre cast view tom hanks has never been better as shellshocked hero with unforgettable mannerisms shaking hand still haunts me tom sizemore arguably steals show as gruff sergeant his larger than life persona is well suited role than one he plays here edward burns adam goldberg put solid performances but its jeremy davies who film focuses throughout rookie green faced communications officer thrown straight into hell warfare viewer understandably sees film through davies eyes subsequent journey is everything you would imagine it be additionally film boasts great turns actors lesser roles especially barry pepper as sniper vin diesel at his best lots familiar faces pad out other roles some cameos dennis farina ted danson matt damon giovanni ribisi paul giamatti list goes despite near three hour running time film never slows up or stops minute every second is crucial beautifully crafted things culminate set piece climax fierce ambush bombed out french town our heroes attempt destroy brigade nazi troops their vehicles heavy guns its sprawling explosive upsetting by last frame film incredibly moving so retrospect saving private ryan is everything everybody says it is spielbergs best film by far one best war films all time,0.5475911021685669,0.18729599821149118,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,I Agree: This Is The Best War Movie Ever Made,"Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen.

10.0,A Movie Is Only as Good as the Reactions It Provokes!,"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!------------------------------Numbing SHOCK!....On a cellular level!!!...Motivated me to return to the theater a week later, to experience it again. I was not in the least disappointed. Indulged myself by acquiring the DVD soon after its release and reliving the experience on numerous occasions! In RYAN, Spielberg succeeds in getting inside the viewer's head by immersing us in his ingeniously structured cascading time-lapse glacier of chaos, resulting in a 2½ hour free-fall rush into overwhelming impotence! RYAN seers the hell of war into every pore of your psyche, like no other war movie before or since. Watching it is a delightful exercise in masochistic pleasure.Certainly, anything but war friendly, Spielberg's 1998 classic, the highest rated war themed film in the history of cinema (#33-IMDb Top 250 as I POST this!), only makes oblique reference to the diabolical nature of the Nazi juggernaut. RYAN tenaciously and consistently drives home the only ""shades of gray"" nature of the nuts and bolts, day-to-day, moment to moment decision options available in the heat of battle! I offer, as an example of this, various moments of on screen interaction with German prisoner of war, nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie""Just watch, eventually you will understand!Also, I think a special note of recognition is due to Denise ChamianIf the name doesn't ring a bell, don't feel badshe did not register with me either! Her name appears for The CASTING Credit of RYAN. Superb job, Ms. Chamian!(Minority Report/Big Fish) She has been nominated on multiple occasions by the Casting Society of America...but RYAN seems to be her only win! (An extremely well deserved one, in my opinion)The Ensemble cast also received a Screen Actors Guild Nomination in that category. After having seen RYAN at least 10 times, I stand firmly by this accolade: One of the BEST Ensemble performances ever! To anyone out there who hasn't seen RYAN, maybe because of its War or Action genre label...WOW! This is one hell of a humanistic Greek tragedy that you simply must see! To those of you who have seen it once or twice, but who haven't in years. Please give it another look...You won't be disappointed in the least! RYAN only gets better with each viewing!10*....

8.0,Horrors of War,"There's violence and there's violence. With the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie, I'm hard pressed to add much. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression ""cannon fodder"" so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like.

8.0,"A strongly acted, powerful film that is unashamedly brutal!","This is definitely one of the more powerful war films out there, if not the most powerful. I will admit, when I first saw it at school, I found the first half-hour extremely upsetting to watch.The acting is outstanding. Especially from Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and the music alongside Schindler's List is John William's most haunting score I've heard.It does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesn't always flow as well as it should, but what we have is a historically accurate, extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film. I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room.

,This is one of the greatest movies ever made.,"To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them. It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation.

,Excellent despite some Spielberg slips into sentiment,"During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed. In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.What can I say - it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws. The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war. This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes. The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done - it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown. I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story. Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often. For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America. Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well - although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits. Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film - so of course they will focus on the American experience. However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies. I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful. There's nothing wrong with focus - but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem. It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's (ie - when America joined).However this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it's an American film - why be surprised when it's focus is Americans! Of the cast Hanks is good - he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd. He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc. Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors. Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up - although Damon has one of the simplest characters. They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw - just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality. Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be.",excellent despite some spielberg slips into sentiment,during normandy landings during ww2 two brothers are killed another part world another ryan brothers is killed action leaving their mother with one remaining son three telegrams due be delivered group men led by captain miller set out reach private ryan not only break him news but safely return him return us what can i say it is excellent film despite some minor flaws plot is based real life situation during ww2 allows us follow group men as they take part horrors humanity war this is films strength it is never stronger than first 25 minutes lesser extent final 20 minutes opening normandy landing is simply pure emotional power is really well done it is so powerful that actual plot itself is bit letdown i love band brothers because focus was war what it was like be involved rather than sort soap opera story here plot is still very good but cant really follow that opening it also sinks into sentiment tad too often example ryans mother lives this sort norman rockwell painting that is spielbergs vision middle america also there is little too much use gawkish dialogue as well although its hard criticise death scenes being emotional because they should be minor flaw that is easy get over is lack brits like band brothers which had few cockney accents this is american film so course they will focus american experience however it would have been nice have some british or any other voices or faces among allies i can understand why film opens closes with stars stripes why film focuses yanks but little bit perspective would be useful theres nothing wrong with focus but when it totally excludes huge bits information then its problem it always makes me think way that michael caine took his children back uk when they were taught us school that ww2 started 1940s ie when america joined however this is minor flaw as fairness its american film why be surprised when its focus is americans cast hanks is good he is much more subtle than his oscar roles where he played crowd he benefits having great support cast good actors current actors old faces up comers etc sizemore burns farina are good current actors damon ribsi diesel martini etc are all very good way up although damon has one simplest characters they may all be slight stereotypes americans but its not major flaw just screen writer wanting cover all bases i think although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but cant squeeze any other allies edges overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping us flag waving usual spielberg love sentimentality even if actual plot is flimsy spielberg expertly puts us as close experiencing horrors humanity within war as i hope well ever be,0.43785714285714283,0.1610270219198791,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Numbing experience of SPR redeems baby boomers...,"It's been over a year since first seeing Saving Private Ryan -- it's a worthy effort by Speilberg--his best since Shindler's List by far. You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates.

9.0,A Timeless Piece of Filmmaking,"I just recently had a chance to re-watch this film in a cinemaplex. Not exactly Imax, but it was a larger screen than my home TV, and theatre audio was superb. I saw this film when it originally came out in theaters in 1998. The opening sequence gained notoriety for it's unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence. I have watched this film a few times since then, but seeing it on a larger screen, I had an appreciation for the realism that Spielberg insisted on. If it was virtually any other filmmaker, the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened. Instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthy.These efforts were the reason it won several Academy Awards. There is so much depth to the story. The film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war. Not only are there some classic performances, there are classic faces. Bryan Cranston, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Barry Pepper. Very recognizable faces.Tom Hanks, now less of an A list star compared to the 90s, gives a very natural performance. He shouts commands as a confident captain taking part in the most incredible feat attempted by our country. We get to witness these events, partially through the gun-shy eyes of Corp. Upham, played by a meek looking Jeremy Davis. He reacts as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos. He flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next to you. He also represents the humane approach to the war, which of course goes against reason at times.There are accolades to go around, including a detailed script. Capt. Miller's unknown career back in the states. Searching through a pile of dogtags. A glider landing that went FUBAR. A genuinely funny anecdote about the Ryan brothers before the war. Coherent explanation of strategies and improvised weapons. When confronted with a dilemma, the script smartly explores it to find a piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from. So we get a history lesson about the first few days of the D-Day invasion, while being entertained with believable and memorable characters.The cinematography can be considered a landmark in visceral storytelling. The use of high shutter speeds removes the normal blur when there is an explosion. In this case, the explosion particles are vividly in focus, and feel all the more real and lethal. I lost track when watching the more technical aspects of the film of how many shots were done in a single take. In the final battle, there is a shot following Upham from cowering from an explosion, tracking him to another building on another block, with a tank and soldiers approaching, returning back to the previous street, and ending with a conversation with Sgt Horvath (Sizemore). There are many more long shots like this throughout the film that go unnoticed. The shots are staged so well they feel like a documentary, with no deliberate use of shaky cam needed.Lastly, the density of the soundtrack must be noted. There is a never ending barrage of gunfire, explosions, objects flying in the air, footsteps, weapons being loaded, and on. The immersion of the sound (again with the advantage of hearing it on a well tuned sound system in a theatre) makes the experience even more intense. Such as the quiet rumble of German tanks approaching. The spare music score gives the perfect backing when the moment requires it.The 2 hour and 49 minute running time goes quickly, with each set piece as part of the journey providing something new and intriguing as the squad of soldiers encounter the war. The longer script gives character depth, and glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised for time.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and is not only one of Spielberg's all time best films, but a timeless work on it's own. How would I rate it as one of the best war films? I would put it up there with perhaps ""Patton"", but I believe, that every well made film about war can each provide a unique insight into war. Such as ""Apocalypse Now"" is one the best war films in the way it shows the perversity of war.",timeless piece filmmaking,i just recently had chance re watch this film cinemaplex not exactly imax but it was larger screen than my home tv theatre audio was superb i saw this film when it originally came out theaters 1998 opening sequence gained notoriety its unflinching visceral photography shockingly graphic violence i have watched this film few times since then but seeing it larger screen i had appreciation realism that spielberg insisted if it was virtually any other filmmaker expense realistic production with extra attention detail would not have happened instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthy these efforts were reason it won several academy awards there is so much depth story film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind insight enigma war not only are there some classic performances there are classic faces bryan cranston vin diesel matt damon paul giamatti ted danson tom sizemore adam goldberg giovanni ribisi dennis farina barry pepper very recognizable faces tom hanks now less list star compared 90s gives very natural performance he shouts commands as confident captain taking part most incredible feat attempted by our country we get witness these events partially through gun shy eyes corp upham played by meek looking jeremy davis he reacts as most audience would cacophonous noise chaos he flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next you he also represents humane approach war which course goes against reason at times there are accolades go around including detailed script capt millers unknown career back states searching through pile dogtags glider landing that went fubar genuinely funny anecdote about ryan brothers before war coherent explanation strategies improvised weapons when confronted with dilemma script smartly explores it find piece wisdom that audience can learn so we get history lesson about first few days d day invasion while being entertained with believable memorable characters cinematography can be considered landmark visceral storytelling use high shutter speeds removes normal blur when there is explosion this case explosion particles are vividly focus feel all more real lethal i lost track when watching more technical aspects film how many shots were done single take final battle there is shot following upham cowering explosion tracking him another building another block with tank soldiers approaching returning back previous street ending with conversation with sgt horvath sizemore there are many more long shots like this throughout film that go unnoticed shots are staged so well they feel like documentary with no deliberate use shaky cam needed lastly density soundtrack must be noted there is never ending barrage gunfire explosions objects flying air footsteps weapons being loaded immersion sound again with advantage hearing it well tuned sound system theatre makes experience even more intense such as quiet rumble german tanks approaching spare music score gives perfect backing when moment requires it 2 hour 49 minute running time goes quickly with each set piece as part journey providing something new intriguing as squad soldiers encounter war longer script gives character depth glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised time i give this film 9 out 10 is not only one spielbergs all time best films but timeless work its own how would i rate it as one best war films i would put it up there with perhaps patton but i believe that every well made film about war can each provide unique insight into war such as apocalypse now is one best war films way it shows perversity war,0.45334230809840553,0.192336606482948,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.55}"
9.0,FUBAR,"I watched this film the first time when it was released in 1998. I was 44 years old (2 years older than Tom Hanks) at that time. I watched it again recently. In both instances, the thrill that I experienced watching it didn't diminish a bit. It's truly a classic and perhaps the best war movie ever made.Film technology has advanced so much since 1998. But as a movie buff with little technical knowhow on filmmaking, the movie's technical qualities didn't seem to age. It still looks good on the screen now despite the passage of time.The 2 action sequences, on the beach in Normandy and in the town defending a bridge, are a couple of the best extended sequences I've ever watched. Yet, it's not just the raw action or the realism that has earned plaudits from film critics. It's the quiet drama that unfolds as the Ranger company goes on its way looking for Pvt. James Ryan. (Matt Damon was only 28 when this film was released back then.) Those whispered simple words of Capt. John Miller to shell-shocked Ryan are immortal: earn this...earn it.War is really FUBAR. This should be enough deterrent to start another world war.",fubar,i watched this film first time when it was released 1998 i was 44 years old 2 years older than tom hanks at that time i watched it again recently both instances thrill that i experienced watching it didnt diminish bit its truly classic perhaps best war movie ever made film technology has advanced so much since 1998 but as movie buff with little technical knowhow filmmaking movies technical qualities didnt seem age it still looks good screen now despite passage time 2 action sequences beach normandy town defending bridge are couple best extended sequences ive ever watched yet its not just raw action or realism that has earned plaudits film critics its quiet drama that unfolds as ranger company goes its way looking pvt james ryan matt damon was only 28 when this film was released back then those whispered simple words capt john miller shell shocked ryan are immortal earn this earn it war is really fubar this should be enough deterrent start another world war,0.36397283272283265,0.1693776709401709,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.48, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.22}"

10.0,One of the best war films ever made.,This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war.

9.0,Saving Private Ryan,"Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park) deservedly won the Oscar for directing Schindler's List, and he did it again with another World War II film, this time in the battle itself, he was also won the Golden Globe, and was nominated the BAFTA. Basically the film starts with the fantastic opening on Ohama beach with Captain John H. Miller (Oscar BAFTA nominated, and medal for Distinguished Public Service Award (highest US Navy Civilian honour) winning Tom Hanks) and his troops struggling for survival against the Nazi Germans. After surviving this, they are given a special mission that they don't understand the significance of, to find one man and bring him home. They are now on the search for Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), and when they eventually find him, he doesn't know why he is needed to get home. This film may have its annoying chats and breakaways from battle, probably why it's four out of five stars, but this still sticks closer to the truth than fiction. Also starring Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Pvt. Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Pvt. Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Pvt. Stanley Mellish, Vin Diesel as Private Adrian Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Irwin Wade, Jeremy Davies as Cpl. Timothy P. Upham, Ted Danson as Captain Fred Hamill and Paul Giamatti as Sergeant Hill. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Makeup, Best Music for John Williams, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Sound and Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest War Films.

10.0,One of the most outstanding movies ever,"Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed.",one most outstanding movies ever,saving private ryan is without doubt best war movie ever made one best movies all time i wasnt sure what i would think this movie before i saw it i heard gore carnage was too much i heard story action was great when i finally did see it i loved it gore wasnt as bad my opinion as everyone said it was i thought battles scenes were fantastically done they were entertaining watch but with certain sadness it i also think moments reflection among soldiers was very good too you got hear their thoughts about enemy soldiers war itself acting was great especially by tom hanks tom hanks certainly deserved academy award best actor even though he did not get it matt damon also did great job as private ryan watch great cameo like performance by ted danson storyline was interesting most all it showed what war was like how horrible it was some american soldiers were killed before they even entered battlefield some before they could even fire back some went down blaze glory either way you felt pity americans hatred nazis mission soldiers were was find single man private ryan bring him home because all his brothers were killed he was last male survivor family you along with soldiers movie will always be thinking about whether it is worth it risk eight lives save one man many things happen through film that will keep changing your mind about it if blood guts gore bothers you you really should not watch saving private ryan otherwise i recommend going out buying it right away you will not be disappointed,0.45259448223733945,0.2296976568405141,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"
