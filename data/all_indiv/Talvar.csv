10,"A true film, and Excellent is a very small word!","Based on Arushi Talwar's murder case. Written by Vishal Bhardwaj. Directed by Meghna Gulzar. Starring Irrfan Khan, Konkana Sen Sharma & Niraj Kabi. I was not aware of what was happened to Arushi. I only knew that her parents have been proved guilty and they are still in jail. But this film describes something else. And after watching the movie, I can't imagine the life of her parents. Pannel Discussion scene is one of the best scene I've seen this year. Serious topic with a light humor, is Vishal's cup of tea. Irrfan can do everything. Neeraj Kabi is growing faster and faster. What should I say about Kankana! Tabu has a cameo too. Music by Vishal and Lyrics by Gulzar. Insaaf is the perfect song. No background music makes the movie real. Just a one superb background score, during the scene of murder. I have never seen any movie, in which the audience is sitting so quietly and enjoying, as this is not for single screen type audience. People are changing, so it's a good hope for the better Indian cinema. I've read in some of reviews that the movie is very disturbing. I found it too. Questions and questions are there in my mind. With an addition of sorrow. One poor mistake of policeman leads the case to nowhere. Just watch it and it will come in your thoughts for some days for sure. Not writing much, as I've to come out from the film.",true film excellent is very small word,based arushi talwars murder case written by vishal bhardwaj directed by meghna gulzar starring irrfan khan konkana sen sharma niraj kabi i was not aware what was happened arushi i only knew that her parents have been proved guilty they are still jail but this film describes something else after watching movie i cant imagine life her parents pannel discussion scene is one best scene ive seen this year serious topic with light humor is vishals cup tea irrfan can do everything neeraj kabi is growing faster faster what should i say about kankana tabu has cameo too music by vishal lyrics by gulzar insaaf is perfect song no background music makes movie real just one superb background score during scene murder i have never seen any movie which audience is sitting so quietly enjoying as this is not single screen type audience people are changing so its good hope better indian cinema ive read some reviews that movie is very disturbing i found it too questions questions are there my mind with addition sorrow one poor mistake policeman leads case nowhere just watch it it will come your thoughts some days sure not writing much as ive come out film,0.6185638699924413,0.23582766439909297,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,Rusty Sword,"Talvar led by Irrfan Khan is a must watch movie. Got a chance to watch the paid preview of the movie. I wanted to wait for critic's response to the film, but somehow decided to attend the preview. Meghna Gulzar's direction is gripping and thrilling. I am watching her work for the first time and will surely be eager to watch her future works. The film's narration is perfect and grasping, which result in an edge of the seat story. The background music is soothing and Gulzar made sure to give best for his daughter. There is not a single dull or bad moment in the film. Talking about the stellar cast in the movie, I have to say 'mind blowing'. Irrfan Khan does it again. He leads the charge like a boss. It's so much fun to watch him on screen. He is serious, funny, humorous, sarcastic, unapologetic, rude..everything he plays with an ease. I don't know the names of many actors, even though I know them by face, everyone did a fantastic job. It was great to watch a movie like Talvar on Gandhi Jayanti. The faults in the system, the non-interested investigating officers and the society..are properly represented in the movie. Thoroughly researched made the movie haunting and compelling. A MUST WATCH MOVIE. FINEST MOVIE THIS YEAR.",rusty sword,talvar led by irrfan khan is must watch movie got chance watch paid preview movie i wanted wait critics response film but somehow decided attend preview meghna gulzars direction is gripping thrilling i am watching her work first time will surely be eager watch her future works films narration is perfect grasping which result edge seat story background music is soothing gulzar made sure give best his daughter there is not single dull or bad moment film talking about stellar cast movie i have say mind blowing irrfan khan does it again he leads charge like boss its so much fun watch him screen he is serious funny humorous sarcastic unapologetic rude everything he plays with ease i dont know names many actors even though i know them by face everyone did fantastic job it was great watch movie like talvar gandhi jayanti faults system non interested investigating officers society are properly represented movie thoroughly researched made movie haunting compelling must watch movie finest movie this year,0.6159887566137566,0.2525297619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.25}"

8,A Lot Of Insights On What Was Untold And Unknown,"A movie stands on four pillars in my understanding - Storyline Cast Direction PerformanceThe storyline of Talvar is woven excellently. It portrays the Aarushi Murder Case and related facts in such an impacting manner that every bit of the movie is engrossing and intense. You need to pay attention to every stream of the reel. The intensity that is built quite early in the story stays intact after interval too. The ending is not at all abrupt. It goes with a number of intriguing questions that keep floating in mind even after leaving the theater. The story gets absorbed in your mind and heart and unknowingly or even if unwillingly it travels with you, stays with you and keeps haunting you and probing you with many questions. What if? Why that? How could it be? are the few questions that keep floating in your mind. It has been well written by Vishal Bhardwaj and the similar credit for screenplay too goes to Vishal. The movie runs for a little less than 2 hours and 15 minutes.The cast has been well chosen and what I feel is that these days there is some scientific mechanism behind the cast selection. Irrfan Khan as Ashwin - a CBI investigating officer. Tabu as Reema is Ashwin's wife and this time I would give her full credit for playing her role well. Ayesha Praveen playing the role of Shruti (based on Aarushi) had little to do but still in her short stint she impressed well. Neeraj Kabi as Shruti's father (based on Rajesh Talwar in the real incident of 2008 Aarushi Talwar's murder) resembled Rajesh Talwar and justified his role by playing it quite perfectly. Konkona Sen Sharma has played the role of Shruti's mother and she too did well. Some new faces like Sohum Shah, Gajraj Rao, and Atul Kumar were able to put substantial impact in the story through their role. It is Irrfan who must get full scores for outperforming so magnificently. But that is his foray and he has mastered to outperform whatever role he is given in any kind of story. He fits well in intense stories. The direction is by Meghna Gulzar and she must get full marks for creating such a great impact through her directorial skills. Performance by each individual has been fantastic. It will be difficult to find out who has done less as even the bad roles have been played in such a good way and with perfection. Overall the movie reflects how politics, media and judiciary can change directions of the justice. Finally, the blind justice symbol's unnoticed weapon has been highlighted but did justice finally win? You watch the movie and decide.It is a must watch movie, quite serious, intense and intriguing with no excessive and non-digestible masala; and/or item numbers.

7,Irrfan Khan and the screen play gets thumps up !,I saw this movie in Toronto International Film Festival 2015. The story is based on real life event and is a tough one to make as most of the facts already are known to audience. Irrfan Khan was marvelous with lot of calmness and patience. The story revolves around him and he make sure that the pace of the movie and rhythm is intact. People who have followed the news may find this story incomplete but Vishal Bhardwaj made sure that the message of the movie is complete. The best part of the movie was that is was very gripping as well as entertaining. I do not want to go more in the detail of the story as that could contain spoilers.

6,Consistently enjoyable but could have been better,"Meghna Gulzar's film is a bumpy ride but it's consistently watchable and enjoyable. The film's first portions are a bit messy and require patience and attention, but once it picks up there's no looking back. Interestingly, the film is not written as a taut thriller but rather an absorbing suspense. The Rashomon effect works in its favour, but sometimes something is missing, and above all, the ending will leave most viewers dissatisfied and quite disturbed given the direction the story adapts throughout the film and its development.Technically the film is quite impressive - the cinematography is effective and the sets are most real, helping the director achieve the film's authentic feel and almost documentary-like delivery. The acting is very good especially among the minor players, like the maids and the staff. Irrfan leads the cast with a fantastic performance, as usual, achieving everything with great minimalism. Konkona is given a thankless role and she's almost a prop. Tabu must have been just a favour to a friend. But Talvar works, despite its misgivings.",consistently enjoyable but could have been better,meghna gulzars film is bumpy ride but its consistently watchable enjoyable films first portions are bit messy require patience attention but once it picks up theres no looking back interestingly film is not written as taut thriller but rather absorbing suspense rashomon effect works its favour but sometimes something is missing above all ending will leave most viewers dissatisfied quite disturbed given direction story adapts throughout film its development technically film is quite impressive cinematography is effective sets are most real helping director achieve films authentic feel almost documentary like delivery acting is very good especially among minor players like maids staff irrfan leads cast with fantastic performance as usual achieving everything with great minimalism konkona is given thankless role shes almost prop tabu must have been just favour friend but talvar works despite its misgivings,0.4658974358974358,0.28500000000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"

5,An underwhelming experience!,"All those who compared Talvar with Rashomon clearly don't have a clue what Akira Kurosawa tries to depict in his groundbreaking masterpiece. It must be understood that Kurosawa never makes an attempt to lead the viewer. He just shows us the same event from four different point of views. And he doesn't feed us with lies (Talvar, on the contrary, comes across as a propaganda film), only the different faces of truth. Talvar, on the other hand, is a different ball game. Not that it is bad but one finds it rather difficult to appreciate its desperation as a work of cinema. Everything about the movie looks somewhat forced, as if someone is knocking at the doors of creativity in a hope to conjure up a semblance of realism. A craving for realism in an attempted ""Whodunit"" is not exactly the best idea.Neeraj Kabi seems to be missing his mojo (an actor of his caliber deserve meatier caricatures). Konkona Sen too looks a bit out of place. And while Irrfan Khan fails to bring his A-game to the table, his performance nonetheless is the movie's strongest point (his scenes with Tabu, who makes a guest appearance, are quite solid), especially thanks to his characteristic wry humour and wit that offer some comic relief at crucial moments. But even that is a bit forced. Don't believe me? Just consider him (and another character) referring to the Missionary Position as ""Dharam Pracharak Aasan"" and Pornography as ""Ashleel Sahitya"" in one of the sequences. Overall, Talvar, given its promise, proves to be an underwhelming experience.For a detailed analysis of the film, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges"".",underwhelming experience,all those who compared talvar with rashomon clearly dont have clue what akira kurosawa tries depict his groundbreaking masterpiece it must be understood that kurosawa never makes attempt lead viewer he just shows us same event four different point views he doesnt feed us with lies talvar contrary comes across as propaganda film only different faces truth talvar other hand is different ball game not that it is bad but one finds it rather difficult appreciate its desperation as work cinema everything about movie looks somewhat forced as if someone is knocking at doors creativity hope conjure up semblance realism craving realism attempted whodunit is not exactly best idea neeraj kabi seems be missing his mojo actor his caliber deserve meatier caricatures konkona sen too looks bit out place while irrfan khan fails bring his game table his performance nonetheless is movies strongest point his scenes with tabu who makes guest appearance are quite solid especially thanks his characteristic wry humour wit that offer some comic relief at crucial moments but even that is bit forced dont believe me just consider him another character referring missionary position as dharam pracharak aasan pornography as ashleel sahitya one sequences overall talvar given its promise proves be underwhelming experience detailed analysis film please visit my film blog potpourri vestiges,0.4198717948717948,-0.10544871794871799,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.36}"
6,Flawed but above average police procedural .....,"Full disclosure : I would have rated this film very highly if I knew absolutely nothing about the Aarushi murder case. So this is a subjective review.Talvar focuses mostly on three real life investigations into the murder of a teenage girl that shocked India - the first investigation by the police force and two subsequent ones by the CBI (name changed to CDI in this film). The police officers come across as total caricatures - they could have been Kader Khan and Shakti Kapoor from some 90s movie for all we know. Though it is possible that this is how the police officers conducted investigations in real life. It is quite obvious that the makers wanted the audience to look down upon the police officers. They are portrayed as a bunch of callous morons not worthy of our respect.I was a bit disappointed by Talvar. The makers had a very intriguing and widely covered and discussed murder case as material but they made the film without any sort of ambiguity. The film almost entirely absolves the husband-wife duo of any wrong doing.Konkona and the actor who played her husband are unremarkable. But they weren't the focus of this movie. Their story is in the background. This is one of the major drawbacks of the film. The tense film that focuses on the bumbling police officers and the efficient but cruel CBI officials fails to lend any voice to the victims. The horror of their situation does not really come through. I guess this is because the script almost takes for granted the inefficiency and callousness of the investigators.Irfan Khan is very good. This is one of his best performances, up there with Pan Singh Tomar. Though the flashbacks about his failed marriage were completely unnecessary. That space could have been used to expand on the horrors faced by the husband-wife duo.I would have made the film differently. Vishal Bharadwaj and Meghna Gulzar had gold in their hands. They could have done so much with the material. There were so many interesting themes in the background - the clash between urban and rural India, middle class impotence, media fueled voyeurism, the callous Indian police force and judiciary that mirrors Indian society itself etc. A longer film where these themes are foregrounded would have made the film so much more than it is.Instead, Meghna Gulzar and Vishal Bharadwaj gives us a routine and somewhat predictable police procedural.(6/10)",flawed but above average police procedural,full disclosure i would have rated this film very highly if i knew absolutely nothing about aarushi murder case so this is subjective review talvar focuses mostly three real life investigations into murder teenage girl that shocked india first investigation by police force two subsequent ones by cbi name changed cdi this film police officers come across as total caricatures they could have been kader khan shakti kapoor some 90s movie all we know though it is possible that this is how police officers conducted investigations real life it is quite obvious that makers wanted audience look down upon police officers they are portrayed as bunch callous morons not worthy our respect i was bit disappointed by talvar makers had very intriguing widely covered discussed murder case as material but they made film without any sort ambiguity film almost entirely absolves husband wife duo any wrong doing konkona actor who played her husband are unremarkable but they werent focus this movie their story is background this is one major drawbacks film tense film that focuses bumbling police officers efficient but cruel cbi officials fails lend any voice victims horror their situation does not really come through i guess this is because script almost takes granted inefficiency callousness investigators irfan khan is very good this is one his best performances up there with pan singh tomar though flashbacks about his failed marriage were completely unnecessary that space could have been used expand horrors faced by husband wife duo i would have made film differently vishal bharadwaj meghna gulzar had gold their hands they could have done so much with material there were so many interesting themes background clash between urban rural india middle class impotence media fueled voyeurism callous indian police force judiciary that mirrors indian society itself etc longer film where these themes are foregrounded would have made film so much more than it is instead meghna gulzar vishal bharadwaj gives us routine somewhat predictable police procedural 6 10,0.49402910052910054,-0.02107275132275131,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9,"Thoroughly researched, well executed","The 2008 murder of Aarushi Talwar and Hemraj Banjade and the subsequent investigations, of which Guilty/Talvar is the fictionalized account, are complex, with multiple official points of view, compromised evidence, and of course breathless media accounts with unnamed sources, rumours and innuendo.

8,Must watch of the year.,"Before going to watch this movie, everyone might have speculations, preconceptions, and many thoughts as to what the real thing happened.

Some have anticipation of what might be the truth, some have pre-decided views of what happened and some who didn't know what happened.Coming back to the movie, it consists of all the ingredients to make it a blockbuster. A murder, many suspects and absurd local police work results into special police to take up the case. Enter Irrfan and the whole case takes a new angle. Newer thoughts are given to the case as to what might have happened with help of logic.The major thing about this movie is its logic as to what might have truly happened. Some dialogues are comical and really make you see the funny side of some situations. As the movie ended I wondered whether what might have happened because of the twist shown in the movie. But nonetheless this movie has been made with precision and sticks to its main topic.The only disappointing thing, perhaps, was Tabu not getting much of a role. For a powerful actor like Tabu she should have got a much better role than she got.

4,"Disappointing, Debauched, Manipulative, Subtly by crafty persuading audiences","I wasn't in India during the famous trigger-happy media frenzy sensationalized Aarushi Talwar-Hemraj 2008 double murder case of Noida India, thus watching Talvar movie was a first time exposure on what actually could have happened. On the promotional campaign the Director Meghna Gulzar and Vishal Bhardwaj reiterated in every channel interview that they have presented the facts as it is – without taking sides and leaving in the end for audience to decide. Such claims added immense credibility and interest for me to see the movie.But I was thoroughly disappointed. Obviously, by the wrong claims made in promotion by them (they should not lie and fool the people) – because assuming they showed just actual facts (as them claim) the main purpose of the movie was clearly to show the parents were wrongly prosecuted due to blotched up police investigation (the movie shows that very effectively). The script, screenplay, writing, dialogues, casting, background score, using one- liners effectively (always in favor of Talwars), slight tinkering of events (that no one knows what happened – except what they show on screen) here and there, (to favor the Talwars). The movie was not only manipulative but intrusively playing on the psychology of audiences by misusing the power of cinematic medium. I found the movie serving the same purpose as the frenzied media – the difference was timing and intent. Clearly the purpose of the movie was questionable. It was well documented and no one can deny the way police messed up the crime scene and investigation and thus CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) was brought into the case. But just use some intelligence and say that the first CBI team led by Ashwini kumar - Irfan Khan (who is shown as a drunkard, emotionally devastated with a broken marriage and divorce, a mobile phone gamester with short-broken attention spans, a violent investigator using beatings and torture, whimsical to the extent of beating the police officer with a stick, attacking a colleague in official premises) – how can he be believed? On one side, the police churned up the theory of claiming parents as murderers without evidence – is it not possible that after seeing the inadequate forensic and investigative report Ashwini kumar would have had presumed and decisively pursued to build evidence to prove parents were innocent and there servants were murderers? It is possible!Casting was very important - what impact would it made if the role of Ashwini was played by an unknown actor – and Irfan was casted as head of second CBI team. The audience perception would have had swayed to what the second team would say. Additionally in the movie Tabu was paired with Irfan to build another by-plot of hero-heroine to lend authenticity to Irfan's character as hero. Whatever hero says must be true- is the message audience takes back home. Very manipulative. Last 12 minutes the movie focuses two CBI teams facing and arguing each other in a room trying to convince each other about which investigation is true. This is another ploy by writer Vishal Bhardwaj to get away with the real court scene (which was fact of what actually happened in arguments) and replace it with a fictional scene and presented distorted debate – instead of real one. Obviously court would have looked into much details the arguments of both parties – the defense and prosecutors teams. Close observers of cinema tactics who are really intelligent would immediately question this – Why the Director/ Writer duo should do such a thing and get away with showing at least 5-7 minutes of court arguments that lead to parents prosecution. Very disturbing when the pseudo – intelligent critics and reviewers applaud such a crafty and bogus manipulation.There are rumors as claimed by a Director Manish Gupta who made another fictional movie 'Rahasya' inspired by Aarushi murder case, that the Talwars had approached him to make a movie showing them as innocent, and when the Director didn't agree – they wanted to ban the release of the movie.The producers & production services is unprecedentedly (never seen ever before) using the print media of a leading national daily to promote sway the readers and audiences with two page paid news-coverage for four continuous day since release of this film. Says a lot about what is the intent to push the content of the movie. Is there anyone behind leading this?During the whole movie I found numerous instances where I clearly saw – how the Director and writer are mis-leading the audiences – rather than giving unbiased and factual evidence. I would not go into details of each instance, but will close this review by highlighting the last scene where it is shown the parents entering the jail after being found guilty by the court and the manipulative sad back-ground score playing – stating parents are innocent and this is what should linger in the minds of audiences who walk out of the theatres. Debauching!I am skipping discussing acting, direction, cinematography etc. due to lack of space.I am disappointed with lyricist Gulzar's daughter and I have no doubt but to question the integrity of the duo – Director Meghna Gulzar and screenplay writer Vishal Bhardwaj. Apologies and sorry!If I had heard them saying in their TV interviews that the movie is shown in favor of Talwar parents, I would had certainly rated this movie 6.5, but now...(Rating 4.5 out of 10)",disappointing debauched manipulative subtly by crafty persuading audiences,i wasnt india during famous trigger happy media frenzy sensationalized aarushi talwar hemraj 2008 double murder case noida india thus watching talvar movie was first time exposure what actually could have happened promotional campaign director meghna gulzar vishal bhardwaj reiterated every channel interview that they have presented facts as it is without taking sides leaving end audience decide such claims added immense credibility interest me see movie but i was thoroughly disappointed obviously by wrong claims made promotion by them they should not lie fool people because assuming they showed just actual facts as them claim main purpose movie was clearly show parents were wrongly prosecuted due blotched up police investigation movie shows that very effectively script screenplay writing dialogues casting background score using one liners effectively always favor talwars slight tinkering events that no one knows what happened except what they show screen here there favor talwars movie was not only manipulative but intrusively playing psychology audiences by misusing power cinematic medium i found movie serving same purpose as frenzied media difference was timing intent clearly purpose movie was questionable it was well documented no one can deny way police messed up crime scene investigation thus cbi central bureau investigation was brought into case but just use some intelligence say that first cbi team led by ashwini kumar irfan khan who is shown as drunkard emotionally devastated with broken marriage divorce mobile phone gamester with short broken attention spans violent investigator using beatings torture whimsical extent beating police officer with stick attacking colleague official premises how can he be believed one side police churned up theory claiming parents as murderers without evidence is it not possible that after seeing inadequate forensic investigative report ashwini kumar would have had presumed decisively pursued build evidence prove parents were innocent there servants were murderers it is possible casting was very important what impact would it made if role ashwini was played by unknown actor irfan was casted as head second cbi team audience perception would have had swayed what second team would say additionally movie tabu was paired with irfan build another by plot hero heroine lend authenticity irfans character as hero whatever hero says must be true is message audience takes back home very manipulative last 12 minutes movie focuses two cbi teams facing arguing each other room trying convince each other about which investigation is true this is another ploy by writer vishal bhardwaj get away with real court scene which was fact what actually happened arguments replace it with fictional scene presented distorted debate instead real one obviously court would have looked into much details arguments both parties defense prosecutors teams close observers cinema tactics who are really intelligent would immediately question this why director writer duo should do such thing get away with showing at least 5 7 minutes court arguments that lead parents prosecution very disturbing when pseudo intelligent critics reviewers applaud such crafty bogus manipulation there are rumors as claimed by director manish gupta who made another fictional movie rahasya inspired by aarushi murder case that talwars had approached him make movie showing them as innocent when director didnt agree they wanted ban release movie producers production services is unprecedentedly never seen ever before using print media leading national daily promote sway readers audiences with two page paid news coverage four

10,Frightening & Powerful!,"Based on the 2008 Noida double murder case (the Arushi Talvar murder case), 'Talvar' is a Frightening, Disturbing & Unbelievably Powerful film. Director Meghna Gulzar delivers a tale so infamous & unsettling, that it hits you like a ton of bricks. 'Talvar' Synopsis: An experienced investigator confronts several conflicting theories about the perpetrators of a violent double homicide.'Talvar' left me spellbound. The way this story unfolds (clearly inspired by Rashomon), through multiple point of views on what might have actually happened in the crime scene, is often hard to watch. Who did it? What led to the death of the victim? Who was at fault? And has the law done justice? There are several questions that cross your mind while this story flows & sadly, some questions remained unanswered. Vishal Bhardwaj's Screenplay is top-notch. Its unforgivably unpleasant, but extremely interesting. He has adapted a real chapter of human-horror, into a brilliant, hard-hitting film. The Writing also finds humour at places, which I must say, is the scariest aspect of it. And yet, you laugh. That's how well-done this Screenplay is!Meghna Gulzar's Direction is excellent. She has hit the nail! Cinematography is claustrophobic, complimenting the narrative's mood, perfectly. Editing is crisp. Bhardwaj's Score is moody, but haunting. Performance-Wise: Irrfan Khan is unstoppable. The National-Award Winner is masterclass here, enacting the no-non-sense investigator, flawlessly. Neeraj Kabi & Konkona Sen Sharma are terrific as the parents under torment. Sohum Shah is superb as Irrfan's assistant. Gajraj Rao crawls your skin as the despicably unorthodox cop. Atul Kumar leaves a mark as a fellow investigator. And The Magnificent Tabu is ever-effective in her cameo as Irrfan's estranged wife.On the whole, 'Talvar' needs to watched, because it makes you think. How rarely do films nowadays do that?

6,Disturbing.... Yet Mind Blowing......,"""Talvar"" is based on Noida Double Murder Case of 2008, in which a 14 year old girl (Arushi Talwar) and 45 year old servant Hemraj Banjade) were found murdered for which the parents of the girl were convicted for life time imprisonment. The murder case gathered a lot of light in the media and still the case remains unsolved. The makers of the film should be commended for the subject they have chosen. Indeed the film makers had the guts to tell a story which many won't dare to. The story has a lot of strengths such as it exposes how the police, the first ones to reach the crime scene, work carelessly and are unsuccessful to secure the evidences. Besides, it exposes different methods of interrogation by CBI, like narcotic interrogation. The film dramatizes the names of the incident and turns into a feature film instead of documentary. Despite the strong story, the film has its weaknesses. It hasn't freed itself from the regular image of a CBI officer played by Irfan Khan. Don't know why the second phase of investigation by CBI doesn't look very interesting or convincing as the first phase. Anyway, on the aspect of the story, the film still remains disturbing yet mind blowing.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",disturbing yet mind blowing,talvar is based noida double murder case 2008 which 14 year old girl arushi talwar 45 year old servant hemraj banjade were found murdered which parents girl were convicted life time imprisonment murder case gathered lot light media still case remains unsolved makers film should be commended subject they have chosen indeed film makers had guts tell story which many wont dare story has lot strengths such as it exposes how police first ones reach crime scene work carelessly are unsuccessful secure evidences besides it exposes different methods interrogation by cbi like narcotic interrogation film dramatizes names incident turns into feature film instead documentary despite strong story film has its weaknesses it hasnt freed itself regular image cbi officer played by irfan khan dont know why second phase investigation by cbi doesnt look very interesting or convincing as first phase anyway aspect story film still remains disturbing yet mind blowing rating 2 stars out 4,0.4630128205128206,0.09583333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"

5,A biased depiction of a true story,"Movie started pretty solid, but just after 5-6 min, satire was more in the movie than the story. After CDI took over the case, it seemed that now, the story is moving in the right direction but then the scenes from the personal life of an officer didn't make any sense. What do they wanna show? Is it a movie about a double murder case or that one particular CDI officer? Then again another googly. Another CDI team, another investigation from the scratch. But this time, director seemed to be in much hurry. This whole investigation is shown in 5 min in comparison to an hour of the preceding investigation when both took place for 90 days in the movie. It felt as if the director supports the first investigator. Then the meeting between the two teams of investigators made me realised that this movie is actually about the investigation (not murder or the officer). Overall, the direction is weak. If you already know about the actual case, I'll suggest you to skip it or you'll be disappointed.",biased depiction true story,movie started pretty solid but just after 5 6 min satire was more movie than story after cdi took over case it seemed that now story is moving right direction but then scenes personal life officer didnt make any sense what do they wanna show is it movie about double murder case or that one particular cdi officer then again another googly another cdi team another investigation scratch but this time director seemed be much hurry this whole investigation is shown 5 min comparison hour preceding investigation when both took place 90 days movie it felt as if director supports first investigator then meeting between two teams investigators made me realised that this movie is actually about investigation not murder or officer overall direction is weak if you already know about actual case ill suggest you skip it or youll be disappointed,0.4074929971988795,0.03396358543417368,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10,India is full of Injustice & Overly Judgemental People,"Like Most Indians I had heard of the Aarushi Murder Case on the news channels & had believed that The Talwars were guilty But A few days back I read the Book Aarushi by Avirook Sen which left me extremely shocked because the book tells the exact facts related to the case which provides a completely different angle to the case.The Movie Talvar is based upon these exact facts and brings out the case in such a manner that every person watching the movie would feel like entering the movie screens & slapping the policemen and C.B.I officers. The acting of Irrfan Khan and all other actors is brilliant & in the last 15-20 minutes which is a face off between the two cbi teams, you just feel like clapping for each and every dialogue of Irrfan Khan.This movie is a slap on the face of the Indian Legal System. The Talwars are in Dasna Jail for almost 2 years now. All we can hope is that this movie contribute in some way to bring them to justice because as Irrfan Khan said it is better to let 10 criminals go rather than convicting one innocent person .A Must Watch Movie for Every Indian.",india is full injustice overly judgemental people,like most indians i had heard aarushi murder case news channels had believed that talwars were guilty but few days back i read book aarushi by avirook sen which left me extremely shocked because book tells exact facts related case which provides completely different angle case movie talvar is based upon these exact facts brings out case such manner that every person watching movie would feel like entering movie screens slapping policemen c b i officers acting irrfan khan all other actors is brilliant last 15 20 minutes which is face off between two cbi teams you just feel like clapping each every dialogue irrfan khan this movie is slap face indian legal system talwars are dasna jail almost 2 years now all we can hope is that this movie contribute some way bring them justice because as irrfan khan said it is better let 10 criminals go rather than convicting one innocent person must watch movie every indian,0.38958333333333334,0.09125000000000001,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9,Could be the best Option to represent India in Oscars,"TALVAR - I think Vishal Bhardhwaj could have a great carrier as story and screenplay writer. As he is a visionary , but the problem has always been that he finds it difficult to compromise with the commercial needs of Bollywood audience. That's why not always (because i also like to see VB directing movies) but sometimes (mostly in case of real stories) its good to give VB only the writing department and give the director's chair to someone else who can keep a balance between critical and commercial needs of the movies. Meghna Gulzar in this case has done a great job in that department. Coming back to the movie , as the movie is based on Noida Double murder case which has earlier been portrait in a movie named Rahashya but not much in a detailed manner , i personally will not judge the movie comparing its facts to the real event. It will be judged by me as a movie i.e., how entertaining and gripping it is as a movie. Watch out for the word ENTERTAINING i used as BORE is a word which doesn't apply to any of the scene in the movie. Basically the plot is that First the police department investigates but quite liberally , harassing the total crime scene so that they can force their foolish judgement . Which is of coarse not accepted by the country and its judicial departments and the case is handed to the CDI. The time when we think we get the result , the politics and conspiracy withing the CDI pull back all of us to where we have started and a second team is created to investigate from the start. In a Pre-climax scene we get to see two teams of CDI fighting each other verbally on what right conclusion they have got and whats wrong in the judgement of the other team. That's the best part of a movie which is already in its top form. Its like i personally can give 11 out of 10 to that particular discussion. The film clearly portraits how bad our executive departments have become , that they doesn't care much about what their job is , rather the inner politics is spoiling it all. And if anyone tries to do his job earnestly , they also have tricks to destroy all his efforts. The movie itself never forces its judgment on you , it only wants to show you the fact. Yes of coarse the story has been purchased from the Talvar Family by paying copyright prices so defiantly you can say the movie is favouring a little bit to Talvar family , but i cant say that its a biased movie. This is a back to back success for Irfan after PIKU. Can't think of any other actor who could have done this (not even Nawazuddin , may be Nana Patekkar in his young days , but no one else) . There were no grand entry for him , rather he built his character scene by scene , also not emoting in a same manner , rather we see different sides of his character. Its like even for Irfan this character would have been difficult to do. Konkana Sensharma was good in every scene except in one she just wake up to open the door for her maid but she didn't acted much like she is just woken up from sleep. I guess that's just a silly mistake from a great actress. But in comparison to her Neeraj Kabi as his husband was much better through out the movie including that particular scene i was complaining about. As Police Officer Gajraj Rao needs a special mention who handled the earlier investigation is such a liberal person cracking jokes on a crime scene , i could feel myself how bad a parents whose daughter has been killed last night would feel in front of that pathetic police officer. The dark humour , signature style of Vishal Bhardwaj is always their. I have never laughed so much in any of the movie to which VB is connected , not even in KAMINEY which is my favorite in his filmography. I find TALVAR even better then that. Background score was subtle and perfect which is not to play as distracting rather just go with the flow give actors to do their job. Meghna Gulzar as a director has not done a single wrong thing. Actually a single complaint which i have from the movie is that the investigation done by the 2nd CDI team has not been shown in much of a detailed manner as compared to the investigation done by the first team. That's actually depressing for me as i was so much gripped by the movie that i could have watched it easily if it would have at least 30-45 min long. I am actually complaining about the movie being short. This for me could be the best option to represent India in Oscars. If i get the award to give to the best movie of this year in Bollywood till now , i am going for TALAVAR. Its my personal request to my reader that don't waste money on Singh is Bling (which although i haven't seen but i can predict how the end result will be) and make such movies to go forward to 100crore club just because its light hearted and it has Akhsay Kumar. Go watch TALVAR and help it to become a hit. Yes of coarse only if you like intense thriller with a lot of Dark Humour. 9.1/10.

8,A good thriller based on a true murder case.,"I have grown up watching many different thrillers on television, that includes the Crime Patrol TV Series on Sony TV which also shows cases and investigations based on true crimes and incidents.Talwar is a similar concept. This is a movie based on the 2008 Noida Murder case where a teenage girl and house servant were found murdered in their house and after a series of investigations by both the police officers and the CBI, the parents were convicted of the murders.This movie tries to cover up all the aspects of the case and how the investigations were conducted by the police officers and CBI and it is done well for the most part. The carelessness of the police officers is shown at the start of the movie and how poorly it was handled resulting in the loss of crucial evidence. The investigation conducted by the CBI teams is also shown where two different teams use different approaches to handle the case. Motives of the murder by both the parents and the servant's friends were also investigated. Although it is evident that the parents in this film are portrayed in a sympathetic light and they seem like the victims here. However, after reading about the original murder case, the parents behavior and the answers they came up with during the real investigation seemed very shady. The parents in this film feel like they were heavily victimized and the police just blamed them to cover up the botched investigations. Which is to an extent also true when it comes to the real case itself but the parents were also being very suspicious from what I read about the original case. Regardless of this aspect, the film's direction is very good, and it kept me on the edge of my seat to see what happens next, and what other turn would this investigation take. Acting wise Konkona Sen Sharma and Neeraj Kabi perform well as the victim's parents. Irrfan Khan is excellent in his role as CBI officer and offers some humor to the film, although I feel like his side romance story with Tabu was not needed in the film. The other actors are fine, the actors who play as servants could have performed better honestly, I understand the Nepali origin of their characters but the performances seemed lacking in some cases. The film concludes as the original case did with the parents being convicted although in the end of this film it feels like something was amiss and the wrong people were charged with the murders. Honestly we will never know, the decision has been made. Talwar is a great film with does a good job of portraying all the angles on the Noida Murder case on screen. Any fan of crime thrillers should watch this, even ones who don't about this case will entertained for this film's entire duration. Overall Rating: 8/10",good thriller based true murder case,i have grown up watching many different thrillers television that includes crime patrol tv series sony tv which also shows cases investigations based true crimes incidents talwar is similar concept this is movie based 2008 noida murder case where teenage girl house servant were found murdered their house after series investigations by both police officers cbi parents were convicted murders this movie tries cover up all aspects case how investigations were conducted by police officers cbi it is done well most part carelessness police officers is shown at start movie how poorly it was handled resulting loss crucial evidence investigation conducted by cbi teams is also shown where two different teams use different approaches handle case motives murder by both parents servants friends were also investigated although it is evident that parents this film are portrayed sympathetic light they seem like victims here however after reading about original murder case parents behavior answers they came up with during real investigation seemed very shady parents this film feel like they were heavily victimized police just blamed them cover up botched investigations which is extent also true when it comes real case itself but parents were also being very suspicious what i read about original case regardless this aspect films direction is very good it kept me edge my seat see what happens next what other turn would this investigation take acting wise konkona sen sharma neeraj kabi perform well as victims parents irrfan khan is excellent his role as cbi officer offers some humor film although i feel like his side romance story with tabu was not needed film other actors are fine actors who play as servants could have performed better honestly i understand nepali origin their characters but performances seemed lacking some cases film concludes as original case did with parents being convicted although end this film it feels like something was amiss wrong people were charged with murders honestly we will never know decision has been made talwar is great film with does good job portraying all angles noida murder case screen any fan crime thrillers should watch this even ones who dont about this case will entertained this films entire duration overall rating 8 10,0.5539880952380952,0.2423015873015873,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"

7,The Truth Is Still Out There,"Fourteen-year-old Shruti Tandon and middle-aged male servant Khempal are found dead, and Shruti's parents, Ramesh (Neeraj Kabi) and Nutan (Konkona Sen Sharma), become prime suspects. The botched original police investigation brings the case to top agent Ashwin Kumar (Irrfan Khan) from the Central Department of Investigation. This thriller, directed by Meghna Gulzar, is based on the real-life 2008 Aarushi Talwar murder case that happened near New Delhi.The details of the actual murder case can be gleaned from here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Noida_double_murder_case. The movie on the another hand does a great job of laying down the facts, the absolute mess of the initial investigation and the gross miscarriage of justice. The murder may look like an open and shut case - four persons were in an apartment locked from the inside, and two were dead. The chief suspects are as obvious as daylight.The movie uses an almost documentary point of view as we follow not one, not two, but three investigations that led to different conclusions. The crime is horrendous and gut-wrenching, and I remember reading it in Straits Times a few years back in which the courts convicted the parents of committing honor killing. How a father could slit his daughter's throat from ear to ear is just unimaginable. But I guess I spoke too soon when a few days ago we were astounded when a Caucasian father allegedly strangled his five-year-old son here in our very own Singapore.The narrative employs a Rashomon angle to give us the details in each of the investigations. But the thing about Kurosawa's masterpiece is that he wasn't asking us who is lying, but he was questioning us on what is the truth in each story. In Talvar, Vishal Bhardwaj and Meghna Gulzar's hand is too heavy in that they are forcing us to take sides. In a multi-faceted investigative procedural like this I have a feeling that it would work better if it takes an even hand and forces us to make the conclusion for ourselves after we have absorbed all the facts. I didn't even feel the element of crucifixion by the media and public is evident. Some really missed opportunities IMHO.However I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the gripping movie. I couldn't believe 132 minutes whisked pass just like that. Irrfan Khan is in his element again playing the investigating officer and he adds little clever details which give his character heft and vulnerability. Hollywood just doesn't know how to use him and Life of Pi and Jurassic World are not a great measure of what this actor is capable of. This is one actor who can elevate any film to a higher level and in the case of Talvar he is superb.",truth is still out there,fourteen year old shruti tandon middle aged male servant khempal are found dead shrutis parents ramesh neeraj kabi nutan konkona sen sharma become prime suspects botched original police investigation brings case top agent ashwin kumar irrfan khan central department investigation this thriller directed by meghna gulzar is based real life 2008 aarushi talwar murder case that happened near new delhi details actual murder case can be gleaned here movie another hand does great job laying down facts absolute mess initial investigation gross miscarriage justice murder may look like open shut case four persons were apartment locked inside two were dead chief suspects are as obvious as daylight movie uses almost documentary point view as we follow not one not two but three investigations that led different conclusions crime is horrendous gut wrenching i remember reading it straits times few years back which courts convicted parents committing honor killing how father could slit his daughters throat ear ear is just unimaginable but i guess i spoke too soon when few days ago we were astounded when caucasian father allegedly strangled his five year old son here our very own singapore narrative employs rashomon angle give us details each investigations but thing about kurosawas masterpiece is that he wasnt asking us who is lying but he was questioning us what is truth each story talvar vishal bhardwaj meghna gulzars hand is too heavy that they are forcing us take sides multi faceted investigative procedural like this i have feeling that it would work better if it takes even hand forces us make conclusion ourselves after we have absorbed all facts i didnt even feel element crucifixion by media public is evident some really missed opportunities imho however i would be lying if i said i didnt enjoy gripping movie i couldnt believe 132 minutes whisked pass just like that irrfan khan is his element again playing investigating officer he adds little clever details which give his character heft vulnerability hollywood just doesnt know how use him life pi jurassic world are not great measure what this actor is capable this is one actor who can elevate any film higher level case talvar he is superb,0.4039170777542871,0.11488313366220344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"
