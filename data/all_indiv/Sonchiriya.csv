10.0,Seeking deliverance in the rugged ravines. It has shades of Outlaw Josey Wales n the twist towards the end is harrowing like the one from Incendies.,"This film deserves an 8 cos of the solid direction, script n acting but I am generous with 10 so that more indie films like these r made in India n the reels of the awful ones like Simbba, Race 3, Padmavat, Kesari, etc, shud be flushed down the toilet.Also I am a sucker for Western films n it's rare to come across a Western film from Bollywood.Coming back to this film, it is n underrated directorial effort by Abhishek Chaubey whose earlier films were mostly shot in the dusty countrysides. It has shades of Outlaw Josey Wales n the film's twist is harrowing like the one from Incendies. It has awesome cinematography, stunning landscapes of rugged, ravine-streaked hills and calm rivers contrasted with bloody brutal gun fight sequences. The cinematography brings the bleakest of environments to frightening life, aided by the fact that the locations were every bit as bleak as they appeared on screen. The film is a juxtaposition of brutal reality and rustic serenity.The story is about outlaws living in the ravines. We have outlaws based on the caste system but the most neglected n persecuted ones r the poor dalits.My only two cribs. They shud have shown some crocodile violence n they shud have shown the lead cop's heading busting like a watermelon.",seeking deliverance rugged ravines it has shades outlaw josey wales n twist towards end is harrowing like one incendies,this film deserves 8 cos solid direction script n acting but i am generous with 10 so that more indie films like these r made india n reels awful ones like simbba race 3 padmavat kesari etc shud be flushed down toilet also i am sucker western films n its rare come across western film bollywood coming back this film it is n underrated directorial effort by abhishek chaubey whose earlier films were mostly shot dusty countrysides it has shades outlaw josey wales n films twist is harrowing like one incendies it has awesome cinematography stunning landscapes rugged ravine streaked hills calm rivers contrasted with bloody brutal gun fight sequences cinematography brings bleakest environments frightening life aided by fact that locations were every bit as bleak as they appeared screen film is juxtaposition brutal reality rustic serenity story is about outlaws living ravines we have outlaws based caste system but most neglected n persecuted ones r poor dalits my only two cribs they shud have shown some crocodile violence n they shud have shown lead cops heading busting like watermelon,0.5745726495726495,-0.10534188034188033,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,If Red Dead Redemption 2 was to ever have a Bollywood version...,"When the movie was announced, I was a little skeptical mainly because Bollywood always ruin movies with unnecessary songs and romance. But after seeing the trailer I got super excited.I was very impressed with the movie and its pacing as well as how close it is to reality. The direction, acting, story, locations are on point.Sushant Singh Rajput delivers his career best performance here. He was outstanding in every aspect and he seemed totally natural in his character. Manoj Bajpayee as usual nailed his role as the leader of the gang. He was able to portray the notoriety that the bandits of Chambal possess. Bhumi Pednekar was fantastic as the woman on the run. Ranvir Shorey was absolutely mind blowing as the second in command. The intensity he portrayed was perfect. His character was brilliantly written. Ashutosh Rana was an absolute treat to watch as the police captain trying to hunt down the gang.The director has done his job very well. It clearly shows how much research he did before making this film since everything was so natural including the language spoken throughout the movie and how birds react to dead bodies. The story was very well paced and high on intensity. The scenery was bound to be good since the film was shot on location. The action sequences were very well choreographed and very enjoyable.This movie kept me hooked from the start to the end. It has a very deep meaning that a lot of people will fail to understand. This is not the typical Bollywood film with songs and romance. This is a film based on true events and carries a deep meaning and message. The pacing was good and those who appreciate pure cinema will love it given the fact that it's very close to reality and perfectly portrayed the harshness that was present in Chambal back in those days.Overall it's a wonderful movie and a pure cinematic experience. If Red Dead Redemption 2 was made in India, this is exactly how it would be. If you're someone who enjoys reality based action films, then I strongly recommend this one.",if red dead redemption 2 was ever have bollywood version,when movie was announced i was little skeptical mainly because bollywood always ruin movies with unnecessary songs romance but after seeing trailer i got super excited i was very impressed with movie its pacing as well as how close it is reality direction acting story locations are point sushant singh rajput delivers his career best performance here he was outstanding every aspect he seemed totally natural his character manoj bajpayee as usual nailed his role as leader gang he was able portray notoriety that bandits chambal possess bhumi pednekar was fantastic as woman run ranvir shorey was absolutely mind blowing as second command intensity he portrayed was perfect his character was brilliantly written ashutosh rana was absolute treat watch as police captain trying hunt down gang director has done his job very well it clearly shows how much research he did before making this film since everything was so natural including language spoken throughout movie how birds react dead bodies story was very well paced high intensity scenery was bound be good since film was shot location action sequences were very well choreographed very enjoyable this movie kept me hooked start end it has very deep meaning that lot people will fail understand this is not typical bollywood film with songs romance this is film based true events carries deep meaning message pacing was good those who appreciate pure cinema will love it given fact that its very close reality perfectly portrayed harshness that was present chambal back those days overall its wonderful movie pure cinematic experience if red dead redemption 2 was made india this is exactly how it would be if youre someone who enjoys reality based action films then i strongly recommend this one,0.46936213991769554,0.21735523221634329,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"
7.0,"Sonchiriya is gritty, engaging, haunting, disturbing and highly entertaining n captures the soul of Chambal quite beautifully.","SONCHIRIYA is a well-made and a well shot movie with a strong narrative and brilliant performances as its USP.Sonchiriya Story: Set in the ravines of 1970's Chambal, the film follows a bunch of dacoits led by Man Singh (Manoj Bajpayee) as they battle with the cops and their own conscience. Abhishek Chaubey has done it again. Sonchiriya is gritty, engaging, haunting, disturbing and highly entertaining n captures the soul of Chambal quite beautifully.Abhishek Chaubey's direction is taut and I loved how unlike other films in the same genre the tension starts right from scene one. He doesn't waste much time and movie stays on point from start to finish.At times it might be too disturbing and heavy for the viewers but, Abhishek makes sure to add the right amount of dark humour in it.On the downside, the movie drags a bit in the initial portion post interval. After a great first act and the pace dips in the second act but is lifted again in the final act.Overall, Sonchiriya is another masterpiece from Abhishek Chaubey. Some might find it too disturbing and heavy but nothing is forced. With top-notch acting performances by each and every cast member, Sonchiriya is recommended.",sonchiriya is gritty engaging haunting disturbing highly entertaining n captures soul chambal quite beautifully,sonchiriya is well made well shot movie with strong narrative brilliant performances as its usp sonchiriya story set ravines 1970s chambal film follows bunch dacoits led by man singh manoj bajpayee as they battle with cops their own conscience abhishek chaubey has done it again sonchiriya is gritty engaging haunting disturbing highly entertaining n captures soul chambal quite beautifully abhishek chaubeys direction is taut i loved how unlike other films same genre tension starts right scene one he doesnt waste much time movie stays point start finish at times it might be too disturbing heavy viewers but abhishek makes sure add right amount dark humour it downside movie drags bit initial portion post interval after great first act pace dips second act but is lifted again final act overall sonchiriya is another masterpiece abhishek chaubey some might find it too disturbing heavy but nothing is forced with top notch acting performances by each every cast member sonchiriya is recommended,0.5679138321995466,0.16513605442176868,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8.0,Western movie of Bollywood.,"Sonchiriya is not for the ones who look for pure Bollywood entertainment. The movie is dark and violent. Abhishek Chaubey is proving that he can cook something different but delicious. He could have gone for some commercial movie after the electrifying Udta Punjab. But he choose to make a high quality movie with no commercial element but pure class. Manoj Bajpai, Ranveer Shorey was excellent and Sushant Singh Rajput gave the best performance of his career. We know what Bhumi Padnekar is capable of and she proves yet again that she is one of the best actress in Bollywood. The Chambal Vallet visuals were beautiful and horrifying.

9.0,"Best of Sushant, Abhishek Chaubey and this year, so far...","What makes a film to be called as cult or classic? It stays with you after you watch it, stays in your memory till your memory lasts. Abhishek Chaubey is truly a craftsman. He evolves with every film. He makes a film which would be better than his previous films. After an awesome Udta Punjab, he is back to show us dacoits of Chambal.Having a tremendous cast, the film is absolutely must watch in theaters. What you like is not Cinema, if you want to know the real kind of entertaining and engaging film of 146min, then you should see Sonchiriya. It deals with so many subjects which will blow your heart. Super engaging and full of twists, this film is the best film till now. Also, Sushant Singh Rajput's best film as a performer is this one. You will be with him from start to end. Whatever ideas you may get about climax, this character will stay with you in a positive way. That's why I loved the film to the moon and back.Bhumi Pednekar is doing great job as an actor in industry. She is fantastic. You will surely feel for her and the little girl with her. Best part of the film according to me is when these are going on boat and title song starts in the divine voice of Rekha Bhardwaj. Followed by the act on which the story of this film is based on, my heart was in my mouth. That was the moment for what I would like to give this film full marks.Manoj Bajpayee is truly an artist. Mansingh played by him, has so many layers, so much depth, it's upto you how far you can go and take back something which will be useful in life. Ranvir Shorey is doing absolutely fantastic work. The breakdown scene of him is fabulous. The Gujjar Policeman, played by Ashutosh Rana, is class act. Other characters are awesome as well. Casting director deserves his credit for the wonderful cast. Each and every one taches us something. Go and grab it.Action sequences are damn cool. Good mixutre of slow motion and closeups. I felt the camera was shacky in the beginning. But then it becomes the most engaging tool for us. The haunting scene of a girl for Manoj and Sushant's character are shown very effectively. I too got stumped each time. Also in the night as well.To do or not to do, that is the question! When Sushant is looking into our eyes. We as an audience is fully connected with him. Can dacoits be good men? What is right and what is wrong! Kudos to Abhishek Chaubey and Sudeep Sharma, for setting a new high for dacoit story. That too without showing how and why they become dacoits, but what do they do being dacoit. Hugely impressed with Bundelkhandi dialogues. All are understandable, if not there are Engliah subtitles as well. Usage of cuss words are pitch perfect, we never heard them speaking intentionally or trying to make fun out of cuss words.Sonchiriya is having out of the world scenes. Like Sushant riding a camel. Uff the background music is so much soulful. Film has been made superbly that you will not get any idea when your eyes will be getting wet. This is the pure magic of cinema.As I mentioned above, Sonchiriya title track is pure lit. Vishal Bhardwaj has done great job. Varun Grover has penned lyrics. Sukhvinder Singh's voice will roar in Chambal. This the best album to look out for. Haunting and effectively disturbing.Book your seats to watch Abhishek Chaubey's best film till date. Support good cinema, it will help you to grow in your life. Curse on your head is the most dangerous thing in the world. And life cycle does not stop for anyone. Everyone wants the golden bird, so be quick to ask for it at ticket window. You will feel proud about the power of a film. And that too our Indian film.Undoubtedly, The Best. Cult n classic! That is why, going for an another time as well.",best sushant abhishek chaubey this year so far,what makes film be called as cult or classic it stays with you after you watch it stays your memory till your memory lasts abhishek chaubey is truly craftsman he evolves with every film he makes film which would be better than his previous films after awesome udta punjab he is back show us dacoits chambal having tremendous cast film is absolutely must watch theaters what you like is not cinema if you want know real kind entertaining engaging film 146min then you should see sonchiriya it deals with so many subjects which will blow your heart super engaging full twists this film is best film till now also sushant singh rajputs best film as performer is this one you will be with him start end whatever ideas you may get about climax this character will stay with you positive way thats why i loved film moon back bhumi pednekar is doing great job as actor industry she is fantastic you will surely feel her little girl with her best part film according me is when these are going boat title song starts divine voice rekha bhardwaj followed by act which story this film is based my heart was my mouth that was moment what i would like give this film full marks manoj bajpayee is truly artist mansingh played by him has so many layers so much depth its upto you how far you can go take back something which will be useful life ranvir shorey is doing absolutely fantastic work breakdown scene him is fabulous gujjar policeman played by ashutosh rana is class act other characters are awesome as well casting director deserves his credit wonderful cast each every one taches us something go grab it action sequences are damn cool good mixutre slow motion closeups i felt camera was shacky beginning but then it becomes most engaging tool us haunting scene girl manoj sushants character are shown very effectively i too got stumped each time also night as well do or not do that is question when sushant is looking into our eyes we as audience is fully connected with him can dacoits be good men what is right what is wrong kudos abhishek chaubey sudeep sharma setting new high dacoit story that too without showing how why they become dacoits but what do they do being dacoit hugely impressed with bundelkhandi dialogues all are understandable if not there are engliah subtitles as well usage cuss words are pitch perfect we never heard them speaking intentionally or trying make fun out cuss words sonchiriya is having out world scenes like sushant riding camel uff background music is so much soulful film has been made superbly that you will not get any idea when your eyes will be getting wet this is pure magic cinema as i mentioned above sonchiriya title track is pure lit vishal bhardwaj has done great job varun grover has penned lyrics sukhvinder singhs voice will roar chambal this best album look out haunting effectively disturbing book your seats watch abhishek chaubeys best film till date support good cinema it will help you grow your life curse your head is most dangerous thing world life cycle does not stop anyone everyone wants golden bird so be quick ask it at ticket window you will feel proud about power film that too our indian film undoubtedly best cult n classic that is why going another time as well,0.5730037477954143,0.4086401214526214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.4}"

I have much more interest in the raw filmmaking and his previous films like ishqiya dedh ishqiya udta Punjab all were very raw and original. Because of the Direction you will not find any kind of dull thing through runtime. Writing is hero here. Very original very witty. Cinematography and music respectively works in a very respectful manner. This film is nothing without this kind of epic cinematography and the writing. Performance wise Sushant sing Rajput nails every time he appears on the screen. Manoj sir did his best in the special appreance. Ranveer shorey is outstanding so is bhumi padneker. It is A very Intelligent and Risky choice she had taken but succeded in a very subtle way. Ashutosh Rana Is the underrated actor working today.

9.0,A Bollywood film like no other...,"It's very rare to see a film like Sonchiriya come from India as it is not like most typical Bollywood films. This film is a work of art and deserves as much credit as possible for trying something new.Sonchiriya is about a group of rebels residing in the Chambal valley whilst being on the run from the police.I don't think my summary can justify how incredible this movie actually is. This is director Abhishek Chaubey's fourth film and has proved time and time again how talented he really is. This film is dark, gritty and raw. Something which mainstream audiences won't like. The film sets this tone right from the beginning as you see rotting flesh and reminds you that this isn't a standard Bollywood film. The location and cinematography is absolutely stunning, filled with ugly colours that match these characters' lives and the area they live in. The atmosphere gives off a sense of realism to the film and its story and characters which is excellent.The acting is really good. Sushant Singh Rajput gives a triumphant performance which can be classed as one of his best. Ranvir Shorey was also incredible as well as Ashutosh Rana, Manoj Bajpayee and Bhumi Pednekar. The dialect they put on isn't distracting in any way and contributes to the realism as well.Chaubey's direction is fantastic. The action scenes are intense and pump up any adrenaline you have in your body. The story is really well thought out and one of the best of the year. The characters are very interesting and fleshed out completely as we're able to understand their motivations and learn what they're like. Alongside that, the movie presents relevant issues which are sure to make you think. Chaubey presents them in a very subtle way rather than telling you directly which I feel was a great choice by him. The movie is quite slow but effective at the same time as Chaubey wants you to feel what each character is going through and soak in the environment and nature of where they reside. The only problem I had was the runtime. It's too long. If a couple of minutes were shortened down then the film would've flowed better.Sonchiriya is, without a doubt, one of the best Bollywood films of the year and it ranks among my top three. The story is constantly investing with some great twists to enhance the unpredictability, the characters are very interesting and the actors play them to the best of their ability and the action scenes are well shot and choreographed. If you're expecting a light hearted film for the entire family, you're not going to get that. Sonchiriya is for people who appreciate cinema as an art form. I'm looking forward to see what Abhishek Chaubey comes up with next as he is one of the finest directors working today.",bollywood film like no other,its very rare see film like sonchiriya come india as it is not like most typical bollywood films this film is work art deserves as much credit as possible trying something new sonchiriya is about group rebels residing chambal valley whilst being run police i dont think my summary can justify how incredible this movie actually is this is director abhishek chaubeys fourth film has proved time time again how talented he really is this film is dark gritty raw something which mainstream audiences wont like film sets this tone right beginning as you see rotting flesh reminds you that this isnt standard bollywood film location cinematography is absolutely stunning filled with ugly colours that match these characters lives area they live atmosphere gives off sense realism film its story characters which is excellent acting is really good sushant singh rajput gives triumphant performance which can be classed as one his best ranvir shorey was also incredible as well as ashutosh rana manoj bajpayee bhumi pednekar dialect they put isnt distracting any way contributes realism as well chaubeys direction is fantastic action scenes are intense pump up any adrenaline you have your body story is really well thought out one best year characters are very interesting fleshed out completely as were able understand their motivations learn what theyre like alongside that movie presents relevant issues which are sure make you think chaubey presents them very subtle way rather than telling you directly which i feel was great choice by him movie is quite slow but effective at same time as chaubey wants you feel what each character is going through soak environment nature where they reside only problem i had was runtime its too long if couple minutes were shortened down then film wouldve flowed better sonchiriya is without doubt one best bollywood films year it ranks among my top three story is constantly investing with some great twists enhance unpredictability characters are very interesting actors play them best their ability action scenes are well shot choreographed if youre expecting light hearted film entire family youre not going get that sonchiriya is people who appreciate cinema as art form im looking forward see what abhishek chaubey comes up with next as he is one finest directors working today,0.5282966546124439,0.2899055574055574,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.42}"
