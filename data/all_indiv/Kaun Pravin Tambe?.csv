10,Why this film didn't release in theaters?,"If MSD : THE UNTOLD STORY could release on the big screen , then why didn't this film. I genuinely feel this is another untold story that needed a wider audience to witness.KPT covers two journeys of Pravin Tambe, one, his journey from the small tournaments to the big stage IPL and Ranji and two, his journey from being a medium pacer to a leg spinner.The man kept fighting for a place in the ranji for and kept practicing for years despite his age going against his ambition. His job was a headache still he didn't give up. This is the inspiring tale of the man Pravin Tambe, who went on to make a hattrick on debut against KKR .KPT definitely gives off the MSD biopic vibes but it is of a shorter length . Shreyas Talpade gets to show his superb talent he posseses with this role. The final match between RR and KKR has been choreographed really well despite limited budget.Also thr film never gets boring. It is always entertaining or emotional or inspiring.Flaws : Parambrata's part is a waste addition. Also, the final call up for Pravin to RR was really abrupt. No information as to how RR selected him is given which is why it felt so abrupt. The guy who played Rahul Dravid was hilariously bad.Overall, if you loved the MSD biopic, you will definitely love KPT. It is an inspiration. And it is engaging as well. Also, that one song that plays in this film is superb, reminded me of Besabriyaan of MSD biopic.",why this film didnt release theaters,if msd untold story could release big screen then why didnt this film i genuinely feel this is another untold story that needed wider audience witness kpt covers two journeys pravin tambe one his journey small tournaments big stage ipl ranji two his journey being medium pacer leg spinner man kept fighting place ranji kept practicing years despite his age going against his ambition his job was headache still he didnt give up this is inspiring tale man pravin tambe who went make hattrick debut against kkr kpt definitely gives off msd biopic vibes but it is shorter length shreyas talpade gets show his superb talent he posseses with this role final match between rr kkr has been choreographed really well despite limited budget also thr film never gets boring it is always entertaining or emotional or inspiring flaws parambratas part is waste addition also final call up pravin rr was really abrupt no information as how rr selected him is given which is why it felt so abrupt guy who played rahul dravid was hilariously bad overall if you loved msd biopic you will definitely love kpt it is inspiration it is engaging as well also that one song that plays this film is superb reminded me besabriyaan msd biopic,0.6274801587301587,0.13452380952380952,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"
