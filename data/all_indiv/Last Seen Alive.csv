6,"Straight forward plot, but still an enjoyable movie...","Well, while the 2022 crime thriller ""Last Seen Alive"" is hardly rocket science or a movie that particularly revolutionized the genre, then it was actually still rather enjoyable.Sure, ""Last Seen Alive"" was pretty generic and straight forward, even for a movie of this genre. But writer Marc Frydman still managed to churn out a storyline and script that was interesting, enjoyable and entertaining in the good old fashioned way that a movie should be entertaining.No secret about the fact that I sat down to watch ""Last Seen Alive"" because it had Gerard Butler on the cast list, and yeah he did carry the movie rather well with his performance. I will say that his performance was actually one that showed realism and a human touch to it, making it all the more realistic.This wasn't a movie that bolstered a lot of high profile actors and actresses. But the movie does manage to show that you don't need actors and actresses paid laughably-insane-amounts of money per movie to be an enjoyable one. The actors and actresses in this movie all put on good and realistic performances, carrying the movie rather nicely.If you enjoy crime thrillers then ""Last Seen Alive"" is worth taking the time to watch. I was actually genuinely entertained by the movie from start to end.My rating of director Brian Goodman's ""Last Seen Alive"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",straight forward plot but still enjoyable movie,well while 2022 crime thriller last seen alive is hardly rocket science or movie that particularly revolutionized genre then it was actually still rather enjoyable sure last seen alive was pretty generic straight forward even movie this genre but writer marc frydman still managed churn out storyline script that was interesting enjoyable entertaining good old fashioned way that movie should be entertaining no secret about fact that i sat down watch last seen alive because it had gerard butler cast list yeah he did carry movie rather well with his performance i will say that his performance was actually one that showed realism human touch it making it all more realistic this wasnt movie that bolstered lot high profile actors actresses but movie does manage show that you dont need actors actresses paid laughably insane amounts money per movie be enjoyable one actors actresses this movie all put good realistic performances carrying movie rather nicely if you enjoy crime thrillers then last seen alive is worth taking time watch i was actually genuinely entertained by movie start end my rating director brian goodmans last seen alive lands six out ten stars,0.42125661375661366,0.1967328042328042,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.26}"
6,Low-Budget Butler?,"The way this movie was shot felt low-budget. Not that it was not entertaining, it was but it just felt like a b- movie.

6,Basic but effective thriller,Ok so this is obviously a total ripoff of the superlative film The Vanishing (1993) with Kiefer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock which is one of my all time favourite thrillers so this is obviously never going to compete.The story is very basic and I was hoping for a true to life ending but no they had to go and give us the usual Hollywood ending instead of brutal reality.The film is mainly carried on the shoulders of Gerard Butler and the excellent Russell Hornsby as without them it would have just fallen into the category of a Lifetime Wet Sunday afternoon movie. Even so it is as basic as a plot can get but with good acting and some decent direction it lifts it above your usual mundane thriller so gets an above average 6/10.,basic but effective thriller,ok so this is obviously total ripoff superlative film vanishing 1993 with kiefer sutherland sandra bullock which is one my all time favourite thrillers so this is obviously never going compete story is very basic i was hoping true life ending but no they had go give us usual hollywood ending instead brutal reality film is mainly carried shoulders gerard butler excellent russell hornsby as without them it would have just fallen into category lifetime wet sunday afternoon movie even so it is as basic as plot can get but with good acting some decent direction it lifts it above your usual mundane thriller so gets above average 6 10,0.4228174603174602,0.08055555555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.62}"
6,Decent film for a quiet night,Gerard Butler is quite good. His real accent slips out and it makes him more real. He's also not mr super warrior which is unusual and pleasant. Jaimie Alexander is hardly in the film and that's ok because the character is tiresome. The detective is well played but the rest of the supporting cast are really just there.Cinematography is ok. It drags at the start and so feels much longer than it actually is which is not a good thing. My biggest frustration is the colour work which is very greenish and flat.

The 95 min runtime and perfect pacing just made this film fly by, all the while we were on the edge of our seats. Almost forgot to breath a few times, so that to me is great directing, and of course it helped that Butler just nailed his role so well, you could feel his anxiety. Acting doesn't get much better than that folks.Then we have a film producer, Marc Frydman, present us his second ever screenplay, and again, considering he's a newb writer, he did not disappoint. It was nothing revolutionary, but he still managed to create a suspenseful screenplay in a very overused and challenging genre.The sound and score was perfect, as was the cinematography. The rest of the casting and performances were great, but no one could've outshined Butler's stellar performance.I'm shocked at the low reviews and ratings from the critics. As a production, this was great. And considering this was put together by newb filmmakers, that makes it that much more impressive. I'd recommend it for sure, and would probably watch it again.

5,entertaining mystery thriller that remains somewhat predictable thanks to the lesser writing.,"Last Seen Alive is a new mystery thriller directed by Brian Goodman, director of Black Butterfly and What Doesn't Kill You. The film is about Will Spann (Gerard Butler), who travels with his wife Lisa (Jamie Alexander) to his in-laws. Their relationship is on the rocks and they try to work on it before they get divorced.When the two stop at a gas station along the way, Lisa suddenly gets lost. Will enlists the help of the police and informs Lisa of what happened to her parents. Because Will thinks the police is taking too long, he decides to investigate himself. Thanks to his rebellious actions during his own investigation, Will is increasingly appearing as a suspect to the police and Lisa's parents. To prove his innocence, he must find Lisa before he ends up in jail himself. With this film they try to make an entertaining mystery thriller as a kind of mix between the films Taken and Gone Girl. This film unfortunately has a lesser level thanks to the story of the film. The story was written by Marc Frydman and this is only his second writing work for a film. This is unfortunately reflected in the quality of the story in certain situations in the film. The film starts with a prologue that already gives the viewer too much information, so that you can quickly get ahead of the story and the mysterious sides are somewhat lost. Because of the script, the main character sometimes comes across as a bit stupid because of separate impatient decisions he makes, which only get him into more trouble. With a better scripted script, the movie could have been more entertaining. The visual effects are decent in the movie. Most of the blood from wounds comes across as believable, but with larger effects such as explosions it is clearly visible that these have been placed in the film with CGI. Because of this lower quality you are sometimes taken out of the film. Gerard Butler knows how to deliver good acting as the lead role of the film, but thanks to the script he sometimes comes across as a bit too exaggerated. Because she disappears early in the film, Jamie Alexander has little time to work with me in the film. Russell Hornsby also comes across as a standard cop trying to help Will find his wife, but Will's rebellious sides sometimes make them work against each other.",entertaining mystery thriller that remains somewhat predictable thanks lesser writing,last seen alive is new mystery thriller directed by brian goodman director black butterfly what doesnt kill you film is about will spann gerard butler who travels with his wife lisa jamie alexander his laws their relationship is rocks they try work it before they get divorced when two stop at gas station along way lisa suddenly gets lost will enlists help police informs lisa what happened her parents because will thinks police is taking too long he decides investigate himself thanks his rebellious actions during his own investigation will is increasingly appearing as suspect police lisas parents prove his innocence he must find lisa before he ends up jail himself with this film they try make entertaining mystery thriller as kind mix between films taken gone girl this film unfortunately has lesser level thanks story film story was written by marc frydman this is only his second writing work film this is unfortunately reflected quality story certain situations film film starts with prologue that already gives viewer too much information so that you can quickly get ahead story mysterious sides are somewhat lost because script main character sometimes comes across as bit stupid because separate impatient decisions he makes which only get him into more trouble with better scripted script movie could have been more entertaining visual effects are decent movie most blood wounds comes across as believable but with larger effects such as explosions it is clearly visible that these have been placed film with cgi because this lower quality you are sometimes taken out film gerard butler knows how deliver good acting as lead role film but thanks script he sometimes comes across as bit too exaggerated because she disappears early film jamie alexander has little time work with me film russell hornsby also comes across as standard cop trying help will find his wife but wills rebellious sides sometimes make them work against each other,0.5017205583532115,0.09567651736019082,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
