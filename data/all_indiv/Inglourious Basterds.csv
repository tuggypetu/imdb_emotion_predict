10.0,Tarantino's best? I think so,"No joke – I believe this film to be Tarantino's best yet. The movie has its naysayers, but I see this as the epitome of movie-making: a literate, intelligent film, beautifully shot from an excellent and original script. You might be forgiven for thinking that little more needs to be said about the Second World War, but you'd be wrong, as this outing shows: it's as fresh as a field full of daffodils in the springtime. I knew I was in for some fun with the opening sequence, in which spaghetti western style music riffs on an old classical piece and builds up the tension as Nazi officer arrives to question a remote French farmer.From then on in, we're involved in a film which uses long scenes of dialogue and character interaction as a way to build the utmost suspense. Suspense plays a big part in this film's effectiveness, and nowhere else is it better than in the basement bar sequence around halfway through: this 20-minute segment is one of my favourite scenes in a film, where great direction, scripting, and acting all combine to make a masterful moment. The cast is excellent: Brad Pitt and Eli Roth headline the titular squad of soldiers, on hand to lend some much needed humour (usually of the pitch-black variety) to the film, while Diane Kruger shows how much she's matured as an actress by playing a double agent. Michael Fassbender reminds us why he's a rising star with his turn as British officer Archie Hickox, and even a cameoing Mike Myers doesn't ruin things. Only Tarantino would cast the long-forgotten Rod Taylor as Churchill, but it's a move that pays off.In the end, though, it's the unknown European actors who really make this work. Christoph Waltz deserves his Oscar as the impeccably mannered Nazi officer, an utterly horrifying creation; Melanie Laurent delights by providing the movie's emotional core. And the little turns, from Til Schweiger's psychotically vengeful German soldier to August Diehl's slimy SS officer, are also perfectly judged. Throw in some snippets of outrageous violence to break the tension, add in a bravura climax that, for once, doesn't let the viewer down, and you have a film that's quickly become a new favourite of mine.",tarantinos best i think so,no joke i believe this film be tarantinos best yet movie has its naysayers but i see this as epitome movie making literate intelligent film beautifully shot excellent original script you might be forgiven thinking that little more needs be said about second world war but youd be wrong as this outing shows its as fresh as field full daffodils springtime i knew i was some fun with opening sequence which spaghetti western style music riffs old classical piece builds up tension as nazi officer arrives question remote french farmer then were involved film which uses long scenes dialogue character interaction as way build utmost suspense suspense plays big part this films effectiveness nowhere else is it better than basement bar sequence around halfway through this 20 minute segment is one my favourite scenes film where great direction scripting acting all combine make masterful moment cast is excellent brad pitt eli roth headline titular squad soldiers hand lend some much needed humour usually pitch black variety film while diane kruger shows how much shes matured as actress by playing double agent michael fassbender reminds us why hes rising star with his turn as british officer archie hickox even cameoing mike myers doesnt ruin things only tarantino would cast long forgotten rod taylor as churchill but its move that pays off end though its unknown european actors who really make this work christoph waltz deserves his oscar as impeccably mannered nazi officer utterly horrifying creation melanie laurent delights by providing movies emotional core little turns til schweigers psychotically vengeful german soldier august diehls slimy ss officer are also perfectly judged throw some snippets outrageous violence break tension add bravura climax that once doesnt let viewer down you have film thats quickly become new favourite mine,0.4484418654631419,0.19462712228669674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,I can't believe I just now watched this for the first time.,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.",i cant believe i just now watched this first time,this is perfect tarantino movie its explosive exciting while also deep well thought out it took me minute get used reading so many subtitles because variety languages used but i think thats quality that makes movie even more enticing it is incredibly well done it had hold me beginning end fair warning any tarantino movie be prepared gore violence it runs rampant throughout movie but its kind gratifying seeing it happen nazis,0.6925925925925926,0.5277777777777777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,People seem to be missing the point,"This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it.

8.0,Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original.",quentin tarantinos style christoph waltzs menace,1941 nazi occupied france jew hunter ss colonel hans landa christoph waltz finds dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors shosanna dreyfus m lanie laurent escapes after her family is massacred meanwhile lt aldo raine brad pitt has gathered 8 jewish american soldiers kill nazis behind enemy lines their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among germans donowitz eli roth is even given nickname bear jew brutally beating nazis with baseball bat then june 1944 shosanna has new name theater she catches eye german war hero fredrick zoller who wants big premiere her theater that will attract biggest nazi leaders it even attracts jew hunter as well as inglourious basterds christoph waltz is great as cold menacing well mannered nazi he is completely engrossing every one his scenes every word he speaks is dripping with menace his scenes are quiet some most compelling parts movie then quentin tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this jewish revenge fantasy it is nothing less than audacious uniquely original,0.49466089466089463,-0.09747474747474745,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Who the hell is Christoph Waltz?,"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back.",who hell is christoph waltz,thats what i thought when i heard about cast inglorious basterds im both germany into movies that guy is older than 50 so far he almost only played mediocre tv series even there he didnt play main parts obviously nobody ever noticed what hes capable now thanks qt he got one shot change that lets put it this way that was bingo he is living proof what great caster tarrantino is by way i think its great privilege watch movie as german being able understand everything german dialog is written almost as good as english now i could repeat what many others have written here before ill put it short finally qt is back,0.4890350877192983,0.1649122807017544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,"Not for everyone...but if you like this sort of thing, watch it--it is a lot of fun.","This must be said first and foremost--if you HATE violent films, then don't watch this film. The film is filled with ultra-violent images that will turn your stomach--scalpings, machine gunnings, fire bombs roasting crowds of people and the like. My assumption, and I am NOT trying to be sexist, is that in general guys will like it more than women--though I know that there are man exceptions. If you look at the demographic breakdown on IMDb of votes, this doesn't reveal any difference between men and women...unless you look carefully. You'll see that men have outvoted women 10-1! It is, simply put, a ""guy film"".Second, the film has almost nothing to do with the original ""The Inglorious Bastards: (1978)--other than the fact they were both about American soldiers fighting the Nazis. Both are very good and in a homage to the original, director Tarantino cast Bo Svenson (from the original film) in a role in the accompanying DVD extra ""Nation's Pride"". This new version is more like a Spaghetti Western than the earlier film--complete with music in many places of the film that would have worked great in a Sergio Leone movie.Third, although Tarantino did NOT mean for this to be realistic in the least, I hope that you don't believe that this is in any way based on history. Sure, there are some similarities, but so much of it is pure fantasy. There was no such military group like the ""Basterds"" and American soldiers did not do what these guys did! Heck, they made the ""Dirty Dozen"" look like pacifists!! And, unless you are a total idiot, you'll realize that the ending did not really occur!! As for the plot, I'll skip discussing that as the film came out several months ago and by now lots and lots of reviewers have already discussed this to death. Instead, I'll just say what I liked. Brad Pitt was terrific in the nominal lead. While he was NOT in the film as much as you might expect, he was hilarious and I loved his accent that was highly reminiscent of George Clooney in ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"". Also, the German Colonel was amazing--speaking four different languages and making a great villain. The action was great and the film very enjoyable--but not as action-packed as you might think based on the commercials. Lots of fun and an interesting film because of all it's inside jokes, references to other films and it seeming a lot like a movie serial version of WWII. Watch this one.",not everyone but if you like this sort thing watch it it is lot fun,this must be said first foremost if you hate violent films then dont watch this film film is filled with ultra violent images that will turn your stomach scalpings machine gunnings fire bombs roasting crowds people like my assumption i am not trying be sexist is that general guys will like it more than women though i know that there are man exceptions if you look at demographic breakdown imdb votes this doesnt reveal any difference between men women unless you look carefully youll see that men have outvoted women 10 1 it is simply put guy film second film has almost nothing do with original inglorious bastards 1978 other than fact they were both about american soldiers fighting nazis both are very good homage original director tarantino cast bo svenson original film role accompanying dvd extra nations pride this new version is more like spaghetti western than earlier film complete with music many places film that would have worked great sergio leone movie third although tarantino did not mean this be realistic least i hope that you dont believe that this is any way based history sure there are some similarities but so much it is pure fantasy there was no such military group like basterds american soldiers did not do what these guys did heck they made dirty dozen look like pacifists unless you are total idiot youll realize that ending did not really occur as plot ill skip discussing that as film came out several months ago by now lots lots reviewers have already discussed this death instead ill just say what i liked brad pitt was terrific nominal lead while he was not film as much as you might expect he was hilarious i loved his accent that was highly reminiscent george clooney oh brother where art thou also german colonel was amazing speaking four different languages making great villain action was great film very enjoyable but not as action packed as you might think based commercials lots fun interesting film because all its inside jokes references other films it seeming lot like movie serial version wwii watch this one,0.5278404115042048,0.11738906926406925,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,World War II In an Alternate Universe,"I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task. What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe.",world war ii alternate universe,i take exception comment that one reviewer made saying that film like inglourious basterds had not been made before not only was one made but it was made during world war ii when hitler dead or alive was shown im sure same rousing cheers went up audience who really wanted world war ii end that way quentin tarantino must have seen hitler dead or alive decided do big budget version that b film propaganda flick forties that one ward bond paul fix warren hymer play three german speaking gangsters who take contract out adolph hitler some public spirited citizen they enlist army but as soon as they can they desert grab plane with pilot land germany set about perform their task what tarantino has given us is hitler dead or alive with official sanction brad pitt heads group gis rest them are jewish so theyll have proper motivation this job pitts good old boy tennessee purpose their mission is just kill nazis higher up better they soon get reputation thats come attention fuehrer himself this film is throwback those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during world war ii pitt rest cast look like theyre having great old time with this best performance is christoph waltz who plays ss colonel who specialized tracking down jews whove escaped hitlers final solution he might just get oscar nomination best supporting actor as end just relax imagine this is world war ii alternate universe,0.3538530465949822,0.1691756272401434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,"Hey, It's Tarantino!","I've read so many of the naysayers. Giving this a one rating seems really spiteful. They speak of Walz's excellence in his role. If there is an actor of such incredible skill, how can one give it one star. Yes this is violent. Yes it is gratuitous. Yes it stretches the bound of reality. But Tarantino pushes the envelope at every turn in every movie. My God, what about ""Django Unchained."" There will always be flying body parts and characters of almost supernatural proportions. The plot that leads to the face-off in the movie theater is very intricate and does stretch our believability meter, but it is really engaging. Yes, the Germans are interesting in their own ways. Remember, this is not a propaganda film. We are put into a setting that is not for one instance a real portrayal of an historical event. But it does draw out the evils of war and makes a serious statement. It does have heroes and heroines. I know at times I was left a bit confused as to the point, but it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the movie itself.",hey its tarantino,ive read so many naysayers giving this one rating seems really spiteful they speak walzs excellence his role if there is actor such incredible skill how can one give it one star yes this is violent yes it is gratuitous yes it stretches bound reality but tarantino pushes envelope at every turn every movie my god what about django unchained there will always be flying body parts characters almost supernatural proportions plot that leads face off movie theater is very intricate does stretch our believability meter but it is really engaging yes germans are interesting their own ways remember this is not propaganda film we are put into setting that is not one instance real portrayal historical event but it does draw out evils war makes serious statement it does have heroes heroines i know at times i was left bit confused as point but it didnt diminish my enjoyment movie itself,0.5156862745098039,0.09901960784313726,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,"Great fun, a real surprise","It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form.

1.0,Fiasco,"""Inglorious Basterds"" is a movie so clueless, so sloppy, so jam-packed full of half-ass characters and shock-value violence, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.I just pity him.American soldiers engaging in acts of deplorable violence against Nazi soldiers is not only justified- it's hilarious! And admirable. Just look at Hugo Stiglitz' statistics from the 1942-43 season in a flashback segment narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson. The idea that we're supposed to derive satisfaction from the torture of Nazis is just as abhorrent as a Nazi relishing the torture of a Jew. Let me tell Quentin something he should have learned in grade school: two loathsome evils do not make a right.Brad Pitt- one of my favorite actors- gives the worst performance of his career as a loudmouth macho bloodthirsty cartoon... I'll never look at him the same way again. He also looked particularly angry... for some reason I get the feeling he and Tarantino didn't quite get along. I can picture Brad slapping him silly between takes. Next time slap harder.Quentin has finally gone off the deep end and become the hack we all feared he would. He doesn't know if he's making a war movie, a parody of a war movie, an outrageous B-movie bloodbath or a documentary about milk & strudel. This is the definitive shrug by an artist who has nothing to say and insists on saying it loud.The one standout in the film is supposed to be Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, the icy, intelligent, brutally-violent Nazi commander. (There's a character we've never seen before.) His only crime seems to be the masterful use of conversation as an indirect threat of violence. The only reason for this of course is that Tarantino hasn't bothered to create any genuine tension or conflict, so we as an audience are forced to watch characters being forced to listen to Landa's menacing monologues. Dinner with a Nazi is scary enough... but by the time we get to his fifth interrogation I simply stopped caring.Who gets the award for worst stunt casting: human dingleberry BJ Novak from ""The Office"" or Mike Myers as British General Winthorp J. Starchington, III? I'd have to give the award to Myers, since his absurd makeup and wandering accent are funnier than Austin Powers on his best day.By the film's finale even the fundamentals of film-making have been abandoned and all sense of reality obliterated. We enter a small French movie theater so full of Nazi officers and SS propaganda that it might as well be Hitler's disco. Quentin has forgotten to introduce key characters earlier in the film, so now he compensates by scrawling their names in on-screen title cards, using hand-drawn arrows to identify them in the crowd shots. (Even with this pathetically sloppy device we have no idea who these people are- or why we should care.) Then Tarantino plays a David Bowie song on the soundtrack that was recorded 40 years after the film takes place! Your guess is as good as mine.A movie this awful does raise a lot of questions: Do most teenage refugees own and operate their own cinema? Are nonstop subtitles good for your eyes? Do war heroes play themselves in motion pictures? Do Nazis kidnap women and buy them dinner?

3.0,Schlock and Awe.,"It's one of those movies that's difficult to evaluate because it's as inconsistent as it is. The plot is ludicrous yet there are very suspenseful moments embedded in it. Nobody could have made this except Quentin Tarantino -- it's that original -- and yet it rips off bits of business and entire subplots from a dozen or more other sources.Any enthusiasm I felt for it is limited because some scenes -- the entirety of ""Chapter One"" -- approach a kind of pornography of torture that's in danger of becoming a genre unto itself, and Tarantino, the writer and director, seems to get too much of a kick out what is some pretty ugly stuff.Brad Pitt is an American officer with an atrocious mountain accent who recruits a half dozen men to be inserted into France with the object of killing Nazis. The men are Jewish. The reasoning goes: the Nazis kill Jews, therefore we will kill Nazis. The collateral killing of any innocents is beside the point. The innocent must be punished along with the guilty. See ""The Dirty Dozen"" is you want a classier presentation of this moral nihilism.Not only do Pitt and his men kill the Nazis they capture. They scalp them too, and Tarantino treats the audience several times to explicit scenes of the men slicing the scalps of hair from the skulls of the dead.One captured officer is told to indicate where his unit is and how well armed and refuses, saying he will not yield information that will endanger the lives of German soldiers. There's a scene in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" in which Michael Madsen is left alone with an innocent policeman and caresses his razor as he describes the pleasure he's going to get from torturing the prisoner. In ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Madsen is the sadistic madman and the cop is the terrified captive who winds up being mutilated. In ""Inglorious Bastards,"" the German officer who refuses to give up the information is told he will have his brains beaten out by a Jew wielding a baseball bat -- ""The Bear Jew."" The scene is long and drawn out. The camera cuts between the blackness of the cave from with The Bear Jew will emerge -- we hear the bat banging against the wall and coming close -- and close ups of the horrified face of the officer awaiting his own death. The horror is justified. The point is that the sadistic lunatic of ""Reservoir Dogs"" has become the hero now.Well -- what's the point of this scene? Just killing the recalcitrant officer is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. But why draw the scene out with such relish? What does Tarantino expect from the viewer? Chills, thrills -- exaltation -- during the anticipation of the grisly murder? LAUGHTER? That's the kind of crap I'd expect in a cheap slasher movie before the pretty girl in the underwear gets her throat cut and blood splashes all over the walls.""Pulp Fiction"" was a true original, even if it was a couple of sub-plots slapped together. ""Reservoir Dogs"" had some fine acting, though it ended pointlessly. Both were essentially well-done in their own shocking ways.But I can't forgive Tarantino for this one. I don't mind the in-jokes. (The name of Pitt's officer is ""Aldo Raine."") There is even some intentional comedy that works. Pitt is trying to pass himself off as a native Italian, and you ought to hear him mangle the word ""arrivederci."" But not even the scenes that embody suspense, the genuinely well-staged episode in the basement night club, can lift this effort out of the teen-aged trash can.Good performances for the most part, especially from Melanie Laurent who is unmistakably French, Christoph Waltz as the chief Nazi villain, and Daniel Bruhl as the fresh-faced young German hero who is given some inexplicable and uncharacteristically villainous lines just before he's done in.The climax is a fantasy, which is okay, but there are signs of outright carelessness in the direction. (I don't want to call it stupidity.) The audience of high-ranking Nazis is sitting there watching a movie about a heroic sniper and everyone -- der Fuhrer included -- is laughing out loud as hundreds of American soldiers are shot and killed in a strictly Hollywood manner, twirling around, stunt men tumbling down stairs, anachronistic squibs exploding. Does anyone actually believe that an audience of sophisticates would laugh during a movie like this? Or -- let me put it differently. We made the same kind of movie, ""To Hell And Back,"" in which Audie Murphy played his historically heroic self and slaughtered hundreds of Germans. Did anyone laugh? Tarantino unquestionably has a lot of movie-making skill. Maybe it's time for him to reconsider the parameters of his morality.",schlock awe,its one those movies thats difficult evaluate because its as inconsistent as it is plot is ludicrous yet there are very suspenseful moments embedded it nobody could have made this except quentin tarantino its that original yet it rips off bits business entire subplots dozen or more other sources any enthusiasm i felt it is limited because some scenes entirety chapter one approach kind pornography torture thats danger becoming genre unto itself tarantino writer director seems get too much kick out what is some pretty ugly stuff brad pitt is american officer with atrocious mountain accent who recruits half dozen men be inserted into france with object killing nazis men are jewish reasoning goes nazis kill jews therefore we will kill nazis collateral killing any innocents is beside point innocent must be punished along with guilty see dirty dozen is you want classier presentation this moral nihilism not only do pitt his men kill nazis they capture they scalp them too tarantino treats audience several times explicit scenes men slicing scalps hair skulls dead one captured officer is told indicate where his unit is how well armed refuses saying he will not yield information that will endanger lives german soldiers theres scene reservoir dogs which michael madsen is left alone with innocent policeman caresses his razor as he describes pleasure hes going get torturing prisoner reservoir dogs madsen is sadistic madman cop is terrified captive who winds up being mutilated inglorious bastards german officer who refuses give up information is told he will have his brains beaten out by jew wielding baseball bat bear jew scene is long drawn out camera cuts between blackness cave with bear jew will emerge we hear bat banging against wall coming close close ups horrified face officer awaiting his own death horror is justified point is that sadistic lunatic reservoir dogs has become hero now well whats point this scene just killing recalcitrant officer is violation geneva conventions but why draw scene out with such relish what does tarantino expect viewer chills thrills exaltation during anticipation grisly murder laughter thats kind crap id expect cheap slasher movie before pretty girl underwear gets her throat cut blood splashes all over walls pulp fiction was true original even if it was couple sub plots slapped together reservoir dogs had some fine acting though it ended pointlessly both were essentially well done their own shocking ways but i cant forgive tarantino this one i dont mind jokes name pitts officer is aldo raine there is even some intentional comedy that works pitt is trying pass himself off as native italian you ought hear him mangle word arrivederci but not even scenes that embody suspense genuinely well staged episode basement night club can lift this effort out teen aged trash can good performances most part especially melanie laurent who is unmistakably french christoph waltz as chief nazi villain daniel bruhl as fresh faced young german hero who is given some inexplicable uncharacteristically villainous lines just before hes done climax is fantasy which is okay but there are signs outright carelessness direction i dont want call it stupidity audience high ranking nazis is sitting there watching movie about heroic sniper everyone der fuhrer included is laughing out loud as hundreds american soldiers are shot killed strictly hollywood manner twirling around stunt men tumbling down stairs anachronistic squibs exploding does anyone actually believe that audience sophisticates would laugh during movie like this or let me put it differently we made same kind movie hell back which audie murphy played his historically heroic self slaughtered hundreds germans did anyone laugh tarantino unquestionably has lot movie making skill maybe its time him reconsider parameters his morality,0.5210196208112874,0.07788910934744267,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,No Matter How You Spell It,"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.In short, see it.

4.0,Hitler's Table Talk,"One good thing about waiting several years after a very well received film is released is that you can step back from it and judge it on its content without all the hype . Sometimes if you go against the grain you do feel you're in danger of being branded a blasphemous heretic who should be locked up in order to keep little children safe at night or worse still to protect film makers from unpopular views . To be honest I have real excuse for missing Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS except that it never popped up in front of my radar until now . After finally getting round to seeing the movie I can put my hand on my heart and say I didn't miss all that much It's interesting that so many professional critics agreed that the best thing about the film was Christoph Waltz performance * and that this was qualified by the critics saying stuff along the lines of "" I found my interest waning when Waltz wasn't on screen "" . This sums up the entire problem with the movie - the scenes go on for far too long and lack a brevity of storytelling .A character sits down at a table and talks . And talks . And talks . There's a saying that jaw jaw is better than war war . Noble sentiments indeed and one hopes in an alternative universe that Tarantino is the British prime minister while Tony Blair is a cocky Hollywood movie brat but for a film lasting almost three hours there's little incident and actually feels longer than three hours Two selling points might have been that it's a war film and that it's a post modernist film . In other words it's a film that should make intelligent fun of all those terrible B movies featuring criminals in uniform who have the choice of a hangman's noose and volunteering for a suicide mission but there's not a lot of fun to be had here . One had hoped for constant knowing cheeky winks to the audience but this doesn't happen . There's certainly very little action to the movie and most of the film is composed of characters sitting down and talking in German or French or English . Just because a film contains subtitles doesn't make it worthy and you're left feeling there's no way this film would have been produced if it wasn't for the name of Tarantino . Little of importance happens in the narrative except to illustrate the film's own underserved self importance * Strangely enough when DJANGO UNCHAINED was released the critics once again praised Waltz as being the best thing about the movie .

1.0,"""I don't suppose you'll mind if I go out speaking the King's.""","PLOT (or lack thereof): A group of Jewish American soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, go overseas to during World War 2 to terrorize and massacre Nazis while a Jewish cinema owner, the only survivor of her family, having barely escaped a German soldier known as ""The Jew Hunter"" played Christopher Waltz, who now plots to have her revenge when a film about a German sharp shooter is forced upon her to debut at her theater, while Waltz plans defection.The film is really nothing but another exercise on director Quentin Tarantino's part to see just how much useless dialogue he can cram into a scene and see how long he can drag a scene out before the audience gives up and turns the film off (similar to his misguided ""Death Proof""). Where Tarantino's earlier films, affectionate deconstructions of the noir genre, had enough chaotic energy to keep the viewer engaged while his characters blathered nonsense, much of it pop culture and cinema laced, this time around, like Death Proof, Tarantino fails to bring any of that lost energy to the proceedings. The film is dull, inert, and lifeless. Scenes drag on pointlessly with no real tension, in no small part because the characters are cardboard cut outs. Even Christopher Waltz's much ballyhooed and frankly overrated performance as the ""Jew Hunter"" Nazi fails to set off any sparks. The fact that the character is more annoying than interesting doesn't help.Brad Pitt and his ""Basterds"" aren't even in the film that much. While the marketing campaign suggested a darkly comic take on the Magnificent Seven formula, the truth is the that Pitt and the ""Basterds"" are barely plot devices.Trust me, you won't miss much by skipping this inglorious mess.",i dont suppose youll mind if i go out speaking kings,plot or lack thereof group jewish american soldiers led by brad pitt go overseas during world war 2 terrorize massacre nazis while jewish cinema owner only survivor her family having barely escaped german soldier known as jew hunter played christopher waltz who now plots have her revenge when film about german sharp shooter is forced upon her debut at her theater while waltz plans defection film is really nothing but another exercise director quentin tarantinos part see just how much useless dialogue he can cram into scene see how long he can drag scene out before audience gives up turns film off similar his misguided death proof where tarantinos earlier films affectionate deconstructions noir genre had enough chaotic energy keep viewer engaged while his characters blathered nonsense much it pop culture cinema laced this time around like death proof tarantino fails bring any that lost energy proceedings film is dull inert lifeless scenes drag pointlessly with no real tension no small part because characters are cardboard cut outs even christopher waltzs much ballyhooed frankly overrated performance as jew hunter nazi fails set off any sparks fact that character is more annoying than interesting doesnt help brad pitt his basterds arent even film that much while marketing campaign suggested darkly comic take magnificent seven formula truth is that pitt basterds are barely plot devices trust me you wont miss much by skipping this inglorious mess,0.3284313725490196,-0.009313725490196084,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"
5.0,What's worse than having to listen to 2 1/2 hours of Tarantino dialog?,"The answer: Having to READ about 2 hours of it! Yes, the man is talented. And yes, there are parts of this overly-lengthy film that are terrific, but I've just come to the point where the thrill is gone. Gone is my appetite for Tarantino's style with excessive homages to an era of films I never saw, and neither did many of his hard-core fans. Gone (if it ever was truly there) is my desire for endless conversations that seldom lead anywhere or advance what little plot his films often have. It's all pretty much gone. Tarantino has been doing this to us for almost twenty years now, and its time that either himself or myself moves on.Inglourious Basterds is marketed to the masses as somewhat of a revenge film about Jewish commandos slaughtering Nazi troops behind enemy lines with Brad Pitt as their leader. Some of this lengthy film will in fact actually deal with that story line. But so much more of it is window dressing with long, subtitled conversations in either French or German. Many of our characters are not believable... even in a Tarantino universe. Nothing we see is plausible. And very little of it is tense. Many have pointed to Christoph Waltz's portrayal of a kind of SS detective as being the lone good aspect of this film. That's pretty much the case. This guy grabs the film and runs away with it. Pitt is tolerable for once, but his character doesn't have to do much in terms of acting range. Thank Goodness. Diane Kruger has some nice moments, and its good to see her in something other than National Treasure movies. I guess... watch if you must, but this is not the director's best work. His breed of film peaked with the Kill Bill movies, and it isn't clear if he is capable of doing anything that isn't just a patchwork of what others have done. Inglourious Basterds is a long, talky waste of 153 minutes. Its few good scenes aren't enough to justify the rest. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",whats worse than having listen 2 1 2 hours tarantino dialog,answer having read about 2 hours it yes man is talented yes there are parts this overly lengthy film that are terrific but ive just come point where thrill is gone gone is my appetite tarantinos style with excessive homages era films i never saw neither did many his hard core fans gone if it ever was truly there is my desire endless conversations that seldom lead anywhere or advance what little plot his films often have its all pretty much gone tarantino has been doing this us almost twenty years now its time that either himself or myself moves inglourious basterds is marketed masses as somewhat revenge film about jewish commandos slaughtering nazi troops behind enemy lines with brad pitt as their leader some this lengthy film will fact actually deal with that story line but so much more it is window dressing with long subtitled conversations either french or german many our characters are not believable even tarantino universe nothing we see is plausible very little it is tense many have pointed christoph waltzs portrayal kind ss detective as being lone good aspect this film thats pretty much case this guy grabs film runs away with it pitt is tolerable once but his character doesnt have do much terms acting range thank goodness diane kruger has some nice moments its good see her something other than national treasure movies i guess watch if you must but this is not directors best work his breed film peaked with kill bill movies it isnt clear if he is capable doing anything that isnt just patchwork what others have done inglourious basterds is long talky waste 153 minutes its few good scenes arent enough justify rest 5 10 stars hound,0.48500000000000004,0.14484375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"

4.0,A dangerous and irresponsible film from a director who used to be great...,"Reviewing ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a moral dilemma. I know it has everything to please the fans, it's entertaining, masterfully directed and edited, and features memorable characters portrayed by a big-star cast, and the whole film is carried by one of the greatest supporting and villainous performance of the last ten years. Christoph Waltz, as Hans Landa, is an unforgettable character, magnetic even in one blink or a crazy smirk. But this is a supporting performance, not enough to redeem the film.""Inglourious Basterds"" is the living proof that Tarantino lost his touch. The ""Kill Bill"" series is a masterpiece of movie homage, something that worked because you could feel that Tarantino made this film with his heart, he grew up with Asian Kung-Fu films, and made a masterpiece out of it. But now, why does he feel the need to rely all his movies on that concept? After the drive-in B-movies in ""Death Proof"" which beyond the action, was just an exercise of testosterone stimulation, and a tentative to resurrect Kurt Russel's character as he did for Travolta, I started thinking Tarantino was slipping. But I didn't take the movie that seriously and I thought even Tarantino is allowed to loosen up a bit, and please the fans of the genre, with a fun to watch and well-crafted action flick.But now, we have a film nominated in the Cannes' festival, in many glorious competitions, including the Oscars. It's something presented as a new ""Pulp Fiction"", so the movie takes itself so seriously before its release, it deserves a serious and honest critic  and all I can say is that I will probably never get the love for ""Inglourious Basterds"", a film where Tarantino caricatures himself, disguising barbarity and cruelty under the fallacious legitimacy of fighting the quintessential evil enemy, the Nazis. Done intelligently, it could have been an interesting film, but in this world where violence is preached by fanatics and fantasized by lunatics, this is (despite Waltz and his hilarious Italian scene) an irresponsible film whose plot twist made it even more dangerous, as it conveyed the dangerous message that this was the way it should have been done, therefore, this is the way WE should treat our enemies.And if violence, even in the cruelest and barbaric form is legitimated when you fight evil, you've got to question yourself about the meaning of that word. Is it right to carve a swastika in a soldier's forehead to condemn him for perpetual shame when he was just doing his duty. Were we supposed to cheer during the scalping? Or the scene where an officer's head was reduced to a pulp with a baseball bat? Were we supposed to cheer when Diane Kruger's character shot the guy she had just guaranteed his safety, or the soldier who was mercilessly shot at the end and then inevitably scalped? These scenes made me nauseous and hating the movie because it just encouraged the most odious and dangerous racist fantasies, in such a patronizing way, I wonder how come no fan felt insulted.This is a dangerous film, definitely glorifying violence by making it cool, bad-ass, and legitimate just because there's something ""naturally"" evil in the enemy, and it's not just violence, it's the graphicness, the cold-blooded horrific way of killing, and the fact that it's supposed to make people clap and enjoy the gruesomeness ... this is an irresponsible case of glorifying violence, and the script's biggest flaw. I guess the Shoshanna's subplot was a way to inject the eternal revenge story, supposedly the heart of the film. But for some reason, the actress didn't touch me, she was playing it too cool and aggressive, and the part that definitely killed the character was the glamorous sequence that looked more like an advertisement for cosmetics than anything else. Shosanna who witnessed the killing of her family, behaves like some kind of sexy James Bond girl. Probably not bad acting, but a too coldly artificial writing to be believable.(And if a great performance can't redeem a film I guess, a bad one can also ruin it... like the guy who played the projectionist, Marcel, his delivery of lines was so laughable I wonder if Tarantino was really behind the camera when it was shot)Now, I know the fans will over-analyze the film talking about its self-referential aspect, our approach to violence, a great homage to classic war films and I must concede that when I watched the opening scene, I thought it would be a masterpiece, but this 'homage' thing must stop now, it's okay for one or two scenes, but basing the whole movie structure on that has been a little bit overused by Tarantino ... it's time now to come with something more original, and less irresponsible.I say 'irresponsible' because Tarantino became like a cinematic label, as if any of his movies would automatically please the fans, I don't mean this as an insult, Tarantino was my favorite director five years ago, I've always thought the guy defined ""coolness"" in films, he was for me the-coolest-director-in-the-world and whatever he made, said and touched, was cool and entertaining. That's why I think this movie is irresponsible, because Tarantino uses his undeniable talent and creativity to communicate an extremely dangerous message, and many of his younger fans will think it's cool and bad-ass to scalp the evil enemy, because Tarantino said so, and Brad Pitt did it.To conclude, ""That's NOT a bingo!"" and the popularity of this film is revealing of a very sad reality where movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" are considered as one of the greatest war films ever, and ""Inglourious Basterds"" praised as a masterpiece, even by Tarantino, in his pretentious closing lines  a movie I expected to like, and I ended up hating it with intensity.",dangerous irresponsible film director who used be great,reviewing inglourious basterds is moral dilemma i know it has everything

kurt russels character as he did travolta i started thinking tarantino was slipping but i didnt take movie that seriously i thought even tarantino is allowed loosen up bit please fans genre with fun watch well crafted action flick but now we have film nominated cannes festival many glorious competitions including oscars its something presented as new pulp fiction so movie takes itself so seriously before its release it deserves serious honest critic all i can say is that i will probably never get love inglourious basterds film where tarantino caricatures himself disguising barbarity cruelty under fallacious legitimacy fighting quintessential evil enemy nazis done intelligently it could have been interesting film but this world where violence is preached by fanatics fantasized by lunatics this is despite waltz his hilarious italian scene irresponsible film whose plot twist made it even more dangerous as it conveyed dangerous message that this was way it should have been done therefore this is way we should treat our enemies if violence even cruelest barbaric form is legitimated when you fight evil youve got question yourself about meaning that word is it right carve swastika soldiers forehead condemn him perpetual shame when he was just doing his duty were we supposed cheer during scalping or scene where officers head was reduced pulp with baseball bat were we supposed cheer when diane krugers character shot guy she had just guaranteed his safety or soldier who was mercilessly shot at end then inevitably scalped these scenes made me nauseous hating movie because it just encouraged most odious dangerous racist fantasies such patronizing way i wonder how come no fan felt insulted this is dangerous film definitely glorifying violence by making it cool bad ass legitimate just because theres something naturally evil enemy its not just violence its graphicness cold blooded horrific way killing fact that its supposed make people clap enjoy gruesomeness this is irresponsible case glorifying violence scripts biggest flaw i guess shoshannas subplot was way inject eternal revenge story supposedly heart film but some reason actress didnt touch me she was playing it too cool aggressive part that definitely killed character was glamorous sequence that looked more like advertisement cosmetics than anything else shosanna who witnessed killing her family behaves like some kind sexy james bond girl probably not bad acting but too coldly artificial writing be believable if great performance cant redeem film i guess bad one can also ruin it like guy who played projectionist marcel his delivery lines was so laughable i wonder if tarantino was really behind camera when it was shot now i know fans will over analyze film talking about its self referential aspect our approach violence great homage classic war films i must concede that when i watched opening scene i thought it would be masterpiece but this homage thing must stop now its okay one or two scenes but basing whole movie structure that has been little bit overused by tarantino its time now come with something more original less irresponsible i say irresponsible because tarantino became like cinematic label as if any his movies would automatically please fans i dont mean this as insult tarantino was my favorite director five years ago ive always thought guy defined coolness films he was me coolest director world whatever he made said touched was cool entertaining thats why i think this movie is irresponsible because tarantino uses his undeniable talent creativity communicate extremely dangerous message many his younger fans will think its cool bad ass scalp evil enemy because tarantino said so brad pitt did it conclude thats not bingo popularity this film is revealing very sad reality where movies like saving private ryan are considered as one greatest war films ever inglourious basterds praised as masterpiece even by tarantino his pretentious closing lines movie i expected like i ended up hating it with intensity,0.6110162091696181,0.040875885478158194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.28,

2.0,Exceptionally poor effort at pornographic sadism,"I really don't like this movie. I think right now I'm rating it like a 2 or 3. I haven't seen ""Death Proof"" but I think I've seen all the other ones he's directed and this is definitely the worst. In fact his films have been getting worse all the time and the last respectable thing he did was ""Jackie Brown"" as far as I'm concerned. I'm pretty much through with him. His credit is totally gone with me. As far as I can tell he makes movies to feed the fantasies of 14 year old boys. It seems like his early movies were fun and different, even if they used a lot of stuff from older movies they put it together in a different way. But this movie and ""Kill Bill"", these are just stupid movies to me. Pornography of violence basically.There's something to be said for the old exploitation movies. I'm not entirely ignorant on this subject. He used a lot of ideas from the B-crime movies of the 50s with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", and then he did I guess his version of ""blaxpoloitation"" with ""Jackie Brown."" But the thing is, that movie was made with respect to black people. It's not even really a blaxploitation movie at all, just a decent modern caper movie that uses music from the 70s movies. But with this ""Inglorious Basterds"" thing, it's really like he's trying to make his own ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" movie. But he's trying to have his cake by making it ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the Jewish resistance."" And ultimately he just presents this sad tableau where every character and every scene is dehumanized and dehumanizing. If he had actually wanted to make a movie that would have entertained Hitler, he couldn't have done better.I want to give this movie points for being different, but how can you reward somebody just for being worse than others, for daring to go further into violence for the sake of violence and justifying it with some lame-arse stuff like ""oh they're all Nazis, who cares what happens to Nazis?"" It's still dehumanizing in my opinion, it debases us to be encouraged to fantasize about committing this kind of violence to anyone. Movies like this are what makes me scared for the future of America, which I love dearly. Don't try to say that the ""Basterds"" are presented in some kind of negative light, or the film is a parody of American Exceptionalism. That's just an excuse that Tarantino built into the film with a few throw-away lines like ""watching the Jew Bear bash a Nazi is the closest thing we get to a movie."" Just to be self conscious about using violence and hate as a cinematic value (like the most base and disgusting exploitation films Tarantino apparently adores in a different way than I ever could) is not to justify it, not even in an aesthetic sense.",exceptionally poor effort at pornographic sadism,i really dont like this movie i think right now im rating it like 2 or 3 i havent seen death proof but i think ive seen all other ones hes directed this is definitely worst fact his films have been getting worse all time last respectable thing he did was jackie brown as far as im concerned im pretty much through with him his credit is totally gone with me as far as i can tell he makes movies feed fantasies 14 year old boys it seems like his early movies were fun different even if they used lot stuff older movies they put it together different way but this movie kill bill these are just stupid movies me pornography violence basically theres something be said old exploitation movies im not entirely ignorant this subject he used lot ideas b crime movies 50s with pulp fiction reservoir dogs then he did i guess his version blaxpoloitation with jackie brown but thing is that movie was made with respect black people its not even really blaxploitation movie at all just decent modern caper movie that uses music 70s movies but with this inglorious basterds thing its really like hes trying make his own ilsa she wolf ss movie but hes trying have his cake by making it ilsa she wolf jewish resistance ultimately he just presents this sad tableau where every character every scene is dehumanized dehumanizing if he had actually wanted make movie that would have entertained hitler he couldnt have done better i want give this movie points being different but how can you reward somebody just being worse than others daring go further into violence sake violence justifying it with some lame arse stuff like oh theyre all nazis who cares what happens nazis its still dehumanizing my opinion it debases us be encouraged fantasize about committing this kind violence anyone movies like this are what makes me scared future america which i love dearly dont try say that basterds are presented some kind negative light or film is parody american exceptionalism thats just excuse that tarantino built into film with few throw away lines like watching jew bear bash nazi is closest thing we get movie just be self conscious about using violence hate as cinematic value like most base disgusting exploitation films tarantino apparently adores different way than i ever could is not justify it not even aesthetic sense,0.5159651360544218,-0.011415816326530616,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1.0,A revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions!,"""Pulp Fiction"" director Quentin Tarantino has taken Italian filmmaker Enzo G. Castellari's cult World War II thriller ""Inglorious Bastards"" (1978) and reimagined it as a cinematic atrocity entitled ""Inglourious Basterds."" Castellari's riveting mission-behind-enemy-lines thriller about a group of court-martialed Allied deserters led by Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson qualified as an electrifying actioneer with charismatic characters boasting several surprises. Tarantino's tasteless tale not only lacks charismatic characters but it also contains no surprises. A bombastic piece of wartime crap containing Brad Pitt's worst performance, ""Inglourious Basterds""--with its deliberately misspelled title--is as appalling as Sasha Baron Cohen's homophobic hokum ""Bruno."" Hopelessly pretentious with its tactless Jewish revenge plot, this polished looking pabulum takes its own sweet time unfolding during a torturous two hours and thirty-three minutes. Garrulous dialogue scenes, erratic characters and a convoluted plot that all defy good taste, much less credibility,undermine what might have been an acceptable movie. Initially, the action—which Tarantino breaks into five chapters--opens during 1941 in the scenic French countryside. Unctuous Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at a farm house with several German soldiers and questions the owner, Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet of ""Hannibal Rising""), about Jews. Landa succeeds so well at ingratiating himself with LaPadite that the poor Frenchman breaks down and exposes the helpless Jewish family holed up down in his basement. The Nazis turn the basement into Swiss cheese with fusillades of machine gun fire. Miraculously, as only miracles in a movie can happen, one of the Jews, a young woman, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent of ""Snowboarder""), manages to escape. In the next scene, U.S. Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt of ""Ocean's Thirteen"") assembles a team of Jewish Americans to infiltrate enemy lines and slaughter as many Nazis as possible. In fact, Raine demands that Sergeant Donny Donowitz (""Hostel"" director Eli Roth), Private Smithson Utivich (B.J. Novak of TV's ""The Office""), Private Omar Ulmer (Omar Doom of ""Death Proof""), Private Gerold Hirschberg (Samm Levine of ""Club Dread""), Private Andy Kagan (Paul Rust of ""Semi-Pro""), and Private Michael Zimmerman (Michael Bacall of ""Undertow"") take 100 Nazi scalps. So much for the time-honored Geneva Convention!In the next scene, Adolph Hitler (Martin Wuttke) clamors that their troops must stop talking about the ""Bear Jew."" The Fuehrer rants that the nickname German soldiers have saddled Sergeant Donowitz with is undermining Nazi morale. Indeed, Donowitz wields a baseball bat with ghoulish gusto. In one scene, he takes sadistic pleasure in smashing the skull of a Nazi soldier with a Louisville slugger. Moreover, Raine and his 'Holocaust' dogs display no qualms in scalping dead Nazis. When Tarantino isn't showing Americans carving the scalps off the fallen enemy, he has them slashing swastikas in the foreheads of live prisoners. Our psychopathic heroes have even gone so far as to rescue a renegade Nazi, Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger of ""Driven""), who has acquired a notorious reputation as a serial killer among his own ranks. Mind you, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is too comically cretinous to distinguish between good Germans and bad Nazis. Like the politically incorrect cavalry westerns of yesteryear, the only good Germans in ""Inglourious Basterds"" are a dead Germans.Three years have elapsed since Shosanna eluded Colonel Landa. She resides now in Paris and owns a cinema. A lonely Nazi soldier, Frederick Zoller (Christopher Reeve lookalike Daniel Brühl of ""The Bourne Ultimatum""), befriends her. Shosanna doesn't know Zoller is a war hero. Singlehandedly, he shot over 200 American G.I.s dead from his sniper's lair atop a bell tower. Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth of ""Stalingrad"") has produced a movie about Zoller's exploits with Zoller playing himself. Moreover, Goebbels plans to premiere this epic in Paris for the high-ranking Nazi elite. Among those scheduled to attend are Hitler, Martin Bormann, Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, and famous German actor Emil Jannings. Of course, when Goebbels imposes on Shosanna to show the movie, she has no alternative. She does, however, have quite a barbecue cooked up for the cream of the Third Reich.Meantime, British Intelligence General Ed Fenech (Michael Meyers of the ""Austin Powers"" movies) and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor of ""The Time Machine"") have concocted their own secret mission. They plan to send British Lieutenant Arch Hicox (Daniel Day-Lewis lookalike Michael Fassbender of ""300"") behind enemy lines to masquerade as a Nazi. He will accompany one of their most trusted double-agents, German film starlet Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger of the ""National Treasure"" movies), to the film premiere. Unfortunately, things go awry for Bridget and Hicox before they can rendezvous with Raine. They encounter a suspicious Gestapo officer in a basement tavern and a massacre ensues that nearly scuttles the mission.Evidently, the last thing Tarantino wanted to make was a patriotic World War II movie. Instead, he has tweaked history so that ""Inglourious Basterds"" amounts to a revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions. Ridiculing the Nazis as supremely stupid swine is one thing, but it is quite another to depict Americans as murderous morons. Colonel Landa's outlandish incompetence at the premiere where he thwarts one plot but wholly overlooks another is hilariously awful. Brad Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine, a clownish Tennessee hillbilly with an ersatz Jethro Bodine drawl, is Tarantino's homage to late B-movie hunk Aldo Ray. Actually, Ray starred in the Italian WWII thriller ""Suicide Commandos."" Pitt plays the leader of this scummy little band of scalphunters without a shred of subtlety. Indeed, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about as subtle as a baseball bat to the brains. The only thing Tarantino forgot to do was dress his Jewish-American commandos up in grease paint, wigs, and phony accents like the Marx Brothers.",revisionist holocaust fantasy far fetched

5.0,Frustrating Experience,"Utterly frustrating viewing experience. There is an excellent film in here but it's ruined by the way in which Tarantino breaks the contract with the viewer. There is absolutely no need to vandalise the viewing experience by insulting the intelligence of the viewer and by scribbling (literally) over the images on screen in a way that further implies the viewer is an idiot who could not follow a simple story without the guidance from an unseen hand.The obvious thing to do to improve this film by 100% is to get rid of the Inglorious Basterds. They are completely irrelevant to the action and the storyline. You need an American covert presence in Europe to carry the story but the basterds team in no way fulfils this requirement, rather it detracts. For one thing the whole scalping and torturing your enemy storyline makes the basterds no better than the Nazis; for another the Brad Pitt character is an embarrassment from start to finish. I do not blame Pitt for this as he is clearly playing the part as the cartoon character that was defined by the script.I'm not averse to doing things differently and I think the unexplained change to the real historical timeline and the use of contemporary music works well. The first ""chapter"" is a master class in creating tension as is the sequence in the cellar. As others have commented the acting of Christoph Waltz is astonishing and quite the best thing in the film. But there are other beautiful sequences such as the opening of chapter five with its superb framing and use of the colour red. Such a pity that the rest of the film is so poorly done.Whilst I know that few will agree with me, the director Tarantino most reminds me of is Stanley Kubrick. Like Kubrick he can produce scenes of breath-taking originality but he is unable to sustain the vision over an entire film. If Tarantino could shed his sometimes infantile interjections into his own film-making process he could produce a work of true genius. Inglorious basterds is half genius, half embarrassing nonsense.",frustrating experience,utterly frustrating viewing experience there is excellent film here but its ruined by way which tarantino breaks contract with viewer there is absolutely no need vandalise viewing experience by insulting intelligence viewer by scribbling literally over images screen way that further implies viewer is idiot who could not follow simple story without guidance unseen hand obvious thing do improve this film by 100 is get rid inglorious basterds they are completely irrelevant action storyline you need american covert presence europe carry story but basterds team no way fulfils this requirement rather it detracts one thing whole scalping torturing your enemy storyline makes basterds no better than nazis another brad pitt character is embarrassment start finish i do not blame pitt this as he is clearly playing part as cartoon character that was defined by script im not averse doing things differently i think unexplained change real historical timeline use contemporary music works well first chapter is master class creating tension as is sequence cellar as others have commented acting christoph waltz is astonishing quite best thing film but there are other beautiful sequences such as opening chapter five with its superb framing use colour red such pity that rest film is so poorly done whilst i know that few will agree with me director tarantino most reminds me is stanley kubrick like kubrick he can produce scenes breath taking originality but he is unable sustain vision over entire film if tarantino could shed his sometimes infantile interjections into his own film making process he could produce work true genius inglorious basterds is half genius half embarrassing nonsense,0.49684523809523806,0.026458333333333327,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,This Movie Was A Bad Joke About WWII,"For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a complete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservoir Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.I (unfortunately) received this DVD by mistake and see this project as a new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke of making jews more barbaric than the Nazis. It perpetuates blame on the common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK bankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now confirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and Mussolini to power beginning immediately at the end of WWI.WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history deserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served up for fools too lazy to look for the truth and try to prevent a recurrence. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.If you want to look at atrocities, many can argue that Stalin made Hitler and the Nazis look like rank amateurs in the business of murdering innocent people, as well as, the drug crazed gangs of Niger roping off streets with human intestines. Where does it end? We need to be getting the multitude of shadowy intelligence agencies under control and accountability instead of getting a cheap emotional thrill about perpetuating their myths in Hollywood and our capitol cities.",this movie was bad joke about wwii,those that have studied wwii unfortunately seen real human brains ground this movie is travesty sadistic farce complete waste time like most tarantinos other questionable work i do admit liking reservoir dogs point however this thing does not even have original title i unfortunately received this dvd by mistake see this project as new low brad pitt other actors taking part this joke making jews more barbaric than nazis it perpetuates blame common german soldiers while covering up major part us uk bankers like prescott bush had funding hitler as well as now confirmed part that british intelligence had bringing hitler mussolini power beginning immediately at end wwi wwii was complex tragic event real world history deserves better than this self serving mythological blood feast served up fools too lazy look truth try prevent recurrence history can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda desensitized inhumane actions self righteous if you want look at atrocities many can argue that stalin made hitler nazis look like rank amateurs business murdering innocent people as well as drug crazed gangs niger roping off streets with human intestines where does it end we need be getting multitude shadowy intelligence agencies under control accountability instead getting cheap emotional thrill about perpetuating their myths hollywood our capitol cities,0.5294306703397613,-0.0689738292011019,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,Dark but Funny Comic Fantasy,"Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. If you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch.",dark but funny comic fantasy,inglorious basterds is dark violent comic fantasy gloriously so built framework dirty dozen inglorious basterds ditches elongated training sequences dirty dozen plunge into action right away process tarantino fixes one dirty dozens major flaws by giving bad guys screen time remind us just how bad nazis were nazis with most screen time end up becoming most completely human characters film which ironically makes them even worse monsters bu ditching training sequences tarantino is also able give us picture entire war showing us not only british american german soldiers but also giving us glimpses into world french german civilians both collaborators resistance it goes without saying that any tarantino film is going have fantastic dialogue but when tarantino made decision have french characters speak french germans speak german beyond adding level authenticity tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue french was as sharp funny clever as his english dialogue case point during opening sequence nazi jew hunter ss colonel hans landa christian waltz is interrogating french dairy farmer perrier lapadite denis menochet landa suspects that lapadite is hiding family jews while subtly pressuring lapadite landa asks glass milk after greedily gulping it down landa compliments lapadite his daughters his cows votre famille et vos vaches je dis bravo thing it is french vache means cow but it is also vulgar name vagina if reprimanded this vulgar pun landa could quite convincingly claim not understand french well enough have meant it that way but landa does mean it that way he means it as threat lapadite understands his meaning all too well that is really subtle piece acting word play that many audiences would never catch or at least they might understand subtext without knowing exact nature threat film is rich with that kind detail all french english dialogue is chosen with that same attention detail while i cant swear german i would suspect that it shows similar level craft inglorious basterds opens with phrase once upon time nazi occupied france personally this reminds me opening every asterix book movie another comic fantasy war torn occupied france like asterix inglorious basterds is howlingly funny places although film also turns darkly serious its more serious moments inglorious basterds reminds us that first casualties war are compassion ability relax as almost every elongated sequence film tarantino finds new way build cruel tension almost unbearable levels tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous even inflammable that its power deserves respect if you can see this film as i did packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke that you will see this masterful film way that it was meant be seen if you are not that lucky all that you will see is great great film that delivers darkly funny punch,0.4878287100326573,0.014471785524417106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.43}"
,"Not for critics, but people who love a good movie","Some critics might claim to need a code key to interpret what Tarantino means by this revisionist adventure film, but I'd say it's right under their up-turned noses: There's a great little scene where Mike Meyers plays a British military man who anticipates attacking a Nazi film premiere so he brings in an a film critic as an adviser. This may or may not be necessary but it does allow for a dialogue exchange like: Meyers: What do you do? Critic: I am a film critic.Meyers: What are your accomplishments? Even though the critic goes on to list some compilation books, it may as well be a rhetorical question.Tarantino thumbs his nose at convention and that is part of the movie's appeal. His movies are often about movies as much as they are about the content at hand. Yet he still manages to sustain genuine tension. The opening Nazi interrogation of a French farmer and a later a tavern basement guessing game scene must have had whopping page counts but they play out as chapters and remain engrossing high stakes set pieces. In the same film he can introduce a character by throwing a title onto the screen as if this member of the ""Basterds"" was cool enough to have his own movie, or play a 1980's David Bowie song while a woman prepares to do battle in her own way while Nazi flags hang outside the window.The movie takes place in an alternate universe that could either be a dream or the unreality of the grind-house era Tarantino has celebrated in Kill Bill and, well, Grindhouse. Anyone with a brain will get that. If that sounds good, see it. I notice now there are blurbs about ""how Jewish critics feel"" about the movie. Well, those who go to a movie with a deliberately misspelled title knowing it is a revisionist fantasy and can't bear to see the character of Hitler as the butt of the joke don't have an opinion worthy of note. If you are an expert on NASA, your views on George Lucas' Star Wars movies are not necessarily of use to me. In fact it's a little galling that such a critic-proof designation as ""Jewish critic"" should be trotted out. They can say what they like about a sensitive document with the intentions of Schindler's List and God bless them. But if someone gets his boxers in a bunch over slapstick Nazis or clueless Hitler autographing the Grain Diary for Indiana Jones, then they just aren't going to be the right audience for Inglourious Basterds. In fact they shouldn't be watching fun movies at all. They should try staring at a blank wall and talking to themselves rather than type up their blather.But it's not all fun. Sad things do happen and unfortunate events occur in this movie. The tension even in dialogue does come from the danger of having a Nazi at the table or someone daring to ask him to leave. But when you get reviewers comparing the Basterds to Al Qaida I think we can excuse those critics from the table as well. Or call Eli Roth over to them and yell ""Play ball!""",not critics but people who love good movie,some critics might claim need code key interpret what tarantino means by this revisionist adventure film but id say its right under their up turned noses theres great little scene where mike meyers plays british military man who anticipates attacking nazi film premiere so he brings film critic as adviser this may or may not be necessary but it does allow dialogue exchange like meyers what do you do critic i am film critic meyers what are your accomplishments even though critic goes list some compilation books it may as well be rhetorical question tarantino thumbs his nose at convention that is part movies appeal his movies are often about movies as much as they are about content at hand yet he still manages sustain genuine tension opening nazi interrogation french farmer later tavern basement guessing game scene must have had whopping page counts but they play out as chapters remain engrossing high stakes set pieces same film he can introduce character by throwing title onto screen as if this member basterds was cool enough have his own movie or play 1980s david bowie song while woman prepares do battle her own way while nazi flags hang outside window movie takes place alternate universe that could either be dream or unreality grind house era tarantino has celebrated kill bill well grindhouse anyone with brain will get that if that sounds good see it i notice now there are blurbs about how jewish critics feel about movie well those who go movie with deliberately misspelled title knowing it is revisionist fantasy cant bear see character hitler as butt joke dont have opinion worthy note if you are expert nasa your views george lucas star wars movies are not necessarily use me fact its little galling that such critic proof designation as jewish critic should be trotted out they can say what they like about sensitive document with intentions schindlers list god bless them but if someone gets his boxers bunch over slapstick nazis or clueless hitler autographing grain diary indiana jones then they just arent going be right audience inglourious basterds fact they shouldnt be watching fun movies at all they should try staring at blank wall talking themselves rather than type up their blather but its not all fun sad things do happen unfortunate events occur this movie tension even dialogue does come danger having nazi at table or someone daring ask him leave but when you get reviewers comparing basterds al qaida i think we can excuse those critics table as well or call eli roth over them yell play ball,0.48683150183150176,0.14460927960927958,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.49}"
3.0,Rotting faeces masquerading as 'Tarentino Art',"The luvvy darlings have all slapped Tarentio luvvy on the back on told him he's a writing/directing genius. Unfortunately this is not the case.If you are going to re-write history in a film, you need to pick a period outside of living memory. Otherwise a lot of the audience will know it's not just inaccurate, but blatantly so. This rather kills the illusion, by slapping the viewer, with a smelly cold wet fish of disbelief for what they are seeing. I liked some of Tarantino's other films, but this seems to be one where he scribbled the script on loo paper whilst high on drugs or alcohol. Fassbender excels as does Waltz (Pitt is just a poster boy and hardly seen!) but the film is so patchy and jerky you never get into any story, just long periods of tedious scenes and dialogue. Watch once (if you have no other choice) and never, ever, ever again.",rotting faeces masquerading as tarentino art,luvvy darlings have all slapped tarentio luvvy back told him hes writing directing genius unfortunately this is not case if you are going re write history film you need pick period outside living memory otherwise lot audience will know its not just inaccurate but blatantly so this rather kills illusion by slapping viewer with smelly cold wet fish disbelief what they are seeing i liked some tarantinos other films but this seems be one where he scribbled script loo paper whilst high drugs or alcohol fassbender excels as does waltz pitt is just poster boy hardly seen but film is so patchy jerky you never get into any story just long periods tedious scenes dialogue watch once if you have no other choice never ever ever again,0.537051282051282,-0.14185897435897438,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
4.0,Where Tarantino fantasizes about dirty war in war,"Okay – here's the story, in a paragraph: a bunch of American soldiers terrorize German infantry for years, in France, behind enemy lines. They become infamous to the Nazis, resorting to intense cruelty to the Germans. Even der Führer wants them caught. Meanwhile, in a French town, a lovely French-Jewish femme fatale plans to blow up her cinema when a famous German action flick is shown to the German hierarchy – including Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Borman. Coincidentally, those infamous American soldiers are sent to do the same job. Also, there's a very nasty Nazi colonel who just loves to hunt down and kill Jews – and he smells a rat in the House of Cinema. How it all turns out, I'll leave up to you to discover – that is, if you see this film.But, I don't recommend at all. Let me tell you why.First, it's billed as drama/thriller/war. Well, I guess it does contain all of those attributes, but they forgot about fantasy. Because, this story is, at core, a spoof about war and sheer fantasy, in addition.Second, in its effort to establish and develop character, it's often boring because it's way too talky for a thriller; you see character from what people do, not from what they say. Brad Pitt (as Aldo Raine) is okay as an over-the-top parody of hill-billy Americana – and he does it well. But, even his character becomes too talky. The nasty Nazi, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is talky also, but at least he's a detective (in his own words), so he has to ask a lot of questions. The rest of the cast do their best with a script that varies between intense dread, only occasionally, to high camp, often – especially concerning the German hierarchy.Third, the whole story is preposterous. Let's face it – any war story that purports to show the entire German hierarchy being blown up in a cinema can only be regarded as coming from another planet Earth in another universe. And the (way too long) card game scene in the café basement is screechingly contrived coincidence and just too stupid for words. So, if you do see it, leave believability (the prime requirement for good stories, especially war) at the door. You've been warned.And, finally, although Quentin Tarantino started well with his filmic revelation, Reservoir Dogs (1992), and followed up with his much better Elmore Leonard story, Jackie Brown (1997) – his best to date – this one is his nadir, in my opinion. Technically very good, especially with the editing, this basterd of a story nevertheless kills the whole experience. If he was trying to show war in the raw, look no further than the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line (1998). If he was trying to create a thriller, stay with the Bourne franchise. If he was attempting drama in war, watch From Here to Eternity (1953) or Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and too many other superior films.To be fair, it has its moments: the frenetic shootout in the café basement is editing at its best. And the opening scenes at the French farm are a tour de force in building dread. However, the cardboard cutout characters left me totally indifferent to the fate of any of them: in sum, a dead story about death at its worst. It'll be interesting to see if Christoph Waltz gets the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Miracles do happen, though.I note that Roger Ebert gave it four stars. Is that out of ten? I hope so – I give it four also.Oh, heck, see it if you must, but just keep in mind it's a fantastic spoof.",where tarantino fantasizes about dirty war war,okay heres story paragraph bunch american soldiers terrorize german infantry years france behind enemy lines they become infamous nazis resorting intense cruelty germans even der f hrer wants them caught meanwhile french town lovely french jewish femme fatale plans blow up her cinema when famous german action flick is shown german hierarchy including hitler goering goebbels borman coincidentally those infamous american soldiers are sent do same job also theres very nasty nazi colonel who just loves hunt down kill jews he smells rat house cinema how it all turns out ill leave up you discover that is if you see this film but i dont recommend at all let me tell you why first its billed as drama thriller war well i guess it does contain all those attributes but they forgot about fantasy because this story is at core spoof about war sheer fantasy addition second its effort establish develop character its often boring because its way too talky thriller you see character what people do not what they say brad pitt as aldo raine is okay as over top parody hill billy americana he does it well but even his character becomes too talky nasty nazi col hans landa christoph waltz is talky also but at least hes detective his own words so he has ask lot questions rest cast do their best with script that varies between intense dread only occasionally high camp often especially concerning german hierarchy third whole story is preposterous lets face it any war story that purports show entire german hierarchy being blown up cinema can only be regarded as coming another planet earth another universe way too long card game scene caf basement is screechingly contrived coincidence just too stupid words so if you do see it leave believability prime requirement good stories especially war at door youve been warned finally although quentin tarantino started well with his filmic revelation reservoir dogs 1992 followed up with his much better elmore leonard story jackie brown 1997 his best date this one is his nadir my opinion technically very good especially with editing this basterd story nevertheless kills whole experience if he was trying show war raw look no further than battle scenes thin red line 1998 if he was trying create thriller stay with bourne franchise if he was attempting drama war watch here eternity 1953 or twelve oclock high 1949 too many other superior films be fair it has its moments frenetic shootout caf basement is editing at its best opening scenes at french farm are tour de force building dread however cardboard cutout characters left me totally indifferent fate any them sum dead story about death at its worst itll be interesting see if christoph waltz gets oscar nod best supporting actor miracles do happen though i note that roger ebert gave it four stars is that out ten i hope so i give it four also oh heck see it if you must but just keep mind its fantastic spoof,0.5087994826810615,0.05353520017993703,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"
