9,"Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant !!","Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine â€“ Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of ""Mera Bharat Mahaan"" actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thrillerOverall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps.

9,Airlift will surely touch all Indians by heart!,"As this year has been started well with Wazir, the good work of Bollywood is on the road with increasing the speed and performance. Yes, I'm talking about Akshay Kumar starer Airlift, directed by Raja Krishna Menon, and which is based on true events! Film starts in Kuwait. Rajiv Katyal (Akki) has been reached on the top level in business with his ability. He refers himself as a Kuwait citizen. But when the government leaves their citizens when Iraq attacks on Kuwait under the order of Saddam Hussain, the people becomes needless. Rajiv now feels that he is an Indian, and so along with other 1,70,000 people who are actually Indians but lives in Kuwait, he starts the mission to run from Kuwait as soon as possible. His tries, his communication to India for the help, and the officer's help from India - These things you can find out in this movie. Some factors, like emotions of love for the family, for the nation, for the coworkers and their relatives, for the people who are only belongs to the same nation, have been described very well. Many moments where we can feel patriotism. Raja has directed a superb film. Akshay has given a stunning performance as usual. I was comparing Baby film with this, but both are different. But if you ask for just one movie, than I'll go with this one. Nimrat Kaur is my favorite since The Lunchbox and Dairy Milk commercials. She has delivered a fine supportive job. She shines as a wife of a rich businessman and a caring mother. Kumud Mishra fits absolutely in the character of a government officer. Poorab Kohli has a small role. Supportive cast are fine, too. De Di and Soch Na Sake are very small songs. Perfectly situated. Tu Bhula Jise is the song to remember. Background score suits to the film. Dialogues are good. Nimrat's 3/4 minuets long conversation with a unsatisfied man of the camp who always complains, is a must! Cinematography is good. Some scenes give are shaky, those could have been shoot better. Editing is fine. Indian flag has been waved by an airport staff of Jordan and Akki is watching that, while Tu Bhula Jise song is playing - the scene has been brought so many whistles and shouts. And than one more, in which Air India plane is taking off, while Akki is watching that and in background Vande Mataram is playing - a truly emotional scene! It will surely gives you goosebumps! Overall, a must watch movie for every Indians, to know the largest human evacuation. Salute to all the real heroes! Jai Hind!",airlift will surely touch all indians by heart,as this year has been started well with wazir good work bollywood is road with increasing speed performance yes im talking about akshay kumar starer airlift directed by raja krishna menon which is based true events film starts kuwait rajiv katyal akki has been reached top level business with his ability he refers himself as kuwait citizen but when government leaves their citizens when iraq attacks kuwait under order saddam hussain people becomes needless rajiv now feels that he is indian so along with other 1 70 000 people who are actually indians but lives kuwait he starts mission run kuwait as soon as possible his tries his communication india help officers help india these things you can find out this movie some factors like emotions love family nation coworkers their relatives people who are only belongs same nation have been described very well many moments where we can feel patriotism raja has directed superb film akshay has given stunning performance as usual i was comparing baby film with this but both are different but if you ask just one movie than ill go with this one nimrat kaur is my favorite since lunchbox dairy milk commercials she has delivered fine supportive job she shines as wife rich businessman caring mother kumud mishra fits absolutely character government officer poorab kohli has small role supportive cast are fine too de di soch na sake are very small songs perfectly situated tu bhula jise is song remember background score suits film dialogues are good nimrats 3 4 minuets long conversation with unsatisfied man camp who always complains is must cinematography is good some scenes give are shaky those could have been shoot better editing is fine indian flag has been waved by airport staff jordan akki is watching that while tu bhula jise song is playing scene has been brought so many whistles shouts than one more which air india plane is taking off while akki is watching that background vande mataram is playing truly emotional scene it will surely gives you goosebumps overall must watch movie every indians know largest human evacuation salute all real heroes jai hind,0.6070899470899471,0.24384920634920637,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10,"Great Movie, must watch.","What do you say about a movie like Airlift? THIS IS IT! (Remo Fernandes in Jhalak Dikhla Ja) One hasn't been to too many First Day Shows in the recent past. But this story was too compelling to pass up. One lugged a child and his friend and the friend's mother. All 4 to a First Day Show. And what a treat! The background music blends in so subtly you don't even notice it. The rest of the score is soothing, melodious and easy on the ears - not a mean feat for a quasi action film. BUT.. the best part is this - the characters are so beautifully etched. Each one of them - including the ensemble cast. Everyone has a place to fill, and everyone fills that place so well. Full marks to the Casting Director! And the actors, of course.I have become an Akshay Kumar fan in the recent years. From being Bollywood's favourite Khiladi in more ways than one, this person has matured as an actor. He brings that rare thing to the screen - persona. Nimrat Kaur does justice to her role. I would have liked a lot more layering in the expressions of this rather complex character, but that's just me. Joseph - who grows in stature from that first shot when Akshay Kumar is asking him how much moneys they have, to the end. Purab Kohli as Iqbal.. what can one say? He stands out, really, REALLY stands out, is all. You will have to see his performance to know what I mean. From the man who escorts the hero to a small gathering of friends in a supermarket, to the man who ensures an identity for a woman with an infant, and then looks the hero in the eye as he walks past, this man truly is an equal.But this was not one man's victory. Nor was it the story of one man. There were so many invisible hands who made this happen. They have been acknowledged in the end, but only in passing. They deserved so much more credit for standing by a man and supporting his battle.One Lakh Seventy Thousand WOWs for this movie. I can only imagine the scale of that number. A full residential complex with 1000 flats has only 5000 people on average. A full movie hall - maybe 150. A flight - 300? 448 flights. Those are numbers that will remain in our mind for a long, long time. Sad that it took so long for someone to tell such an inspirational story, but that time only makes it more special, as we are in a position to look back and appreciate how that one battle of 1990 changed the course of world history, and continues to do so - 25 years later.",great movie must watch,what do you say about movie like airlift this is it remo fernandes jhalak dikhla ja one hasnt been too many first day shows recent past but this story was too compelling pass up one lugged child his friend friends mother all 4 first day show what treat background music blends so subtly you dont even notice it rest score is soothing melodious easy ears not mean feat quasi action film but best part is this characters are so beautifully etched each one them including ensemble cast everyone has place fill everyone fills that place so well full marks casting director actors course i have become akshay kumar fan recent years being bollywoods favourite khiladi more ways than one this person has matured as actor he brings that rare thing screen persona nimrat kaur does justice her role i would have liked lot more layering expressions this rather complex character but thats just me joseph who grows stature that first shot when akshay kumar is asking him how much moneys they have end purab kohli as iqbal what can one say he stands out really really stands out is all you will have see his performance know what i mean man who escorts hero small gathering friends supermarket man who ensures identity woman with infant then looks hero eye as he walks past this man truly is equal but this was not one mans victory nor was it story one man there were so many invisible hands who made this happen they have been acknowledged end but only passing they deserved so much more credit standing by man supporting his battle one lakh seventy thousand wows this movie i can only imagine scale that number full residential complex with 1000 flats has only 5000 people average full movie hall maybe 150 flight 300 448 flights those are numbers that will remain our mind long long time sad that it took so long someone tell such inspirational story but that time only makes it more special as we are position look back appreciate how that one battle 1990 changed course world history continues do so 25 years later,0.5120783730158729,0.16772693452380952,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,Great Movie. Nice start for 2016,"Airlift is simply a great movie whether you talk about direction or acting,its simply mind blowing. Akshay kumar's gritty acting is simply mesmerizing.Unlike other movies , songs of this movie are soothing and full of melody. Its great that they didn't put a item song. The film is based on the real-life conflict and bloodshed that took place twenty five years back in Kuwait, and the way it is doneâ€”with a sense of urgency and immediacy, bringing alive a city over-run and under siegeâ€”sends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel- producing Bollywood.Other than that Nimrat kaur's was also very good. Overall, 'Airlift' is a good film,solidly plotted, well executed and well- acted. A must watch. Its a perfect movie for Republic Day Week !",great movie nice start 2016,airlift is simply great movie whether you talk about direction or acting its simply mind blowing akshay kumars gritty acting is simply mesmerizing unlike other movies songs this movie are soothing full melody its great that they didnt put item song film is based real life conflict bloodshed that took place twenty five years back kuwait way it is done with sense urgency immediacy bringing alive city over run under siege sends out crucial message star driven yet drivel producing bollywood other than that nimrat kaurs was also very good overall airlift is good film solidly plotted well executed well acted must watch its perfect movie republic day week,0.5017687074829931,0.3004761904761905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.22}"
6,A historical achievement enfeebled by poor film-making! Airlift is mediocre. Period.,"Yes, we had a great plot in our baggage. A true story intended to pan out a biopic that could have turned heads, made some noise about the plight of 170000 stuck Indians in a warzone. An immaculate rescue operation that was so colossal that it lodged its name in the Guinness Book of World Records for being one of the largest evacuations of all times.But what does Menon do with it? He changes facts, people, creates sheer fiction, rules out details, comes with a hand-woven shoddy script to replace the truth, places his own fake characters to enrich melodrama, throws in some songs in there to deliberately connect with the Indian audience, enforces unrealistic patriotism for emphasis, and squeezes in pointless unwanted tantrums to say the least.SPOILERS AHEAD: The movie begins by depicting the lavish life of the protagonist whilst noisily pointing out how little Katyal, a big fish in the Kuwait business suburbs, thought of his homeland. He had turned, as suggested by a brayed intentional laugh of his friends, more Kuwaitian than a Kuwaitian himself. These bits again seemed forced rather than appear natural so as to benefit the script.Chaos depicted by some pathetic CGI bombing, tanks and helicopters raids manifest how little we have progressed in movie making. Third grade young actors chosen here try to scare you with guns and a foreign accent. They fail terribly at it. Their acts were excruciatingly unpromising as they try to kick someone lethargically on the butt, shoot people to nail in absent fear, make advances at young girls, or occasionally stop people for intimidating enquiry. Amidst all the mayhem Akshay Kumar cries which somehow doesn't blend in with the unconvincing setup. Also, when he runs home to not discover his wife and child, whilst looking unperturbed by the snot lazily hanging from his nose (which seemed a very forceful shot by Menon BTW), really squeezed out acting from him, which pretty soon disappeared in its next impending frames. Menon tries to shoehorn drama in there which seemed more enacted to have ever reached a gut-wrenching point.What was however quite endearing to watch was how the movie unfurls into better horizons from there as the protagonist starts taking effective measures to get the job done. The way the story oscillates with the 'how' is the crux of the flick. It however also tries to milk a character called George, played by Prakash Belawadi, depictive of a head that doesn't work well with the mass. What it failed to cash on was its moniker. The fact that Air India flew over 488 air planes in a war-hit zone was humongous, but it was vaguely mentioned in a daft line by Akshay. True heroics get overshadowed right there.After watching this you will miss Neeraj Pandey big time, or even hope the likes of Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee or even the newcomer Neeraj Ghaywan to have picked this up. Airlift failed to engage and rivet us. The music couldn't captivate us and there was hardly an adrenaline moment to keep our jaws wide open for long. To say that it even came close to the likes of Argo would be downright foolish.Alas! the damage has been done. What you have is mediocre served on your platter! What could have turned into something phenomenal ends up being an average Indian mainstream movie. It is quite unfortunate that the Indian mass loves this kind of stuff. I would call it nothing but an average crowd entertainer.Go with lesser expectations and you might enjoy it.",historical achievement enfeebled by poor film making airlift is mediocre period,yes we had great plot our baggage true story intended pan out biopic that could have turned heads made some noise about plight 170000 stuck indians warzone immaculate rescue operation that was so colossal that it lodged its name guinness book world records being one largest evacuations all times but what does menon do with it he changes facts people creates sheer fiction rules out details comes with hand woven shoddy script replace truth places his own fake characters enrich melodrama throws some songs there deliberately connect with indian audience enforces unrealistic patriotism emphasis squeezes pointless unwanted tantrums say least spoilers ahead movie begins by depicting lavish life protagonist whilst noisily pointing out how little katyal big fish kuwait business suburbs thought his homeland he had turned as suggested by brayed intentional laugh his friends more kuwaitian than kuwaitian himself these bits again seemed forced rather than appear natural so as benefit script chaos depicted by some pathetic cgi bombing tanks helicopters raids manifest how little we have progressed movie making third grade young actors chosen here try scare you with guns foreign accent they fail terribly at it their acts were excruciatingly unpromising as they try kick someone lethargically butt shoot people nail absent fear make advances at young girls or occasionally stop people intimidating enquiry amidst all mayhem akshay kumar cries which somehow doesnt blend with unconvincing setup also when he runs home not discover his wife child whilst looking unperturbed by snot lazily hanging his nose which seemed very forceful shot by menon btw really squeezed out acting him which pretty soon disappeared its next impending frames menon tries shoehorn drama there which seemed more enacted have ever reached gut wrenching point what was however quite endearing watch was how movie unfurls into better horizons there as protagonist starts taking effective measures get job done way story oscillates with how is crux flick it however also tries milk character called george played by prakash belawadi depictive head that doesnt work well with mass what it failed cash was its moniker fact that air india flew over 488 air planes war hit zone was humongous but it was vaguely mentioned daft line by akshay true heroics get overshadowed right there after watching this you will miss neeraj pandey big time or even hope likes anurag kashyap dibakar banerjee or even newcomer neeraj ghaywan have picked this up airlift failed engage rivet us music couldnt captivate us there was hardly adrenaline moment keep our jaws wide open long say that it even came close likes argo would be downright foolish alas damage has been done what you have is mediocre served your platter what could have turned into something phenomenal ends up being average indian mainstream movie it is quite unfortunate that indian mass loves this kind stuff i would call it nothing but average crowd entertainer go with lesser expectations you might enjoy it,0.5102849336455892,-0.041081186572989835,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"

7,Uplifts Indian cinema standard,"Director Mr. Raja Krishna Menon work is superb. You feel yourself in to the screen. Story is inspired by real incident. It is OK. Screenplay makes its interesting by adding so many good and balanced plot, like introducing Kuwaiti girl and its culmination, one scene of secretary with his father, telling him about pain of migration, which triggers him to take the matters personally, track of irritating George etc. Credit goes to screenplay writers Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair, Director himself and Rahul Nangia . Dialogues by Ritesh Shah, are real and impactful. Transformation of characters are very good, like a hardcore businessman to an extra emotional human being of main character. Productions design by Mustafa Staionwala needs to be applauded. Film looks so real and then great work by Director of photography, Priya Seth, to capture it perfectly. It could have been brutal but makers kept it very balanced. One scene where lead actor scuffles with Iraqi soldiers is a note above but its culmination again makes it worth clapping. Performance wise Akhshay Kumar is fantabulous. He is just amazing in every scene, especially in emotional ones. Nimraut Kaur as Amrita is OK. She had a good scene but it was just OK performance by her. Inaamul Haq as Iraqi Major Khalaf Bin Zayd, is first rate. He had gone deep into character that its hard to believe that he is an Indian. His balanced greed in eyes and accent make his character believable. Kumud Mishra as secretary Sanjeev Kohli is impressive. Purab Kohli as Abraham makes his presence felt. Ajay Arya Singh as Akshay kumar first driver is fine in his brief role. Feryana Wazheir as Kuwaiti girl, Tasneem looks innocent as the requirement of character.

Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well. It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of ""Mera Bharat Mahaan"" actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thriller Overall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps.

10,Airlift Review : Excellent gift for all Indians and cinema lovers...,"Movie: Airlift (U/A)Rating : 4.75/5It's a true fact that we Indians love our heroes and protectors, who spend their lives for us, and when we see a film related to them, we all like those films and start to have a respect for the makers. Akshay Kumar's patriotic action thriller AIRLIFT too is a film which showcases not just the pride in being Indian, but also that in being a true HUMAN.Akshay Kumar starrer AIRLIFT is based on a true story, which might be the biggest reasons why this film succeeds in connecting with the viewers. Akshay's performance and portrayal of a man struck by patriotism is simply outstanding. If you believe me, let me tell you that when Akshay got emotional on screen, I too had tears in eyes. Nimrat Kaur has a good role and she portrays it well; the role is not like a regular heroine in movies. Other actors do a great job and add flavor and color to the film.Coming to the music, I hadn't heard it before. I watched it only on the big screen. There aren't much songs, but the ones that are there, make their way to the shelves of music buffs. The background score of the film is good and keeps you involved in. The dialogues oozing patriotism are simply to say, superb. The technical aspects, as every war film has, are top notch and well executed. The action scenes are well choreographed, executed and filmed, and are quite realistic. The cinematography is brilliantly done with and filming locations are quite adorable. The editing is crisp and the film keeps you hooked till the end. The best thing I liked was the director's way of placing the intermission point. You don't have an idea that it would be an intermission signalling for. But, I meant that I liked every single frame of this film. There was nothing to dislike at all.Another thing to mention is that AIRLIFT is a film which has a strong appeal not only for those who love their country and realistic movies, but also for the audiences who want to take home something they love in a film. In this film, there's not only one portion to take home: You can take the entire film home. I liked the film so much that I think of adding it to my video library soon after it releases on DVD. Besides, despite of a UA certificate, the film is family friendly and can be watched with the family, and rather, the country.To sum up, AIRLIFT is the finest film that has come this year, and has all the strength to become a major and notable success. Since I watched the film today on the occasion of Republic Day, as I was willing to, I would love to conclude with following lines: AIRLIFT : ""SUCH A PRECIOUS AND LOVELY GIFT, WILL MAKE THE BAR OF Indian FILMS LIFT"".Anything else, oh yes, I forgot to say that. JAI HIND.",airlift review excellent gift all indians cinema lovers,movie airlift u rating 4 75 5its true fact that we indians love our heroes protectors who spend their lives us when we see film related them we all like those films start have respect makers akshay kumars patriotic action thriller airlift too is film which showcases not just pride being indian but also that being true human akshay kumar starrer airlift is based true story which might be biggest reasons why this film succeeds connecting with viewers akshays performance portrayal man struck by patriotism is simply outstanding if you believe me let me tell you that when akshay got emotional screen i too had tears eyes nimrat kaur has good role she portrays it well role is not like regular heroine movies other actors do great job add flavor color film coming music i hadnt heard it before i watched it only big screen there arent much songs but ones that are there make their way shelves music buffs background score film is good keeps you involved dialogues oozing patriotism are simply say superb technical aspects as every war film has are top notch well executed action scenes are well choreographed executed filmed are quite realistic cinematography is brilliantly done with filming locations are quite adorable editing is crisp film keeps you hooked till end best thing i liked was directors way placing intermission point you dont have idea that it would be intermission signalling but i meant that i liked every single frame this film there was nothing dislike at all another thing mention is that airlift is film which has strong appeal not only those who love their country realistic movies but also audiences who want take home something they love film this film theres not only one portion take home you can take entire film home i liked film so much that i think adding it my video library soon after it releases dvd besides despite ua certificate film is family friendly can be watched with family rather country sum up airlift is finest film that has come this year has all strength become major notable success since i watched film today occasion republic day as i was willing i would love conclude with following lines airlift such precious lovely gift will make bar indian films lift anything else oh yes i forgot say that jai hind,0.5390199669611435,0.33446545284780577,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.18}"

7,Awesome film though may not be accurate in terms of facts,"It's very difficult to make a biopic on real events, Sometimes filmmakers are forced to take cinematic liberties inorder to get mass appeal Airlift based on the Iraq invasion in Kuwait in 1990 is perhaps not as accurate in terms of facts yet it's a brilliant movie. It moves you, makes you feel for the characters. The film starts off well and keeps you engaged, right from the start The entire evacuation part is well handled, also the characters of Ranjit Katyal(Akshay Kumar) or any other minor character. The film is handled well by Raja Menon There are few hiccups perhaps like as mentioned at times it's too filmy, although I wont mention the song in the boat as it doesn't really seem like a forced song as people have mentioned, The climax too is superb Direction is good Music is decent, De Di is the best song rest songs are good too though some could be avoided Camera-work is superb, there have recreated 1990s kuwait in UAE brilliantlyAkshay Kumar excels in his role, the actor is growing with every film He is simply fab Nimrat Kaur is fab too, especially in the scene when she gives an answer to George Prakash Belavadi is fantastic in his role, Amongst others Ninad Kamat seen after a long time is good, rest are all good",awesome film though may not be accurate terms facts,its very difficult make biopic real events sometimes filmmakers are forced take cinematic liberties inorder get mass appeal airlift based iraq invasion kuwait 1990 is perhaps not as accurate terms facts yet its brilliant movie it moves you makes you feel characters film starts off well keeps you engaged right start entire evacuation part is well handled also characters ranjit katyal akshay kumar or any other minor character film is handled well by raja menon there are few hiccups perhaps like as mentioned at times its too filmy although i wont mention song boat as it doesnt really seem like forced song as people have mentioned climax too is superb direction is good music is decent de di is best song rest songs are good too though some could be avoided camera work is superb there have recreated 1990s kuwait uae brilliantlyakshay kumar excels his role actor is growing with every film he is simply fab nimrat kaur is fab too especially scene when she gives answer george prakash belavadi is fantastic his role amongst others ninad kamat seen after long time is good rest are all good,0.5639329805996472,0.2991622574955909,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

The movie start very slow with cheesy production and laughable dialogue and once the climax supposedly should come, the movie just skip it as nothing happens!!It very clear that the director had no clue on what is he doing or what is the direction of the movie. the setup is bad, i will give you very good example, when Akshay goes to Iraq to meet with the officials, the cast was wearing a UAE national dress were they supposed to wear an Iraqi custom !!! what was the movie maker thinking??!!!One of my biggest problem also with the movie is the character of the Iraqi military guy, how on earth you put an Indian to portray an Iraqi Officer !!!! they cant find any Arab speaking actor !!! and ohh my god that character is really bad and not believable at all.

5,Mediocre...?,"This movie had some very good aspects and some very bad aspects. Nothing was mediocre. All subplots were unrealistic and overdramatic viz. Mr. George subplot, Kuwaiti in the camp subplot, the driver subplot, etc. Cinematography was weak. War zones were very weakly depicted. All wide angle shots of Kuwait city under attack looked animated. All fire, burning vehicles were CGI and looked inauthentic to the limit. Makeup and costumes were good. Nimrat Kaur especially looked gorgeous in the whole movie. But, did Amrita Katyal and other cast supposed to look good? Background score was overpushed. Scenes were tried to be made thriller or melodramatic on the basis of background score even when it is not needed. Acting was overall very good. This was the best acting by Akshay Kumar I've ever seen. After the lunchbox, Nimrat Kaur yet again proved her talent. Screenplay was plain bad, eg. Ranjit Katyal goes to the party just because an item number needs to be inserted. It neither sheds a light on Ranjit-Amrita relationship (as suggested by the preceding scene), nor helps the story to move forward. Stereotypes were used for comic element. Direction was subpar. Between the awesomeness of some departments and utter dismal by the other, the movie as a whole failed to rise above ordinary.",mediocre,this movie had some very good aspects some very bad aspects nothing was mediocre all subplots were unrealistic overdramatic viz mr george subplot kuwaiti camp subplot driver subplot etc cinematography was weak war zones were very weakly depicted all wide angle shots kuwait city under attack looked animated all fire burning vehicles were cgi looked inauthentic limit makeup costumes were good nimrat kaur especially looked gorgeous whole movie but did amrita katyal other cast supposed look good background score was overpushed scenes were tried be made thriller or melodramatic basis background score even when it is not needed acting was overall very good this was best acting by akshay kumar ive ever seen after lunchbox nimrat kaur yet again proved her talent screenplay was plain bad eg ranjit katyal goes party just because item number needs be inserted it neither sheds light ranjit amrita relationship as suggested by preceding scene nor helps story move forward stereotypes were used comic element direction was subpar between awesomeness some departments utter dismal by other movie as whole failed rise above ordinary,0.5633784893267652,0.023559113300492613,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
4,Do not be fooled by the 9.2 rating,"Dear gullible Indian/Foreign audiences, please do not be fooled by the 9.2 rating this film has received on IMDb. Airlift is an extremely overrated film. Critics and audiences seem to have worked themselves into a frenzy over this mediocre film.Firstly, Raja Menon is a terrible filmmaker. After the scenes with Akshay and wife (Nimrat Kaur) living it up, the film cuts straight to tanks and trucks coming into Kuwait. There is no suspense, no intrigue, nothing. It is astounding that such a chilling instance of one country invading another was portrayed in such an unimaginative way. The film was completely unsuccessful in conveying the horror of the situation.Secondly, Akshya Kumar's acting is mostly crap. The guy is so damn self conscious. Nimrat Kaur is also quite unremarkable. The actor who played the Iraqi tin pot general overacted way too much. The scenes where he makes an appearance were absolutely awful.However, there were a few uplifting scenes. Like the one where all the Indian refugees take on the Iraqi soldiers. And the ending which does promote national integration.The film is also interesting because it does show how Indians react under pressure - lashing out at each other due to class differences. But it does not deserve a 9.2 rating by any stretch of the imagination.More like a (4/10).Best Regards, Pimpin.",do not be fooled by 9 2 rating,dear gullible indian foreign audiences please do not be fooled by 9 2 rating this film has received imdb airlift is extremely overrated film critics audiences seem have worked themselves into frenzy over this mediocre film firstly raja menon is terrible filmmaker after scenes with akshay wife nimrat kaur living it up film cuts straight tanks trucks coming into kuwait there is no suspense no intrigue nothing it is astounding that such chilling instance one country invading another was portrayed such unimaginative way film was completely unsuccessful conveying horror situation secondly akshya kumars acting is mostly crap guy is so damn self conscious nimrat kaur is also quite unremarkable actor who played iraqi tin pot general overacted way too much scenes where he makes appearance were absolutely awful however there were few uplifting scenes like one where all indian refugees take iraqi soldiers ending which does promote national integration film is also interesting because it does show how indians react under pressure lashing out at each other due class differences but it does not deserve 9 2 rating by any stretch imagination more like 4 10 best regards pimpin,0.5128472222222222,-0.041666666666666664,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"

An 8.7 for this is absolutely ridiculous. I feel bad for all the non- Indians who trust the rating and go on to watch the movie and swear never to watch a movie from India again.Firstly, this movie has a lot of similarity to Hotel Rwanda. Especially the first 3/4 of the film. From the chaos happening outside, random killings, soldiers showing up at the place they were hold up, bribing of officials and so on. Although infused with its own original elements too, the movie was shamelessly ripped off.Secondly, the historicity of the movie. The movie made it look like there was some kind of genocide of Kuwaitees going on outside. While there were about a 1000 civilian deaths throughout the conflict, The depiction of random killings and rapes is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the actual airlift was downplayed by the Hotel Rwanda ripoff bits. Felt that should have been given more attention.Thirdly, why did they have to use an Indian guy to act as an Iraqi general.

10,Airlift Awesome plot,"A story must to be spread #Airlift is compelling, thanks largely to a sterling performance from Akshay Kumar, who is both suitably weary and suitably level-headed for the part enough to anchor the proceedings. The actor is always fine when reined in, and Menon plays to his strengths and Kumar only snaps once, almost reflexively, into Bollywood hero mode, but he is mostly calm and grown-up and holding on.It is several steps ahead of Kumar's other recent January releases, Baby (2015) and Special 26 (2013), and deserves all the box-office it can get. The bar has been raised and it's about bloody time.Watch Airlift because it tells a very important story that never got a mention in our history books.
