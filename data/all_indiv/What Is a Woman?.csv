10,I'm a Democratic voter but this is a genius documentary,"I voted Democrat in 2008, 2012, 2016 and I gotta say that this really makes you wonder what is going on academia, whether professors are failing to teach Classics, Classical Philosophy, logic/rationality, critical thinking, and Biology 101. These gender ideologues seem to base their ideas on things they found on blogs rather than textbooks and actual scientific literature.There were folks were being deceptive about puberty blockers as if puberty can just be resumed in your 20s or 30s or even 40s without serious health issues. People need to speak up professionally against this and see the truth is being overrun by these ideas.The documentary is a golden example of the Socrates Method which any educated person would recognize and commend Matt Walsh for and for staying in character to ask simple inquisitive questions that investigative journalists should have already asked long ago but were too afraid of being labeled a ""phobe"" or ""prejudiced"" or something.",im democratic voter but this is genius documentary,i voted democrat 2008 2012 2016 i gotta say that this really makes you wonder what is going academia whether professors are failing teach classics classical philosophy logic rationality critical thinking biology 101 these gender ideologues seem base their ideas things they found blogs rather than textbooks actual scientific literature there were folks were being deceptive about puberty blockers as if puberty can just be resumed your 20s or 30s or even 40s without serious health issues people need speak up professionally against this see truth is being overrun by these ideas documentary is golden example socrates method which any educated person would recognize commend matt walsh staying character ask simple inquisitive questions that investigative journalists should have already asked long ago but were too afraid being labeled phobe or prejudiced or something,0.3864468864468865,-0.09102564102564105,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.54}"
8,Those who call it transphobic haven't watched it,"I was quite surprised to see the level of respect this film had for the subjects, at many points reflecting on the sympathy for children suffering with gender identity.I think what I appreciated most was that these weren't trick questions, the presenter asked very basic and honest questions - the fact that a univeristy professor was unable to answer simple questions in his own field was very telling. It was a running theme that those who wanted honest discussions were being shut down, lose their careers and even faced imprisonment.Speaking with an African tribe was also an interesting juxtaposition of societal ideals.My one criticism is that I wish he had not been able to open the jar of pickles.",those who call it transphobic havent watched it,i was quite surprised see level respect this film had subjects at many points reflecting sympathy children suffering with gender identity i think what i appreciated most was that these werent trick questions presenter asked very basic honest questions fact that univeristy professor was unable answer simple questions his own field was very telling it was running theme that those who wanted honest discussions were being shut down lose their careers even faced imprisonment speaking with african tribe was also interesting juxtaposition societal ideals my one criticism is that i wish he had not been able open jar pickles,0.5020957341269842,0.2277777777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9,Worth Watching,"This documentary is affecting. It starts with emotions of confusion, humor and fascination, and journey's deep into a place of disturbance and despair. It has some mild trolling at the start, but it genuinely gives everyone a chance to speak and doesn't have any dishonest cuts. It handles a topic that's managed to become controversial in maybe the last five years. But it also asks questions, that no matter where you stand we should be asking if we really care about people - are the procedures successful outcomes? Are there lasting after effects or issues? Are we influencing people and in what ways? Do children have a clear sense of self and consent?",worth watching,this documentary is affecting it starts with emotions confusion humor fascination journeys deep into place disturbance despair it has some mild trolling at start but it genuinely gives everyone chance speak doesnt have any dishonest cuts it handles topic thats managed become controversial maybe last five years but it also asks questions that no matter where you stand we should be asking if we really care about people are procedures successful outcomes are there lasting after effects or issues are we influencing people what ways do children have clear sense self consent,0.3791666666666667,0.19444444444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.54}"
9,Matt is a sheep amidst wolves,"None of these people he interviewed could stand their ground. They all had tantrums when they realized they couldn't intimidate him or control the conversation. He interviewed some really tough strong towers who couldnt do anything but keep reminding him of their high positions as doctors/educators/politicians, or like i said, not even be able to continue the conversation. My favorite part was when the angry black lady was confronting the spa that lets trans men into the young girls' spaces. ""F--- gender orientation, i see a D---!"" Oh man I was rollingðŸ¤£.

9,An Actual Documentary,"So, its fairly well produced, it looks good (certainly comparable to other documentaries out there.) All of the technical aspects of the film are in order. Nothing truly stands out as exceptional, but everything is very much professional.From an approach perspective, it really is more of a documentary than most ""documentaries"" in that, the main character (Matt Walsh) is asking questions to try and understand the opposing opinion. Most ""Documentaries"" have a side and then only interview supporting perspectives of the thesis. In this case, Walsh actually interviews the opposing side a lot. For that reason alone, this a more honest documentary. Now, fair-is-fair, I don't like the subject of documentaries to be the documentarian. I believe that would classify it as more journalistic or activist (a-la, Moore or Spurlock.) But it is a common documentary style.That said, I guess we get into the meat of it and why people love it or hate it. As before mentioned, there is a lot of exchanges with opposing view points, and those view points did not make strong arguments. Did Walsh interview the actual leading experts on the subjects? Maybe, maybe not. They do have considerable credibility, but Walsh himself is by no means an expert in the field, so even if the people he's interviewing are not the leaders, it's not like it's an unfair fight.I think if you're for or against this subject matter, it's probably a good film to watch. It's always good to know what the opposing arguments are, but for some reason this topic people get very passionate about. From a purely creative standpoint, I think it's great, not exceptional, but if you like documentaries, it's going to be one of the best ones this year.",actual documentary,so its fairly well produced it looks good certainly comparable other documentaries out there all technical aspects film are order nothing truly stands out as exceptional but everything is very much professional approach perspective it really is more documentary than most documentaries that main character matt walsh is asking questions try understand opposing opinion most documentaries have side then only interview supporting perspectives thesis this case walsh actually interviews opposing side lot that reason alone this more honest documentary now fair is fair i dont like subject documentaries be documentarian i believe that would classify it as more journalistic or activist la moore or spurlock but it is common documentary style that said i guess we get into meat it why people love it or hate it as before mentioned there is lot exchanges with opposing view points those view points did not make strong arguments did walsh interview actual leading experts subjects maybe maybe not they do have considerable credibility but walsh himself is by no means expert field so even if people hes interviewing are not leaders its not like its unfair fight i think if youre or against this subject matter its probably good film watch its always good know what opposing arguments are but some reason this topic people get very passionate about purely creative standpoint i think its great not exceptional but if you like documentaries its going be one best ones this year,0.5207440476190477,0.23935714285714282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8,"It's very funny, until it stares deep into reality.","Watching a modern society try to answer this simple question is funny. The self-aware documentary holds up a mirror to a politically correct thought process, and simply allows itself to present it's own absurdity. I will say the host Matt Walsh is not for everyone. He's not a professional comedian, although he is funny enough to carry the documentary. He has a laid back, dry wit that did not translate at the beginning for me. Some viewers may not realize he's being humorous, because he plays it so seriously. Please start watching knowing that 'What Is A Woman' doesn't take itself in earnest for the first hour of viewing. It's halfhearted mannerism completely sold it for me though. It's just a question, and it was answered by several diverse individuals, but the non-answers (the I don't knows) are what stuck out the most.The remaining half of this documentary chooses a side in the transgender debates. I would call it, ""the cons"" of transitioning, of redefining gender, as well the political shift. I found it eye-opening. I found it terrifying. I actually learned something about the transgender community that I did not know. I'd imagine most people don't know. I learned the downside of our COMPLETE social acceptance of transgenderism. I learned these things NOT from one point of view, but from a diverse field of medical professionals, college professors, and transgender individuals. The documentary did it's research thoroughly, and I think that's what I found so incredibly horrific about it... The fact that we aren't asking questions anymore, because we're afraid of asking. We no longer ask questions, because society doesn't allow us. So I'd imagine the documentary requires a trigger warning. Because it certainly uncovers answers that society needs to hear, and showcases the lengths at which others are attempting to hide it.",its very funny until it stares deep into reality,watching modern society try answer this simple question is funny self aware documentary holds up mirror politically correct thought process simply allows itself present its own absurdity i will say host matt walsh is not everyone hes not professional comedian although he is funny enough carry documentary he has laid back dry wit that did not translate at beginning me some viewers may not realize hes being humorous because he plays it so seriously please start watching knowing that what is woman doesnt take itself earnest first hour viewing its halfhearted mannerism completely sold it me though its just question it was answered by several diverse individuals but non answers i dont knows are what stuck out most remaining half this documentary chooses side transgender debates i would call it cons transitioning redefining gender as well political shift i found it eye opening i found it terrifying i actually learned something about transgender community that i did not know id imagine most people dont know i learned downside our complete social acceptance transgenderism i learned these things not one point view but diverse field medical professionals college professors transgender individuals documentary did its research thoroughly i think thats what i found so incredibly horrific about it fact that we arent asking questions anymore because were afraid asking we no longer ask questions because society doesnt allow us so id imagine documentary requires trigger warning because it certainly uncovers answers that society needs hear showcases lengths at which others are attempting hide it,0.3964607464607464,0.023133848133848136,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.45}"
