10.0,"""To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town""","I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",my big brother george richest man town,ive always thought that reason its wonderful life has had such enduring popularity is that more than any other film it shows what can be value single individual contribution greater good they can make george bailey as portrayed by james stewart is kind every man hero we can all identify with hes got every day problems be sure raising providing family but hes got bigger problems than that fate has made him rallying point opposition his small town bedford falls richest meanest man town embodied lionel barrymore its real david vs goliath battle barrymore seems have unlimited resources at his disposal samuel s hinds as peter bailey put it so well him asking what are you doing all this barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use little charity wouldnt hurt him remember basic plot outline whole lot people bedford falls one post world war ii christmas eve see that their friend george is toting heavy load mysterious origins their prayers reach heavens where angel is dispatched aid but before henry travers angel arrives hes given story george baileys life we see kind struggles hes had sacrifices hes made good whole lot others weve also seen greedy grasping potter grabbing everything that george bailey cannot save something happens that day before christmas through no fault his own bailey is big trouble its driven him brink despair thats why angel is sent down he shows him alternate universe that would have been had he never existed its something each every one us should try do step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be but i think what frank capra is trying say this greatest his films is that having done that we realize we havent contributed greater good humankind we resolve do so its simple but profound lesson what if potter got same opportunity sense charles dickens did just that christmas carol would lionel barrymore change its interesting point speculation addition those cast members already mentioned whole group players who worked with capra before grace this film add that some others you have perfectly cast feature picture donna reed has interesting part as well your choice mate is real important life had she not been as loving supportive george bailey he might very well have taken different route life mary hatch bailey became signature part her more identified than her role here eternity which got her oscar it certainly was basis her tv series when todd karns who plays harry bailey toasts his brother hes saying that riches world are not necessarily things that can be quantified your life is not measured material things but how you use material things given you that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as its wonderful life is shown every year wouldst we all learn it,0.5499144102085279,0.26780656707127287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A Great Influence...,"No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...",great influence,no movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic i had honor doing play version it about 5 years ago i had seen film thousands times had loved it but i never really knew what it meant during course production i suddenly felt alive i felt that i wasnt having enough fun i felt that i wasnt doing enough my life crazy things like kissing my mother or my father i hadnt really hugged one them while it makes you think its more thinking persons film than mere christmas film if you think its just christmas film i insist you watch it again again until you get message stewart gives finest performance his career one most difficult characters ever portrayed character all us are familiar with person looking find himself herself its great struggle finding what it is life you really want do george bailey teaches us so lessons throughout film end he teaches us most important lesson all that life although long winding road truly is lack better word wonderful,0.5402777777777777,0.2413194444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,One of those quintessential Christmas movies....,"It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox",one those quintessential christmas movies,its wonderful life is something truly special along with scrooge original miracle 34th street home alones 1 2 it is something i watch every christmas why because i love this movie seriously i do looking through my 1000 or so reviews here i couldnt believe i hadnt reviewed this movie i have seen movies that i have loved cherished since childhood i have seen movies that belong at bottom garbage its wonderful life belongs former although i am 17 i appreciate good movie when i see one this is more than good movie its timeless masterpiece that holds up repeated viewings never loses its magic its wonderful life could have easily been overly sentimental clich d but quality direction screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was beautiful heart warming somewhat poignant film while there are some funny parts not bursting your gut funny but funny subtle sort way other parts are close heart rending direction frank capra is excellent sensitive nuanced capra shows even more talent as screenwriter having penned one most honest touching scripts ever film casablanca all about eve shawshank redemption all had wonderful scripts but script here has lot say about community spirit shows that this film is much more than feel good sentimentality there is element feel good here no doubt about it but it doesnt overpower what film intends visually its wonderful life is wonder i dont think it is dated at all cinematography is crisp black white looks beautiful pristine christmas scenery really does take me back some my favourite ever memories was christmas whether it was watching nostalgic christmas videos eating christmas dinner or singing carols under christmas tree another thing i have mention is that movie is richly beautifully scored dmitri tiomkins music here is absolutely gorgeous lyrical whimsical nostalgic most importantly it never felt intrusive more integral parts film i have mention story never my life i genuinely mean this have i seen movie where it communicates such strong message so well too story suicidal man who is shown value his life by his guardian angel is effective timeless one imitated perhaps but never equalled finally acting is wonderful james stewart i seriously dont give damn whether he was racist or not neither should you is absolutely superb as george bailey truly complex character who goes through such lot get where he is at end movie george bailey is like mr deeds john doe mr smith rolled into one my opinion only james stewart could have given justice character that has self doubt gnawed at his essential decency also character change like that alistair sims scrooge at end scrooge was heart breakingly believable donna reed is radiant charming as his wife who is like caring lover devoted wife dedicated mother while thomas mitchell gives one his more memorable performances as uncle billy henry travers is revelation as clarence guardian angel but there is another performance i think is worth mention good morality tale you need good villain well name potter you have one who better portray him than great lionel barrymore acting at peak his powers overall timeless classic with true heart rendingly poignant ending 10 10 one easiest perfect scores i have made recently bethany cox,0.6352640415140415,0.35078601953601957,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic,"This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family. We watch it every year and never tire of it. Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values. This is probably his greatest film in that regard. Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town. The second message is that each life important. No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant. His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters. He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition. He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow. For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero. Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational. The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming. Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town. Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century. It was nominated for five academy awards and won none. It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film. History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation. Of course, I rated it a 10/10. I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.",wonderful film timeless classic,this film has become christmas tradition my family we watch it every year never tire it frank capra is master creating films with message that reinforce strong values this is probably his greatest film that regard both he stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film message this film is one courage sacrifice greater good as george bailey man with big ideas about seeing world continually forsakes his own desires do what is right town second message is that each life important no matter how insignificant we feel we are we are all inextricably linked each other play important part fabric one anothers lives capras direction is brilliant his genius is bringing human stories life ways that not only make point but that totally involve audience lives characters he is always extremely optimistic about human condition he is known testing his characters with overwhelming adversity make them struggle triumph way that causes world change character grow this reason his films were always crowd pleasers this film was best all that regard led by capras understanding hand actors all did magnificent job stewarts wide eyed enthusiasm boyish charm coupled with unbending strength character made him perfect folk hero donna reed was lovely charming attained right balance between being supportive inspirational romantic chemistry between her stewart was subtle charming lionel barrymore was towering as greedy old skinflint who was trying take over town thomas mitchell plays one my favorite characters as bumbling uncle billy probably his most memorable role this film is number eleven afis list best films century it was nominated five academy awards won none it was swept 1947 by best years our lives great film that won seven oscars that year but my opinion was lesser film history has corrected that minor injustice by rendering its wonderful life enduring classic that is viewed loved by generation after generation course i rated it 10 10 i cant wait see it again this christmas,0.6462991718426502,0.4153209109730849,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.,"This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.",wonderful film that should be watched again again,this is one best films all time without doubt i challenge anyone watch this film not be touched if you can you have no heart james stewart is one my favourite actors this film he acts so naturally you even forget hes actor playing part you really believe his story youre pulled roller coaster emotions throughout this film by no means is this light hearted look at life as many believe this is not rose tinted look at wonderful life we have this is dark downtrodden start film where lead character is about commit suicide however it is beautiful film is one few that you can watch again again walk away with same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it,0.5391025641025641,0.3576923076923077,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"

Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be. Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst. Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience.

,Atop my Top Ten,"I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not.

9.0,Best feel good movie ever? Quite possibly.,"Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.",best feel good movie ever quite possibly,heres new definition cold hearted man or woman who remains completely untouched by 1946 capra classic its wonderful life you cant not be moved by this wonderful little gem acting is all great one films greatest strengths me is making george bailey star movie played by james stewart nice normal man hes not perfect thats pretty much essential films success because bailey could be any man lesson movie is fairly simple we all have our role play world we are all important most movies would make this into schmaltzy affair but capra delivered touching heart warming tale bailey consistently denies himself allow others live as he sacrifices his life make sure people can have enough money avoid having sell their soul debt evil h potter alas not harry potter his complete utter humility is great he doesnt see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel clarence shows him again clarence isnt played usual clich d manner but more as believable character who honestly loves bailey his strengths movie is success because you cant but want bailey succeed manner which he does could be classified as corny but because its so deserved that doesnt matter music set pieces all touches add wonderful movie give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful lovely mood lifter 8 8 10,0.6382254601766797,0.29394863266814486,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.34}"

The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off.

10.0,It's a Wonderful Life,"One of the best family movies I have ever seen, the storyline is amazing and puts hope in your heart. When the movie is over, when you feel useless in life, watch the movie and your thinking will change and you will know that you have a positive impact on the lives of the people you know.

10.0,So is the movie...,"Review edited and therefore quite choppy due to maximum word limit.  Has there ever been a truer and more heartfelt character than George Bailey? This is a man whose life is one of great significance, but he, like all of us, does not always realize that this is so. He does not recognize his impact on the world until an angel erases his existence like chalk on a board. It is then that he is hit by the fact that one man's failing life isn't always as inconsequential as it may seem. We all remember when Clarence (Henry Travers) first appears on that snowy bridge and saves George Bailey (James Stewart) from committing suicide. He explains nonchalantly that he is an angel and George is incredulous--until Clarence wipes away his entire past. His mother doesn't recognize him. George tells her about his uncle as a source of belief. She states that his uncle has been dead for some time, now. The best scene in the entire film is that following when George is thrown out by his mother. He runs towards the camera in an intense wide shot, his face registering emotions of fear, horror, and ultimately the horrid understanding of what has happened. This role is the highlight of James Stewart's career--he never came anywhere close to the superb performance he gives in this movie. There is a reason it was his favorite film he ever starred in. Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is the grown image of all of us: As a child he dreamed of nothing but exotic locations and adventurous travels to foreign lands. But now he is a family man, a father and a husband. He has left behind his silly bachelor notions, but they still come back to haunt him. Bailey owns the town savings and loan, left to him by his father. The cranky Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants complete monopoly over the town, and all that stands in his way is Bailey and his little bank. But Bailey, an inner disgust and hatred towards Potter brewing since his childhood days, refuses to cave in and give it all away. Then one day, George's absentminded and quite eccentric uncle (Thomas Mitchell), misplaces a large sum of money, leaving George hopeless and Potter with a serious advantage. After blowing up at his wife (Donna Reed) and kids at home, George gets drunk at a local bar, is scorned at by a schoolteacher's wife, and left dazed and confused, walking through the snowy town at night during the happy Christmas season without a hope in the world. Battered and delirious, thinking back over his apparently pointless and wasted life, he contemplates suicide. He prays to God and wishes that he had never existed. Which is why Clarence comes down from heaven to sort things out and answer his prayer. Essentially bombing at the box office when it was first released, and then proceeding to fall into copyright problems for years, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" resurfaced only years later when it was brought back into the public domain circa 1970. When other channels were airing expensive Hollywood movies during the Christmas season, PBS picked up the film and played it as a counter attack, a weak hope prevailing in them that the classic film buffs out there would tune in. They did. And so did families across the nation. Every year the ratings got stronger and stronger and now, almost sixty years following the movie's initial release, it is considered a holiday tradition. George considers suicide as a way of escaping his problems without really thinking over the possible outcomes given his final choice. He looks back upon his life as wasted potential; he wanted to become an adventurer, break his family's small-town tradition and become something huge. Mentally scanning his life to the point in time when he stands on that bridge, George Bailey believes that he has simply and truly created a waste of space. He's ready to end his (assumed) pointless life when his entire point of view is wholly altered by the power of God. George suddenly realizes that though he never lived out his boyhood fantasies, he did so much more than he ever dreamed of. He saved his brother's life, which resulted in a huge impact in later years; he made an influence in the lives of others and brought peace and harmony to an otherwise small town by prevailing at the requests of Mr. Potter; he married a beautiful wife and had children, all of whom will no doubt have some measure of significance later in the world. And his wish on that bridge was that he had never been born. Often I am asked to name my favorite movie, and though I ignore requests and state that I have not seen every existing movie and therefore my judgment carries no significance, I have the lightest whimsy that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" may be my favorite motion picture to date. I cherish few other films just as close, but to me, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is more moving than ""Casablanca,"" a better study of one man's life than ""Citizen Kane,"" and a movie that will live on in the hearts and memory of viewers long after we are gone. I believe that this is the definitive Americana motion picture, regardless of how I compare it to my other favorites, which may carry the same weight but not the same true significance. Few films come as close to the heart as ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And few films come as close to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" at all, for that matter. 5/5.",so is movie,review edited therefore quite choppy due maximum word limit has there ever been truer more heartfelt character than george bailey this is man whose life is one great significance but he like all us does not always realize that this is so he does not recognize his impact world until angel erases his existence like chalk board it is then that he is hit by fact that one mans failing life isnt always as inconsequential as it may seem we all remember when clarence henry travers first appears that snowy bridge saves george bailey james stewart committing suicide he explains nonchalantly that he is angel george is incredulous until clarence wipes away his entire past his mother doesnt recognize him george tells her about his uncle as source belief she states that his uncle has been dead some time now best scene entire film is that following when george is thrown out by his mother he runs towards camera intense wide shot his face registering emotions fear horror ultimately horrid understanding what has happened this role is highlight james stewarts career he never came anywhere close superb performance he gives this movie there is reason it was his favorite film he ever starred stewarts portrayal george bailey is grown image all us as child he dreamed nothing but exotic locations adventurous travels foreign lands but now he is family man father husband he has left behind his silly bachelor notions but they still come back haunt him bailey owns town savings loan left him by his father cranky mr potter lionel barrymore wants complete monopoly over town all that stands his way is bailey his little bank but bailey inner disgust hatred towards potter brewing since his childhood days refuses cave give it all away then one day georges absentminded quite eccentric uncle thomas mitchell misplaces large sum money leaving george hopeless potter with serious advantage after blowing up at his wife donna reed kids at home george gets drunk at local bar is scorned at by schoolteachers wife left dazed confused walking through snowy town at night during happy christmas season without hope world battered delirious thinking back over his apparently pointless wasted life he contemplates suicide he prays god wishes that he had never existed which is why clarence comes down heaven sort things out answer his prayer essentially bombing at box office when it was first released then proceeding fall into copyright problems years its wonderful life resurfaced only years later when it was brought back into public domain circa 1970 when other channels were airing expensive hollywood movies during christmas season pbs picked up film played it as counter attack weak hope prevailing them that classic film buffs out there would tune they did so did families across nation every year ratings got stronger stronger now almost sixty years following movies initial release it is considered holiday tradition george considers suicide as way escaping his problems without really thinking over possible outcomes given his final choice he looks back upon his life as wasted potential he wanted become adventurer break his familys small town tradition become something huge mentally scanning his life point time when he stands that bridge george bailey believes that he has simply truly created waste space hes ready end his assumed pointless life when his entire point view is wholly altered by power god george suddenly realizes that though he never lived out his boyhood fantasies he did so much more than he ever dreamed he saved his brothers life which resulted huge impact later years he made influence lives others brought peace harmony otherwise small town by prevailing at requests mr potter he married beautiful wife had children all whom will no doubt have some measure significance later world his wish that bridge was that he had never been born often i am asked name my favorite movie though i ignore requests state that i have not seen every existing movie therefore my judgment carries no significance i have lightest whimsy that its wonderful life may be my favorite motion picture date i cherish few other films just as close but me its wonderful life is more moving than casablanca better study one mans life than citizen kane movie that will live hearts memory viewers long after we are gone i believe that this is definitive americana motion picture regardless how i compare it my other favorites which may carry same weight but not same true significance few films come as close heart as its wonderful life few films come as close its wonderful life at all that matter 5 5,0.4763993316624895,0.10200975924660137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"

9.0,Great Christmas (and all year round) movie,"Frank Capra's 1946 drama/fantasy IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is one of the best-remembered films of all time, and it's no surprise; this moralistic tale of human suffering, poverty, greed, courage and determination is one that resounds through the ages, particularly so in our modern age of fat-cat bankers and a growing gap between rich and poor.James Stewart gives a dependably decent turn as George Bailey, a family man who finds himself at the mercy of Lionel Barrymore's criminal banker, Mr. Potter. What follows is lengthy and often profound, an occasionally twee but ultimately moving exploration of the human character and the effect one man can have on his world.What I particularly liked about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is the way that every part of the narrative hangs together without any unnecessary extras. Even the little bits like the accident on the ice at the outset later come back to haunt our characters. It's very well written, and expertly directed by Frank Capra; an unashamedly old-fashioned, heart-warming and sentimental piece of movie-making on a grand scale.

The characters, the situations, the message all come together in a way that intrinsically defines it as a Christmas movie, but when you get right down to it, the film transcends Christmas in a way that's truly heartwarming and magical. Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying.

I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top.

10.0,Each man's life touches so many others.,"In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. we obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.In a return to the Christmas theme that he earlier used in 1941 classic ""Meet John Doe"", director Frank Capra saves the seasonal Twist of the story for the film's last half-hour. An unseen angel is sent to a small town to aid a possible suicide victim when the actions of the greedy and evil Lionel Barrymore threatens to send him to prison for embezzlement. Stewart's life is seen in flashbacks for much of the film, but when the film joins the present day, it is almost like it has gone some 70 years into the future to today with Barrymore representing the truly evil Scrooge like banker who wants to control everybody's life.It is quite a shocker to see Barrymore playing such a nasty, evil man after playing the kindly Dr. Gillespie in the series of MGM medical dramas. he is basically expanding the role of Scrooge which he did on radio for many years and adds an essence of true malevolence to his characterization. Even Scrooge wasn't as crass as his character here. It seems to be a continuation of the role that Edward Arnold played so beautifully in Capra's earlier films ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"".The lovely Donna Reed crosses over from MGM ingenue to classy leading lady, adding much depth to her role of Stewart's girlfriend, later wife, with Beulah Bondi saintly as usual his lovable mother. (Bondi played Stewart's mother in so many films and on TV that it is obvious that somehow in real life, he did call her ma.) Then there's Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, Thomas Mitchell as Stewart's rascal uncle, and of course Henry Travers as Clarence, the angel who desperately wants his wings. The smaller roles are filled out by many familiar actors, some of whom were in pretty much every Capra film, as well as Danny Mummert and Larry Simms, both from the ""Blondie"" series and Karolyn Grimes, an underrated child star who stole many movie programmers in the mid-1940s.There are so many other things to credit for this film's excellence beyond the cast and direction, namely the brilliant script, fast pacing and brilliant production design. This film holds up regardless of whether you see it in its original black-and-white form or it's decently restored colorized version. I'm not in favor of colorizing classic movies, but somehow this one actually came out all right. while I watch this one every other year rather than every year, I can say that I am continuously touched and discover new seems in its that I had not seen before.

10.0,One of the Most Beautiful Movies of the Cinema History Ever,"On the Christmas Eve of Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black & white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000. This is the type of movie that a lover of cinema will never get tired of watching many times.

10.0,FRANK CAPRA'S OPUS,"If you were to ask me what Holiday-themed film I enjoy the most and never get tired watching, my answer would invariably be, Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946).Of course, there are many other great holiday movies that are also genuine cinematic treasures, even though they're not as well known as ""It's A Wonderful Life."" My ""must watch"" holiday list includes many of the black and white classics I have previously reviewed on IMDb such as, ""Holiday Inn (1942),""It Happened On 5th Avenue,"" (1947), A Christmas Carol (1951),"" ""Christmas In Connecticut,"" (1945) and although it's in color, ""White Christmas"" (1954). And for good measure I still immensely enjoy watching ""Home Alone 1 & 2"" (1990-1992) and the charming trilogy, ""The Santa Clause"" (1994-2004-2006).Nevertheless, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the singular holiday film that continues to resonate with me on multiple levels. It is a supremely powerful story of self-worth and destiny, bolstered by superb acting, laced with unforgettable characters like George Bailey, Clarence Oddbody, and Mr. Potter, thoughtful cinematography which perfectly captures the small town ambiance of Bedford Falls, sharp editing (no surprise since Capra began his film career as an editor), a beautiful score by Russian composer Dimitri Tiomkin, and more memorable quotes than could ever be listed here.Ironically, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" may never have popped up on anyone's cinematic radar screen had the proper copyright ownership documents been registered. How this error occurred is fascinating.The original 1945 ownership of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" belonged to Liberty Films, an independent motion picture production company created by the film's brilliant director, Frank Capra. The following year, Liberty was purchased by Paramount. Ten years later, in 1955, M. & A. Alexander subsequently purchased the rights to the short story, ""The Greatest Gift,"" on which the film was based. With the purchase also came the rights to the film itself, television syndication, and the music score. Shortly thereafter, National Telefilm Associates (NTA) became the new owner. Amazingly, a clerical error meant NTA had neglected to renew its copyright. By 1974, the movie fell into the ""public domain.""In essence, Capra's masterpiece no longer had copyright protection, and therefore, anyone could make copies of the film, package it anyway they chose, all without having to pay for it. Because of this, television studios began broadcasting ""It's A Wonderful Life"" during the Christmas holidays, while dozens of other companies packaged and sold the film in various media forms such as VHS, and later, Laser Disc and DVD. The good news- This nearly forgotten film was now being seen for the first time by millions of people. The bad news - Many of the reproductions were of poor quality, with some crudely edited down from the original 131 minute run time into a shorter length to accommodate TV scheduling. Nevertheless, these unusual series of events managed to breathe new life into Capra's stunning film for future generations.As often occurs with films destined for immortality, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was initially a financial box office failure, although it was nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and has been revered by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.There's nothing more I can add to this review that hasn't been covered already by other astute IMDb reviewers, but I will say that if you have still not seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"" by now (2021) then stop whatever you're doing and buy the BR, DVD, or stream it. I'm confident even after your first viewing you are going to feel like you've just seen one of the greatest films ever made, and you would be absolutely right!No spoilers here as usual but I will reveal that while much of the film happens in the fictional town of Bedford Falls during a very cold, snowy, Wintery Christmas holiday, it was actually filmed in Southern California which was experiencing a sweltering record heat wave!",frank capras opus,if you were ask me what holiday themed film i enjoy most never get tired watching my answer would invariably be frank capras its wonderful life 1946 course there are many other great holiday movies that are also genuine cinematic treasures even though theyre not as well known as its wonderful life my must watch holiday list includes many black white classics i have previously reviewed imdb such as holiday inn 1942 it happened 5th avenue 1947 christmas carol 1951 christmas connecticut 1945 although its color white christmas 1954 good measure i still immensely enjoy watching home alone 1 2 1990 1992 charming trilogy santa clause 1994 2004 2006 nevertheless its wonderful life is singular holiday film that continues resonate with me multiple levels it is supremely powerful story self worth destiny bolstered by superb acting laced with unforgettable characters like george bailey clarence oddbody mr potter thoughtful cinematography which perfectly captures small town ambiance bedford falls sharp editing no surprise since capra began his film career as editor beautiful score by russian composer dimitri tiomkin more memorable quotes than could ever be listed here ironically its wonderful life may never have popped up anyones cinematic radar screen had proper copyright ownership documents been registered how this error occurred is fascinating original 1945 ownership its wonderful life belonged liberty films independent motion picture production company created by films brilliant director frank capra following year liberty was purchased by paramount ten years later 1955 m alexander subsequently purchased rights short story greatest gift which film was based with purchase also came rights film itself television syndication music score shortly thereafter national telefilm associates nta became new owner amazingly clerical error meant nta had neglected renew its copyright by 1974 movie fell into public domain essence capras masterpiece no longer had copyright protection therefore anyone could make copies film package it anyway they chose all without having pay it because this television studios began broadcasting its wonderful life during christmas holidays while dozens other companies packaged sold film various media forms such as vhs later laser disc dvd good news this nearly forgotten film was now being seen first time by millions people bad news many reproductions were poor quality with some crudely edited down original 131 minute run time into shorter length accommodate tv scheduling nevertheless these unusual series events managed breathe new life into capras stunning film future generations as often occurs with films destined immortality its wonderful life was initially financial box office failure although it was nominated five academy awards including best picture has been revered by american film institute as one 100 best american films ever made theres nothing more i can add this review that hasnt been covered already by other astute imdb reviewers but i will say that if you have still not seen its wonderful life by now 2021 then stop whatever youre doing buy br dvd or stream it im confident even after your first viewing you are going feel like youve just seen one greatest films ever made you would be absolutely right no spoilers here as usual but i will reveal that while much film happens fictional town bedford falls during very cold snowy wintery christmas holiday it was actually filmed southern california which was experiencing sweltering record heat wave,0.510351949637664,0.2804712747569891,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,No man is a failure who has friends,"Even though it is nowadays considered one of the best christmas movies ever, It's a Wonderful Life was not always seen that way. People at the time thought it was barely mediocre, and that it would probably be forgotten about in a year or two, but 70 years later it has endured. So why is this? At first, I didn't really know whether or not I should consider it a christmas movie, because it does have the aesthetic of the holiday, but a big middle portion of the film doesn't really have a holiday feel to it. In fact, it's actually pretty depressing. I think this movie is constantly remembered as one of the best because it has a very original idea. The story is about a guy named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who intends to kill himself on Christmas Eve because his life is turning into a disaster. An angel is sent from heaven in order to show him how even though he might not realize it right now, his life has meaning to others. Before the angel, Clarence, decides to interfere in George's life, we are shown the events that happened throughout his life starting with his childhood. We see how as a 12 year old in 1919, George is sledding with his brother Harry but falls into a pool of ice water, costing him the use of one of his ears for the rest of his life. We also see how George is lusted after by a young girl named Mary (Donna Reed), who later comes back into his life during his time in college. Sadly, George's father dies soon after, and Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), wants to dissolve George's father's former business now that he is dead. George, with the help of his uncle Billy, run the company now. Under George's direction, his company builds Bailey Park, which is a housing project designed to challenge Potter's control of the town. Potter even calls George into his office and offers to make him his assistant for almost half a million (modern) dollars, but George declines, knowing his real objective is to shut down his father's business. Later on, World War 2 is underway, and George is not drafted because of his partial deafness. His brother Harry becomes a fighter ace and shoots down a japanese plane that was about to bomb a transport ship. Billy goes to rub in Potter's face the fact that one of his relatives is a war hero, but inadvertently misplaces a huge amount of money in Potter's office. A bank examiner then calls out George's company on the missing money, and George realizes he's now in serious trouble, possibly facing jail time. He tries to figure out where in the world the missing money could be, and takes out his bad mood on his innocent family members in the meantime, since he is now married to Mary. Desperate, George heads to Potter in order to surrender his life insurance policy to him to make up for the lost cash, but Potter tells him he's calling the police anyway. George runs away and eventually comes to a bridge, where he sees someone drowning in the freezing water below. After diving in and saving him, it's revealed that the man is Clarence, George's guardian angel, but George doesn't believe him. He says he wishes he never existed, and the angel grants this wish. George's town is now called Pottersville, there's crime everywhere, and nobody (even his own family members) recognize him anymore. He learns that Bailey park is now a cemetery, and George finds that his brother Harry is dead, drowned in a lake at age 9. This means all the men on the transport ship in ww2 were killed, since Harry wasn't there to rescue them. George even sees his wife Mary, who's now a librarian, but she doesn't recognize him either. Now convinced the world is horrible without him in it, George pleads with Clarence to give him his old life back. It does come back, and George rushes home to eagerly await being arrested. Just when it looks like he is actually going to be taken into custody, the townspeople pull through and show up at George's house to make up for the missing 8000 dollars. George also receives a final thank you note from Clarence, saying that he finally has wings now because he was able to successfully help George. What a wonderful movie. It isn't everyday when I watch something that is worth seeing every holiday season, but now that I've seen this, I can completely understand its legendary reputation. Everything about this film is great. There's way too many aspects of it that are worthy of praise, so I'm not going to go over all of them. I will say though that the acting is truly worthy of a classic movie, and both Stewart and Donna Reed live up to their reputations. As George, Jimmy Stewart is an anxious, depressed person who doesn't know what his next move is going to be. He's shown to love Mary a lot, but is more frustrated the longer the film goes on by the threat of Potter blackmailing him. He takes his hate out on his family who simply don't deserve it. He knows he shouldn't, and he feels bad that he did, so he mistakenly assumes that by just literally dropping dead, he would be doing the world a favor. Clarence later shows him how wrong he is. Donna Reed as Mary is the love of George's life ever since he was a kid. It's clear to see why she hates to see him so bitter, especially around christmastime. Lionel Barrymore as Potter does his job really well. He's everything you want to see in an antagonist. He always belittles George and makes him feel unimportant, and intends to make life really difficult for him by closing down his company. Even Gloria Grahame shows up at one point. In my opinion, this is an odd holiday movie because there is a big portion of it that doesn't feel like christmas, but the second half of it makes it worthwhile. It reminds me a lot of A Christmas Carol, because Scrooge sees how horrible his world will be if he doesn't change, and so he decides to become a better person. To be clear, It's a Wonderful Life truly earns its praise as not just one of the best christmas movies, but one of the best movies, period. Capra really did know how to make films.",no man is failure who has friends,even though it is nowadays considered one best christmas movies ever its wonderful life was not always seen that way people

9.0,An all-time classic,"One of the films that has been on my watchlist the longest. I finally understand why this is regularly listed as peoples' favourite film, and why it has become the ultimate Christmas staple.Jimmy Stewart was fantastic in this. I can't help but feel he brought some of his own wartime experiences into this role and the way he portrays George Bailey at his most vulnerable. The rest of the cast were fantastic too. Special mention to Donna Reed as the beautiful Mary, and Henry Travers as Clarence, who definitely had me laughing more than once.This didn't actually feel like a traditional Christmas film for most of it. In some ways, that just makes it even more universal and timeless in its appeal.The plot and originality have been reproduced in countless ways ever since. It's easy to see why. You can't help but think about your own life at times, and somehow come out the other side a little more grateful, a little more optimistic. Any film that can do that is worth its weight in gold.A well-deserved classic and one I'm grateful to have finally seen.Those final scenes. Damn. Is someone cutting onions in here?",all time classic,one films that has been my watchlist longest i finally understand why this is regularly listed as peoples favourite film why it has become ultimate christmas staple jimmy stewart was fantastic this i cant help but feel he brought some his own wartime experiences into this role way he portrays george bailey at his most vulnerable rest cast were fantastic too special mention donna reed as beautiful mary henry travers as clarence who definitely had me laughing more than once this didnt actually feel like traditional christmas film most it some ways that just makes it even more universal timeless its appeal plot originality have been reproduced countless ways ever since its easy see why you cant help but think about your own life at times somehow come out other side little more grateful little more optimistic any film that can do that is worth its weight gold well deserved classic one im grateful have finally seen those final scenes damn is someone cutting onions here,0.5916134940328488,0.18302611367127497,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,Sheer brilliance!,"After strong performances in films such as ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"", James Stewart confirmed his status as one of the greats with his performance as George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"". This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It's movie that makes you think, about life in general and how each person makes a difference, and about how great life can be (hence the title ""It's a Wonderful Life). Whilst making you think, it also entertains with many light hearted moments, particularly towards the end of the film. The direction, sound and casting in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are second to none. Yet it is the fact that almost any person can watch this movie and come away feeling inspired that makes it easily the best movie of all time!A 10/10 without a doubt!",sheer brilliance,after strong performances films such as mr smith goes washington philadelphia story james stewart confirmed his status as one greats with his performance as george bailey its wonderful life this movie is without doubt best all time its wonderful life is movie that you can watch over over again its movie that makes you think about life general how each person makes difference about how great life can be hence title its wonderful life whilst making you think it also entertains with many light hearted moments particularly towards end film direction sound casting its wonderful life are second none yet it is fact that almost any person can watch this movie come away feeling inspired that makes it easily best movie all time 10 10 without doubt,0.6333333333333334,0.538235294117647,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,A Wonderful Film with a Cutting Edge,"Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included. It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things. George Bailey is in trouble. He has decided to end it all. The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle. George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities. There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene. George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll. He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living. He has gifts he doesn't realize. He has family. He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is. Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it. His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over. His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank. George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously. It can be painful to watch sometimes. The best scenes are the ones where George never existed. His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher. When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others. They are superb. It's a question all of us have wrestled with: ""What if we had never existed?"" There is no peer in Capra's canon. I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage. We need to see things as they should be. I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts. This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place.",wonderful film with cutting edge,once again my two cents worth film that is darling so many people myself included it has its uplifting conclusion theme that every life has its purpose great scheme things george bailey is trouble he has decided end it all thought jail disgrace is more than he can handle georges life has been continual parade missed opportunities there is layer pain just above surface nearly every scene george is victim this series disappointments takes its toll he eventually becomes hardened frustrated but because he is honorable he goes about business living he has gifts he doesnt realize he has family he has status while not often appreciated he is unfortunately we dont always share our love admiration with those who deserve it his sense adventure birth has been clutched him over over his bad ear makes army impossibility his fathers death forces him run business he wants run away even his honeymoon money is used prevent run bank george never knows his importance until henry travers well meaning angel comes along i love this movie but i also take it seriously it can be painful watch sometimes best scenes are ones where george never existed his despair is evident tension builds higher higher when he comes back such weight that is lifted jimmy stewart is at top his acting form i loved him as living human being as actor he portrays kindness i believe world should have then there is donna reed lionel barrymore ward bond all others they are superb its question all us have wrestled with what if we had never existed there is no peer capras canon i truly believe that this is necessary part our heritage we need see things as they should be i love christmas because it at least portends be time we all look at our gifts this movie is gift world one we can learn over over even if events never took place,0.4576190476190476,0.13119047619047622,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10.0,A man receives a rare gift,"Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of ""Sinbad"" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release. For that reason, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them. James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film. George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we're all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going.
