10.0,"Despite a lot of plot flaws and conveniences, this really is one of the best films ever made.","Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",despite lot plot flaws conveniences this really is one best films ever made,ah yes film that propelled leonardi dicapro super stardom became first film gross 1 billion stayed top box office charts 12 years only be kicked off top by another james cameron film avatar it is said titanic is film with most continuity errors all films despite this though film was indeed masterpiece sheer scale sets entire production were simply mind blowing sinking titanic was greatest ship sinking scene ever was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk ship off course that was not case though as it were all very elaborate sets most which were destroyed during making film leonardo made very likable hero quite frankly one lot guys can relate young lovers were so different yet so alike their love story was almost endearing i must admit jumping backwards forwards time was bit unnecessary resulted overlong epic they should only have told 1912 story apart that film was thrilling exciting fascinating every sense word,0.5940051020408165,0.29761904761904756,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,Actually it got better for me,"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fianc√©, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10",actually it got better me,back 1997 do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research unfortunate death princess diana marlins won world series woman gave birth septuplets this was also big year release titanic one biggest films all time tale about ship dreams about boy girl who fall love but are torn apart by their social class at height their emotional commitment ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected titanic be as huge as it was movie was bigger than life had millions fans 85 them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at time course saw movie multiple times it was film that made me believe that love that jack rose shared was so real beautiful at time i felt that titanic could do no wrong course i grew up didnt watch film since i was 14 couple years ago i saw film dvd 5 99 figured that it was good price see what i thought about movie now was it worth hype was it really best movie all time was that leonardos real nose ok i know thats silly say but i did re watch film being completely honest here titanic is great movie it delivered romance humor disaster emotions took us this incredible maiden voyage film starts with brock lovett his team exploring wreck rms titanic searching necklace set with valuable blue diamond called heart ocean unsuccessful they instead discover drawing young woman wearing heart ocean dated day titanic sank 101 year old rose dawson calvert learns drawing contacts lovett inform him she is woman drawing when asked if she knew whereabouts necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard titanic revealing first time that she was rose dewitt bukater 1912 upper class 17 year old rose boards ship with her controlling fianc cal hockley her desperate money mother ruth dewitt bukater distraught frustrated by her engagement rose attempts suicide by jumping stern before she leaps drifter artist named jack dawson intervenes who convinces her not jump jack rose strike up tentative friendship as she thanks him saving her life he shares stories his adventures traveling sketching their bond deepens when they leave first class formal dinner wealthy much livelier gathering dancing music beer third class after revealing their love each other wish leave together when ship docks they then witness ships fatal collision with iceberg now must escape together so does titanic live up its hype i still say that this is great movie watch i think that there were still are quite few haters that some reason just want trash movie because it had won ton awards leo mania was born at time everyone is entitled opinion but please dont let haters bother you watching this great movie it has great acting amazing effects beautiful costumes outstanding sets well written story still looks flawless love it or hate it you have admit this movie didnt get lot hype just because leos baby face or kates amazing ability cry sight this film is something special otherwise i dont think wed still be talking about it so many years later kate leo had this amazing chemistry that my opinion made it one greatest love stories all time despite story not being most original with rich girl loves poor boy plot i think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together james cameron extreme perfectionist that he is went over time money budgets titanic but this was his baby it paid off very well james had captured everything about titanic sinking so well he respectfully shows what terror victims went through that night made sure that this wasnt just love story but remember those who lost their lives tragic voyage he had every right my opinion scream im king world at oscars because this movie blew everyone out water no pun intended you know what im going admit it i love titanic even past my teen years i absolutely adore this movie it will always hold special place my heart it has too since i saw this film 8 times theater when it was released remember one thing be true yourself dont follow crowd lovers or haters if you go with hype youre always going go crazy over film before viewing it then if you thought film was just alright some reason it comes off as worst movie ever i do recommend titanic its great one sure go down classics one day 10 10,0.5837344720496893,0.25042545015371104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,This was one of the few movies that actually brought me to tears.,"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack.

10.0,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.",standing ovation 10 stars out 10,stage curtains open not since advent 1995 film braveheart have i ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into movie as i was with titanic i knew going just trailer word mouth it was going be good but i had no idea ride i was when lights dimmed theater that night i have never understood still dont understand negative backlash that ive read heard when it come this epic film because it is just that epic every way shape or form we follow along as young wayfarer named jack leonardo dicaprio wins ticket board titanic game chance during its fateful voyage he meets falls upper class girl named rose kate winslet under thumb her demanding fiance billy zane her narrow minded mother rose is introduced different side life by jack he helps her find her own individuality independence alienating her life that she already despises she must now decide if shell choose stay where she is or leave have life with jack decision that is further compounded when mighty ship strikes iceberg leading eye popping conclusion what makes this film work is love story lot negative reviews ive read complain because there is love story but without it this movie doesnt work i am not interested watching biography about titanic i want good story this movie certainly delivers that i was completely invested jack rose when ship began sink i was with them both every step way i highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out 10 event ship sinking alone was awe inspiring you are right there scene i could not take my eyes off screen direction is tight special effects phenomenal acting completely believable dicaprio winslet had perfect chemistry i was affected moved by titanic even knowing outcome i will happily get board again again,0.5584523809523809,0.23371031746031745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,My review is this film's 2400th....so what more can I say?!,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once.",my review is this films 2400th so what more can i say,titanic won bazillion oscars is considered classic by many it now counting this one has 2400 reviews so what more can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well very little that is why this review is rather short i give film 9 because it isnt perfect some characters me seemed bit simplistic but no matter if you like them or not theres no denying awesomeness film after all it looks like you are huge cruise ship special effects wreck this isnt exactly spoiler are amazing so like story or not film is staggering watch particularly big screen now that i think about this this is exactly how i viewed director camerons other huge success avatar well worth seeing once,0.47017195767195763,0.258614417989418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy.

9.0,A Superb Epic,"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10",superb epic,i avoided watching this film longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as over hyped over blown overly romanticized piece hollywood schmaltz i wanted nothing do with it i never watched it theatre i shook my head disbelief at 11 academy awards even though i had never seen it then i was asked be judge at high school public speaking contest one girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me said you might be right but if she liked movie that much maybe shell want learn more about real titanic movie must have done something right get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared pay tv ok i thought ill give it look see i didnt want like it i didnt i loved it what great movie where start first directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does superb job creating almost you are there type atmosphere gaiety life aboard most elegant ship world nonchalance as news iceberg first spreads then rising sense panic you dont just watch it you really do feel it then performances lead performances kate winslet as rose leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent winslets being superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girl poor boy characters down perfect t i thought my opinion though stealing show was frances fisher as roses mother she was perfect as snobby aristocrat you could feel fear loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then details im no expert sinking titanic but i have reasonable general knowledge this film does super job recreating historical details accurately then weaving them seamlessly around fictional romance very impressive indeed then song who can watch this movie not be taken with celine dions performance my heart goes problems well romance was perhaps too contrived sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly steerage first class i know he was invited first time but he seems keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there while realities separation social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when steerage passengers were going be left locked down there after ship hit iceberg while first class folks got enjoy half empty lifeboats minor quibble though this is truly excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive 9 10,0.5472836661546339,0.31517793138760875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"

10.0,"One of many movies and many stories from the ship of dreams, but still floats at the top of the list.","From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it.

10.0,Titanic masterpiece: an emotional and visual thrill ride,"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other.

The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film.

I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version.

,bravo,"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor. Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake. I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them. But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie. Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet). But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning. Bravo to Cameron. He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much. James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film.

,"Despite some glaring faults,Cameron's mixing of romance with real life disaster is still impressive and occasionally brilliant","It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say ""I'm king of the world"" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fianc√©e,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",despite some glaring faults camerons mixing romance with real life disaster is still impressive occasionally brilliant,its really quite odd when titanic first came out reviews were mixed but public generally loved it those who disliked film were definitely minority over years it has became somewhat fashionable slag titanic off even if great many those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such enormous hit cinemas titanic is flawed definitely sometimes greatly so however its also tremendous achievement its director james cameron mixing real disaster with romance is harder do than some might think maybe he did have right say im king world when film won best picture at oscars just once modern day opening is excellent making effective use some camerons real footage he took sunken titanic there is real sense mystery than we flash back titanic being boarded film stalls just little around two hours attention detail is amazing even all cutlery matched you know there is nothing wrong with extremely slow build up action think seven samourai however central romance between leo kate is often badly written unconvincing start kates rose would certainly not have done two things she does film as quickly as she did obviously thousands teenage girls seeing film 1997 would disagree with my views we also have suffer cameron constantly labouring point that poor people ship are better than rich people however final 80 or so minutes detailing sinking is simply brilliant film making suspense is built expertly even though we know what will happen climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive perhaps there is little two much emphasis central couple but there are some truly moving moments it really feels true although course cameron did play with facts little here there as at least one descendant one survivors has pointed out following sequence involving boats is extremely haunting with some especially good use sound as final scene it does manage be pretty moving its schmaltzy but it works though hardly original think somewhere time various 40s romantic fantasies titanic has some excellent use cgi watch out transitions present past sunken ship one glaringly bad special effect iceberg which looks like polystyrene james horners best selling score is really quite poor only occasionally brings emotion it should do performances are generally excellent sometimes succeed overcoming some thin characterisation such as billy zane as roses fianc e who even has suffer with far too much eye make up overall titanic is still worth seeing sometimes it really does hit heights that it should it succeeds more than it fails which is impressive film as ambitious as this,0.5252299783549784,0.19486607142857137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.24}"
