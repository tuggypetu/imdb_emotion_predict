10.0,A brilliant masterpiece from a masterful director,"""Rashomon"" was Akira Kurosawa's first national hit (becoming, at the time, the highest-grossing foreign film in America) and even gained an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, but almost sixty years later it still hasn't lost any of its impact. It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of all-time, but unlike some other movies, it is not a film that feels dated. The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and on-par with the cinema of today -- this isn't a movie where you say, ""Yeah, fifty years ago it might have been different, but now it's done in all the movies."" Kurosawa's techniques are still superior to most of his imitators. Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film, ""Basic,"" which copies a good portion of ""Rashomon's"" concept. Which is the better film? It's not a hard choice.The film begins under a structure which reads ""Rashomon"" on its exterior, in a small Japanese village. It's raining outside and a woodcutter (Takashi Shumura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) inadvertently find themselves in the company of a wandering commoner (Kichijiro Ueda), and as he asks them what is the matter they both begin to relay the most horrific story they claim to know -- of a brutal murder a few days prior.Kurosawa then switches to flashback and we see three different versions of the exact same event -- the slaying of an innocent man (the murderer played by Kurosawa film regular Toshirô Mifune) in the woods outside the village. Was it because of lust? Betrayal? Envy? Or insanity? We hear from the murderer, the wife of the victim, and a woman channeling the spirit of the dead man.""Rashomon"" is brilliant. Some people have complained that the ending is a cop-out and sentimental hogwash, but I think Kurosawa was fond of sentimentality to a point (he uses a good deal of it in ""Ikiru"") but the difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed to many filmmakers of today is that he uses to to ENRICH the story, not provide an easy solution to all the problems.Is there resolution in the finale of ""Rashomon""? To a degree. But, like ""Ikiru,"" it also leaves an open answer to its audience -- this film questions us, and our humanity, and it says something about the human condition and our weaknesses as a species. Yet it also proposes that along with the evil is an inherent good, and in my opinion the message of ""Rashomon"" is just as important and effective as its film-making techniques and acting.",brilliant masterpiece masterful director,rashomon was akira kurosawas first national hit becoming at time highest grossing foreign film america even gained oscar best foreign film but almost sixty years later it still hasnt lost any its impact it is widely revered as one most influential films all time but unlike some other movies it is not film that feels dated revolutionary methods kurosawa are still effective par with cinema today this isnt movie where you say yeah fifty years ago it might have been different but now its done all movies kurosawas techniques are still superior most his imitators look at 2003 john mctiernan film basic which copies good portion rashomons concept which is better film its not hard choice film begins under structure which reads rashomon its exterior small japanese village its raining outside woodcutter takashi shumura priest minoru chiaki inadvertently find themselves company wandering commoner kichijiro ueda as he asks them what is matter they both begin relay most horrific story they claim know brutal murder few days prior kurosawa then switches flashback we see three different versions exact same event slaying innocent man murderer played by kurosawa film regular toshir mifune woods outside village was it because lust betrayal envy or insanity we hear murderer wife victim woman channeling spirit dead man rashomon is brilliant some people have complained that ending is cop out sentimental hogwash but i think kurosawa was fond sentimentality point he uses good deal it ikiru but difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed many filmmakers today is that he uses enrich story not provide easy solution all problems is there resolution finale rashomon degree but like ikiru it also leaves open answer its audience this film questions us our humanity it says something about human condition our weaknesses as species yet it also proposes that along with evil is inherent good my opinion message rashomon is just as important effective as its film making techniques acting,0.47938034188034195,0.16883680555555558,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.25}"
8.0,Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.,"To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the ""Best Foreign Film"" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rashômon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rashômon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being ""borrowed"". His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.While the characters were strong, the direction was flawless, and the story was compelling, there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashômon. This is the story of murder, betrayal, and rape and in any typical ""courthouse"" film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth. At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rashômon. Kurosawa gives us the ""black sheep"" of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story. As I began this film, I thought I was going to get a clear-cut story with honesty and troubled souls, but instead I was handed no prize at the end. What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end, but instead trapped still within the film. Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story, that there possibly is no way of knowing the true ""truth"". Four different souls, seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the ""truth"" may never be known. Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that ""it didn't exist"". Deep within Rashômon the truth is hidden, and it may never emerge, but that is what Kurosawa intended. A viewer could walk away from this film, after several viewings, and discover different truths about the characters and story. This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.Outside of these beautiful themes, Rashômon is a flawless film. From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction, there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor. To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history. In each of the stories he is portrayed differently (even in his own) and with precise execution he delivers every time. He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time. While some may see his acting as eccentric or over-the-top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute. When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved. Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife. While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease. When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.Overall, I thought that this was a near perfect film. Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories. I have seen the same passion in Ran, and it cannot be denied. My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it. I found myself watching it three times because I could not stay focused (outside factors) enough to see those darkly hidden themes. I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end. The fact that after hearing these stories of murder and rape, it doesn't stop one from continuing along a similar path. It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all!

10.0,"Kurosawa's first milestone, one of the top foreign films of the 20th century","Akira Kurosawa was one of those directors, the first from the Eastern hemisphere, to develop the form and structure of cinema in ways it hadn't been. The story he used for Rashomon is now, like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, and Yojimbo, a near archetype that at this point in the history of film has become formula and common knowledge for writers and directors. In that sense, Rashomon is as important and entertaining as a film as Citizen Kane, Battleship Potemkin, Rear Window, or Open City. Tee basic premise- Four different people give four different accounts on the rape and murder of a couple in the woods. A key ingredient to the success of Rashomon, is that the recollections given to the courts by the woman, the bandit, the as well as the four in discussion, is that their emotions reveal their humanity, even if their details reveal nothing, or everything. It's difficult to say whether character goes over story here, or if they have equal importance to understand Kurosawa's psychology with these people. The opening shot of the house is a perfect representation of the mature of the picture, something that has fallen apart over time due to disasters that go beyond control of individuals. The man who heard the testimonies of the trial says ""I don't understand"". This has been a discussed line, since essentially he's saying the point right up front. All the information won't ease his puzzlement. The three who discuss the details of the crimes and confessions are crucial- they speak for us, what our opinions might be, and we listen to each version of the story, the characters, the fears, the pride, the shame, and the search for judgment and/or truth in the situation.Along with being director and co-adapter, Kurosawa's mastery is revealed heavily in his use of editing- there are short, fleeting moments that hint, or rather pronounce, emotions and thoughts. For instance, when we first see Tajomaru, the bandit, played by action-legend Toshiro Mifune, he is looking up at the sky, bound in straps to keep him from moving, and for a second, or less than a second, there's a shot of what he sees in the sky, then back to his face which reveals an expression that borders on skeptical, and a bit crazed, or more. Mifune's part is of a barbarian, but all the more believable as a human barbarian since he acts as such with animal desires- he sees the woman in the woods, and knows he wants her, and while he reflects that he didn't have to have killed the man, he did as a last resort as a man with an urge. This is intensified by a sadistic flee with his actions. What's intriguing about that first description/recollection of the battle between him and the other man, is that it seems like it could be the truth, and to one viewer it could, and to another it seems like it could all be apart of his hyperactive and trapped imagination. And in the attack of the bandit on the woman, at first to him, it's like a game, then in later descriptions, he feels a little more un-easy, then later, it's of neither pleasure or discomfort, it just is. This kind of technique later happens with the woman who was victim (who has conviction, though is herself an archetype of Lifetime women), the presence who saw it ""all"", and with the man who in the beginning didn't understand. In each telling the expressions, the cut-aways, the lighting and movement by Kazuo Miyagawa, it's equally startling, exhilarating. That the film gives off such a hypnotic aura isn't surprising, or perhaps it is for those in the grips of the emotion of it all- the dead man's story is like the hook ripping into a twelve foot bass. The final accouter of the tale proves the most accurate to the common observer, yet Kurosawa knows that's not the point- if he made it as such to be bold AND had a definite concrete point, the ending would be as poignant when revealed is the truth, or what one could believe as the closest thing to it is. We know why that last person didn't want to get involved with the courts with what he knows: his story is no more a revelation, of any comfort or consolation to the listeners, than the others. I highly recommend this to anyone, and to those who have distaste to foreign films should view it once anyway- it's certainly not a long movie, and it won't loose its grip on anyone willing to give itself to the tale(s). For me, it's another to add to my top 50 of all time.",kurosawas first milestone one top foreign films 20th century,akira kurosawa was one those directors first eastern hemisphere develop form structure cinema ways it hadnt been story he used rashomon is now like seven samurai hidden fortress yojimbo near archetype that at this point history film has become formula common knowledge writers directors that sense rashomon is as important entertaining as film as citizen kane battleship potemkin rear window or open city tee basic premise four different people give four different accounts rape murder couple woods key ingredient success rashomon is that recollections given courts by woman bandit as well as four discussion is that their emotions reveal their humanity even if their details reveal nothing or everything its difficult say whether character goes over story here or if they have equal importance understand kurosawas psychology with these people opening shot house is perfect representation mature picture something that has fallen apart over time due disasters that go beyond control individuals man who heard testimonies trial says i dont understand this has been discussed line since essentially hes saying point right up front all information wont ease his puzzlement three who discuss details crimes confessions are crucial they speak us what our opinions might be we listen each version story characters fears pride shame search judgment or truth situation along with being director co adapter kurosawas mastery is revealed heavily his use editing there are short fleeting moments that hint or rather pronounce emotions thoughts instance when we first see tajomaru bandit played by action legend toshiro mifune he is looking up at sky bound straps keep him moving second or less than second theres shot what he sees sky then back his face which reveals expression that borders skeptical bit crazed or more mifunes part is barbarian but all more believable as human barbarian since he acts as such with animal desires he sees woman woods knows he wants her while he reflects that he didnt have have killed man he did as last resort as man with urge this is intensified by sadistic flee with his actions whats intriguing about that first description recollection battle between him other man is that it seems like it could be truth one viewer it could another it seems like it could all be apart his hyperactive trapped imagination attack bandit woman at first him its like game then later descriptions he feels little more un easy then later its neither pleasure or discomfort it just is this kind technique later happens with woman who was victim who has conviction though is herself archetype lifetime women presence who saw it all with man who beginning didnt understand each telling expressions cut aways lighting movement by kazuo miyagawa its equally startling exhilarating that film gives off such hypnotic aura isnt surprising or perhaps it is those grips emotion it all dead mans story is like hook ripping into twelve foot bass final accouter tale proves most accurate common observer yet kurosawa knows thats not point if he made it as such be bold had definite concrete point ending would be as poignant when revealed is truth or what one could believe as closest thing it is we know why that last person didnt want get involved with courts with what he knows his story is no more revelation any comfort or consolation listeners than others i highly recommend this anyone those who have distaste foreign films should view it once anyway its certainly not long movie it wont loose its grip anyone willing give itself tale s me its another add my top 50 all time,0.4167071405960293,0.07178548817437708,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,To what extent does subjectivity affect perception?,"""Rashomon"" tells a very simple tale in a very complicated manner, presenting four 'versions' of the truth, each from a party either witness to or involved in the incident depicted. It is not the film's intent to have you piece together a puzzle since that would be impossible based on how drastically the four tales differ. We know that lies don't enter the equation since the participating persons all claim to be guilty. ""Rashomon"" is not about choosing a version of the incident you believe is true; it is about human perspective and how it shapes what we see. Even if we truly believe what we have seen is true, is it really? The film opens when a priest and woodcutter are encountered by a man who engages in a conversation about crime with them and subsequently learns that a samurai has been killed in the woods and his wife raped by a bandit. These two details are the basic, practically undisputed facts which make up the foundation of the four versions of the story we hear: the bandit's, the woman's, her husband's (through a medium), and the woodcutter's (the only presumably objective account, which still does not make sense in relation to the others). In many ways the best thing about ""Rashomon"" is that it never reveals what actually happens (or if any of the four accounts is in fact true), and although we are not meant to solve the mystery (the idea here is that there is no objective truth since humans are too selfish and dishonest to view anything without bias) the story structure is still brilliant and adds a lot of ambiance to the film. The narrative flow is strong and the method seems fresh and inventive today despite countless imitations (including one inexplicably popular one- ""The Usual Suspects"").""Rashomon"" is very much a visual film. It would be reduced to unimportant and insignificant fare without the cinematography, which captures the mood and feel of the jungle perfectly, as does the score. The film achieves an epic feel very rare for films filmed in fullscreen, especially during the battle between the bandit and the samurai during the last telling of the story. Kurosawa was also wise enough to choose a location for the film that would accurately capture the eerie, slightly disturbing mood of the story. Just picture the events taking place anywhere other than a jungle.""Rashomon"" is not without its (minor) flaws, however. While theatrical acting (Kurosawa was fascinated with silent film) worked perfectly with films like ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Throne of Blood"", it does nothing but take away from the realism of this oft claustrophobic human drama. Yes, Mifune (Tajomaru, the bandit) does provide an interesting spin on his character for each telling, and Takashi Shumura (the woodcutter) seems as honest and real as any character could possibly be, but nearly all of that effect is lost every time Machiko Kyo appears on screen. It is hard to take her seriously and during moments when I should have been close to tears I was much closer to laughter. I'm not sure how much blame I would place on her as Kurosawa probably asked her to act exactly as she does. While discussing actors I have to (unconventionally) note Fumiko Honma as the medium, who brings a wonderfully eerie air to the film during its greatest scenes.I don't think ""Rashomon"" is Kurosawa's best or most important film, but it is still a masterful piece of cinema which is absolutely essential for any film lover. It's extraordinary how much Kurosawa accomplished at such an early stage in his career and without the benefit of the lavish budgets he was allotted for later projects. The film's main question is also still relevant and confusing today: is what we think we see really the truth, and to what extent does subjectivity affect perception? 4.5/5",what extent does subjectivity affect perception,rashomon tells very simple tale very complicated manner presenting four versions truth each party either witness or involved incident depicted it is not films intent have you piece together puzzle since that would be impossible based how drastically four tales differ we know that lies dont enter equation since participating persons all claim be guilty rashomon is not about choosing version incident you believe is true it is about human perspective how it shapes what we see even if we truly believe what we have seen is true is it really film opens when priest woodcutter are encountered by man who engages conversation about crime with them subsequently learns that samurai has been killed woods his wife raped by bandit these two details are basic practically undisputed facts which make up foundation four versions story we hear bandits womans her husbands through medium woodcutters only presumably objective account which still does not make sense relation others many ways best thing about rashomon is that it never reveals what actually happens or if any four accounts is fact true although we are not meant solve mystery idea here is that there is no objective truth since humans are too selfish dishonest view anything without bias story structure is still brilliant adds lot ambiance film narrative flow is strong method seems fresh inventive today despite countless imitations including one inexplicably popular one usual suspects rashomon is very much visual film it would be reduced unimportant insignificant fare without cinematography which captures mood feel jungle perfectly as does score film achieves epic feel very rare films filmed fullscreen especially during battle between bandit samurai during last telling story kurosawa was also wise enough choose location film that would accurately capture eerie slightly disturbing mood story just picture events taking place anywhere other than jungle rashomon is not without its minor flaws however while theatrical acting kurosawa was fascinated with silent film worked perfectly with films like seven samurai throne blood it does nothing but take away realism this oft claustrophobic human drama yes mifune tajomaru bandit does provide interesting spin his character each telling takashi shumura woodcutter seems as honest real as any character could possibly be but nearly all that effect is lost every time machiko kyo appears screen it is hard take her seriously during moments when i should have been close tears i was much closer laughter im not sure how much blame i would place her as kurosawa probably asked her act exactly as she does while discussing actors i have unconventionally note fumiko honma as medium who brings wonderfully eerie air film during its greatest scenes i dont think rashomon is kurosawas best or most important film but it is still masterful piece cinema which is absolutely essential any film lover its extraordinary how much kurosawa accomplished at such early stage his career without benefit lavish budgets he was allotted later projects films main question is also still relevant confusing today is what we think we see really truth what extent does subjectivity affect perception 4 5 5,0.539042328042328,0.1274222222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,What did we just see?,"'People forget the unpleasant things. They only remember what they want to remember.'In Rashomon the editing tells ½ of the story. It may feel experimental or unconventional, but Kurosawa perfects the concept second by second, directing and editing. This film didn't need a big budget to come perfectly to the point. It's a simple tale, but not a superficial tale. Different points of view and selective memories ('It's true! I saw it!') don't only make the woods unsafe, but are one of the most universal topics of humanity. 'We humans are weak creatures. That's why we lie, even to ourselves' says it all actually: it's about what people want to hear and when they start being interested at all, apart from wishful thinking. Selfish excuses vs trust in other people.Rashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence, thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw. That is the sort of storytelling that the supposed masters of cinema in our time yet have to equal, or try to copy when they fail. Admitted 'Memento' (2000, Nolan) is a truly great one. Still not THAT universal. 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) didn't come close, 'La Commare Secca' (1962) also didn't. 'Ghost dog: the way of the samurai' (1999) touched another border of the concept, or does it?The use of (non-original) music in my opinion reveals a certain interest for western influence, not only in Rashomon, but also in Kurosawa's forthcoming films, and is probably why his films were so influential on western filmmakers too.The cinematography is dynamic and changes scene by scene to emphasize exactly what is going on. The shadows of leaves and branches, captured by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, make you really feel 'in the woods', while the actors (Toshirô Mifune, Takashi Shimura) convince the remaining part of the audience (which adds up to 100% breathless viewers). It may be after days that you first realize you saw an important film. After weeks you realize that you must see it again to comprehend (despite it's only 85 min), and ironically that is just one of the crucial points that Kurosawa made. 10/10",what did we just see,people forget unpleasant things they only remember what they want remember rashomon editing tells story it may feel experimental or unconventional but kurosawa perfects concept second by second directing editing this film didnt need big budget come perfectly point its simple tale but not superficial tale different points view selective memories its true i saw it dont only make woods unsafe but are one most universal topics humanity we humans are weak creatures thats why we lie even ourselves says it all actually its about what people want hear when they start being interested at all apart wishful thinking selfish excuses vs trust other people rashomon gets masterful when one instant there is literally different point view camera takes another position shoot same sequence thereby forcing audience reconsider what they just saw that is sort storytelling that supposed masters cinema our time yet have equal or try copy when they fail admitted memento 2000 nolan is truly great one still not that universal pulp fiction 1994 didnt come close la commare secca 1962 also didnt ghost dog way samurai 1999 touched another border concept or does it use non original music my opinion reveals certain interest western influence not only rashomon but also kurosawas forthcoming films is probably why his films were so influential western filmmakers too cinematography is dynamic changes scene by scene emphasize exactly what is going shadows leaves branches captured by cinematographer kazuo miyagawa make you really feel woods while actors toshir mifune takashi shimura convince remaining part audience which adds up 100 breathless viewers it may be after days that you first realize you saw important film after weeks you realize that you must see it again comprehend despite its only 85 min ironically that is just one crucial points that kurosawa made 10 10,0.5031641604010024,0.09313909774436091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,I saw it with my own eyes!,"This fabulous work was years and years ahead of its time when it was made in 1950, being a work of art that engages the eyes and the ears, but most essentially, the brain. The film is both aesthetically beautiful, using amazing camera techniques, extensive periods of silence and a very limited cast to deliver the action, and the story is typically Japanese...ostensibly amazingly simple, but complex to the point of sending you cross-eyed!The basic tale is this: a woman and her husband, a Samurai, are travelling through a forest when they meet a bandit. The bandit has sex with the woman and the Samurai ends up dead. That's it. This tale is related to us through the woodcutter and a monk who saw the protagonists give their evidence to the police (the dead Samurai through a medium), but unfortunately the three tales conflict with one another. Each confessor says that they killed the Samurai, and then we hear from the woodcutter who in fact witnessed the event, who gives us a version of events that borrows from each individual account, and is still less credible!The conclusion presented by Kurosawa seems to be firstly that individuals see things from different perspectives, but secondly, and most importantly, that there is no objective truth. There is no answer as to what took place in the forest, and Kurosawa offers us no way of knowing what went on. Each story is as credible as the other, and so no conclusion about guilt can be reached. We even have to think at the end that as the whole thing is reported to us by the woodcutter and priest, was there any truth in anything we heard at all?This film leads to an especially tricky conclusion for a movie-goer! Your eyes are supposed to show you objective truth, but they don't. The camera is supposed not to lie, but it does. I feel that the simple message is that subjectivity lies at the heart of life, and this subjectivity needs to be recognised before any attempt is made to understand events.",i saw it with my own eyes,this fabulous work was years years ahead its time when it was made 1950 being work art that engages eyes ears but most essentially brain film is both aesthetically beautiful using amazing camera techniques extensive periods silence very limited cast deliver action story is typically japanese ostensibly amazingly simple but complex point sending you cross eyed basic tale is this woman her husband samurai are travelling through forest when they meet bandit bandit has sex with woman samurai ends up dead thats it this tale is related us through woodcutter monk who saw protagonists give their evidence police dead samurai through medium but unfortunately three tales conflict with one another each confessor says that they killed samurai then we hear woodcutter who fact witnessed event who gives us version events that borrows each individual account is still less credible conclusion presented by kurosawa seems be firstly that individuals see things different perspectives but secondly most importantly that there is no objective truth there is no answer as what took place forest kurosawa offers us no way knowing what went each story is as credible as other so no conclusion about guilt can be reached we even have think at end that as whole thing is reported us by woodcutter priest was there any truth anything we heard at all this film leads especially tricky conclusion movie goer your eyes are supposed show you objective truth but they dont camera is supposed not lie but it does i feel that simple message is that subjectivity lies at heart life this subjectivity needs be recognised before any attempt is made understand events,0.442156862745098,0.10339635854341736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.55}"
5.0,I had a different perception about this classic film,"""Well, men are only men. That's why they lie. They can't tell the truth, even to themselves.""Rashomon was the first film from critically acclaimed Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa, that I got to see. I was expecting some great things from this film considering it ranks among the best films in history. The black and white cinematography was breathtaking and there were some great long shots, but the story fell flat and the performances here were a bit theatrical for my taste. The film is only 85 minutes long, but it seemed to drag forever. The film was made in 1950 so I can imagine there were several inventive elements incorporated here, but they really don't stand out today because we've seen those tricks so many times now. For example, it is claimed that this was the first time that a camera was pointed directly at the sun, but of course that doesn't have an effect on the viewer today. However, I've seen many other classic films which I thought still managed to seduce me and have timed really well, but it wasn't the case with Rashomon. The film focuses on different realities and perceptions about humanity, but in doing so it really never manages to find a deep meaning. It focuses on the lies we tell, our selfish desires, and our pursuit or need to believe in the goodness of humanity (reflected through the Priest in this film), but ultimately it plays down to discovering that sometimes reality is just a matter of perception and differing point of views. ""Rashomon is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meaning,"" is what Kurosawa would say about this film when approached about its meaning. What I can say about Rashomon is that the cinematography is great and the lighting effects were also astonishing for its time. The film takes place during a heavy rain storm (classic trade mark from Kurosawa) as a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) are taking refuge from the rain and talking about a terrible crime that has been committed. A peasant (Kichijiro Ueda) who is unfamiliar with what they are talking about joins the conversation and the two men recount the events of what they consider the most horrific crime they have experienced. The woodcutter happened to discover the body of a samurai three days ago as he walked across the woods and was summoned to testify at a trial for the samurai's murder. The priest also has to testify since he had run into the samurai (Machiko Kyo) and his wife (Masayuki Mori) as they were passing through the town before the murder took place. The woodcutter and the priest then recount what they heard from the three direct witnesses of the murder: the suspected bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) who apparently raped the wife and killed the samurai, the wife, and the samurai himself who testifies through a medium. They all give different accounts of what took place, and each account is as unreasonable as the next. The story is told in the form of flashbacks through the perception of each witness.The main issue I had with the film is that the horrendous crime never felt like it was that terrible or memorable to begin with. It was just a common crime, a terrible one, but nothing to have an existential or philosophical debate about. Besides the main concern they had wasn't because a murder was committed but rather that everyone seemed to be lying about what happened. They couldn't find a reasonable explanation for an unreasonable act. The flashbacks were sort of interesting despite me not liking the performances, and I really liked the fighting choreography staged near the end between the bandit and the samurai. It was nothing you would expect from a Japanese samurai film. That was probably my favorite scene in this film and it had some funny moments as well. I can see the influence the director has had in modern films like Vantage Point or The Usual Suspects, but despite that I had a difficult time carrying about this movie. Well I guess I'm on the minority here, but Kurosawa would have to accept my opinion and the perception I had of this film because that is what this film is really about: differing perceptions of what we believe to be real.",i had different perception about this classic film,well men are only men thats why they lie they cant tell truth even themselves rashomon was first film critically acclaimed japanese director akira kurosawa that i got see i was expecting some great things this film considering it ranks among best films history black white cinematography was breathtaking there were some great long shots but story fell flat performances here were bit theatrical my taste film is only 85 minutes long but it seemed drag forever film was made 1950 so i can imagine there were several inventive elements incorporated here but they really dont stand out today because weve seen those tricks so many times now example it is claimed that this was first time that camera was pointed directly at sun but course that doesnt have effect viewer today however ive seen many other classic films which i thought still managed seduce me have timed really well but it wasnt case with rashomon film focuses different realities perceptions about humanity but doing so it really never manages find deep meaning it focuses lies we tell our selfish desires our pursuit or need believe goodness humanity reflected through priest this film but ultimately it plays down discovering that sometimes reality is just matter perception differing point views rashomon is reflection life life does not always have clear meaning is what kurosawa would say about this film when approached about its meaning what i can say about rashomon is that cinematography is great lighting effects were also astonishing its time film takes place during heavy rain storm classic trade mark kurosawa as priest minoru chiaki woodcutter takashi shimura are taking refuge rain talking about terrible crime that has been committed peasant kichijiro ueda who is unfamiliar with what they are talking about joins conversation two men recount events what they consider most horrific crime they have experienced woodcutter happened discover body samurai three days ago as he walked across woods was summoned testify at trial samurais murder priest also has testify since he had run into samurai machiko kyo his wife masayuki mori as they were passing through town before murder took place woodcutter priest then recount what they heard three direct witnesses murder suspected bandit tajomaru toshiro mifune who apparently raped wife killed samurai wife samurai himself who testifies through medium they all give different accounts what took place each account is as unreasonable as next story is told form flashbacks through perception each witness main issue i had with film is that horrendous crime never felt like it was that terrible or memorable begin with it was just common crime terrible one but nothing have existential or philosophical debate about besides main concern they had wasnt because murder was committed but rather that everyone seemed be lying about what happened they couldnt find reasonable explanation unreasonable act flashbacks were sort interesting despite me not liking performances i really liked fighting choreography staged near end between bandit samurai it was nothing you would expect japanese samurai film that was probably my favorite scene this film it had some funny moments as well i can see influence director has had modern films like vantage point or usual suspects but despite that i had difficult time carrying about this movie well i guess im minority here but kurosawa would have accept my opinion perception i had this film because that is what this film is really about differing perceptions what we believe be real,0.4979063018242122,0.09419568822553898,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,A Technical & Creative Success,"It's hard to tell just how striking ""Rashômon"" might have seemed to those who watched it in 1950, rather than seeing it after so many subsequent movies and other works have made use of its techniques and ideas. But it's clear that it is a technical and creative success. The story itself is not particularly satisfying, which was most likely by design, and the movie is carried by its structure and by the concept of the markedly different perspectives on the same series of events. The cast also deserve their share of credit for how well it works, and the photography is excellent, as it is in almost all of Kurosawa's films.Kurosawa's expertise makes the interwoven sequences of past and present - essentially telling two different stories - not only work flawlessly, but fit together thematically. It's even more commendable when compared to some of the subsequent films that have tried to use similar ideas, only to come off as pretentious rather than creative or innovative. Kurosawa was also working with much less in terms of possible precedents.In one sense, the choice of specific story material could seem a little odd.The downbeat, rather sordid scenario makes the movie somewhat less enjoyable than several of Kurosawa's other pictures (which is, admittedly, a pretty high standard), and as a result ""Rashômon"" is more a film to respect and admire than one to enjoy and take pleasure from. Still, it does have significantly more substance to it than do most of the more recent pictures that have been deliberately downbeat or negative in their portrayals of humanity. Such stories are more trendy at present, and they often receive undue praise simply for so being.At the same time, the lack of sympathetic characters and the paucity of hopeful developments bring out all the more its success in developing its ideas about narrative and about reality, ideas that are more fundamental and, in their way, perhaps at least as important as any specific story or events.",technical creative success,its hard tell just how striking rash mon might have seemed those who watched it 1950 rather than seeing it after so many subsequent movies other works have made use its techniques ideas but its clear that it is technical creative success story itself is not particularly satisfying which was most likely by design movie is carried by its structure by concept markedly different perspectives same series events cast also deserve their share credit how well it works photography is excellent as it is almost all kurosawas films kurosawas expertise makes interwoven sequences past present essentially telling two different stories not only work flawlessly but fit together thematically its even more commendable when compared some subsequent films that have tried use similar ideas only come off as pretentious rather than creative or innovative kurosawa was also working with much less terms possible precedents one sense choice specific story material could seem little odd downbeat rather sordid scenario makes movie somewhat less enjoyable than several kurosawas other pictures which is admittedly pretty high standard as result rash mon is more film respect admire than one enjoy take pleasure still it does have significantly more substance it than do most more recent pictures that have been deliberately downbeat or negative their portrayals humanity such stories are more trendy at present they often receive undue praise simply so being at same time lack sympathetic characters paucity hopeful developments bring out all more its success developing its ideas about narrative about reality ideas that are more fundamental their way perhaps at least as important as any specific story or events,0.48524181547619044,0.17313802083333332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,"Kurosawa's elaborate, intricately-plotted masterwork","Seen today, sixty years after it was made, RASHOMON is still one of Akira Kurosawa's most accessible works to western viewers. Instead of a sprawling, multi-faceted historical epic, this uniquely original and inspiring film is a different beast entirely; a cinematic experiment if you will, or an exploration of the human psyche. It covers a seemingly straightforward event from different perspectives, throwing into question the nature of truth, while also exploring themes of the unreliable narrator and perception. It's also a highly entertaining film at that.The small cast work wonderfully with the given material, particularly Toshiro Mifune, who's handed the scene-stealing role of the bandit who starts off the story. However, Machiko Kyo gets the meatiest role as the put-upon wife, and she's required to do the brunt of the emoting. Kudos also to Masayuki Mori, excelling as the typical stony-faced samurai character, and Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura who's present in the framing sequences which help to set up the film's atmosphere.Kurosawa's camera-work is first rate and he brings his forest backdrop to life, utilising all manner of shots to tell his story. He was famously the first director ever to shoot into the sun, but I particularly liked the stand-off in the second version of the tale between the three characters, which utilises point-of-view shots that Sergio Leone later used most famously for the duel in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. In the end, though, it's the originality of the film – and the clever exploration of a topic that in itself is quite difficult to use in the medium – that makes RASHOMON a classic and well worth anybody's time.",kurosawas elaborate intricately plotted masterwork,seen today sixty years after it was made rashomon is still one akira kurosawas most accessible works western viewers instead sprawling multi faceted historical epic this uniquely original inspiring film is different beast entirely cinematic experiment if you will or exploration human psyche it covers seemingly straightforward event different perspectives throwing into question nature truth while also exploring themes unreliable narrator perception its also highly entertaining film at that small cast work wonderfully with given material particularly toshiro mifune whos handed scene stealing role bandit who starts off story however machiko kyo gets meatiest role as put upon wife shes required do brunt emoting kudos also masayuki mori excelling as typical stony faced samurai character kurosawa regular takashi shimura whos present framing sequences which help set up films atmosphere kurosawas camera work is first rate he brings his forest backdrop life utilising all manner shots tell his story he was famously first director ever shoot into sun but i particularly liked stand off second version tale between three characters which utilises point view shots that sergio leone later used most famously duel good bad ugly end though its originality film clever exploration topic that itself is quite difficult use medium that makes rashomon classic well worth anybodys time,0.47775263951734553,0.1620098039215686,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,A rare and a unique masterpiece from the master himself,"As oppose to its commonplace plot, Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece, howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that's what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance, the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. Rashomon pioneered Kurosawa's dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. Rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai, his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. The bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai's wife. The dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. The bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. Their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai's spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. The samurai's version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. Each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. The woodcutter, who didn't want to get involved personally, later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. The movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception, but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. The concept of Rashomon though well ahead of its time, sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. A quintessential Kurosawa classic, strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 10/10",rare unique masterpiece master himself,as oppose its commonplace plot rashomon as concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it undisputed masterpiece howsoever improbable it vividly limns artistry contrivance innate human psyche owing importunate desire humans placate their insatiable egos this manipulation facts has no limits entirely depends upon skill imaginative improvisation individual along with his level comfort at skullduggery ability misinterpret comes naturally humans as desperate ploy counter adversities life thats what makes it indispensable as direct consequence contrivance concept truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective matter individualistic perception rashomon pioneered kurosawas dream tryst with perpetual brilliance undoubtedly played pivotal part making his name mark excellence world cinema rashomon is well knitted tale about supercilious samurai his whimsical wife boorish bandit bandit inveigles samurai into imprisonment has his way with samurais wife dead body samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by woodcutter bandit is captured arraigned along with deranged widow samurai their narrated versions seem such contrasting that psychic is called upon conjure up dead samurais spirit record his testimony order corroborate facts that seemed excessively manipulated samurais version yet again differs considerably testimonies other two each version though different seemed satiate respective ego testifier woodcutter who didnt want get involved personally later confesses priest have actually witnessed incident comes up with version his own which falsifies other three movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing do with revelation truth as verity is merely matter lame perception but rather is highlight discrepancies among different versions as medium depict irrational complexities associated with human psyche concept rashomon though well ahead its time sowed seeds creative innovation world cinema has served as undisputed benchmark innovative excellence well over five decades quintessential kurosawa classic strongly recommended masses its sheer brilliance enigmatic charm 10 10,0.5732142857142859,0.07698412698412697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,Kurosawa is just so damn good,"""Rashomon"", Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film about a horrible crime and the various versions of the ""truth"" that come to fruition during the investigation is absolutely amazing, pure and simple. The story is told four different times, each time from the point of view of one of the participants. The basic story of the crime is that a bandit (Mifune) comes across a husband and wife traveling through the forest. The bandit, Tajomaru, seduces/assaults the Masako (Kyo) after tying up her husband Takehiro (Mori), and soon after, Takehiro is dead. What happens between the times Tajomaru encounters the couple and the discovery of Takehiro's body is what is left to be discovered. Masako, Tajomaru and even Takehiro (with the assistance of a medium) each tell their account of the story, each taking blame for Takehiro's death. The fourth telling is from a passer-by, and the audience is left to decide which is the true account.I absolutely loved this film. I had heard that Yimou Zhang's ""Hero"" had, if not as an homage, employed the same technique of storytelling and perspective, but seeing this great film was a real treat. The story is original and rich, and Kurosawa always is able to pull great performances from his actors. I found ""Rashomon"" to be extremely compelling from start to finish, and even managed to be really creeped out at one point. (The psychic medium is pure, unadulterated nightmare fuel) From the very little that I know of Japanese cinema of the 1950's & 1960's, I realize that Kurosawa was not the only director, but he certainly was the trailblazer and set the bar for the genre for decades to come. His peers were putting out material, it was just fairly primitive. (It is easy to forget that not every country's film industry was as opulent as America's) To see this kind of film, a film that is actually incredibly simple, but so ingeniously conceived of and executed makes me remember why I have been and always will be both a student of and lover of film. 8/10 --Shelly",kurosawa is just so damn good,rashomon akira kurosawas 1950 film about horrible crime various versions truth that come fruition during investigation is absolutely amazing pure simple story is told four different times each time point view one participants basic story crime is that bandit mifune comes across husband wife traveling through forest bandit tajomaru seduces assaults masako kyo after tying up her husband takehiro mori soon after takehiro is dead what happens between times tajomaru encounters couple discovery takehiros body is what is left be discovered masako tajomaru even takehiro with assistance medium each tell their account story each taking blame takehiros death fourth telling is passer by audience is left decide which is true account i absolutely loved this film i had heard that yimou zhangs hero had if not as homage employed same technique storytelling perspective but seeing this great film was real treat story is original rich kurosawa always is able pull great performances his actors i found rashomon be extremely compelling start finish even managed be really creeped out at one point psychic medium is pure unadulterated nightmare fuel very little that i know japanese cinema 1950s 1960s i realize that kurosawa was not only director but he certainly was trailblazer set bar genre decades come his peers were putting out material it was just fairly primitive it is easy forget that not every countrys film industry was as opulent as americas see this kind film film that is actually incredibly simple but so ingeniously conceived executed makes me remember why i have been always will be both student lover film 8 10 shelly,0.5498249299719887,0.2274247198879552,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"

His style was always so breathtakingly simple that you can't help but get sucked into the rainy and sunny bestial world depicted in here, with a beautiful use of the black and white nitrate film stock contrasting against a sordid storyline. I've probably seen it 10 times now over the decades and it seems to get better every time I settle down to it - it's been a continual treat.A horror story from a few days previous is recounted on a ferociously wet day: beautiful woman is (apparently) raped by animalistic bandit in front of her husband who is then (apparently) murdered. But who really did what to who and why? It's told from four viewpoints: the bandit's, the honourable woman's, the heroic dead husband's via a rather startling medium and lastly a breathless version from a timid eye-witness. The event becomes a crime scene with the beauty of forest surrounding us and splintered sunlight beaming down on us through the trees bearing mute witness to the savage few moments. It's a salutary lesson in Human Beings vs Objectivity; the psychologies of the main protagonists are laid bare, as well as the story-tellers, even to Kurosawa and the viewers themselves.

,"Nested, Folded, Parallel Narrative","Spoilers herein.Superficially about truth, this is more fundamentally about the nature of nested and floating narrative. Kurosawa is one of three men who invented film, and this is his most influential one. Much is made of the construction of the story, which you can read elsewhere. I'd like to focus here on what I think is the rarest of Kurosawa'a abilities: the way he changes the eye of the camera -- and the composition of the world it creates for us -- for each of the narratives.Some are impressionistic; some flat and full of contrast; some deep. Some are composed around people, some around the environment with people in it, some around fleeting motion. Sometimes the words are the organizing principle, sometimes images.I know other directors who can do this once within a film: to twist the consciousness of the viewing eye to match the perspective of the narration, even some capable of a dual view within and without. But I know of no one else capable of doing so multiply within the same film and with such obvious link to the story.The DVD is astonishingly clear.

9.0,Amazing,"The more I watch and re-watch Kurosawa's films, the more I am sure that he will be remembered as the greatest director of the 20th century. Although I prefer ""Ran"" and ""The Seven Samurai"" for reasons of personal taste, I don't think I would argue very much with anyone who proposed that ""Rashomon"" was his best film. Made in 1950, it is so unusual and so far ahead of it's time that it takes your breath away.The story itself deserves a mention: A husband & wife travelling through woods are attacked by a thief, who ties up the husband and rapes the wife. This is as much of the story as we can be sure of. The husband ends up dead of a stab wound. How did he die? Who was responsible? Each of the three give their accounts before a court (the dead husband through a medium!), and each account is entirely different. A woodcutter who witnessed the events gives a fourth, entirely different, account.Each flashback is an absolute gem in itself, and lives long in the mind. Toshiro Mifune as the thief exudes more raw masculinity and charisma that I think I have ever seen in ANY movie, and creates a totally believeable character. Machiko Kyo as the wife is superb in what are essentially four different roles, her own version being the highlight. The husband's character is the least well developed, but since he spends a lot of the time either tied up or dead, that's not really surprising.Because the viewer knows that each flashback is highly personal to the teller, a vast amount of brainpower and concentration are required if you are going to try to work out what actually DID happen. Alternatively, watch the film twice back-to-back, once for the visuals and acting, and once for the detective work and philosophical implications.My favourite shot in the movie is one which starts with the husband and wife kneeling, facing each other, a view of the wife over the shoulder of the husband; the camera then moves round to the side and simultaneously zooms in on the wife's profile; then pulls back behind the wife, ending with a view of the husband's face over the shoulder of the wife - a mirror image of the initial shot in the sequence. Absolutely awesome! And dating from 1950! Unbelievable!I normally try to keep my reviews a LOT shorter than this, but I make no apologies in this case. Indeed, there are lots of other points I would like to make (I haven't even mentioned the central importance of the dagger, or the relevance of the Rashomon gate itself).

10.0,The film that introduced western audiences to Japanese cinema,"While not my favourite Akira Kurasawa(for not only Japan's greatest director, but one of the finest directors there was) film, like Seven Samurai closely followed by Ran, Rashomon is still a fantastic film. No Kurasawa film is the same without great scenery and cinematography, and Rashomon is no disappointment in that regard. The camera is always moving but never feels like too much due to how subtly composed they (and the editing) are, and the scenery especially the beautifully lit jungle is just as striking, not as epic as Seven Samurai but still making its mark. The music, though I may prefer Ran's score when it comes to scores for Kurasawa's films, is always fitting with the mood and atmosphere of the film, and with its exploration of the relativity of truth the four accounts of the woodland encounter between a bandit and a wealthy couple is written in a compelling and completely credible manner. Kurasawa's direction as ever is superb, as are the performances of Machiko Kyo and Toshiru Mifune. Overall, a truly remarkable film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",film that introduced western audiences japanese cinema,while not my favourite akira kurasawa not only japans greatest director but one finest directors there was film like seven samurai closely followed by ran rashomon is still fantastic film no kurasawa film is same without great scenery cinematography rashomon is no disappointment that regard camera is always moving but never feels like too much due how subtly composed they editing are scenery especially beautifully lit jungle is just as striking not as epic as seven samurai but still making its mark music though i may prefer rans score when it comes scores kurasawas films is always fitting with mood atmosphere film with its exploration relativity truth four accounts woodland encounter between bandit wealthy couple is written compelling completely credible manner kurasawas direction as ever is superb as are performances machiko kyo toshiru mifune overall truly remarkable film 10 10 bethany cox,0.5999999999999999,0.35458333333333336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.17}"
,"Not as perfect as some would suggest but still interesting, thought-provoking and well-delivered (suggestive spoilers)","A samurai and his wife are travelling through the forest when they meet a bandit. At some point after this interaction, the samurai is dead and his body is found by a woodcutter passing through. Of this much we can be sure. The bandit is arrested for the murder but, at the trial, he, the wife and the spirit of the dead man (via a medium) tell different version of events.Rashômon is the subject of my favourite Simpsons' joke and is also one of those films that it is polite to mention in conversation when discussing anything that uses different points of view on events as the basis for its narrative  whether it be Hero, Boomtown, Vantage Point or whatever. So, with these things in mind I thought I should probably at least watch it for myself. Having watched a few longer films from Kurosawa, I was surprised to find this so short and brisk but I suppose this comes from the fact that there is not a lot of material within the film. As others have said, the scenario is the same with each telling and effectively the film is ""nothing more"" than several different ways of events playing out to the same outcome. Then it is over and you never really know the truth. I can understand why those unwilling to get into the film, just dismiss it. It is ""dull"" I suppose by some standards and the ending is open in regards the events that had gone before and also seems to come from nowhere (not unlike the baby, which is a rather lazy device in my opinion).These are flaws within the film perhaps and I do recognise that the film is not perfect  in particular with the conclusion to the film  Kurosawa may be highly regarded but he is not free from criticism. What the film does do very well is to tell the versions of events in a way that is true to the character and in a way that tells us a lot about the characters. Some have had the lack of shame to come on this site complaining that it is the same story again and again but they are missing the point badly. Each twist on the truth is done for personal reasons, whether they be major changes or just minor embellishments. It is a tad disappointing that the differences are so extreme though and I would have liked to see events a lot tighter but with just as telling, but more subtle differences. It still works though and it does provide some material for thought about the nature of truth and how hard it is to get to one version of any event that can be agreed on.The cast do well to vary their characters between the telling to reflect how they are presented in the version that suits the teller of the tale. The three main actors of Mifune, Kyô and Mori work well together  with Mifune and Kyô in particular delivering the most as their material allows. The framing scenes with the woodcutter etc are also good and I think the only weaknesses with their performances come from how they have to present this story as the worst thing ever, which is not an impression I ever shared. For the court scenes we are added Honman as a medium; she throws herself into the performance and it is only a shame that I struggle to buy her character as a narrative device in the first place. The direction is low-key but still impressive  mainly due to shooting in heavy rain, and in the woods  neither appear affected by the challenges as the lighting and shot framing is always excellent.Rashômon will disappoint people because almost everyone will have been told what a classic it is and will expect to be blown away second by second. Which of course doesn't happen and the film is not as subtle or as clever as one would hope. However it is still a well constructed, interesting and thought-provoking piece that is punchy and engaging with strong performances and direction. Don't expect something that it is not and come to it with an open mind and you will find a film that justifies the majority of its reputation.",not as perfect as some would suggest but still interesting thought provoking well delivered suggestive spoilers,samurai his wife are travelling through forest when they meet bandit at some point after this interaction samurai is dead his body is found by woodcutter passing through this much we can be sure bandit is arrested murder but at trial he wife spirit dead man via medium tell different version events rash mon is subject my favourite simpsons joke is also one those films that it is polite mention conversation when discussing anything that uses different points view events as basis its narrative whether it be hero boomtown vantage point or whatever so with these things mind i thought i should probably at least watch it myself having watched few longer films kurosawa i was surprised find this so short brisk but i suppose this comes fact that there is not lot material within film as others have said scenario is same with each telling effectively film is nothing more than several different ways events playing out same outcome then it is over you never really know truth i can understand why those unwilling get into film just dismiss it it is dull i suppose by some standards ending is open regards events that had gone before also seems come nowhere not unlike baby which is rather lazy device my opinion these are flaws within film perhaps i do recognise that film is not perfect particular with conclusion film kurosawa may be highly regarded but he is not free criticism what film does do very well is tell versions events way that is true character way that tells us lot about characters some have had lack shame come this site complaining that it is same story again again but they are missing point badly each twist truth is done personal reasons whether they be major changes or just minor embellishments it is tad disappointing that differences are so extreme though i would have liked see events lot tighter but with just as telling but more subtle differences it still works though it does provide some material thought about nature truth how hard it is get one version any event that can be agreed cast do well vary their characters between telling reflect how they are presented version that suits teller tale three main actors mifune ky mori work well together with mifune ky particular delivering most as their material allows framing scenes with woodcutter etc are also good i think only weaknesses with their performances come how they have present this story as worst thing ever which is not impression i ever shared court scenes we are added honman as medium she throws herself into performance it is only shame that i struggle buy her character as narrative device first place direction is low key but still impressive mainly due shooting heavy rain woods neither appear affected by challenges as lighting shot framing is always excellent rash mon will disappoint people because almost everyone will have been told what classic it is will expect be blown away second by second which course doesnt happen film is not as subtle or as clever as one would hope however it is still well constructed interesting thought provoking piece that is punchy engaging with strong performances direction dont expect something that it is not come it with open mind you will find film that justifies majority its reputation,0.5182649572649574,0.06957692307692306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Whom to trust?,"I've wanted to watch this since I first found out it existed. This is the second Kurosawa feature I've seen, the first being Seven Samurai. The man certainly was an artist. The concept smoothly avoids being a gimmick, as it could easily have turned into in the hands of someone not sufficiently talented, and is instead a well-used device, through which base human emotions and responses are explored, as well as relationships, good and evil, and more. Any piece of expression that so skillfully encourages its audience to think - without ever seeming like a lecture - should be respected and appreciated. The story-telling is excellent. The acting is spot-on, from all involved. The minimal cast and amount of settings are well-utilized, and keeps the focus sharp. The plot never loses the viewers' interest, and in fact only gets increasingly deep and fascinating as it goes. While the subject of this is a sexual crime, the way it's handled is immensely tasteful. The visuals are impeccable, and cinematography and editing are amazing. This could arguably, along with much of Hitchcock's work, be cited as the origins of the utter tidal wave of ""twist endings""(often overshadowing all else about those movies, including, but not limited to, consideration being put into ensuring that said surprise even makes sense) that have hit popular cinema in recent years, however, milestones sometimes do cause negatives, and they shouldn't be blamed for that. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys being challenged, and is willing to give the medium of film the chance to prove itself as possessing the potential to be a form of art. 10/10",whom trust,ive wanted watch this since i first found out it existed this is second kurosawa feature ive seen first being seven samurai man certainly was artist concept smoothly avoids being gimmick as it could easily have turned into hands someone not sufficiently talented is instead well used device through which base human emotions responses are explored as well as relationships good evil more any piece expression that so skillfully encourages its audience think without ever seeming like lecture should be respected appreciated story telling is excellent acting is spot all involved minimal cast amount settings are well utilized keeps focus sharp plot never loses viewers interest fact only gets increasingly deep fascinating as it goes while subject this is sexual crime way its handled is immensely tasteful visuals are impeccable cinematography editing are amazing this could arguably along with much hitchcocks work be cited as origins utter tidal wave twist endings often overshadowing all else about those movies including but not limited consideration being put into ensuring that said surprise even makes sense that have hit popular cinema recent years however milestones sometimes do cause negatives they shouldnt be blamed that i recommend this anyone who enjoys being challenged is willing give medium film chance prove itself as possessing potential be form art 10 10,0.5918470418470417,0.1891414141414141,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,More layers than a Smith Island Cake,"""Rashomon"" is a classic whodunnit murder mystery, but with a major twist. You know that old board game Clue? Imagine playing that game with your friends but with trick cards, loaded dice, and everyone's allowed, if not obligated, to cheat. Got it? Solve the mystery!Eventually the result would likely be all of you sitting around, sullen, confused & frustrated with each of you taking turns muttering, ""I just don't understand!"" And that is exactly how the opening scene of ""Rashomon"" begins.Two depressed looking men are sitting in the ruins of an old building beneath a sign that reads ""Rashomon"". They are waiting for a torrential storm to pass. A third man joins them also seeking shelter and asks them why the long faces. That's your cue to strap on your seatbelt because after that, all bets are off in the ways of truth, perception and storytelling. The two men tell the tale, as they had heard through witnesses' testimonies it in court, regarding a dead man, his wife, and the bandit accused of the murder. The twist is that each testimony drastically contradicts each of the others. And as the story is visually played out for us in each version, we suddenly realize how subjective ""truth"" is.The effect is poetic and powerful. As Robert Altman (director of MASH, Shortcuts, Gosford Park) commented:""When one sees a film, you see the characters on screen; it's not like reading where you imagine certain things. You see very specific things. You see a tree, you see a sword. So you take that as truth. But in this film, you take it as truth, and then you find out that it is not necessarily true. And you see various versions of the episode that has taken place, and you're never told which is true and which isn't true ... So it becomes a poem, and it cracks this visual thing that we have in our minds that if we see it, it must be a fact.""Augmented by Kurosawa's brilliant directing, Miyagawa's excellent camera work, and the symbolic majesty of the forest of Nara which constantly presents a very Monet-like, impressionistic veil of leaves and shadows throughout the film, ""Rashomon"" is so much more than a whodunnit. It's the greatest of them all, leading us the viewers deeper and deeper into the psychological and metaphysical thicket, until ultimately we may end up feeling like one of the characters in the movie who laments: ""I don't even know my own soul.""",more layers than smith island cake,rashomon is classic whodunnit murder mystery but with major twist you know that old board game clue imagine playing that game with your friends but with trick cards loaded dice everyones allowed if not obligated cheat got it solve mystery eventually result would likely be all you sitting around sullen confused frustrated with each you taking turns muttering i just dont understand that is exactly how opening scene rashomon begins two depressed looking men are sitting ruins old building beneath sign that reads rashomon they are waiting torrential storm pass third man joins them also seeking shelter asks them why long faces thats your cue strap your seatbelt because after that all bets are off ways truth perception storytelling two men tell tale as they had heard through witnesses testimonies it court regarding dead man his wife bandit accused murder twist is that each testimony drastically contradicts each others as story is visually played out us each version we suddenly realize how subjective truth is effect is poetic powerful as robert altman director mash shortcuts gosford park commented when one sees film you see characters screen its not like reading where you imagine certain things you see very specific things you see tree you see sword so you take that as truth but this film you take it as truth then you find out that it is not necessarily true you see various versions episode that has taken place youre never told which is true which isnt true so it becomes poem it cracks this visual thing that we have our minds that if we see it it must be fact augmented by kurosawas brilliant directing miyagawas excellent camera work symbolic majesty forest nara which constantly presents very monet like impressionistic veil leaves shadows throughout film rashomon is so much more than whodunnit its greatest them all leading us viewers deeper deeper into psychological metaphysical thicket until ultimately we may end up feeling like one characters movie who laments i dont even know my own soul,0.4909693877551021,0.1283843537414966,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,"""I just don't understand this story""","These are the opening words of Rashômon, and in a way that's also a summary of the entire film. It is the story of four testimonies of the same event that couldn't differ more. It is told by a priest and a woodcutter to a commoner, as they seek shelter from the rain under the Rashomon gate. The priest and the woodcutter were witnesses in a trial, and what they heard there made them puzzled, and after they told everything, the viewer is just as puzzled as these two. What happened? Takehiro, a samurai has been murdered and Masako, his wife has been raped, the suspect is Tajômaru. And indeed, in court he confesses to have raped the woman and to have killed the samurai in duel. Masako however tells quite a different story: After Tajômaru took advantage of her, he left and despair and pity made her kill her husband, but to commit suicide, just as she originally planned, she's to weak. Then the murdered samurai speaks, through the voice of a medium. In his story, he committed suicide because of disgust at his wife, who asked Tajomaru to kill him in order to accompany the robber. At the end, we hear even another story from the woodcutter, who was, as he reveals, an eyewitnesses. In his version, Tajômaru killed the samurai in a duel (or rather: in a brawl) that was demanded by his wife. Now what did really happen? Why did at least three of these four people lie? The reason cannot be (as the commoner says at one point) that everyone told what was useful for him, since, except for the woodcutter, everyone told a story in which he was the killer. So do they all think their story is true? Do they all feel guilty for a reason or another? These questions will cause endless discussions once you watch this film. And the end, Kurosawa raises another question: If man keeps lying (to others as well as to himself), does that mean he is evil? This question is underlined by the crying baby the three men find in the Rashômon gate. Kurosawa's answer to this question is clearly a no: the woodcutter takes the baby to raise him and the priest realizes that he is a good man, even although he's a lier and a thief. But if Kurosawa had only raised these questions, Rashômon wouldn't have become such a classic as it is considered today. He is telling his story with breathtaking images, as when he's holding his camera directly into the sun, when he uses the wood, light and shadow to create a dense atmosphere, or when he shows the trial scenes, where he makes the witnesses talk to the viewers to make them feel like the judges. The fight scenes are all terrifically shot, and the scene before Masako kills Takehiro can move you to tears. Rashômon also has some good acting, especially the breathtaking Toshirô Mifune in one of film history's most unforgettable performances as the wild robber Tajômaru, always jumping around and seemingly untamable and unafraid. All this makes Rashômon a mind-boggling experience, that had me talk all night through with friends of mine, and still stirs me whenever i watch it.",i just dont understand this story,these are opening words rash mon way thats also summary entire film it is story four testimonies same event that couldnt differ more it is told by priest woodcutter commoner as they seek shelter rain under rashomon gate priest woodcutter were witnesses trial what they heard there made them puzzled after they told everything viewer is just as puzzled as these two what happened takehiro samurai has been murdered masako his wife has been raped suspect is taj maru indeed court he confesses have raped woman have killed samurai duel masako however tells quite different story after taj maru took advantage her he left despair pity made her kill her husband but commit suicide just as she originally planned shes weak then murdered samurai speaks through voice medium his story he committed suicide because disgust at his wife who asked tajomaru kill him order accompany robber at end we hear even another story woodcutter who was as he reveals eyewitnesses his version taj maru killed samurai duel or rather brawl that was demanded by his wife now what did really happen why did at least three these four people lie reason cannot be as commoner says at one point that everyone told what was useful him since except woodcutter everyone told story which he was killer so do they all think their story is true do they all feel guilty reason or another these questions will cause endless discussions once you watch this film end kurosawa raises another question if man keeps lying others as well as himself does that mean he is evil this question is underlined by crying baby three men find rash mon gate kurosawas answer this question is clearly no woodcutter takes baby raise him priest realizes that he is good man even although hes lier thief but if kurosawa had only raised these questions rash mon wouldnt have become such classic as it is considered today he is telling his story with breathtaking images as when hes holding his camera directly into sun when he uses wood light shadow create dense atmosphere or when he shows trial scenes where he makes witnesses talk viewers make them feel like judges fight scenes are all terrifically shot scene before masako kills takehiro can move you tears rash mon also has some good acting especially breathtaking toshir mifune one film historys most unforgettable performances as wild robber taj maru always jumping around seemingly untamable unafraid all this makes rash mon mind boggling experience that had me talk all night through with friends mine still stirs me whenever i watch it,0.5140151515151514,0.11603535353535352,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Dirty degradation away from mysticism,"Rashomon is one of those movies that at first seems to have a lot of peculiarities, but upon further viewing makes more and more sense. It doesn't need multiple viewings in order to be appreciated, though... it's impact is pretty immediate. It's just that some of the things that seem more odd about it are much more lasting than one would think.The story is about four people who are involved in a rape, a murder, and a theft in the woods, and how each tells the story of the events with a different stress in order to make themselves look better. What is clear is this: a woman was taken in front of her husband by a bandit. The husband was killed. His sword was taken by the bandit and the woman's dagger somehow disappeared. With those elements, a cynical outside observer hears the stories of each character and eventually comes to the conclusion he has from the beginning: that people are selfish and self-interested, and that good no longer exists in the world.The woman's, bandit's, and witness's stories are more easily accepted, but what do we do with the presence of the dead husband's ghost and his story, especially when the priest points out that ""dead men don't lie""? Akira Kurosawa often puts metaphysical beings into the story with the same matter-of-fact quality as he does any other character, and to a cynical observer's eye, this could be considered a distraction. However, just the ghost helps illustrate just how far Japanese society has degraded away from classic values. Just as the listener of the tales tears apart Rashomon temple as the movie progresses for the selfish need of firewood, the ghost no longer is held to the same amount of abstractly definite authority. The presence of the priest and his clenched grip around his faith in humanity helps create a dialog about how removed people have become from abstract concepts of good and evil. The ghost, the priest, and the temple are all a very important part of the story, the same way the outsider's anecdote, ""They say the demon who resided here fled rather than be met with the evil of human beings"" has dire importance to the interplay of relationships in this film.Kurosawa's skill is not just in dialog and relationships, his visual acuity helps accentuate these themes as well. When the story begins, the woods is magical, even colorful (despite the black and white photography). It is a woods of fairy tale, with magical breezes and quiet streams. As the movie progresses, the woods lose more and more of their mystical quality and become dirty and dry. By the time the battle between the husband and the bandit is played out in its final representation, it is no longer a valiant battle of skill against two well-versed opponents, its a stressful, scary affair that has the two kicking up more dust than swinging their swords. The dust itself shows the degradation of the story away from the abstract qualities of truth and justice to a much more dirty, ugly reality as promoted by the outsider.I don't think Akira Kurosawa necessarily holds the theme of this movie as utter truth, especially considering the hopeful ending, but it does seem as if this movie came during a very cynical time during Kurosawa's life. Many discuss it as a post-war film, which isn't a bad guess. But even without it's affinity to the post-war world of Japan at the time, it somehow has a profound effect on viewers even today.--PolarisDiB",dirty degradation away mysticism,rashomon is one those movies that at first seems have lot peculiarities but upon further viewing makes more more sense it doesnt need multiple viewings order be appreciated though its impact is pretty immediate its just that some things that seem more odd about it are much more lasting than one would think story is about four people who are involved rape murder theft woods how each tells story events with different stress order make themselves look better what is clear is this woman was taken front her husband by bandit husband was killed his sword was taken by bandit womans dagger somehow disappeared with those elements cynical outside observer hears stories each character eventually comes conclusion he has beginning that people are selfish self interested that good no longer exists world womans bandits witnesss stories are more easily accepted but what do we do with presence dead husbands ghost his story especially when priest points out that dead men dont lie akira kurosawa often puts metaphysical beings into story with same matter fact quality as he does any other character cynical observers eye this could be considered distraction however just ghost helps illustrate just how far japanese society has degraded away classic values just as listener tales tears apart rashomon temple as movie progresses selfish need firewood ghost no longer is held same amount abstractly definite authority presence priest his clenched grip around his faith humanity helps create dialog about how removed people have become abstract concepts good evil ghost priest temple are all very important part story same way outsiders anecdote they say demon who resided here fled rather than be met with evil human beings has dire importance interplay relationships this film kurosawas skill is not just dialog relationships his visual acuity helps accentuate these themes as well when story begins woods is magical even colorful despite black white photography it is woods fairy tale with magical breezes quiet streams as movie progresses woods lose more more their mystical quality become dirty dry by time battle between husband bandit is played out its final representation it is no longer valiant battle skill against two well versed opponents its stressful scary affair that has two kicking up more dust than swinging their swords dust itself shows degradation story away abstract qualities truth justice much more dirty ugly reality as promoted by outsider i dont think akira kurosawa necessarily holds theme this movie as utter truth especially considering hopeful ending but it does seem as if this movie came during very cynical time during kurosawas life many discuss it as post war film which isnt bad guess but even without its affinity post war world japan at time it somehow has profound effect viewers even today polarisdib,0.5753846153846154,0.011512820512820505,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,A superb Classic,"Kurosawa's magic film is a composite of 2 Japanese short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa: One, ""Rashomon,"" the title tells of a confrontation of a young man at Rashomon, the large, fortified gate at one entrance to Kyoto where people would abandon children and corpses; the other, yabu no naka ni, ""In a Grove,"" tells of the confrontation between the bandit, the samurai and his wife, told from the point of view of the woodcutter. In 1950, Kurosawa weaves this tale of human vanity and duplicity with the young Toshiro Mifune, as the bandit, Machiko Kyo as the lady and Masayuki Mori as the samurai. The tale unfolds through the flashbacks in the narration of the great Takashi Shimura as the woodcutter, supported by character actors Minoru Chiaki as the monk and Kichijiro Ueda as the bum. Basically, with a cast of six and the stark settings of a woods and a dilapidated castle gate in pouring rain, Kurosawa the magician gives us four views of human vanity, excessive pride and cultural conflict. The foibles of human needs are exposed but redeemed in the final scene where the basic act of kindness brings closure to the bizarre display of greed, lust and mendacity that has gone before. For a Kurosawa film, this one is short, to the point with an economy of emoting-- for which Mifune was never accused of under doing and the viewer is left somewhat exhausted by all the twists and turns, confused by the mix of contradictions and seeming paradox, but satisfied with a feeling of hope.",superb classic,kurosawas magic film is composite 2 japanese short stories by ryunosuke akutagawa one rashomon title tells confrontation young man at rashomon large fortified gate at one entrance kyoto where people would abandon children corpses other yabu no naka ni grove tells confrontation between bandit samurai his wife told point view woodcutter 1950 kurosawa weaves this tale human vanity duplicity with young toshiro mifune as bandit machiko kyo as lady masayuki mori as samurai tale unfolds through flashbacks narration great takashi shimura as woodcutter supported by character actors minoru chiaki as monk kichijiro ueda as bum basically with cast six stark settings woods dilapidated castle gate pouring rain kurosawa magician gives us four views human vanity excessive pride cultural conflict foibles human needs are exposed but redeemed final scene where basic act kindness brings closure bizarre display greed lust mendacity that has gone before kurosawa film this one is short point with economy emoting which mifune was never accused under doing viewer is left somewhat exhausted by all twists turns confused by mix contradictions seeming paradox but satisfied with feeling hope,0.46855158730158725,0.10441468253968256,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.46}"
