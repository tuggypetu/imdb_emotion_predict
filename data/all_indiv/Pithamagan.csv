8,A Fabulous Masterpiece,"An absolutely fantastic movie, to say the least!! This movie is the stand-out proof, if any were required, that Tamil cinema has been there on top with the best in the world when it comes to meaningful n powerful contributions to cinema.It's a simple story about an extraordinary man and his relationships with a perfectly ordinary world. Sitthan is a child of the graves, born in a cemetery and lived there all his life until one day, as a grown man he is forced to step out into the world. He is caught in times he does not understand. He is totally and believably unaware of such concepts as money, the police and dining etiquette. What he does possess is an animal instinct to survive.A street-side drug seller takes him into her fold and gets him employed in a cannabis farm. The rest of the story revolves around how he meets Shakthi, a conman who becomes his friend for life and how the two proceed through their collective lives.The movie is commendable in in many ways. Vikram gives a stellar National Award-winning performance as Sitthan. Almost dialog-less throughout the movie, he excels in every scene, emoting complex sentiments easily through gestures and grunts. His body language is compelling, almost prehistoric and carries a hint of an unspoken raw terror. The scenes where he mauls the policemen are brutal but bloodless. In one scene where he is hung on a rod like a captured tiger, he sends a growl into the face of a policemen, with such intensity it evokes unpleasant memories of Hannibal Lecter. Simply superb.The rest of the cast delivers the goods too. Shakti, played by Surya as the one soul who understands Sitthan is touching and convincing. The ladies are largely soulful. The direction by Bala is splendid, taking the story along with effortless ease. The fight sequences with Vikram butchering everyone are chillingly choreographed to incessant wild grunting. Though the editing could have been a lot slicker, the camera work is pretty good.The only scenes where the movie goes off track are the scenes with Simran and her hip-shakes. A totally unnecessary song-dance sequence. Also, Laila, playing Shakti's love interest, overdoes it at several occasions. But Vikram drowns it all.On the whole, a fantastic movie that delivers the slow-paced caffeine of a classic.",fabulous masterpiece,absolutely fantastic movie say least this movie is stand out proof if any were required that tamil cinema has been there top with best world when it comes meaningful n powerful contributions cinema its simple story about extraordinary man his relationships with perfectly ordinary world sitthan is child graves born cemetery lived there all his life until one day as grown man he is forced step out into world he is caught times he does not understand he is totally believably unaware such concepts as money police dining etiquette what he does possess is animal instinct survive street side drug seller takes him into her fold gets him employed cannabis farm rest story revolves around how he meets shakthi conman who becomes his friend life how two proceed through their collective lives movie is commendable many ways vikram gives stellar national award winning performance as sitthan almost dialog less throughout movie he excels every scene emoting complex sentiments easily through gestures grunts his body language is compelling almost prehistoric carries hint unspoken raw terror scenes where he mauls policemen are brutal but bloodless one scene where he is hung rod like captured tiger he sends growl into face policemen with such intensity it evokes unpleasant memories hannibal lecter simply superb rest cast delivers goods too shakti played by surya as one soul who understands sitthan is touching convincing ladies are largely soulful direction by bala is splendid taking story along with effortless ease fight sequences with vikram butchering everyone are chillingly choreographed incessant wild grunting though editing could have been lot slicker camera work is pretty good only scenes where movie goes off track are scenes with simran her hip shakes totally unnecessary song dance sequence also laila playing shaktis love interest overdoes it at several occasions but vikram drowns it all whole fantastic movie that delivers slow paced caffeine classic,0.6137541320468148,0.15874430447601182,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10,Indias Best.Bala's Masterpiece,"If u guys never seen a Indian movie..better start with this one..Indian movies are generally very superficial with lot of dance and fights...but this movie is very deep....with vikram's national award acting ,,actually surya did equally good.. and the only Indian movie which can be compared to international standards.Though there are lot of bollywood movies which are doing pretty good but the difference between them and Pithamagam is Unique....the B'wood are heavily influenced by other foreign movies but Pithamagan is a genuine material. somee other movies like nayagan which is a pure rip-off of ""godfather"" & once upon a time in America has got more credits than this movie..thats very SAD... the film is said to be based on a short story by jayakanthan. the story revolves aaround a vetian(who burns dead bodies accord to Indian tradition) who is detached from the society and how he gets close to some superb characters played by Surya. Laila, SangeetaWhats soo great about director Bala, he creates a world with characters so different and extreme at the same time very realistic. words really can't describe....its a must see..if u guys could get this movie with subtitles ...grab it..u will cry",indias best balas masterpiece,if u guys never seen indian movie better start with this one indian movies are generally very superficial with lot dance fights but this movie is very deep with vikrams national award acting actually surya did equally good only indian movie which can be compared international standards though there are lot bollywood movies which are doing pretty good but difference between them pithamagam is unique bwood are heavily influenced by other foreign movies but pithamagan is genuine material somee other movies like nayagan which is pure rip off godfather once upon time america has got more credits than this movie thats very sad film is said be based short story by jayakanthan story revolves aaround vetian who burns dead bodies accord indian tradition who is detached society how he gets close some superb characters played by surya laila sangeetawhats soo great about director bala he creates world with characters so different extreme at same time very realistic words really cant describe its must see if u guys could get this movie with subtitles grab it u will cry,0.5035632183908046,0.18986042692939245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.22}"
9,South Indian movie at its best,"I heard a lot about this movie but watched it probably because sometimes when i heard a lot about any movie i get a little biased towards watching it, as all the talk about it irritates me. I made a mistake in watching this movie earlier. 'Awesome' is an understatement. What attracted me towards this movie was the first time combination of two South Indian stars Vikram and Surya(both my favorite) of the three superstars(Vijay, Vikram and Surya). Vikram as usual gives an outstanding performance as mentally challenged undertaker, on the other hand Surya and Laila leaves no stone unturned to show their own skills and make movie better. The story in some good movie takes a second place to the characters, Pithamagan is one such movie.Watch it for Surya-Vikram duo, rest is just extra gift to you.",south indian movie at its best,i heard lot about this movie but watched it probably because sometimes when i heard lot about any movie i get little biased towards watching it as all talk about it irritates me i made mistake watching this movie earlier awesome is understatement what attracted me towards this movie was first time combination two south indian stars vikram surya both my favorite three superstars vijay vikram surya vikram as usual gives outstanding performance as mentally challenged undertaker other hand surya laila leaves no stone unturned show their own skills make movie better story some good movie takes second place characters pithamagan is one such movie watch it surya vikram duo rest is just extra gift you,0.5020833333333333,0.27421875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"

6,Chiyaan Vikram goes completely berserk and Suriya goes totally nasty in this soulful action drama,"Pithamagan (2003) : Brief Review -Chiyaan Vikram goes completely berserk and Suriya goes totally nasty in this soulful action drama. Pithamagan is typical South action flick with out of the hands characters. It's very easy to write an action flick with two heroes and one antagonist by mixing several filmy conflicts in it but it's not easy to have a mad character leading the ship. Pithamagan experiments with the leading actor and designs a solid emotional surroundings. At the same time, it shows you the second hero with completely opposite features from the mad one. That works on some level hence Pithamagan ends up well on its own zone. The film is about Chittan, a social outcast who has grown up in a cemetery. A drug dealer finds him a job in a cannabis farm but he gets caught by the cops In prison, he meets a kind-hearted conman, Shakti. This friendship transforms him from his stony existence and then tragedy strikes at them. Chiyaan Vikram plays Chittan with utter brutality. He is terrific in the role and goes on to cross the barriers of compromises set by other actors in Action Genre. No wonder why he won the national award for his performance, he was actually beyond any award credits. On the other side, Suriya is damn funny and entertaining as Shakti. Whenever he appears on screen, a grin smile on your face is generated naturally. Don't know why, but whenever he was about to speak something i found myself laughing already, i mean even before listening to his dialogues. Remember that formula of attraction between two opposite sides? It works so fine here. Bala's direction is good but nothing special. Even the film good but nothing like a classic at all. I am shocked to see such a high rating to this film. Anyways, i enjoyed it and that's enough.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",chiyaan vikram goes completely berserk suriya goes totally nasty this soulful action drama,pithamagan 2003 brief review chiyaan vikram goes completely berserk suriya goes totally nasty this soulful action drama pithamagan is typical south action flick with out hands characters its very easy write action flick with two heroes one antagonist by mixing several filmy conflicts it but its not easy have mad character leading ship pithamagan experiments with leading actor designs solid emotional surroundings at same time it shows you second hero with completely opposite features mad one that works some level hence pithamagan ends up well its own zone film is about chittan social outcast who has grown up cemetery drug dealer finds him job cannabis farm but he gets caught by cops prison he meets kind hearted conman shakti this friendship transforms him his stony existence then tragedy strikes at them chiyaan vikram plays chittan with utter brutality he is terrific role goes cross barriers compromises set by other actors action genre no wonder why he won national award his performance he was actually beyond any award credits other side suriya is damn funny entertaining as shakti whenever he appears screen grin smile your face is generated naturally dont know why but whenever he was about speak something i found myself laughing already i mean even before listening his dialogues remember that formula attraction between two opposite sides it works so fine here balas direction is good but nothing special even film good but nothing like classic at all i am shocked see such high rating this film anyways i enjoyed it thats enough rating 6 5 10 by,0.47878105590062126,0.038071946169772254,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10,"Outstanding, brilliant movie","Practically everyone of the main characters were brilliant. I liked the innocent and happy play of Suryan and Laila very much which contrasted nicely with the darker nature of the movie. Even Simran's dance was very good - no elaborate glamor, just plain and simple dance elements - I found it breathtaking. The characters were powerful yet realistic and believable. The police, the jailors, the rich, corrupt guys, the helplessness of poor people caught in these dynamics. Its such a relief to have a director who is original, strong, secure, no need not to copy from Hollywood. Bollywood is so bereft of ideas that no movie can survive without some item number, trying to cover up empty movies with technical whizbang - see the movie Race for example.
