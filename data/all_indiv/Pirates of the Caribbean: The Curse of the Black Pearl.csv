9.0,"""You better start believing in ghost stories. You're in one.""","What a great line to describe probably the greatest pirate movie ever. Certainly, it isn't perfect, a bit over the top, yet filled with characters that you love to hate or you can't resist rooting for. Thanks to the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, this has become a long-lasting franchise of Disney car and love the many sequels that followed up aren't as good, Jack has remained consistently strong in the ones where he was given a great opportunity to show off his huge talents.Johnny was justifiably nominated for an Oscar for his performance in this, and is ably supported by Geoffrey Rush as the ghostly Captain Barbarossa and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (brought up as a pirate until he was rescued at sea as a child), and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island.In his performance, Depp gives several insights into the real character of Jack Sparrow, and it is debated whether he was just an eccentric drunk or possibly gay or bisexual. Certainly, the slaps he gets from various women throughout the film debate the second point, but other insinuations indicate that he had prolactivities. Sparrow and Turner are rivals at first until they must join forces to rescue Elizabeth who is kidnapped by Barbarossa. she goes to a frightening sequence when she learns of who they really are, and that brings terrific elements of horror into the film.Fans of the Disneyland ride will be gleefully surprised to see various elements of it from the drunk man sleeping with tags, the jailed men trying to get a dog to bring over the key or the various battle fights at sea. they are spread throughout the film so you don't feel like you taking the ride and then gone back into a plot, so it makes it fun for experienced riders of that tourist attraction as they pop up.The terrific makeup, costumes, photography and music add to the sensational performances. This takes the best elements of all the classic pirate movies (from ""Treasure Island"" to ""Captain Kidd"") and adds a reality with the violence and filth and crudeness, but somehow, some of the pirates (especially Sparrow) are quite loveable in a strange way. This is non-stop action, filled with humor both physical and verbal, and some of it in spite of the lack of etiquette of the characters is subtlety classy. I can see myself returning to this every couple of years because certainly, like a trip to Disney, it's a ride that you don't want to miss when you have the opportunity.",you better start believing ghost stories youre one,what great line describe probably greatest pirate movie ever certainly it isnt perfect bit over top yet filled with characters that you love hate or you cant resist rooting thanks performance johnny depp as captain jack sparrow this has become long lasting franchise disney car love many sequels that followed up arent as good jack has remained consistently strong ones where he was given great opportunity show off his huge talents johnny was justifiably nominated oscar his performance this is ably supported by geoffrey rush as ghostly captain barbarossa orlando bloom as will turner brought up as pirate until he was rescued at sea as child keira knightley as elizabeth swann daughter governor caribbean island his performance depp gives several insights into real character jack sparrow it is debated whether he was just eccentric drunk or possibly gay or bisexual certainly slaps he gets various women throughout film debate second point but other insinuations indicate that he had prolactivities sparrow turner are rivals at first until they must join forces rescue elizabeth who is kidnapped by barbarossa she goes frightening sequence when she learns who they really are that brings terrific elements horror into film fans disneyland ride will be gleefully surprised see various elements it drunk man sleeping with tags jailed men trying get dog bring over key or various battle fights at sea they are spread throughout film so you dont feel like you taking ride then gone back into plot so it makes it fun experienced riders that tourist attraction as they pop up terrific makeup costumes photography music add sensational performances this takes best elements all classic pirate movies treasure island captain kidd adds reality with violence filth crudeness but somehow some pirates especially sparrow are quite loveable strange way this is non stop action filled with humor both physical verbal some it spite lack etiquette characters is subtlety classy i can see myself returning this every couple years because certainly like trip disney its ride that you dont want miss when you have opportunity,0.5743230625583566,0.22649393090569553,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9.0,"""That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.""","If you're ever in the mood for just a flat out entertaining flick, you can't go wrong with 'Curse of the Black Pearl"". I wasn't writing these reviews when this movie first came out, didn't even know there was such a thing as IMDb. So I'm finally getting back to it this many years later and even though I'd forgotten a lot about the story, I was blown away all over again by the outrageous antics of Captain Jack Sparrow and those transition scenes where the skeleton pirates manifest in the moonlight. In fact, the story itself might be incidental to the special effects and physical stunts that highlight the action in the film. Johnny Depp of course makes the movie with his swish-buckling (yeah, I misspelled it on purpose) approach to the character, and you couldn't ask for a more fetching lady in distress than Keira Knightley, although she managed to hold her own against most of those menacing pirates quite nicely. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush round out the rest of the principal cast, and each did a superb job. I've never gotten beyond this movie's sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest', but watching this one again inspires me to go forward and check out all the rest.",thats got be best pirate ive ever seen,if youre ever mood just flat out entertaining flick you cant go wrong with curse black pearl i wasnt writing these reviews when this movie first came out didnt even know there was such thing as imdb so im finally getting back it this many years later even though id forgotten lot about story i was blown away all over again by outrageous antics captain jack sparrow those transition scenes where skeleton pirates manifest moonlight fact story itself might be incidental special effects physical stunts that highlight action film johnny depp course makes movie with his swish buckling yeah i misspelled it purpose approach character you couldnt ask more fetching lady distress than keira knightley although she managed hold her own against most those menacing pirates quite nicely orlando bloom geoffrey rush round out rest principal cast each did superb job ive never gotten beyond this movies sequel dead mans chest but watching this one again inspires me go forward check out all rest,0.5393892339544514,0.1224120082815735,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Terrific!,"You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made.The opening concept is a clich√®:a beautiful woman(Keira Knightley)is kidnapped by a bunch of filthy pirates(led by Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa)and the man(Orlando Bloom)who's desperately in love with her decides to track them down.From now on,things get unexpected,as he asks another pirate for help.And it's no ordinary pirate:it's Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp),a lying,cheating,but charismatic scumbag,the hardest man on Earth to predict,not to mention quite unlucky and clumsy(""You are,with no doubt,the worst pirate I've ever heard of"" ""But you HAVE heard of me!"").It's got all the elements of a classic pirate movie,elements that would give this flick a 9/10.So,why am I giving it a 10/10? The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns.See you next summer,Captain!",terrific,you will always remember this as movie that made johnny depp superstar almost got him oscar fact that he didnt win isnt problem since thanks him this is best pirate film ever made opening concept is clich beautiful woman keira knightley is kidnapped by bunch filthy pirates led by geoffrey rushs barbossa man orlando bloom whos desperately love with her decides track them down now things get unexpected as he asks another pirate help its no ordinary pirate its captain jack sparrow johnny depp lying cheating but charismatic scumbag hardest man earth predict not mention quite unlucky clumsy you are with no doubt worst pirate ive ever heard but you have heard me its got all elements classic pirate movie elements that would give this flick 9 10 so why am i giving it 10 10 answer is simple captain jack moment he makes his entrance justly included empire top 10 entrances all time we know hes reason people will keep watching movie he s depps best non tim burton character ever i cant wait til he returns see you next summer captain,0.5562610229276896,0.19367283950617287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Phenomenal!,"If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",phenomenal,if there was minor quibble with movie it is that it is little overlong putting that aside this is truly wonderful film that is definitely one highlights 2003 whole film is wonder look at with splendid costumes very realistic sets script is just gem with classic original lines like stop blowing holes my ship that sometimes have you gales laughter i did find pirates as skeletons quite frightening though films that have scared me are mummy pitch black performances were first rate especially johnny depp possibly his best performance his character jack sparrow is somewhat charming likable rogue depp pulled him off perfection as barbossa geoffrey rush positively sinks his teeth into his role sometimes sinister sometimes fun kiera knightly proves once again that she looks lovely period dramas because it really does suit her orlando bloom is dashing as will turner before i round off i want mention another aspect film music by hans zimmer lion king it was outstanding zimmer should be up there with great film composers like james horner american tail titanic john williams et home alone late jerry goldsmith legend shadow all all highly entertaining film 10 10 bethany cox,0.5497222222222222,0.22791666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,One of the Most Delightful Pirates Adventure Ever,"When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes. I saw this movie for the first time on 24 April 2004, and I have just watched again today (10 Feb 2007) enjoying the same way as in the first time.

8.0,Surprisingly Good,"Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10",surprisingly good,although i had expectations watching trailers that this might be good movie i was still surprised that its as good as it is story is actually more complex than i had expected involving cursed pirates their quest rid themselves curse i wont say more than that so as not spoil it if you havent seen it there arent as many action scenes as i had thought there would be pirate movie but ones that are movie were very fun enjoyable after seeing it i think it had right balance action drama there are also course lot funny bits interspersed between action drama some really good special effects also add enjoyment this movie i wasnt much fan johnny depp until i saw this movie i think he deserved win academy award best actor its largely because his performance imo that movie was so good most supporting cast did well mind you just that johnny depp stood high above rest i did find orlando blooms performance bit wooden but other than that acting was good basically its really fun movie id give it about 8 out 10,0.4175223214285713,0.33694196428571427,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,"Finally, a real swashbuckling film to make me laugh","""Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,"" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)The moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)The other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...The basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: ""we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'""Jack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as ""the worst pirate I've ever seen"", as in ""the worst at it"", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).This character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another ""Mask of Zorro"", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...There are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.The film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - ""it's okay"", ""I was rooting for you"" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.But then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! √ø",finally real swashbuckling film make me laugh,even i love johnny depp im male previous reviewer declares tongue cheek well i wouldnt go quite that far

,Proof that Disney can still create good movies,"Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10",proof that disney can still create good movies,disney seemed be going down tubes lately with atlantis home range but this movie is masterpiece if it wasnt this movie johnny depp wouldnt be as famous as he is today every scene with him or geoffery rush is brilliant movie is very crisp shots islands are breathtaking definitely movie worth picking up at blockbuster or even better buying i dont buy dvds often but this was one them characters are thought out very well plot is excellent script is one main stars film itself every line that seems come out sparrow or barbossas mouth or any other cast is original if you like action films youll love this if you like comedy youll love this actually this movie is great everyone except small kids who may get frightened by skeleton scenes 10 10,0.5447089947089947,0.33505291005291005,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Depp for Emperor?,"I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?""And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking ""overproduced by"" credit on the cover-liner. ""Bombastic."" ""Overdone."" ""Absurdly Stupendous.""Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, ""What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?""Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, ""Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho"" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another ""entry"" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure.

,Why is the rum gone?,"A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view.This movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in.At first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway, as I've always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story.

,A Pirate For Our Times,"What lifts this film above typical Disney fluff is Johnny Depp's humorous performance as pirate Jack Sparrow, the eccentric, individualistic anti-hero, who confronts other pirates, and outwits a humorless, incompetent bureaucratic establishment. Sparrow looks more like Cher than Johnny Depp, and talks more like William F. Buckley than a pirate. Geoffrey Rush is a worthy foil as the main rival pirate, Barbossa, a character who vaguely resembles Margaret Hamilton in ""The Wizard Of Oz"".Most of the plot is silly. There's lots of fighting, shouting, and general mayhem, all accompanied by a frantic score. It's a cinematic slight of hand that conveys an illusion of substance.

He's more like Fagan in ""Oliver."" Capt. Sparrow's ever so fey. That's his charm.Though the pirates on the ""Black Pearl"" ship are dead & sometimes in their skeleton form they aren't scary enough for kids since this is a comedy.The story line goes as follows: A governor's daughter is in charge of a young boy her own age who has been pulled out of the sea by her father's bourgeoisie crew. She notices his necklace is a pirate's & takes it from him to protect him from being hung to death.But, the golden medallion is the last 1 of a pirate's treasure that has cursed the ""Black Pearl"" ship's crew. Without its return, with the blood of the boy on it, the skeletal crew remains dead, unable to feel any life in themselves; they are also not killable since they are already dead.Capt. Sparrow (Depp), though a bumbling comical pirate who's bent upon owning the ""Black Pearl,"" the ship the cursed crew stole from him, plays a marvelously lovable & lucky pirate who is the super glue that holds together the loose ends of the movie.

,Johnny Depp puts a little swish in swashbuckle...,"Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney's first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.Other than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character's personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of 'Pirates' reads like a Who's Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early '90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (E.T., Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Back to the Future to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'.That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.A few predictions may be in order, however. Look for an Oscar nomination for Depp's efforts. Look for nominations as well for sound, set design, makeup, and cinematography. As far as best picture? Next to Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)? Not likely.Director Gore Verbinski, who used to play in a punk rock band and is best known for creating the Budweiser frogs, does an outstanding job keeping track of the myriad details required of a director, given his limited experience. True, 'Pirates' has countless errors in continuity, but those occur in any film of such scope. Mr. Verbinski has only four other films to his name: a short entitled The Ritual (1996), and then three very different but effectively made films, Mouse Hunt (1997), The Mexican (2001), and the very creepy thriller The Ring (2002). Again, it makes one wonder just who is at the helm of the USS Disney to put a $125 million movie in the hands of a neophyte. Well, it worked with Lord of the Rings and a very inexperienced Peter Jackson, and it worked here for Disney as well.'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a fun movie for most of the family. It may be rather scary for children ten and under and somewhat boring for many over twenty-five.

9.0,This is a true classic,"There are two few action-adventure movies now a days that delivers such original characters, played by a truly incredible cast. When I first saw The Curse of the Black Pearl as a boy I was fascinated. There where Pirates, cannons, sword fights, treasures funny monkey's and a beautiful girl, What more could you possibly ask for. I can still remember when I saw Jack Sparrow for the first time. He may not of had the typical ""hero"" qualities that would see in somebody like say William Turner, but that is what made jack so undeniably brilliant, he wasn't somebody we have experienced before. He was a witty, drunk, Sword fighting Pirate, with a flare for the dramatic. Seen for the first time in possibly the greatest hero entranced ever made. I glanced my stunned eye's at the screen to behold the one they called Jack Sparrow, or should I say ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow. There he stood in all his glory, the anthem soundtrack blared as he stood on top of his wooden sinking ship, or boat... As he floats by the pirate outlaws hung by there necks, with a sign on them that states ""pirates Ye Be Warned"" he stops bailing his sinking boat in time to offer a kind salute, to his fellow dead pirates.Its not long in till we are swept away by a amazing story of a two men desperately trying to find the loves of there life. One a Pirate after his stolen ship, and the other, a working hard blacksmith boy, trying to find his true love. Luckily for them, both loves have been taken by the ""crew of the dammed"". Barbossa, the fearless pirate with a pet monkey, yes a pet monkey. It soon becomes apparent that everyone in the story wants something, and they will screw and back-stab anyone who gets in there way, honestly this film there are know such thing as true friends, everyone will become an enemy in time.After years of watching this film, it still reveals itself as nothing more but a great adventure movie, just plain fun. So why not give it ten out of ten. There is everything you want in an adventure movie, girls, fights and a little magic and mystery. Not to mention some of the best 1-liners you will ever hear, ""you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner, you're in one"", and my personal favourite, the very last line in the film, as Jack prepares to embark on more of his adventures he quotes ""bring me that horizon"" as the ship sales off into the sunset.",this is true classic,there are two few action adventure movies now days that delivers such original characters played by truly incredible cast when i first saw curse black pearl as boy i was fascinated there where pirates cannons sword fights treasures funny monkeys beautiful girl what more could you possibly ask i can still remember when i saw jack sparrow first time he may not had typical hero qualities that would see somebody like say william turner but that is what made jack so undeniably brilliant he wasnt somebody we have experienced before he was witty drunk sword fighting pirate with flare dramatic seen first time possibly greatest hero entranced ever made i glanced my stunned eyes at screen behold one they called jack sparrow or should i say captain jack sparrow there he stood all his glory anthem soundtrack blared as he stood top his wooden sinking ship or boat as he floats by pirate outlaws hung by there necks with sign them that states pirates ye be warned he stops bailing his sinking boat time offer kind salute his fellow dead pirates its not long till we are swept away by amazing story two men desperately trying find loves there life one pirate after his stolen ship other working hard blacksmith boy trying find his true love luckily them both loves have been taken by crew dammed barbossa fearless pirate with pet monkey yes pet monkey it soon becomes apparent that everyone story wants something they will screw back stab anyone who gets there way honestly this film there are know such thing as true friends everyone will become enemy time after years watching this film it still reveals itself as nothing more but great adventure movie just plain fun so why not give it ten out ten there is everything you want adventure movie girls fights little magic mystery not mention some best 1 liners you will ever hear you best start believing ghost stories miss turner youre one my personal favourite very last line film as jack prepares embark more his adventures he quotes bring me that horizon as ship sales off into sunset,0.5180692640692641,0.23572510822510825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"
