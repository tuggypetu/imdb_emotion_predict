9.0,The edge of seat thriller after a long time which is scarier than many horror movies.,"The main advice for watching this film as said in Idharkkudhaane aasaipattai Balakumara ""It should not be watched by 1) People less 18 of age 2) Pregnant ladies 3) Heart patients""Though it's not a Horror film, the movie is scarier, especially second half.Story: The movie started as a usual crime film, but tone became darker when the movie started to progress. The backstory of Psycho was good.Screenplay: The screenplay in this movie is engaging and brilliant. First half seems to be normal. But, the true fear starts in its second half, though there are very few loopholes.Music: The best one about the movie is its BGM. 80% of the fear is because of its BGM. The dark music which completely matched the film. Gibran again proved himself to be the best music director.Acting: All actors did their best. This is the best movie ever for both Vishnu Vishal and Amala Paul in terms of acting. All the other actors dedicated well.Other things: The runtime in this movie is too long which is around 2 Hours and 50 minutes. But one doesn't feel that the movie is dragging, because of the engaging screenplay. Each and every scene in this movie is essential. Moreover, editing was crispier which added more thrill to the film.On the whole, it would be a great movie if you watch it in theatre.My rating: 4.5/5",edge seat thriller after long time which is scarier than many horror movies,main advice watching this film as said idharkkudhaane aasaipattai balakumara it should not be watched by 1 people less 18 age 2 pregnant ladies 3 heart patients though its not horror film movie is scarier especially second half story movie started as usual crime film but tone became darker when movie started progress backstory psycho was good screenplay screenplay this movie is engaging brilliant first half seems be normal but true fear starts its second half though there are very few loopholes music best one about movie is its bgm 80 fear is because its bgm dark music which completely matched film gibran again proved himself be best music director acting all actors did their best this is best movie ever both vishnu vishal amala paul terms acting all other actors dedicated well other things runtime this movie is too long which is around 2 hours 50 minutes but one doesnt feel that movie is dragging because engaging screenplay each every scene this movie is essential moreover editing was crispier which added more thrill film whole it would be great movie if you watch it theatre my rating 4 5 5,0.36509803921568634,0.2374509803921569,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.22}"

7.0,Awesome except for having unneeded dramatized ending,"The movie is awesome and keeps you engaging until the final climax where suddenly characters started making sillying mistakes and allowing the killer to slip from their hands. Which really was frustrating. Given that the actor asking in few scenes before to another police officer to shoot at killer without thinking but when himself presented the same opportunity doesn't do so. He has a clear shot ahead while the killer is just paused prior hammering the kid. Actor could have simply shot at killer's hammer holding hand but instead he simply moves near and allowing the killer to slip again.In several instances I found it dumb for police officers to gave up their vehicles and chase killer on foot when apparantly the killer is in vehicle.The entire buildup and suspense was truly engaging and the story went quite good untill it reached its climax and closure sequence. Unnecessary past reference that too out of context which lead to illogical conclusion of teasing the killer just to distract didn't made sense. And killer in-spite being diagnosed with hormone disorder disease had surprisingly super natural stamina to keep attempting to arise after every blow. Actor was literally giving the killer third degree kind of beating still killer was amazingly agile and quick on feets.To sum up the frustrating mistakes were: 1. Police officer not shooting (at least on legs) even when Hero is explicitly repeating to do so on phone.(Atleast he fires at tire. Bless him for that); Plus why he allows the killer to play with cards?2. Hero not shooting killer (hypocrite) when had clear chance. Was he afraid that killer's speed of swinging hammer being faster than bullet?3. The actress while running upstairs away from killer is clearly trying to save the kid but surprisingly she somehow manages to forget the kid in very next scene. Lol. Killler was too scary for her consciousness maybe4. The doctor driving the car when found the kid ahead and after having a glimpse of killer surprisingly turns to feet instead of car to run away. How smart!5. In a chase scene where the actor is chasing on feet and other officer on bike, the killer gets rid of them easily by applying the brakes and making bike officer to bump on the Van. And amazingly the unhurt actor prioritise to console bike officer instead of continuing chase by bike or foot. Bike officer wasn't really fatally injured!",awesome except having unneeded dramatized ending,movie is awesome keeps you engaging until final climax where suddenly characters started making sillying mistakes allowing killer slip their hands which really was frustrating given that actor asking few scenes before another police officer shoot at killer without thinking but when himself presented same opportunity doesnt do so he has clear shot ahead while killer is just paused prior hammering kid actor could have simply shot at killers hammer holding hand but instead he simply moves near allowing killer slip again several instances i found it dumb police officers gave up their vehicles chase killer foot when apparantly killer is vehicle entire buildup suspense was truly engaging story went quite good untill it reached its climax closure sequence unnecessary past reference that too out context which lead illogical conclusion teasing killer just distract didnt made sense killer spite being diagnosed with hormone disorder disease had surprisingly super natural stamina keep attempting arise after every blow actor was literally giving killer third degree kind beating still killer was amazingly agile quick feets sum up frustrating mistakes were 1 police officer not shooting at least legs even when hero is explicitly repeating do so phone atleast he fires at tire bless him that plus why he allows killer play with cards 2 hero not shooting killer hypocrite when had clear chance was he afraid that killers speed swinging hammer being faster than bullet 3 actress while running upstairs away killer is clearly trying save kid but surprisingly she somehow manages forget kid very next scene lol killler was too scary her consciousness maybe4 doctor driving car when found kid ahead after having glimpse killer surprisingly turns feet instead car run away how smart 5 chase scene where actor is chasing feet other officer bike killer gets rid them easily by applying brakes making bike officer bump van amazingly unhurt actor prioritise console bike officer instead continuing chase by bike or foot bike officer wasnt really fatally injured,0.5340986394557822,0.14438775510204085,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.47}"
8.0,"Shud hav trimmed the length n removed the lousy slow motion scenes. Nevertheless, a captivating serial killer film with terrific music n a hot actress.","I came across this title on IMDb n the synopsis piqued up interest. As a fan of serial killer films n aft seeing almost every Hollywoood, Korean, Spanish n German serial killer films, I can vouch that this film is well made for fans of the genre. I am not familiar with any of the star cast, director or people involved with this film. The lead actor is decent n the actress very hot. The plot is about a man who is obsessed with serial killers n who wants to join film making business but out of family pressure has to join police police force. At the same time there is a serial lurking in the cops's precinct killing young girls. The female who played the cop's sis cannot act for sure. Some of the action sequences were laughable n also the last scene with the cop n the killer face to face n the then hide n seek n the action was a bit lousy. The house of the killer had a creepy feel to it n there is sufficient tension n suspense. The background story of the killer was given too much time, in fact the problem with Indian cinema is that they spoon feed too much but thank God there were no lousy songs n unnecessary muscle flaunting. The film deserves a 7 but I am a bit generous with an 8 cos of the effort.",shud hav trimmed length n removed lousy slow motion scenes nevertheless captivating serial killer film with terrific music n hot actress,i came across this title imdb n synopsis piqued up interest as fan serial killer films n aft seeing almost every hollywoood korean spanish n german serial killer films i can vouch that this film is well made fans genre i am not familiar with any star cast director or people involved with this film lead actor is decent n actress very hot plot is about man who is obsessed with serial killers n who wants join film making business but out family pressure has join police police force at same time there is serial lurking copss precinct killing young girls female who played cops sis cannot act sure some action sequences were laughable n also last scene with cop n killer face face n then hide n seek n action was bit lousy house killer had creepy feel it n there is sufficient tension n suspense background story killer was given too much time fact problem with indian cinema is that they spoon feed too much but thank god there were no lousy songs n unnecessary muscle flaunting film deserves 7 but i am bit generous with 8 cos effort,0.5063034188034188,-0.019070512820512822,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,"Stylish, Fast-Paced And Full Of Twists. Fans Of Thrillers DO NOT Miss This One!","My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠To begin with, I generally refrain from giving a 10/10 rating to every movie I happen to fall in love with immediately but this here is an exception. One of the main reasons being that not a single second is boring and the speed with which the narrative moves is refreshing for its 2 hrs 25 mins runtime length. The other being that I am always looking and searching for a good thriller that lights up parts of my brain in all the wonderful ways only a thriller can.This certainly went above and beyond my expectations. Watching 'Ratsasan' is like going on an exhilarating rollercoaster ride which doesn't want to end until the viewer is satisfied and has been left completely quenched from their craving for a thriller. It is unique and infinitely creative as far as storytelling goes for the thriller genre.'Ratsasan' defines what edge-of-your-seat really means. It masterfully balances all the elements of a great thriller with an intelligence and style that only a handful of movies have mastered as of yet.

6.0,Good thriller movie. But takes so many inspirations from Hollywood and other movies.,"What disappointed me was that it took inspiration of Hollywood movies: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and a Malayalam movie: Dhrishyam . The story, direction took so many aspects from this and mix it up to suit Indian version. Those who haven't watched any of these will feel Ratsasan is great and all that. But I felt it was a huge disappointment to see too many concept copies. Neither it leads a good love story, a predictable prolonged suspense, annoying starting without any purpose of him being aspiring film maker. The story jumps too many emotions just to keep people rolling on with suspense and emotions which it does multiple times.It could have been a great movieif the director stopped too much taking much plots from all these movies to tell a simple story. Though I understand why it is liked by many. Because most Indians don't watch foreign films or even Hollywood films. And it takes granted for film makers to take things from others and pick a story and fuse those elements.Acting are good in parts, but I wish they established a simple story, hold a bit to weave a nice character development of villain and antagonist to fit the story. Overall if you see movie as someone who never watched any world movies than surely it's good film but can't be called the best.",good thriller movie but takes so many inspirations hollywood other movies,what disappointed me was that it took inspiration hollywood movies se7en silence lambs curious case benjamin button malayalam movie dhrishyam story direction took so many aspects this mix it up suit indian version those who havent watched any these will feel ratsasan is great all that but i felt it was huge disappointment see too many concept copies neither it leads good love story predictable prolonged suspense annoying starting without any purpose him being aspiring film maker story jumps too many emotions just keep people rolling with suspense emotions which it does multiple times it could have been great movieif director stopped too much taking much plots all these movies tell simple story though i understand why it is liked by many because most indians dont watch foreign films or even hollywood films it takes granted film makers take things others pick story fuse those elements acting are good parts but i wish they established simple story hold bit weave nice character development villain antagonist fit story overall if you see movie as someone who never watched any world movies than surely its good film but cant be called best,0.5015639589169001,0.2676470588235294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.13}"
7.0,"Watch it, enjoy it, forget it... Nothing memorable about it","It was a surprise hit of kollywood. There was no popular face associated to the film and hence, no big expectations, but the word of mouth spread quickly and It ran in some theaters over Chennai for over a month. Distributors were ready to release it in Telugu as well. Quickly, the name spread all over facebook and possibly every single social media platform plus youtube and it gained nationwide acclaim. Currently, no. 7 in top rated Indian movies on IMDb. This is because a lot of Indians on IMDb are amateurs whose only job is to exaggerate everything related to Indian cinema. Ratsasan is an example of those films which are good, but overpraised.Story is same as any other Psychological thriller. Feels a little inspired, but the treatment is good. There is an overuse of BGM. There is a different BGM used for almost every single situation ,some of them are really good though.Like every other tamil film, the hero has a love interest, and he won her after beating some goons. Sounds familiar? The action scenes were lousy(as always). The cops may spent months and even years to find a clue about the killer, but our main villian can find anyone's address, threaten his/her family notice being noticed by anyone. Talking about logic? Moreover, it was edge of a seat kind of thriller( watch Theeran Adhigaram Ondru to know what it means). The length is surely a problem.Besides these obvious flaws, I can say Ghibran did a brilliant job as composer ,his sountrack enhances the feel of the film, without it, it would be boring.I can say the film didn't dissapoint me, it's reviewers did.",watch it enjoy it forget it nothing memorable about it,it was surprise hit kollywood there was no popular face associated film hence no big expectations but word mouth spread quickly it ran some theaters over chennai over month distributors were ready release it telugu as well quickly name spread all over facebook possibly every single social media platform plus youtube it gained nationwide acclaim currently no 7 top rated indian movies imdb this is because lot indians imdb are amateurs whose only job is exaggerate everything related indian cinema ratsasan is example those films which are good but overpraised story is same as any other psychological thriller feels little inspired but treatment is good there is overuse bgm there is different bgm used almost every single situation some them are really good though like every other tamil film hero has love interest he won her after beating some goons sounds familiar action scenes were lousy as always cops may spent months even years find clue about killer but our main villian can find anyones address threaten his her family notice being noticed by anyone talking about logic moreover it was edge seat kind thriller watch theeran adhigaram ondru know what it means length is surely problem besides these obvious flaws i can say ghibran did brilliant job as composer his sountrack enhances feel film without it it would be boring i can say film didnt dissapoint me its reviewers did,0.5203664799253034,0.1268032212885154,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.32}"

The only thing I did not like was the stupid police chief woman, she's beyond annoying and I doubt she'd be like that in real life since she's doing everything against the case and in real life if you were as egoistic as her you'd still want to close the case cause it might give a promotion or recognition or something, here she just tried her hardest to not solve it.",very dark hardcore disturbing exellent thriller,i loved this so much pacing was amazing tons mindblowing plot twists though one them was predictable music is so creepy well done this film gave me dozens goosebumps only thing i did not like was stupid police chief woman shes beyond annoying i doubt shed be like that real life since shes doing everything against case real life if you were as egoistic as her youd still want close case cause it might give promotion or recognition or something here she just tried her hardest not solve it,0.7092307692307693,-0.1457692307692308,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.38}"
5.0,Extremely overrated.,"What they carefully built in the first half, recklessly destroyed in the second. People who are not familiar with psychological mystery thriller genre are hailing it as a masterpiece, it's a typical thriller drama. I think the regional crowd seems to be the cause for its high rating than it deserves. The reveal was just unbearably awful.Raman Raghav 2.0 stands the only worthy response international psychological thriller market.",extremely overrated,what they carefully built first half recklessly destroyed second people who are not familiar with psychological mystery thriller genre are hailing it as masterpiece its typical thriller drama i think regional crowd seems be cause its high rating than it deserves reveal was just unbearably awful raman raghav 2 0 stands only worthy response international psychological thriller market,0.5171428571428571,-0.07160714285714287,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10.0,A movie made with a lot of heart... 10/10,"Great plot, good execution, and great performances made this a memorable outing for me...First of all, would love to see Vishnu Visal going forward selecting good stories like this. Indru Netru Naalai was a similar selection from him. Here too, he selected a proper psycho-thriller, which I haven't seen executed this well in recent years in Indian cinema. Making a 2hr 45 min long movie takes guts these days. It shows how confident the director was, with the content.A lot of set-ups and pay-offs are there in the movie, which spring up every now and then making it interesting. The BG Score by Ghibran was great, kept me glued to the screen. The children performed so well in their respective roles, and so did Amala Paul, Kali Venkat, Nizhalgal Ravi, etc.. The twists were believable, and not the familiar one-twist saves all kindof mediocre stuff. It tests your observation throwing stuff right in front of your eyes, and hiding them perfectly. Worth a watch...",movie made with lot heart 10 10,great plot good execution great performances made this memorable outing me first all would love see vishnu visal going forward selecting good stories like this indru netru naalai was similar selection him here too he selected proper psycho thriller which i havent seen executed this well recent years indian cinema making 2hr 45 min long movie takes guts these days it shows how confident director was with content lot set ups pay offs are there movie which spring up every now then making it interesting bg score by ghibran was great kept me glued screen children performed so well their respective roles so did amala paul kali venkat nizhalgal ravi etc twists were believable not familiar one twist saves all kindof mediocre stuff it tests your observation throwing stuff right front your eyes hiding them perfectly worth watch,0.5301190476190476,0.31991071428571427,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"

,Interesting ideas but nothing we haven't seen before. Contain obvious plotholes.,"Overall the ideas are interesting but I'm sure most of the reviews already covered these ideas.Plotholes and conveniences are jarring and annoyed me more than they should because I expected much more from the film:1) How did a serial killer suspect easily break from his arrest at the hospital? Remember he's not the killer, he's was just a school teacher.2) How come the school teacher has the same doll in his house? Remember the teacher only invited the student because they use the same taxi.3) The killer was too overpowered, easily entered the school teacher's house to plant the evidence (like that baby doll). Not to mention overpowering a cop only using playing cards.4) The cops are so incompetent to the point that the only competent cops in the film are the protagonist and some cop that let the protagonist out of the jail. His supervisor constantly being a hindrance, his friend who has aim a gun at the serial killer yet wouldn't shoot him, and even the protagonist himself sometimes would do stupid things like waiting for the schoolgirl to be captured while sitting in the car for about 1 kilometer away.5) Almost everyone would see the twist coming from miles away (the serial killer is the son)Overall, I think it's a solid 7/10. Good thriller but could've been better.",interesting ideas but nothing we havent seen before contain obvious plotholes,overall ideas are interesting but im sure most reviews already covered these ideas plotholes conveniences are jarring annoyed me more than they should because i expected much more film 1 how did serial killer suspect easily break his arrest at hospital remember hes not killer hes was just school teacher 2 how come school teacher has same doll his house remember teacher only invited student because they use same taxi 3 killer was too overpowered easily entered school teachers house plant evidence like that baby doll not mention overpowering cop only using playing cards 4 cops are so incompetent point that only competent cops film are protagonist some cop that let protagonist out jail his supervisor constantly being hindrance his friend who has aim gun at serial killer yet wouldnt shoot him even protagonist himself sometimes would do stupid things like waiting schoolgirl be captured while sitting car about 1 kilometer away 5 almost everyone would see twist coming miles away serial killer is son overall i think its solid 7 10 good thriller but couldve been better,0.5026748971193415,0.1395061728395062,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.38}"
