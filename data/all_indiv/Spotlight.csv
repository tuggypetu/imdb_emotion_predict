10.0,It will leave you shaken....,"Before you consider watching ""Spotlight"", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).The story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.Why did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!",it will leave you shaken,before you consider watching spotlight i strongly urge you think twice it isnt because i think its bad film its amazingly good but its also difficult film watch particularly if you or someone close you has been victim sexual abuse i know that my case it was particularly tough because i am retired psychotherapist used specialize working with sexual abuse victims perpetrators latter which i think benefit very little treatment which is much reasons i changed careers story is about not only discovery huge number pedophile priests boston parish by boston globe reporters but organizations discovery that problem went all way top other words even beloved cardinal bernard law knew about many many victims yet did nothing discipline them or restrict their access more victims but film doesnt just talk about so much that we know be true today but it covers stop by step process by which paper began completed investigation why did i give film 10 particularly since i almost never give films such high scores well reason is that folks making movie really really cared about subject matter getting it right instead focusing making money with film including usual glitz glamour filmmakers chose instead emphasize realism above all else normal looking actors such as michael keaton mark ruffalo are used they make efforts keep them normal looking additionally film has relatively slow deliberate pace again as they werent interested making pretty or hollywoodizing production overall great film made greater because folks making it really really seemed care wanted get it right which showed great sensitivity subject matter victims great film,0.5265854978354977,0.18709370490620492,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,A heavy subject dealt with rivetingly,"'Spotlight' to me was a very worthy Best Picture winner. Even if it didn't do much for me, which it did, it would still be appreciated for what it set out to do and would have been applauded for trying.It took on a very heavy subject, that is still very much relevant today, and does it in a way that's riveting with a strong emotional core, strong insight that illuminates and tells of stuff that we didn't know (that leaves us shocked and very angry) and not fall into the trap of having too much of things that we knew already. It also never feels mawkish or preachy, traps that it also could have fallen into.While it is a deliberate and relatively slow-paced film, it didn't leave me bored for a second, instead gluing me in with its excellent performances across the board, how it tells its story, it's beautifully balanced screenplay and sheer class. Tom McCarthy's direction has all the class and professionalism that 'Spotlight' needed.Other strengths are the way it's filmed, it's very atmospheric and evocative in its detail and the cinematography is gritty and ravishing. The music fits beautifully, 'Spotlight's' script and story are engrossing and quietly intelligent and the characters are written compellingly.Acting is excellent across the board. Both Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams give career-best performances worthy of award recognition, particularly Ruffalo. Michael Keaton's performances here and in the previous year's 'Birdman' are his best in years, a very commanding turn. Brian D'Arcy James are up to their level.Overall, a riveting and brave film that does wonders with a difficult subject matter. 10/10 Bethany Cox",heavy subject dealt with rivetingly,spotlight me was very worthy best picture winner even if it didnt do much me which it did it would still be appreciated what it set out do would have been applauded trying it took very heavy subject that is still very much relevant today does it way thats riveting with strong emotional core strong insight that illuminates tells stuff that we didnt know that leaves us shocked very angry not fall into trap having too much things that we knew already it also never feels mawkish or preachy traps that it also could have fallen into while it is deliberate relatively slow paced film it didnt leave me bored second instead gluing me with its excellent performances across board how it tells its story its beautifully balanced screenplay sheer class tom mccarthys direction has all class professionalism that spotlight needed other strengths are way its filmed its very atmospheric evocative its detail cinematography is gritty ravishing music fits beautifully spotlights script story are engrossing quietly intelligent characters are written compellingly acting is excellent across board both mark ruffalo rachel mcadams give career best performances worthy award recognition particularly ruffalo michael keatons performances here previous years birdman are his best years very commanding turn brian darcy james are up their level overall riveting brave film that does wonders with difficult subject matter 10 10 bethany cox,0.5893410852713178,0.2162403100775194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,One of the greatest horror films of all time,"... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up.And then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath.As a film it is superb. McCarthy who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady.A reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me.A must-see.",one greatest horror films all time,because by time credits roll you start breathe normally again you will suddenly realize that this was not horror film as such this was re enactment events that actually happened with real victims real perpetrators real well meaning third parties covering up whole thing as fast as body count kept piling up then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath as film it is superb mccarthy who did double duty as writer director deserves acknowledgement cast is universally excellent ruffalo gives performance his career keaton is solid as rock mcadams reaps overdue dividends her decision broaden her career into non glamorous roles at time when only scripts they were sending her were diva parts smart lady reviewer is not supposed interject personal feelings review but i will say without apology that i miss films like these films that speak injustice society offer solutions wish there were more them it seems that when i was younger there was lot more interest doing right thing merely because it was right thing this no longer seems be societal meme that troubles me must see,0.4865714285714286,0.24142857142857144,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9.0,Not often that a film truly entertains as well as informs...,"Sometimes, a film of this type makes a real impact... just sometimes... But, it very often doesn't have any impact at all like in the case of movies like Dark Waters (Dupont) or Deepwater Horizon (BP) or Love & Other Drugs (Pfizer/Eli Lilly) or The Big Short (Banks) or Thank You For Smoking (Tobacco)... I'd like to think that this film had at least a measurable impact on society and more specifically, the amount of sexual abuse cases in religion... and that in itself, is commendable.The film does a good job not only focusing on the main cast of characters, but also spends some time focusing on the sub-supporting characters, like the 'survivors' in the film and spends a good amount of time on the investigative part of the whole story as well... journalism like this didn't just fall out of the sky... it took months and months of hard researching and interviewing many many different people...They obviously took some creative license wrt. the events and timeline of certain parts of the film, but overall about 90% of the events shown in the film actually happened.

10.0,A movie that qualifies as strong meat a.k.a. be ready to digest a lot of reality and face the true face of a world unknown to people living in a happy bubble.,"This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic.

10.0,Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness,"Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW...",fantastic movie filled with sadness,going into theater see spotlight i had read rave reviews knew i was something special this movie did not disappoint being boston this movie really made me think about my life growing up as lot what ifs came mind what if i went church every sunday what if i was gullible enough have priest lure me into his lair spotlight goes straight heart this amazingly sad apparently never ending saga catholic church amount abuse priests have inflicted hundreds victims acting is all around fantastic mr keaton some actors that i am not familiar with which is aspect this fine movie that makes it so profound tense throughout i was saddened hear that this abuse is epidemic probably will never be stopped exclamation point was when member audience stood up told rest us i am survivor wow,0.5825892857142857,0.09445684523809526,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,"Burns slow, but riveting to the end","Garnered awards and horrifying subject matter put aside, take a look at the movie poster for ""Spotlight"". It's a still image of the principal cast hovered over a cluttered desk in a small room. It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising. You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am an absolute sucker for this.The scandal herein is the systemic cover-up of pederasty within the Catholic Church. To that end (even though a lot of the dialogue in this movie is come-from-behind startling), one line in particular jumped out at me: ""They say it's just physical abuse but it's more than that, this was spiritual abuse. You know why I went along with everything? Because priests are supposed to be the good guys."" This isn't just a story about the crimes committed, but there's also sensitivity towards the victims themselves. I dunno, I just found that line deeply unnerving.But when all is said and done, this movie runs on the grueling nuts-and-bolts detective work of investigative journalism; a uniformly excellent cast, great writing and tension that continues to build.Amazing stuff.9/10",burns slow but riveting end,garnered awards horrifying subject matter put aside take look at movie poster spotlight its still image principal cast hovered over cluttered desk small room its not flashy but still incredibly effective piece advertising you know instant that this is journalism movie die hards rolled up shirtsleeves working all hours unearth national scandal i am absolute sucker this scandal herein is systemic cover up pederasty within catholic church that end even though lot dialogue this movie is come behind startling one line particular jumped out at me they say its just physical abuse but its more than that this was spiritual abuse you know why i went along with everything because priests are supposed be good guys this isnt just story about crimes committed but theres also sensitivity towards victims themselves i dunno i just found that line deeply unnerving but when all is said done this movie runs grueling nuts bolts detective work investigative journalism uniformly excellent cast great writing tension that continues build amazing stuff 9 10,0.5845238095238096,0.11363636363636363,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet,"In ""All the President's Men"", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In ""Spotlight"", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called ""Spotlight"" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.The story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is more to the story. The ""seed"" is similar to the break-in of the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots against perceived political enemies.The Spotlight team is headed by Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Keaton), a no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story. Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names. Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in similar criminal behavior against minors.On another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book over several years are listed as ""on leave due to illness"", ""on administrative leave"", or other designations of inactivity after only one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic Church, all the way to the Vatican.This is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often boys because they were less likely to ""squeal"" because of the shame, the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts of the country, it was happening internationally.",all vaticans men outstanding investigative journalism film revealing skeletons boston archdioceses closet,all presidents men young reporters bob woodward carl bernstein uncovered national political scandal when they through their investigative journalism revealed white house under then president richard nixon was using campaign funding finance dirty tricks political enemies nicknamed watergate spotlight similar team investigative reporters reveal scandal epic proportions which makes much watergate scandal seem tame by comparison they uncovered widespread sexual abuse minors committed by priests roman catholic church who turn hid crimes michael rezendes mark ruffalo walter v robinson michael keaton sacha pfeiffer rachel mcadams martin marty baron leiv schreiber ben bradlee jr john slattery matt carroll brian darcy james work group investigative reporters within boston globe called spotlight who succeed finding skeletons boston diocese proverbial closet many years prior sexual abuse scandal spotlight had investigated reported many other ground breaking stories story begins with quick flash back 1976 when priest is jailed sexual abusing minor film then cuts 2001 marty baron schreiber jewish floridian becomes main editor boston globe he meets different editors journalists learns work by spotlight globe column reveals lawyer mitchell garabedian claims cardinal law then archbishop boston knew father john geoghan priest within laws diocese was sexually abusing children bishop did not bring him attention authorities baron urges spotlight team investigate further see whether claim is true isolated incident or if there is more story seed is similar break democratic headquarters at watergate complex which eventually revealed nixon white house had been engaging multiple plots against perceived political enemies spotlight team is headed by walter robby robinson keaton no nonsense fair but tough reporter editor they agree barons wishes begin researching deeper see if there is larger story their first lead is attorney mentioned article mitchell garabedian stanley tucci rezendes ruffalo peruses garabedian who acted as negotiator between boston archdiocese victims father geoghan reporter wishes attorney reveal names victims but at first garabedian declines eventually garabedian agrees contact victims who are now much older ask them if they are willing speak with rezendes without revealing their names eventually interviews are set up at attorneys offices question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged similar criminal behavior against minors another front other members team including sacha pfeiffer mcadams begin discovering unspeakable reality other victims possibly at hands more priests aside geoghan then tip former rehabilitation counselor priests informs team that based statistics there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse children boston area alone team then appropriates volumes american guide book roman catholic priests published once year which lists whereabouts every clergyman church terms dioceses parishes investigators make startling discovery certain names book over several years are listed as leave due illness administrative leave or other designations inactivity after only one three years at particular parish leading team consider these may be priests who engaged sexual misconduct with minors if true it would place blame not only cardinal law as possibly covering up churchs indiscretions but entire roman catholic church all way vatican this is stunning film about power small group urban reporters uncover wrongdoing by one oldest far reaching institutions world roman catholic church particular high marks mark ruffalo as michael rezendes rachel mcadams as sacha pfeiffer michael keaton as robbie robinson so much story parallels watergate scandal several decades earlier as horrible as actual victimization minors by priests often boys because they were less likely squeal because shame cover up by law was nearly as criminal instead taking priests justice as he should have done he tried cover it up by offering settlements families often when victims were minors law probably other church officials moved priests other parishes where they engaged similar behavior thus allowing widespread sexual abuse continue it was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children other parts country it was happening internationally,0.45527822364901027,0.07558498305689318,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.41}"

10.0,Flawless! #2 All-Time Greatest Film. 71 Awards.,"Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' portrays the Boston Globe's investigative articles on the Catholic Church's cover-up of pedophile abuse by a significant percentage of its priests in the Boston area.The movie wastes no time in it's 2 hours and 9 minutes with on-the-edge-of-your-seat pacing. Every interaction is meaningful, every character believable, as layer after layer of the Catholic churches systemic cover-up is unfolded. It is the best newspaper movie ever produced (and #2 All-Time Greatest Film).But the underlying relationships of the ""Spotlight"" investigative team that thrives as a proxy family is the element that makes this movie so appealing.Idealic respect shared between the characters and the professional bond that the diverse personalities have for each other is laid out by McCarthy over the course of the movie. Like close siblings whose love and common bond allow for overlooking each others idiosyncrasies and grow stronger under duress, the characters navigate the religious, social, community, political and legal challenges of bringing such an impacting story to press.'Spotlight' is flawless in execution.

The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift.

10.0,Flat Out Remarkable! Possibly the Year's Best!,"Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. ""Rocky"" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. ""Rudy"" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. ""Spotlight"" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, ""Spotlight"" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind ""All the President's Men"" and maybe ""The Insider,"" it's among the best ever made.""Spotlight"" tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, ""Spotlight"" is astonishingly crafted.I'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the ""love"" factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpieceand succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far.All the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in ""The Master,"" Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in ""Birdman,"" and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud.Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play ""Robbie"" and ""Sacha"" respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues.If there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, ""Spotlight"" sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue.",flat out remarkable possibly years best,seconds after credits tom mccarthys spotlight roll overwhelming feeling changing your career takes over is film criticism really where i belong what important life changing story am i not writing about truth is quite bit classic films give off that same feeling rocky made bunch our fathers older brothers go morning run drink raw eggs rudy made us want go out play notre dame football spotlight makes you want go down your local courthouse search public records clues then get phone with pen pad start asking some really tough questions honestly speaking spotlight is best investigative news drama this century matter fact behind all presidents men maybe insider its among best ever made spotlight tells true story how boston globe uncovered massive scandal child molestation cover up within local catholic archdiocese shaking entire catholic church its core where you must begin with any praise film is audacious fortifying script by tom mccarthy josh singer two create cinematic magic their articulation words characters narrative storytelling each person feels authentic each scene feels rich equally important as last most all its tightest most satisfying film beginning end seen this year minute one youre hooked up until last second where they decide last words spoken should be spotlight is astonishingly crafted im still shock awe that tom mccarthy is one who made this this is writer director who ive appreciated but didnt have love factor surrounding any his films paired with outstanding cast co writer josh singer editor tom mcardle cinematographer masanobu takayanagi composer howard shore tom mccarthy gets chance create his masterpiece succeeds he makes brilliant artistic choices such as letting mark ruffalo letter reading play over 2 minute taxi car ride back newspaper mccarthys direction is one best directorial efforts any filmmaker this year thus far all players performing are top notch but walking away best show is performance academy award nominee mark ruffalo ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance date makes stake his claim oscar this year weirdly reminiscent joaquin phoenixs work master ruffalo builds his mike feet up giving him his own characteristics that im not sure mccarthy singer set out do his expressions words mannerisms all encapsulate magnitude his work bookended by explosive scene that brought tears my eyes think back emma stones acclaimed work birdman scene that made everyone notice i wanted simply applaud michael keaton rachel mcadams who play robbie sacha respectively are attune with their characters destinations each bring strong sensibilities sensitivity their roles that desperately call them hotly worked into story is liev schreiber as newly appointed editor that little screen time hes given makes long lasting impression stanley tucci is also afforded same opportunity gives one films best monologues if theres film this year that feels like oscar winner spotlight sure does make compelling case dramatic heart pounding necessarily made its one most important films this year probably best picture year telluride tradition may continue,0.5054551612770791,0.26082625517557023,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,Catholic Church in the Spotlight.,"Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.This is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy.",catholic church spotlight,relevant powerful astonishing shocking criminal true these are only words describe this film as it has literally put spotlight systematic cover up by catholic church mass molestation sexual assault acts performed by priests boston archdiocese that were trusted communities they represented these men god preyed weak vulnerable years most powerful religious sect world did nothing but sweep it under proverbial carpet spotlights dramatic importance has immediately drawn attention film lovers who crave riveting production that dives deep into very real circumstance that has impacted every corner globe tom mccarthy could not have been at helm better film what he has been able achieve terms wrestling attentions audience is worthy highest praise mccarthy along with josh singer have written gritty story that pulls no punches it isnt afraid get right into heart required subject spotlight have been received by critics as well as it has it had stride unapologetically into this unbelievable sordid affair it needed expose sensitive controversial information that some people may find confronting but context this outstanding production absolutely essential it destroyed lives revealed blatant arrogance this pious organisation all star cast jumps right out at you even before opening scenes are shot up onto screen based true events spotlight pushes all right buttons beginning as name implies spotlight refers investigative journalism team who report boston globe newspaper they are thorough relentless will stop at nothing expose headline stories that affect everyday lives normal americans when new editor marty baron liev schreiber drops potentially explosive story lap spotlight chief walter robinson michael keaton about allegations sexual abuse involving catholic church robinson his loyal crew go about uncovering one greatest criminal cover ups human history deeper their investigation goes more sadistic shocking outcome becomes fingers are pointed people are accused list clergy involved becomes larger larger whole situation ceases become boston problem grows worldwide exposure rachel mcadams mark ruffalo are part investigative team as young committed journalists sacha pfeiffer mike rezendes respectively mcadams performance is award worthy ruffalo is fully engaged role that matches his talents michael keaton has found his niche hollywood as sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as tenacious hard hitting robinson real cherry cast is presence magnificent stanley tucci as mitchell garabedian who represents victims whole saga tucci adds class that takes spotlight another level with engrossingly accomplished performance this is best journalistic drama since 1976s all presidents men tom mccarthy has centred his narrative within confines boston globes newsroom as it should have been spotlight doesnt shy away true nature newspaper drama audience benefits such authentic setting top shelf acting some very best young talent sparks fire that captivates viewer throw some true icons keaton tucci spotlight has perfect balance this film will be classified as very best its category has set benchmark terms confronting realism sit back enjoy,0.5961489411489409,0.16446179946179945,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10.0,Priests Secretly Committing Pederasty. An Award Winner Reality Movie.,"Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup.Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. It is nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor: Mark Ruffalo, Best Supporting Actress: Rachel McAdams, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.In 2001, The Boston Globe hires a new editor, Marty Baron. Baron meets Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, the editor of the Spotlight team, a small group of journalists writing investigative articles that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a Globe column about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines interview. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk.Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through a man who heads a victim's rights organization, they widen their search to thirteen priests. They learn through an ex-priest who worked trying to rehabilitate pedophile priests that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston. Through their research, they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to deprioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was aware of the problem and ignored it. After The Boston Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed, the Spotlight Team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of twenty pedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on. Baron, nevertheless, tells Robinson and the team that the work they are doing is important. The story goes to print with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law, and a phone number requesting victims of pedophile priests to come forward. The following morning, the Spotlight team is inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. The film closes with a list of places in the United States and around the world where the Catholic Church has been involved in concealing abuse by priests.",priests secretly committing pederasty award winner reality movie,spotlight is 2015 american biographical drama film directed by tom mccarthy written by mccarthy josh singer film follows boston globes spotlight team oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit united states its investigation into cases widespread systemic child sex abuse boston area by numerous roman catholic priests it is based series stories by real spotlight team that earned globe 2003 pulitzer prize public service film stars mark ruffalo michael keaton rachel mcadams john slattery stanley tucci brian darcy james liev schreiber billy crudup spotlight was shown out competition section 72nd venice international film festival it was also shown at telluride film festival special presentations section 2015 toronto international film festival film was released november 6 2015 by open road films it won numerous guilds critics association awards was named one finest films 2015 by various publications it is nominated six academy awards including best film editing best supporting actor mark ruffalo best supporting actress rachel mcadams best original screenplay best director best picture 2001 boston globe hires new editor marty baron baron meets walter robby robinson editor spotlight team small group journalists writing investigative articles that take months research publish after baron reads globe column about lawyer mitchell garabedian who says that cardinal law archbishop boston knew that priest john geoghan was sexually abusing children did nothing stop him he urges spotlight team investigate journalist michael rezendes contacts garabedian who initially declines interview though he is told not rezendes reveals that he is spotlight team persuading garabedian talk initially believing that they are following story one priest who was moved around several times spotlight team begin uncover pattern sexual abuse children by catholic priests massachusetts ongoing cover up by boston archdiocese through man who heads victims rights organization they widen their search thirteen priests they learn through ex priest who worked trying rehabilitate pedophile priests that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests boston through their research they develop list eighty seven names begin find their victims back up their suspicions when september 11 attacks occur team is forced deprioritize story they regain momentum when rezendes learns garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm cardinal law was aware problem ignored it after boston globe wins case have even more legal documents unsealed spotlight team finally begins write story plan publish their findings early 2002 as they are about go print robinson confesses team that he was sent list twenty pedophile priests 1993 story he never followed up baron nevertheless tells robinson team that work they are doing is important story goes print with link leading documents that expose cardinal law phone number requesting victims pedophile priests come forward following morning spotlight team is inundated with phone calls victims coming forward tell their stories film closes with list places united states around world where catholic church has been involved concealing abuse by priests,0.3339373804490083,0.21787224403503472,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,"A Gem to Rival ""All the President's Men""","I finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards broadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one. Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense.

,"Engagingly told story of process, with a strong emotional core","By coincidence I watched this film only a week after listening to the editor in chief of Huffington Post UK say that authentic writing cannot come from paid journalists, which is why they do not pay their writers (although Adriana Huffington seemed fine with the millions she got when she sold the website). This stuck in my mind when watching this very fine drama about how the Boston Globe reporters uncovered and exposed a mass cover-up of abuse within the Catholic Church. Also in my mind was a sense of disbelief that this true story is not too much more than a decade old – the mass abuse of children by Catholic Priests now just seems such a known thing now that it is hard to imagine a time when it wasn't.Perhaps because this is so well known, the film is compelling because it focuses on the story of the story, focusing on the journalism. This gives the film the challenge that in terms of action it is mostly people typing, people on the phone, and lots of talking. This it manages really well, building a compelling but robust drama that builds well and takes the viewer along with it. The subject matter means that the emotional side is not left behind either, and the film deftly reminds us of the people (not just the facts) in ways that are natural and integrated, not sentimental or manipulative.McCarthy directs with professional control, and standards are high – mostly noticeably in the casting. It is not easy to point out one lead, because so many famous faces are here, and all of them do their job in a way that integrates with the rest – there are no really showing moments, no moments where you feel someone is pushing for an Oscar; it is a real ensemble piece, with too many good turns to start to name them all. The end result is that strong writing, and respect for the process of journalism, combines with the importance of the true story and the strong delivery of all aspects to produce an engaging story which carries emotional and professional weight.",engagingly told story process with strong emotional core,by coincidence i watched this film only week after listening editor chief huffington post uk say that authentic writing cannot come paid journalists which is why they do not pay their writers although adriana huffington seemed fine with millions she got when she sold website this stuck my mind when watching this very fine drama about how boston globe reporters uncovered exposed mass cover up abuse within catholic church also my mind was sense disbelief that this true story is not too much more than decade old mass abuse children by catholic priests now just seems such known thing now that it is hard imagine time when it wasnt perhaps because this is so well known film is compelling because it focuses story story focusing journalism this gives film challenge that terms action it is mostly people typing people phone lots talking this it manages really well building compelling but robust drama that builds well takes viewer along with it subject matter means that emotional side is not left behind either film deftly reminds us people not just facts ways that are natural integrated not sentimental or manipulative mccarthy directs with professional control standards are high mostly noticeably casting it is not easy point out one lead because so many famous faces are here all them do their job way that integrates with rest there are no really showing moments no moments where you feel someone is pushing oscar it is real ensemble piece with too many good turns start name them all end result is that strong writing respect process journalism combines with importance true story strong delivery all aspects produce engaging story which carries emotional professional weight,0.528531746031746,0.21829365079365082,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Faith,"Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith  the core of this ""based on actual events"" story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by ""The Church"".It's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story  we even know how it snow-balled globally  but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all  All The President's Men (1976).The opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass.Flash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called ""Spotlight"". It's led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book ""The Curse of the Bambino"", just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people.What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects – just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together – and how fluid the process was  the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to ""get"" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism  right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite – he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle – settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law – the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican.The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few ""best scenes"". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions – we either need to hit something or throw up – and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers.The story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, ""It takes a village to raise a kid  or abuse one."" In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut.

8.0,Spotlight is the Best Film of 2015,"""Spotlight"" is the best film of 2015 and I will be disappointed if it does not receive the Academy Award for Best Picture. As good as it is, it is just one step short of greatness. ""Spotlight"" depicts Boston Globe reporters investigating priest sex abuse of children. ""Spotlight"" focuses like a laser on what it is to be a journalist, to consider whether or not to cover a story, to select it, to research it, to uncover piece-by-piece, a full narrative, to publish it and to live with the consequences of publication. You don't learn about the reporter's personal lives except for what you see incidentally as they work at home. There is no romantic subplot; there are no trumped-up action scenes where a reporter punches a priest. There's actually one of those scenes, no doubt a self- conscious salute to classic newspaper films, where you see newspapers being run through one of those giant machines that rapidly prints, folds, and stacks hard copies. I've never seen a film in which I liked these actors more: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian D'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou. Lesser known actors in minor roles are every bit as good. There is no Hollywood in these performances. There's no sexy costumes or makeup, no grandstanding for the Academy. The actors are dressed in the workaday attire of newspapermen and women. Much of the film takes place in a grubby shared office full of sloppy manila file folders or in cafes and working class neighborhoods where informants are interviewed. Each performer plays a cog in a giant wheel working to uncover evil. None of them knows about world-shaking scandal still to come, or Pulitzer Prizes. They are just, with a pair of tweezers, turning over one leaf and seeing what lies beneath and adding that to the information already gathered. Even though viewers already know how this story played out in real life, the audience gasps when a discovery is made; the audience fears that a rock will be thrown through a window; the audience fears that judicial complicity will keep the story hidden. I began crying half an hour into the film. I was crying at the end. I made audible ""Huh!"" noises at especially and outrageously ironic moments, as did others in the audience. We applauded at the film's conclusion. The film opens with a child in a police station, accompanied by his parents and a priest. A lawyer enters. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. ""I promise this will never happen again."" The police are cynical. The lawyer is smooth. The child is crushed. The parents are heartbroken. The priest appears slickly demonic. The scene is anonymous. Events like this were repeated at least a thousand times. July, 2001. The Boston Globe acquires its first Jewish editor, Martin Baron. The Spotlight team is considering following up a case of priestly sex abuse. Slowly but surely, they discover that there are far more incidences than suspected. They discover not just one bad apple here and there. Rather, Cardinal Law has reassigned abusive priests to new parishes. Baron meets with Law. Law presents Baron with a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. ""Spotlight"" mentions ""Good Germans"" – people who kept their eyes closed to the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors, and the sudden appearance of ash falling from the sky. Just so, there were many ""Good Bostonians."" It's sickening to confront the many who had awareness of priestly sex abuse and did nothing. Targeted kids were powerless and without allies. One had a schizophrenic mother. Some had absentee fathers. Some were gay. Many were from the wrong side of the tracks. After they were abused, some became alcoholics, drug addicts, or suicides. When SNAP activist Phil Saviano is invited to the Boston Globe's office, and he talks about a conspiracy to protect abusive priests that stretches all the way to the Vatican, he comes across as a twitchy, obnoxious, conspiracy theorist raving about Area 51 – someone easy to write off. The most nauseating reason of all given for ignoring clergy sex abuse: money. The Globe could have covered clergy sex abuse earlier, but it didn't. Over fifty percent of the paper's subscribers are Catholics. Boston is a small town, with a lot of insular Irish Catholics who don't want anyone rocking the boat, or risking various money streams, including the church's significant charity work. Especially poignant are the scenes where abuse survivors are encouraged to detail what happened to them. ""It's not enough to say he molested you. You must give me the clinical details of exactly what happened,"" reporters insist, to sobbing survivors, who must then re- inhabit their worst memories. The plot churns forward with the single line of a freight train running on schedule. I was never bored. The priestly sex abuse crisis is not a tragedy because the Catholic Church is corrupt. The priestly sex abuse crisis is a tragedy because the Catholic Church is great. The film could have become better than it is had it included this theme. Show Catholics feeding the homeless. Show Catholics recovering from grief with the support of their faith. Show Cardinal Law for what he once was – a courageous hero in the Civil Rights movement, when that meant receiving death threats and alienating the powerful. That something so beautiful is so sullied, along with individual victims' pain, is the heart of this tragedy. I am a lifelong, church-going Catholic. I present my reasons for being Catholic, in spite of everything, in my book ""Save Send Delete."" I salute, not boycott, the Globe's reporting, and films like this. Confession and redemption are gifts we shared with the world.",spotlight is best film 2015,spotlight is best film 2015 i will be disappointed if it does not receive academy award best picture as good

7.0,A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture,"Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the ""X-Factor"" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that.Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that ""in between"" state, which may have hurt him.There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset.",fine film but not worthy winning best picture,going into spotlight i was aware that it was front runner win best picture at academy awards after having seen it i cant really understand why thats not say it wasnt good film it simply didnt blow me away at all it told story admittedly fascinating true story informative way but it didnt do anything that great films do like inspire me move me or leave me stunned with powerful nature it was told with best picture winners past like schindlers list told true stories but also encompassed all three those traits plenty more that was film i will never forget spotlight will probably be completely out my mind by this time next week frankly i was little underwhelmed with lack emotion such serious subject brought out me film just didnt really seem try do that it felt more like documentary reenactment simply with very fine actors than anything else my disagreement with it likely winning best picture aside there are some very fine filmmaking skills show here all departments director tom mccarthy only his fifth turn at directing has been nominated best directing award while i dont like lack emotion his storytelling brought out me he clearly had vision tell story certain way he got it done he tells it punchy fashion that never allows audience drift off best directing race this year is tight one with four five all being widely contention i dont think mccarthy will get win however as his film doesnt have x factor going it that lot others do having said that any film that wins best picture has get some real credit its director so dont completely rule him out if it does indeed win that mark ruffalo rachel mcadams have also been nominated best supporting actor actress awards i have trouble understanding how again be frank roles based real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing work with script they were almost never given chance shine any scene because this i dont believe either has chance winning their respective award it wasnt film designed make actors look good having said that stand out performance me was michael keaton he almost won best actor award last year this year cant even get nomination had his been considered supporting role im sure he would have but it was probably considered that between state which may have hurt him there are lot true stories at this years acadmey awards i think spotlight is benefiting being most interesting story them all big short is another case interesting true story however that was told very unique clever way interestingly that is biggest competition spotlight will have when winner is read out night my fingers might just be crossed seeing upset,0.4723717506326202,0.3570393374741201,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
6.0,"Very relevant and important, but not very good","""Spotlight"" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out. Seeing these names now I kinda think it helped McAdams with her nomination that she was the only female from the bunch.In terms of the entire film, I summarized it appropriately in the title I believe. It is a very important subject and it was a strong cast making this subject work with dignity and professionalism, but I personally felt the heart was missing. And this subject certainly would have deserved to make a more emotional impact in the grand scheme of things than it did on me. The attempts by McCarthy to deliver in terms of that were something that felt rather forced than effective to me. They brought in references to the journalists' private lives and how it impacted them to some extent, but it did not feel too compelling for me to watch these and the victims also did not add as much as I hoped they would. The ending with Keaton's ""Spotlight"" quote was nicely done though. I also liked the way they brought in 9/11 getting in the way of disclosing the events. Overall, I believe this is an important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened in reality and because with the Best Picture win, it is probably now the defining film on a very contemporary and tragic occurrence of events. But I still feel it did not make the impact that it could have made and my favorite McCarthy film to this day stays ""The Visitor"". But I recommend ""Spotlight"" too of course. I would say it's nowhere near the best or worst Best Picture Academy Award winners.",very relevant important but not very good,spotlight is american movie last year that runs slightly over 2 hours was written directed by tom mccarthy it won two academy awards earlier this year including grand prize best picture reason this is probably that it is about really important subject namely way it was discovered by major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed larger scale church despite many attempts latter keep it disclosed mark ruffalo rachel mcadams managed oscar nominations their supporting performances i cannot say i agree with either sadly mcadams played her part well had couple good moments but i dont think it was one best year her category probably more coattail nomination i remember it was also pretty surprising she got ruffalos nomination was no surprise he got at all precursors too but i had sometimes problems with his performance it seem over top theatrical it had touch one man against church at times which went entirely against idea team collaboratively managing great things i am usually fan ruffalo he has good moments here too but i think mix not so good writing perhaps not best approach role may have hurt character keaton tucci slattery schreiber are pretty much same good but not great but probably par with two nominees it was team effort nobody really stood out seeing these names now i kinda think it helped mcadams with her nomination that she was only female bunch terms entire film i summarized it appropriately title i believe it is very important subject it was strong cast making this subject work with dignity professionalism but i personally felt heart was missing this subject certainly would have deserved make more emotional impact grand scheme things than it did me attempts by mccarthy deliver terms that were something that felt rather forced than effective me they brought references journalists private lives how it impacted them some extent but it did not feel too compelling me watch these victims also did not add as much as i hoped they would ending with keatons spotlight quote was nicely done though i also liked way they brought 9 11 getting way disclosing events overall i believe this is important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened reality because with best picture win it is probably now defining film very contemporary tragic occurrence events but i still feel it did not make impact that it could have made my favorite mccarthy film this day stays visitor but i recommend spotlight too course i would say its nowhere near best or worst best picture academy award winners,0.5159471480900052,0.2344888801674516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

6.0,The Subject Matter Is Noble But The Execution Is Unsatisfying,"Yet another film I've watched because it's a contender for the award ceremonies next year and you can see why . The Oscars have taken onboard movies with an indie feel over the last few years and with SPOTLIGHT we have a double whammy of a film based on true life events this time featuring The Boston Globe investigation in to child sex abuse and the resulting cover over decades in Boston , Get these prizes out now Or on second thoughts put them away for the time being because SPOTLIGHT is something of a disappointment . Not so much a disappointment a film that doesn't really do anything radical in its sub-genre. Investigative journalism movies all suffer from the same structural problems along these lines: Journalist A gets hold of a possible lead , gets pulled in to the editors office and is told ""We can't run this"" Journalist B gets another lead on the same story , gets pulled into the editors office and is told by the editor ""We can't run this"" Journalist A and B work behind the editors back on the story and cut through every red tape obstacle in their pathJournalist c gets another lead on the same story ... you can see where this is heading can't you ? One thing the film does do well is explain to a secular audience the type of metaphysical power a Catholic priest has over a congregation but apart from that the rest of the film is curiously uninvolving and distant and one wonders if the acclaim it is receiving might be down to the subject matter rather than its cinematic credentials As it stands SPOTLIGHT is yet another slightly unsatisfying film expected to win prestigious prizes . There's no doubt in my mind that the 2016 Oscars will be dominated by THE REVENANT . As with every year there's always a film at the ceremony that ends up close but no cigar where it gets several noms but no Oscar in any category .

10.0,I Remembered Why I love Movies,"Throughout the year I watched many movies and by the middle of the year I was finding it hard to watch a movie. I really had to force my self. I thought my love for movies is dying and I'm more of a TV person now. I was wrong. This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn't me, it was actually the movies I've seen this year.This movie has it's flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story.

8.0,Exceptional Movie About Reporters Reporting,"The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best.With an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.Michael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted.It all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face.The investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century.Michael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision.Nods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects.The entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven.Spotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/",exceptional movie about reporters reporting,awards season may just have found its first forerunner 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation tom mccarthys spotlight rising above heap assert itself as one 2015s best with all star cast including michael keaton mark ruffalo rachel mcadams live schreiber john slattery stanley tucci billy crudup spotlight shines light 2001 investigation by boston globes sexual abuse within catholic church michael keaton plays walter robinson who leads globes investigative unit with michael rezendes ruffalo sacha mcadams matt carrol brian darcy james under new editor marty baron schreiber team begins unfold horrific pattern child sexual abuse by church that was muted covered up by high priced lawyers payoffs victims families as walter probes further further into events setting is after events 9 11 investigation reveals layers layers injustice catholic priests that were aided by highest powers church effort keep story muted it all starts with featured column about catholic priest john geoghan who was accused abusing over 100 boys civil suit is filed but details abuse were ordered sealed by courts schriebers baron puts team reporters case within days evil that lurked with sacred rooms local churches begins reveal is foul despicable face investigation goes months as team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward every two steps back but story eventually breaks emotionally exhausted team is eventually able bring light one more depressing important stories early new century michael keaton was really good last years birdman named himself many awards academy award nomination his part spotlight he may be even better under direction tom mccarthy win win station agent keaton shines carries performance determination frustration redemption that is delivered with precision nods all presidents men will be inevitable but that was different era different movie spotlight is fresh invigorating its painfully frustrating subject matter audiences should leave with renewed belief that investigative reporting is monumental importance that stories such as one originating 2001 massachusetts are still out there clouded red tape secrecy muffled whispers it is painful watch at times trusted bonds between people children parents institution that promotes opposite what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought screen with sizzling effects entire cast top bottom is perfectly cast mccarthy doesnt populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals spotlight is instead very straight forward focused driven spotlight will be nominated best picture keaton should get nod actor ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets but whether spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize importance films such as these few years ago i would guess that 99 population knew nothing about iran hostage rescue highlighted ben afflecks argo spotlight should have same effect acting as docudrama that is both highly entertaining educational at same time it is both very good film important one,0.5146013986013984,0.14829370629370625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"
