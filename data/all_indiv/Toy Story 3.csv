10.0,"An amazing third ""Story""","Lee Unkrinch directed ""Toy Story 3,"" the third and presumably final installment in the ""Toy Story"" movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's ""Toy Story 2"" remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto ""Toy Story 2"" for deep personal reasons, but ""Toy Story 3"" does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.As foreshadowed in ""Toy Story 2,"" Andy (John Morris) has finally grown up; he's 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. His mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic (a sort of gone-but-not-forgotten-and-within-reach-type of deal).Woody (Tom Hanks), brave leader of the toys and Andy's favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at Sunnyside Daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. This introduces us to Lotso (Ned Beatty), the strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metro-sexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and others. As it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and Lotso runs this place with an iron fist; of course, Lotso has a very tragic back-story that explains his evil ways, much like with Jessie (Joan Cusack), who first appeared in ""Toy Story 2."" So Woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college.""Toy Story 3"" is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first ""Toy Story,"" which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented Disney-owned animation studio Pixar. They have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. The animation here is at its most life-like and real and it's damn-near flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far Pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with ""Toy Story."" And every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories.While ""Toy Story 2"" had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, ""Toy Story 3"" is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. In addition, ""Toy Story 3"" can also be an incredibly dark film at times - a bold move considering that this is a family film - but there's no need to worry because the fact is that it's all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very light-hearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes.""Toy Story 3"" is a triumph of animation and imagination, and I say that as a die-hard ""Toy Story 2"" fan. What we get here, is a fitting closer (?) to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. It's just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone bye-bye.10/10",amazing third story,lee unkrinch directed toy story 3 third presumably final installment toy story movie franchise one could argue that this is probably best one yet 1999s toy story 2 remains my personal favorite three i wont argue with those who think otherwise i still hold onto toy story 2 deep personal reasons but toy story 3 does build upon events foreshadowed previous installment which does gives this film weighty emotional punch rarity animated films these days as foreshadowed toy story 2 andy john morris has finally grown up hes 17 now is his way college just few days his mom is putting pressure him get rid his old toys either by throwing them out with garbage donating them other needy children or simply putting them attic sort gone but not forgotten within reach type deal woody tom hanks brave leader toys andys favorite manages dodge bullet somewhat but puts himself line fire when buzz lightyear tim allen other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at sunnyside daycare where they are welcomed with open arms by resident toys there this introduces us lotso ned beatty strawberry scented teddy bear who runs place along with metro sexual ken doll michael keaton others as it turns out this daycare center is actually prison lotso runs this place with iron fist course lotso has very tragic back story that explains his evil ways much like with jessie joan cusack who first appeared toy story 2 so woody other toys must mount valiant escape if they are be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves college toy story 3 is amazing film fitting end wonderful film series that started 1995 with first toy story which also signaled arrival very illustrious extremely talented disney owned animation studio pixar they have yet another significant hit their hands with this picture animation here is at its most life like real its damn near flawless strikingly beautiful which signals just how far pixar has come 15 years since their first hit with toy story every film since then has added significant amounts realism weight dimension their animated stories while toy story 2 had high nostalgia factor days long gone by toy story 3 is film about inevitability children growing up putting away their toys there are also themes about effect loss love friendship going proceedings here addition toy story 3 can also be incredibly dark film at times bold move considering that this is family film but theres no need worry because fact is that its all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very light hearted humor fast furious action scenes stirring emotional moments that just might bring few tears your eyes toy story 3 is triumph animation imagination i say that as die hard toy story 2 fan what we get here is fitting closer amazing film series that just continues surprise again again with each new entry its just great reminder all us heartless adults better days our youth that have long gone bye bye 10 10,0.5620315882034631,0.2272088068181818,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,A Nutshell Review: Toy Story 3,"It was in 1995 that Toy Story signaled the arrival of Pixar, and the rest was history. To date, I have personally always found myself to have enjoyed all of their outputs, and it does seem that Pixar has indeed grown from strength to strength with sophistication in its graphics and attention to detail, but more so that their creative teams have always come out with solid stories to tell, which is always the key beneath all the glossy bells and whistles visuals.And I simply love this installment, not only because it reunites us with the characters whom we have taken to heart as old friends, welcoming them back to yet another big screen outing, but because it has a moving story to tell, and has various elements from action-adventure, comedy and drama all rolled into one, allowing an outpour of a kaleidoscope of emotions as we journey for close to 2 hours with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Mr and Mrs Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Res (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark) and the aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) for one last hurrah.The storyline for all three Toy Story films may share some similar plot lines in having the constant fear of being discarded and unwanted when one turns old, or to obsess with the thought of being forgotten and unappreciated, and almost always comes with a distance to conquer. That continues here in stronger terms given that it's been some 11 years since the last Toy Story film, and that the toys' owner Andy has already outgrown the toys and have chucked whatever's left all into a treasure chest. Making things worst, he's about to relocate to attend college, and thus the anxieties that Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang has to come to terms with, being provided 4 options of heading for the trash, the attic, being given away or being that rare toy that gets to accompany Andy to his new environment.New toys get introduced by way of how the story got crafted involving a children's day care centre, where we get to meet up with the over-emphasized, metrosexual Ken (Michael Keaton!) from Barbie (Jodi Benson), and others such as the Lotso bear (Ned Beatty), together with those belonging to a new human character called Bonnie (Emily Hahn) who owns a cool plush Totoro (which doesn't speak of course)! Sequels tend to overcrowd their stories with plenty of characters, but it worked perfectly for this installment as other than those which get lines, there are plenty in the background that you may just spot a few that you too may have owned at some point in time. Things also aren't quite what they seem at the day care being the paradise for toys in constantly being played with and loved but never to suffer a heartbreak or to be left feeling unwanted, and provides the basis upon which the story develops, providing plenty of challenges for the gang to overcome (gotta love that Monkey!)What's powerful about Toy Story 3 are the themes that get thrown in, such as that about loss, and the search and fight for things that are worthwhile. It emphasizes the bonds of friendship and courage, while tackling how the lack thereof in abandonment and the feeling of tremendous loss, can someone turn one into a bitter soul, which allowed for the film to take on tragic, darker consequences unseen in the earlier installments, while balancing the light hearted moments. We get to grow with the familiar characters a little more, while having new ones which are just as fun. Just ask Ken!And a word of caution - prepare those tissues and hankies! Parting is such sweet sorrow, and the manner in which director Lee Unkrich deals with will definitely tug at your heartstrings. At least two scenes got to me, one involving facing a consequence of inevitable hopelessness that is a definite edge of your seat stuff only to remind you of how much you really care for the characters, while the other was what I deem as the perfect send off, an au revoir fit for closing the chapter on this Toy Story arc, while leaving room for another to happen (if it does). It moved, and shows how valuable it is to be loved again, and I thought it was pitch perfect. It would be interesting to know how the creators had intended to end the story, but it was brilliant to have chosen with what was.Toy Story 3 is a must see, and it's contending for a space in my top 10 for the year. It's a sequel done right, a tale with a lot of heart, with elements encompassing what essentially is a fitting tribute and farewell to beloved characters that have blazed the trail for computer generated animation to take centerstage. As with all PIxar feature films, a short precedes the main feature, and ""Day and Night"", like the one offered in Up, comes without dialogue, but with plenty of imagination and again, a solid story for a well animated short film that only Pixar can.",nutshell review toy story 3,it was 1995 that toy story signaled arrival pixar rest was history date i have personally always found myself have enjoyed all their outputs it does seem that pixar has indeed grown strength strength with sophistication its graphics attention detail but more so that their creative teams have always come out with solid stories tell which is always key beneath all glossy bells whistles visuals i simply love this installment not only because it reunites us with characters whom we have taken heart as old friends welcoming them back yet another big screen outing but because it has moving story tell has various elements action adventure comedy drama all rolled into one allowing outpour kaleidoscope emotions as we journey close 2 hours with woody tom hanks buzz tim allen jessie joan cusack mr mrs potato head don rickles estelle harris hamm john ratzenberger res wallace shawn slinky dog blake clark aliens jeff pidgeon one last hurrah storyline all three toy story films may share some similar plot lines having constant fear being discarded unwanted when one turns old or obsess with thought being forgotten unappreciated almost always comes with distance conquer that continues here stronger terms given that its been some 11 years since last toy story film that toys owner andy has already outgrown toys have chucked whatevers left all into treasure chest making things worst hes about relocate attend college thus anxieties that woody buzz rest gang has come terms with being provided 4 options heading trash attic being given away or being that rare toy that gets accompany andy his new environment new toys get introduced by way how story got crafted involving childrens day care centre where we get meet up with over emphasized metrosexual ken michael keaton barbie jodi benson others such as lotso bear ned beatty together with those belonging new human character called bonnie emily hahn who owns cool plush totoro which doesnt speak course sequels tend overcrowd their stories with plenty characters but it worked perfectly this installment as other than those which get lines there are plenty background that you may just spot few that you too may have owned at some point time things also arent quite what they seem at day care being paradise toys constantly being played with loved but never suffer heartbreak or be left feeling unwanted provides basis upon which story develops providing plenty challenges gang overcome gotta love that monkey whats powerful about toy story 3 are themes that get thrown such as that about loss search fight things that are worthwhile it emphasizes bonds friendship courage while tackling how lack thereof abandonment feeling tremendous loss can someone turn one into bitter soul which allowed film take tragic darker consequences unseen earlier installments while balancing light hearted moments we get grow with familiar characters little more while having new ones which are just as fun just ask ken word caution prepare those tissues hankies parting is such sweet sorrow manner which director lee unkrich deals with will definitely tug at your heartstrings at least two scenes got me one involving facing consequence inevitable hopelessness that is definite edge your seat stuff only remind you how much you really care characters while other was what i deem as perfect send off au revoir fit closing chapter this toy story arc while leaving room another happen if it does it moved shows how valuable it is be loved again i thought it was pitch perfect it would be interesting know how creators had intended end story but it was brilliant have chosen with what was toy story 3 is must see its contending space my top 10 year its sequel done right tale with lot heart with elements encompassing what essentially is fitting tribute farewell beloved characters that have blazed trail computer generated animation take centerstage as with all pixar feature films short precedes main feature day night like one offered up comes without dialogue but with plenty imagination again solid story well animated short film that only pixar can,0.5080442388661566,0.17765299768724427,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,~One of the Best Trilogies of All Time~,"I attended a special screening for Toy Story 3. I went in with HIGH expectations. I LOVED the first two Toy Stories movies. Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.This movie has a real chance to become the First Animated Film to win Best Picture. I surely would not be surprised.10/10 An Amazing End to a Fantastic Series Go Watch It",one best trilogies all time,i attended special screening toy story 3 i went with high expectations i loved first two toy stories movies toy story is beloved franchise that almost everyone that i know loves first two films now how about 3rd film well all i could say is that it lived up my unbelievably high expectations then some this is such good film it has laughs magic best all entertainment new characters movie feel like they were previous two films they were that engaging really worked well movie best part movie has be ending i almost cried was moved just about tears i truly believe that this is one best trilogies all time it might even rival lord rings trilogy this movie has real chance become first animated film win best picture i surely would not be surprised 10 10 amazing end fantastic series go watch it,0.5133899845010957,0.4517348084014751,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"By delivering an amazing finale to an amazing trilogy, all we can do is bow and thank Pixar once again.","Star Wars. Indiana Jones. Fistful of Dollars. Bourne. These are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. Yes, I am neglecting the fourth Indiana Jones. Upon the mention of the third Toy Story, I was deathly afraid. Afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story. Could part 3 even come close to the original two? My friends, I am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes.Toy Story 3 does exactly what the first two did, delivered on all cylinders, all aspects of film-making and entertainment. The humor is back, the heart is back, the delightful cast of characters is back. This time, thanks to an incredible script, there's more suspense, more drama, and many more surprises. Like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends. It literally is difficult to find any flaw or any slow moment in this movie, and even if there is, it will immediately be forgiven by the next major laugh or the next major revelation. The predictability factor in this movie is low, and the payoff to all the suspense is extremely high. Guys, this is the go-to movie of the summer, and makes up for any disappointment you have seen this year or last.Just like Toy Story 2's subtle and underlying themes, Toy Story 3 revolves around the group of toys and their latest adventure, but dwells far deeper than that. On the surface, this movie is about the toys in a series of circumstances, winding up in a daycare center that isn't all it seems. At the same time, Andy is heading for college, but Woody isn't quite ready to let go of his owner and the memories that follow. The deeper aspects involve aging, growing up, and moving on. Michael Arndt, the Oscar winner that wrote Little Miss Sunshine, was behind the spectacular screenplay in this third trip in the world of toys. Then with the help of John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich (who serves as the director), we see plenty of references to Pixar, other movies, the previous Toy Story installments, and even we even see nods to the influences of the entire animation studio (Miyazaki).The writing wasn't the only thing that was on par with the first two Toy Story movies. The voice acting cast was once again phenomenal, with popular actors, underrated talent, and great character actors filling the bill. Come on now, just read em': Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Jody Benson, Estelle Harris, Blake Clark, John Ratzenburger, Ned Beatty, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton. Unlike what Dreamworks pulls off on a yearly basis, Pixar carefully chooses their voice cast in terms of pulling off the best performances, not to generate more money. Because honestly, was there even a point to Angelina Jolie voicing the tiger in Kung Fu Panda? On the other hand, very few can pull an authentic Barbie like Jody Benson (a.k.a. Ariel in the Little Mermaid). It takes reliable and authentic acting to pull at the heartstrings, and everyone definitely was on their A-game.Lee Unkrich directed this movie with incredible pacing and just as much heart and dedication as Lasseter, who was in charge of the first two. The truth is, Pixar directs the movie together, as they share ideas and suggestions amongst each other. This fact can be traced to the similar pacing and directing styles seen in Pixar's better works like Ratatoille, Finding Nemo, and Up. They all have the similar technique of incorporating just as many tears as laughs. But unlike all the other Pixar movies (with the exception of The Incredibles), Toy Story 3 has a heave dosage of suspense and peril, which is climaxed by one of the most exciting animated sequences this side of Castle in the Sky (a Miyazaki adventure masterpiece). Other reviewers have noted this before me, but this Toy Story is quite scary in depth and in imagery at some instances, so be wary of this while watching this with the kids. With so much time invested with these toys, the drama runs a bit high.Bottom Line: Toy Story 3 secures its place in cinema brilliance by becoming the best third installment since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the best sequel since Kill Bill Vol. 2, and the best movie we've seen this year. This movie is usually hilarious, sometimes thrilling, and sometimes downright tear-jerking. And yes, just like Up's opening 10 minutes, there is that one major sequence in which Pixar will play with your heartstrings like Eric Clapton playing tears of Heaven. If you enjoyed the first two Toy Stories, there's no need to worry about the third and hopefully final chapter in the quality-filled saga. How Pixar manages to deliver yet again is absolutely beyond me.Walt Disney may not be one-hundred percent proud of his company if he were alive to see it now, but he would be absolutely delighted at seeing what beautiful art Pixar has delivered ever since 1995. Pixar has re-created Walt Disney 's magical methods of storytelling and movie-making, and arguably has taken it a step even further by adding depth to the characters and depth to the overall stories presented. The direction was fantastic, the writing was Oscar-worthy, and the overall production is Best Picture caliber. This is Pixar's best work since Finding Nemo, and a must see by any means necessary. Despite my cynical nature, there's no way I can grade this any less than perfect. Just no way.",by delivering amazing finale amazing trilogy all we can do is bow thank pixar once again,star wars indiana jones fistful dollars bourne these are all incredible trilogies that can will

10.0,Succeeds In Living Up To Expectations,"Well, this lived up to the hype, which usually isn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment with this one. Thankfully, it didn't happen. ""Toy Story 3"" was another amazing story in this (so far) trilogy.With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes. All three of these facets should make this a fun 103 minutes every time I watch the DVD, much like the first two. Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places. Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney (""Slinky Dog""), who died in 2000. It's great to still hear familiar and distinctive voices, such as those of Wallace Shawn (""Rex""), John Ratenzenber (""Hamm""), Don Rickles and Estelle Harris (""Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, respectively).Kudos to all those involved in making this film. They nailed the essence of ""Toy Story"" and how much loyalty can mean.",succeeds living up expectations,well this lived up hype which usually isnt easy accomplishment toy story 1 2 set bar high so frankly i was expecting disappointment with this one thankfully it didnt happen toy story 3 was another amazing story this so far trilogy with bunch reviews already here there is no sense going into story those who havent seen it yet three surprises stood out me 1 high number new characters introduced 2 darkness some them this is not always fun story 3 incredibly touching last 15 or so minutes all three these facets should make this fun 103 minutes every time i watch dvd much like first two also artwork is at usual high standard especially some scenes last half hour at dump yard all places finally whats really cool too is that people who voice main characters are still same men women who did first two films with exception jim varney slinky dog who died 2000 its great still hear familiar distinctive voices such as those wallace shawn rex john ratenzenber hamm don rickles estelle harris mr mrs potato head respectively kudos all those involved making this film they nailed essence toy story how much loyalty can mean,0.42876183712121213,0.14256865530303034,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.54}"
9.0,Metaphysics By Mattel,"Is there Life after playtime? Can you handle a film in which the toys are playing with us, the audience? The third chapter of the Toy Story saga asks some tough questions of viewers, but the rewards of seeing this remarkable film outweigh the emotional toll.It's the last week of summer before Andy heads off to college, and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the other remaining toys in Andy's bedroom find themselves in fear of what's to become of them. It looks like the attic, but events conspire to throw them a day-care center called Sunnyside. It looks swell enough, at first...""You'll never be outgrown, or neglected,"" the toys are informed by the chuckily plush play bear Lots-O (Ned Beatty). ""Never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means - no heartbreak!""It's odd to see a film series that started out as an animated lark turn into ""Watership Down"", but there's always been some existential angst at the heart of the enterprise, c.f. the fragile buddy system employed in the first ""Toy Story"", Sid's hapless victims, and talk of rummage sales. The second film pushed these buttons a bit harder, to the point of losing the humor.This time the drama is stronger than ever, yet the film amazingly manages to stay refreshingly clever and hilarious. We meet Ken (Michael Keaton), who introduces himself to Barbie saying ""We were made for each other"". Ken must deal with wisecracks about being a girl's toy, or as Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) puts it, ""an accessory, a purse with legs."" The daycare center is also fabulously realized, a cacophony of misfit toys all showing signs of wear from constant play. Every now and again we break away to see Woody in his new situation, being played with by a girl named Bonnie who is very nice but has a left-field imagination. ""We do a lot of improv here,"" another toy tells him.All this is very funny, and director Lee Unkrich and the Pixar writers and artists find brilliant ways to keep humor close to the center of things throughout. Yet this movie is no lark. One of the funniest scenes the first time I saw this movie three weeks ago, involving a cutaway to a clown staring at a window, got hardly a laugh when I saw it again tonight. I think it was because the rest of the audience, like me, knew what was coming; a sad story about cosmic indifference and cold-hearted abandonment which sets in motion the real emotional undertow of the film.Set against this is Woody's firm if shaken resolution to ""be there for Andy"", even when it seems he and the other toys are no longer wanted by their owner. It's a message of faith you relate to, yet it also brings out another point, the notion of change, even painful change, as needful. The toys know they'll be neglected, perhaps forever, if exiled to the attic, but prefer it to the unknown. This actually makes sense. What can happen out there isn't very nice, but even in the face of extinction the film suggests a certain nobility through acceptance can be still possible. It's a pretty heavy message to take away from watching a G-rated comedy.The film doesn't leave you on a down note, but it's a funny thing. In the past, I always looked forward to the post-credit goof scenes as something to laugh at on my way out of the theater.

10.0,"Thank you, Pixar.","I left the theater in 1995 after seeing the original Toy Story strangely moved. I was only six years old, and I'm not sure I had even fully grasped the revolutionary CGI for what it was (it probably just registered as animation to me, and I didn't quite understand its impact), but I did know – at least on a basic level of storytelling – that it was fantastic. Four years later I went to see the sequel with my younger sisters and felt the exact same way I had the first time. Even at a fairly young age I knew there was something special about these films.Many times nostalgia has to compensate for quality (or lack thereof) in your perception of entertainments as you age. Suddenly Mac and Me isn't as awesome as you once found it to be. You revisit films from your childhood and learn to appreciate them based solely on the memories they conjure up, trying to block out the reality that, hey, This kinda sucks.That never happened with the Toy Story movies. As I grew older, as I saw them more and more times, they only seemed to improve. New layers appeared – adult humour that I never appreciated when I was ten but suddenly blindsided me. Characters that revealed new depths; emotional scenes that only became increasingly poignant and meaningful, like that amazing scene where Buzz first becomes aware of his own mortality as a toy that can't really fly, or when he learns to cope with that fact by embracing the fact that he can instead fall rather well (with style).The point of this rambling trip down memory lane is that Toy Story, the whole legacy of it, means a lot to me. I grew up with these pictures and never tired of returning to them, and they were always there for me like a good friend is. I approached Toy Story 3 with the slightest of reservations, fully trusting Pixar, and yet wondering how they could possibly produce anything that would live up to such high standards.Well, suffice to say, they did it – if Toy Story 3 isn't the best of the series, then that's merely because it comes eleven years after the last one and it hasn't been given some time to work its full magic on us. This is every bit as engaging, heartwarming and funny as the first two films – but it's also the saddest, most human and most moving.The plot has already been outlined by other critics, so I don't feel a need to recap anything. Nor do I want to inadvertently spoil any key moments (and please, for your own sake, avoid reading too much about the movie before going to see it – some reviewers are a bit too keen on giving away the ending, although it's understandable given how surprisingly emotional it is).The introduction of new characters is seamless – Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) is hilarious but thankfully not overused, and the other assorted variety of toys, including Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), are fine additions to the series.And Woody and Buzz (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, respectively) pick up right where they left off, and you feel, in a weird way, like you're visiting old pals. The movie features the best animation of the trilogy, and the second half – which is darker than the two previous installments – makes excellent use of lighting and cinematography. The climactic finale is incredibly intense (especially for a ""kids movie"") and features particularly impressive visuals. Many reviewers have noted that they cried during the finale, and even I must admit that I came pretty close.In a summer full of bores, disappointments and under-achievers, Toy Story 3 is not merely the first thoroughly satisfying motion picture of the season – it's the only truly moving one. It is fairly ironic, perhaps, that we must turn to movies about pieces of plastic to find such poignant reflections upon human nature, but then again, I'm not sure I'd want to have it any other way.",thank you pixar,i left theater 1995 after seeing original toy story strangely moved i was only six years old im not sure i had even fully grasped revolutionary cgi what it was it probably just registered as animation me i didnt quite understand its impact but i did know at least basic level storytelling that it was fantastic four years later i went see sequel with my younger sisters felt exact same way i had first time even at fairly young age i knew there was something special about these films many times nostalgia has compensate quality or lack thereof your perception entertainments as you age suddenly mac me isnt as awesome as you once found it be you revisit films your childhood learn appreciate them based solely memories they conjure up trying block out reality that hey this kinda sucks that never happened with toy story movies as i grew older as i saw them more more times they only seemed improve new layers appeared adult humour that i never appreciated when i was ten but suddenly blindsided me characters that revealed new depths emotional scenes that only became increasingly poignant meaningful like that amazing scene where buzz first becomes aware his own mortality as toy that cant really fly or when he learns cope with that fact by embracing fact that he can instead fall rather well with style point this rambling trip down memory lane is that toy story whole legacy it means lot me i grew up with these pictures never tired returning them they were always there me like good friend is i approached toy story 3 with slightest reservations fully trusting pixar yet wondering how they could possibly produce anything that would live up such high standards well suffice say they did it if toy story 3 isnt best series then thats merely because it comes eleven years after last one it hasnt been given some time work its full magic us this is every bit as engaging heartwarming funny as first two films but its also saddest most human most moving plot has already been outlined by other critics so i dont feel need recap anything nor do i want inadvertently spoil any key moments please your own sake avoid reading too much about movie before going see it some reviewers are bit too keen giving away ending although its understandable given how surprisingly emotional it is introduction new characters is seamless ken voiced by michael keaton is hilarious but thankfully not overused other assorted variety toys including lots o huggin bear ned beatty are fine additions series woody buzz tom hanks tim allen respectively pick up right where they left off you feel weird way like youre visiting old pals movie features best animation trilogy second half which is darker than two previous installments makes excellent use lighting cinematography climactic finale is incredibly intense especially kids movie features particularly impressive visuals many reviewers have noted that they cried during finale even i must admit that i came pretty close summer full bores disappointments under achievers toy story 3 is not merely first thoroughly satisfying motion picture season its only truly moving one it is fairly ironic perhaps that we must turn movies about pieces plastic find such poignant reflections upon human nature but then again im not sure id want have it any other way,0.5206356188614252,0.18406189390060357,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10.0,Simply brilliant!,"I was about 10 or 12 when I watched the first Toy Story in the cinema with my little brother and sister. We were all enchanted! Years later Toy Story 2 came out and it was a blast! Again we all went to the theater to see it and we were so thrilled and excited after the movie! Im 24 now, and just yesterday I was at the Bulgarian gala-premiere of the film. My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that's kinda natural for them. But still it feels like 100% Toy Story, with all the improvements, somehow I don't feel this 15-years-wide gap between the first and the third part.What matters more is the (Toy) Story itself! And it is just fantastic! I had really high expectations of this film and honestly, after seeing it, my expectations were surpassed! The plot is really emotional, with so many nostalgic moments... Being kinda grown-up myself, but doing my growing-up with the first two parts of Toy Story, I couldn't relate more with this one! I was really touched! I just wish the theater was empty. Then I could stop holding back my tears! And it's not just t the big story, but also all those little things that go on around it! I don't know how many of those references and gags were in the script and how many were put in there in the making process, but it's just amazing! Even if it's the most dramatic and the darkest of the 3 (as dark as Toy Story can get) the comedy is still there, and I was laughing out loud all the way through! It's a wild roller-coaster, and I'm not even sure who will have more fun with it, if it will be the kids, or their parents! There's just so much more in there for you to notice, admire and laugh at! And I'm sure that after watching the film again I'll find out even more! There's also a really neat Totoro cameo, and it's great of Pixar to pay homage to their old friend, Miyazaki san.The old lovable characters are all here, and they are joined by an army of new ones, and each one of them has his real personality and you can recognize in them characteristics of someone, both visually and with their attitude they express different things and you instinctively feel what these toys stand for. It's really funny to recognize in them some movie archetypes or features of people that you know.I realize that I just poured out tons of superlatives, but there's nothing else you can say about this film! It has everything! (And about how many 3rd parts you can say that?) The only thing I could criticize is that there is one really freaky baby-toy, that can give the creeps to the smaller kids, but it's done on a purpose and for me it was really an enjoyable touch to the atmosphere of the film.To wrap up this review, I will just say - Thank you, Pixar!",simply brilliant,i was about 10 or 12 when i watched first toy story cinema with my little brother sister we were all enchanted years later toy story 2 came out it was blast again we all went theater see it we were so thrilled excited after movie im 24 now just yesterday i was at bulgarian gala premiere film my brother was fortunate win invitation two he took photo himself with our small collection toy story toys sent it website we had chance see third part its first screening 1st time 3d no doubt that animation is better than ever guys pixar constantly push limits but thats kinda natural them but still it feels like 100 toy story with all improvements somehow i dont feel this 15 years wide gap between first third part what matters more is toy story itself it is just fantastic i had really high expectations this film honestly after seeing it my expectations were surpassed plot is really emotional with so many nostalgic moments being kinda grown up myself but doing my growing up with first two parts toy story i couldnt relate more with this one i was really touched i just wish theater was empty then i could stop holding back my tears its not just t big story but also all those little things that go around it i dont know how many those references gags were script how many were put there making process but its just amazing even if its most dramatic darkest 3 as dark as toy story can get comedy is still there i was laughing out loud all way through its wild roller coaster im not even sure who will have more fun with it if it will be kids or their parents theres just so much more there you notice admire laugh at im sure that after watching film again ill find out even more theres also really neat totoro cameo its great pixar pay homage their old friend miyazaki san old lovable characters are all here they are joined by army new ones each one them has his real personality you can recognize them characteristics someone both visually with their attitude they express different things you instinctively feel what these toys stand its really funny recognize them some movie archetypes or features people that you know i realize that i just poured out tons superlatives but theres nothing else you can say about this film it has everything about how many 3rd parts you can say that only thing i could criticize is that there is one really freaky baby toy that can give creeps smaller kids but its done purpose me it was really enjoyable touch atmosphere film wrap up this review i will just say thank you pixar,0.4823649190315857,0.22242905242905242,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,"few trilogies can be considered whole and complete, but this is now one of them","Toy Story 3 brings back nostalgia, but that's to be expected. We all think back to fifteen years ago, or eleven years ago, when the Toy Story movies came out the first time. If you're too young for that, then at least the re-release was last year to catch people up, though it's not quite the same thing. As Andy is off to college- as was predicted would happen as a given in Toy Story 2- we in the audience realize that this third film follows a kind of time-line that runs with our lives. Even if you're an adult (i.e. older than my 20-something age) you can relate to what the toys and Andy are going through. What happens at the end of the film, the resolution of the ultimate conflict of what to do with the toys as life goes on, is one of the most beautiful and heartwarmingly bittersweet (well, more like sad-sweet) moments in recent cinema. Pixar tends to do that.This is the kind of third movie that makes it a trilogy- it's hard to see it going on to a fourth film and having any kind of the same resonance- and one that seems perfectly fit together in terms of a progressing story. But where something like Star Wars saw the second film as the darkest and third one coming into (somewhat) lighter terms, this is not quite the same with Pixar's baby. Toy Story 3, with it becoming a prison movie in more than just a sense (the toys get sent to Sunnyside Daycare, run by a cute-looking but ruthless bear voiced by Ned Beatty), and what happens in said prison. To be sure, other cute things abound in the movie, from Peas-in-a-Pod to (yes) Totoro from Miyazaki's movie. But in that prison, and other things that happen such as the trip to the junkyard/landfill, it gets dark.And yet, Pixar continues their outstanding method of storytelling and entertainment: nothing is even scaled-down for kids, and nothing is too sappy for adults. A couple of obvious song choices aside- 'Dream Weaver' for when Ken and Barbie first meet, and 'Freak Out' as Ken hilariously tries on a wardrobe- there's nothing that doesn't work for kids and adults, equally, and often more-so for adults than kids (I wonder, for example, when Buzz is reset and becomes El Buzzo and speaks Spanish if the wee little ones will be able to read the subtitles). When it's funny the humor is aimed at sophisticated one-liners and, yes, sophisticated (or just well-timed) slapstick, when there's action it's intense just as in the previous Toy Stories, and when it's heartbreaking it'll make everyone in the audience cry. I wonder if Pixar has some kind of magic movie-voodoo to get the old adage to come alive: you'll laugh, you'll cry- and sometimes in the same breath! The new toys are great additions, but they never detract from the classic cast. And even with them, and the great dynamic of the daycare center and its prison atmosphere, we never get lost in the shuffle of toy conflicts and desires and dreams halted (Lotso's backstory is like a twisted version of Jessie's story from Toy Story 2). It would also be a given to say that the animation keeps getting better, a little higher quality in stylization and panache, but the animators and filmmakers also aim higher in a number of ways. The opening of the film, with its grand depiction of what's going on inside of Andy's mind as he plays with his toys, an Old West-Sci/fi hybrid complete with a train full of troll orphans and Hamm as a giant flying pig-spaceship-weapon, is so epic as to seem like it's out of a much bigger Summer Action Blockbuster than it should be. Or rather, Toy Story IS this summer's big Blockbuster, and it's epic enough to be qualified as a kind of mini-masterpiece - that is, until the rest of the film unfolds.At the least, Buzz dancing to Spanish Salsa music, and that end of the movie, make it one of the high points of Pixar's career - and this is following WALL-E and Up!",few trilogies can be considered whole complete but this is now one them,toy story 3 brings back nostalgia but thats be expected we all think back fifteen years ago or eleven years ago when toy story movies came out first time if youre too young that then at least re release was last year catch people up though its not quite same thing as andy is off college as was predicted would happen as given toy story 2 we audience realize that this third film follows kind time line that runs with our lives even if youre adult i e older than my 20 something age you can relate what toys andy are going through what happens at end film resolution ultimate conflict what do with toys as life goes is one most beautiful heartwarmingly bittersweet well more like sad sweet moments recent cinema pixar tends do that this is kind third movie that makes it trilogy its hard see it going fourth film having any kind same resonance one that seems perfectly fit together terms progressing story but where something like star wars saw second film as darkest third one coming into somewhat lighter terms this is not quite same with pixars baby toy story 3 with it becoming prison movie more than just sense toys get sent sunnyside daycare run by cute looking but ruthless bear voiced by ned beatty what happens said prison be sure other cute things abound movie peas pod yes totoro miyazakis movie but that prison other things that happen such as trip junkyard landfill it gets dark yet pixar continues their outstanding method storytelling entertainment nothing is even scaled down kids nothing is too sappy adults couple obvious song choices aside dream weaver when ken barbie first meet freak out as ken hilariously tries wardrobe theres nothing that doesnt work kids adults equally often more so adults than kids i wonder example when buzz is reset becomes el buzzo speaks spanish if wee little ones will be able read subtitles when its funny humor is aimed at sophisticated one liners yes sophisticated or just well timed slapstick when theres action its intense just as previous toy stories when its heartbreaking itll make everyone audience cry i wonder if pixar has some kind magic movie voodoo get old adage come alive youll laugh youll cry sometimes same breath new toys are great additions but they never detract classic cast even with them great dynamic daycare center its prison atmosphere we never get lost shuffle toy conflicts desires dreams halted lotsos backstory is like twisted version jessies story toy story 2 it would also be given say that animation keeps getting better little higher quality stylization panache but animators filmmakers also aim higher number ways opening film with its grand depiction whats going inside andys mind as he plays with his toys old west sci fi hybrid complete with train full troll orphans hamm as giant flying pig spaceship weapon is so epic as seem like its out much bigger summer action blockbuster than it should be or rather toy story is this summers big blockbuster its epic enough be qualified as kind mini masterpiece that is until rest film unfolds at least buzz dancing spanish salsa music that end movie make it one high points pixars career this is following wall e up,0.4690182040182039,0.14495393495393494,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A perfect way to end the beloved Toy Story trilogy,"Again, I don't mean to sound like a broken record but it seems like Disney/Pixar is the only competent movie company that produces great films and classic stories. They know how to write, shoot and tell a story well. Toy Story is Pixar's baby, at the time of the first film's release and was the start of what we have today with computer animation. Now the first Toy Story was good, the second Toy Story was great and Toy Story 3 was absolutely fantastic. The stories just get better and better as they keep coming. Bringing back our favorite characters but adding a fun new little twist to them, it brought a new audience in and kept the one's who saw the first one and gave us something new to enjoy. Pixar's last films like Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up kept raising the bar higher and higher, not only are they Disney's great films, but they're also some of the strongest and best films of all time. Toy Story 3 can now be added as this is my favorite of the trilogy, bringing in some great new characters and magic to the story, I couldn't stop laughing and crying with this movie. I thought this was a perfect ending to the trilogy as it gets to all the adults when we had to grow up and give up our childhood toys.Now seventeen years old, Andy has outgrown his old toys and is preparing to move to college. He decides to take Woody with him and packs the other toys in a garbage bag, intending to store them in the attic, but Andy's mom mistakenly puts the bag on the curb. Believing that Andy no longer wants them, the toys sneak into a box to be donated to Sunnyside Daycare. As the only toy who saw what really happened, Woody tries to clear up the misunderstanding, but the other toys refuse to believe him and they are all driven to Sunnyside. Woody tries to convince the others to return to Andy, but they decide they are happier at Sunnyside, so he leaves without them. The others soon discover that Lotso had placed them in a room of toddlers, whose young and rambunctious nature causes them to abuse and torture the innocent toys. Woody learns that Sunnyside is a toy prison. Realizing their error, the toys try to leave but are imprisoned by Lotso, the head bear of the toys and his henchmen. Woody must return to Sunnyside to help his friends break out.One of the things I absolutely loved about this film was that it is darker than other family animated movies, I felt like this one had to be as it's really sad that Andy has to say good bye to his toys. But I was telling my friends the other day how it's sad because a lot of animated films while they're good, our films that we grew up with always had a dark touch like Who Framed Roger Rabbit or The Lion King, along with others long before those films. I thought maybe this generation was just a bit wussy when it came to having a little bit of a scary story. But Toy Story 3 has some genuinely chilling moments, the group of evil henchmen toys turn Buzz evil and it is actually kind of creepy the way they come at him. I loved when they put our group of toys in the bins and had a little tribute to some great prison movies, something for the adults to enjoy. I also saw a little Puss in Boots when the group gets a hold of Buzz and resets him by accident turning him into Spanish Buzz Lightyear, I couldn't stop laughing at his actions and lines. Incredible animation, great story along with a strong cast, this was a terrific film that I was so glad to see. I don't like to over hype a movie because you'll have a certain hope for it, but I went in with high hopes and not only got what I wanted, but much more. I can't wait for this movie to be added to my DVD collection. It's a new classic that I'm sure you'll absolutely love.10/10",perfect way end beloved toy story trilogy,again i dont mean sound like broken record but it seems like disney pixar is only competent movie company that produces great films classic stories they know how write shoot tell story well toy story is pixars baby at time first films release was start what we have today with computer animation now first toy story was good second toy story was great toy story 3 was absolutely fantastic stories just get better better as they keep coming bringing back our favorite characters but adding fun new little twist them it brought new audience kept ones who saw first one gave us something new enjoy pixars last films like ratatouille wall e up kept raising bar higher higher not only are they disneys great films but theyre also some strongest best films all time toy story 3 can now be added as this is my favorite trilogy bringing some great new characters magic story i couldnt stop laughing crying with this movie i thought this was perfect ending trilogy as it gets all adults when we had grow up give up our childhood toys now seventeen years old andy has outgrown his old toys is preparing move college he decides take woody with him packs other toys garbage bag intending store them attic but andys mom mistakenly puts bag curb believing that andy no longer wants them toys sneak into box be donated sunnyside daycare as only toy who saw what really happened woody tries clear up misunderstanding but other toys refuse believe him they are all driven sunnyside woody tries convince others return andy but they decide they are happier at sunnyside so he leaves without them others soon discover that lotso had placed them room toddlers whose young rambunctious nature causes them abuse torture innocent toys woody learns that sunnyside is toy prison realizing their error toys try leave but are imprisoned by lotso head bear toys his henchmen woody must return sunnyside help his friends break out one things i absolutely loved about this film was that it is darker than other family animated movies i felt like this one had be as its really sad that andy has say good bye his toys but i was telling my friends other day how its sad because lot animated films while theyre good our films that we grew up with always had dark touch like who framed roger rabbit or lion king along with others long before those films i thought maybe this generation was just bit wussy when it came having little bit scary story but toy story 3 has some genuinely chilling moments group evil henchmen toys turn buzz evil it is actually kind creepy way they come at him i loved when they put our group toys bins had little tribute some great prison movies something adults enjoy i also saw little puss boots when group gets hold buzz resets him by accident turning him into spanish buzz lightyear i couldnt stop laughing at his actions lines incredible animation great story along with strong cast this was terrific film that i was so glad see i dont like over hype movie because youll have certain hope it but i went with high hopes not only got what i wanted but much more i cant wait this movie be added my dvd collection its new classic that im sure youll absolutely love 10 10,0.5946338596044476,0.20835612426788894,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,How in the world did Pixar make adults CRY over TOYS??!,"The best magic tricks in the world are ones that cannot be unraveled, reverse engineered or dissected to figure out exactly how they are pulled off. This philosophy is doubly applicable to Pixar's ""Toy Story 3"", the storyline-ending outro of the beloved Toy Story, uh, story.I feel it relevant somehow to divulge my age, as it somehow validates the powerful emotions evoked throughout the film. I am a 28 year old male, who, fifteen years ago, was fresh into the teen years of supposed adolescence at the release of some weird, 3d animated movie (wait, they can animate with computers?) entitled ""Toy Story"". This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gawd-awful.""Toy Story 3"" starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when ""Toy Story 2"" wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1's spark is TS2's candle, and that in turn is TS3's blazing sun.Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream.

10.0,A Perfect Tale of Adventure and Devotion,"Since I felt none of the other reviews here do the movie justice, I became compelled to write my own. It is the most inspired film I have ever encountered.The creators of Toy Story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. I cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that I have ever seen to it. It is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys, the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. Yet, the Pixar Team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. The animation is so brilliant that it captures shading, lighting, and textures that have yet to be seen on film.Then, Toy Story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two, with very clever character development. Its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: Woody, the wise sheriff, leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog, slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of Ken and Barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. At the same time, Pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. It is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. But these toys never age, and as its owners, once in their playful youths, leave for work and college, these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. As you leave for work every morning, your dog doesn't know where you go. And every day, he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him, every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.Finally comes Pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear, love, action, and comedy, among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right, that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure, wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline, always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. It is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. I cannot wait to see it again.",perfect tale adventure devotion,since i felt none other reviews here do movie justice i became compelled write my own it is most inspired film i have ever encountered creators toy story 3 have imagination that is unparalleled i cannot begin compare any other animated movies that i have ever seen it it is fantasy unconventional sense aside talking toys environment settings are typical commonplace yet pixar team manages cram every last drop energy into incredibly clever story inventive plot devices out just common household objects animation is so brilliant that it captures shading lighting textures that have yet be seen film then toy story 3 becomes beautiful elaboration first two with very clever character development its maturity relationships is concise but witty woody wise sheriff leading other toys with courage finesse spaceman winning love cowgirl loyalty dog slinky grumpy married potato his devoted wife superficial relationship ken barbie broken spirit lost teddy bear at same time pixar uses metaphor that is so strong that it drives audience love these characters with all their hearts it is similar emotional complex happy puppy who is brought into home has nothing its mind but playing with its youthful owners but these toys never age as its owners once their playful youths leave work college these toys still know nothing more than their youth happiness living one day play again as you leave work every morning your dog doesnt know where you go every day he does nothing more than pray that you come back see him every day waiting you bring out ball again game fetch finally comes pixars ability integrate so many emotions fear love action comedy among others with each having so much vigor its own right that movie becomes roller coaster animation adventure wound together by constant movement setting storyline always keeping audience guessing what might happen next it is brilliant tale perfect movie children adults alike i cannot wait see it again,0.5807936507936506,0.29134920634920636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Third time's a Charm,"I think the harshest thing I could say about the latest Pixar adventure, or Toy Story movie, for that matter, is even attempting to determine with Toy Story film is the best.How Pixar does it blows my mind. Time and again. Sure, they start with what I consider the number one quality of any movie: story. Character depth and development ranks second for me. Despite all my male-counterparts that simply love action, things blowing up, beautiful women (or people,) etc., fall behind – far behind – the front two. Toy Story 3 has all qualities needed to make a fantastic, adventurous and successful movie for tons of people of all creeds. But it puts both of my favorite staples first: excellent story with (yes, even animated) deep characters. And it's a lot of fun to boot.Starting off with a literal bang, Toy Story 3 sets the scene early that these ""Toys of Owner Andy"" love to be played with. It's what they were made for, what they yearn for and it gives them hope and a soul. Unfortunately for them, like the expiration on food, (yes, even Twinkies, thanks Zombieland) kids grow up and out of toys.Will Andy be faithful, keeping his prized Buzz Lightyear (Allen,) Woody (Hanks) or (most of) the rest of his toys, ones adults like me grew up with in Toy Story and Toy Story 2? Kinda.As in usual Toy Story fashion, there are mishaps and the adventure begins! Follow the toy crusaders from this point on from Andy's house to the curb, from the day care of hell to new child's house and so on.I would hate to even divulge in more of the secrets, twists, turns, comedy (and I mean roll on floor laughing humor), suspense or ideas presented. I can't imagine even some movie-goers on the fence that actually ""have to decide"" to see it.As equally tough as it would be to rank all Pixar movies – though, I plan to – and rank these Toy Story movies in order, it would be equally hard to pinpoint the best parts of Toy Story 3, aside from to aforementioned great script and characters. But, I'll try.I loved the monkey! Though brief, I laughed so hard every second he was on screen. Furthermore, I loved the other new characters, especially Mr. Pricklepants (Dalton.) I loved the intro. I loved the plan of escape. I loved the Ken ""secret"" references. I loved the español. I loved the comity (as found in the other Toy Story movies, but I would say it's most evident in this feature) between the leads, as well as newcomers. I loved the extreme attention to detail, the crispness of the film and the cinematography while never forgetting this is a cartoon. (And to add to that, by far, the graphics and technology has tripled this time around, even though the previous groundbreaking entries were still way above par.) I loved the overall comedy, including the tongue-in-cheek jokes. (I actually found myself laughing hard and out loud at some of the under-the-radar jokes that apparently no one else either caught or cared for. It was a tough and somewhat quiet crowd around me – aside from the annoying and crying kids and their equally inattentive guardians who don't know how to muffle their kids.) I love that as well created and designed it is, this could very well be a stand-alone feature, though it helps to see the first two and it does play homage to fans of the other Toy Story movies. So much so, it's hard NOT to get choked up in the finale, if you can make it that far without getting somewhat emotional.That's just a short list. There's so much wonder and awe and it's jaw dropping that Pixar, or the returning voice talent/actors could pull this offagain. But they did. It's highly recommended, and I would say to see it on IMAX 3-D for the quality and grand scale – like I did, but Disney STILL has yet to shock me with their ""version"" of 3-D. I was blown away during the 3-D in Monsters Vs. Aliens, but here, like in Up, it was so-so. Thankfully, Pixar does know how NOT to rely on 3-D as a gimmick. They spend their money on the talent to create everlasting stories, fun and adventures.Side Note: The preceding animated short, one I always look forward to prior to any Pixar film, Day & Night, was pretty good, and inventive, but not great. At least it featured Vegas.",third times charm,i think harshest thing i could say about latest pixar adventure or toy story movie that matter is even attempting determine with toy story film is best how pixar does it blows my mind time again sure they start with what i consider number one quality any movie story character depth development ranks second me despite all my male counterparts that simply love action things blowing up beautiful women or people etc fall behind far behind front two toy story 3 has all qualities needed make fantastic adventurous successful movie tons people all creeds but it puts both my favorite staples first excellent story with yes even animated deep characters its lot fun boot starting off with literal bang toy story 3 sets scene early that these toys owner andy love be played with its what they were made what they yearn it gives them hope soul unfortunately them like expiration food yes even twinkies thanks zombieland kids grow up out toys will andy be faithful keeping his prized buzz lightyear allen woody hanks or most rest his toys ones adults like me grew up with toy story toy story 2 kinda as usual toy story fashion there are mishaps adventure begins follow toy crusaders this point andys house curb day care hell new childs house so i would hate even divulge more secrets twists turns comedy i mean roll floor laughing humor suspense or ideas presented i cant imagine even some movie goers fence that actually have decide see it as equally tough as it would be rank all pixar movies though i plan rank these toy story movies order it would be equally hard pinpoint best parts toy story 3 aside aforementioned great script characters but ill try i loved monkey though brief i laughed so hard every second he was screen furthermore i loved other new characters especially mr pricklepants dalton i loved intro i loved plan escape i loved ken secret references i loved espa ol i loved comity as found other toy story movies but i would say its most evident this feature between leads as well as newcomers i loved extreme attention detail crispness film cinematography while never forgetting this is cartoon add that by far graphics technology has tripled this time around even though previous groundbreaking entries were still way above par i loved overall comedy including tongue cheek jokes i actually found myself laughing hard out loud at some under radar jokes that apparently no one else either caught or cared it was tough somewhat quiet crowd around me aside annoying crying kids their equally inattentive guardians who dont know how muffle their kids i love that as well created designed it is this could very well be stand alone feature though it helps see first two it does play homage fans other toy story movies so much so its hard not get choked up finale if you can make it that far without getting somewhat emotional thats just short list theres so much wonder awe its jaw dropping that pixar or returning voice talent actors could pull this off again but they did its highly recommended i would say see it imax 3 d quality grand scale like i did but disney still has yet shock me with their version 3 d i was blown away during 3 d monsters vs aliens but here like up it was so so thankfully pixar does know how not rely 3 d as gimmick they spend their money talent create everlasting stories fun adventures side note preceding animated short one i always look forward prior any pixar film day night was pretty good inventive but not great at least it featured vegas,0.5471980329611909,0.14088543328017003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,"To me, this is by far and large the best Pixar film to date!","To me, Pixar have never yet made a bad film, even their weakest Cars is actually very good. Like a lot of people here, I grew up with and loved the first two Toy Story films and still love them. As is consistently the case with Pixar they are superbly animated, sophisticated and had great characters. Toy Story 3 somehow managed to do the seemingly impossible, while its Toy Storys 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart, this film was even better.Perhaps Toy Story 3 isn't the most original of the trilogy or of the Pixar films, but that made little difference to me. While the darkest of the three, it still maintained the predecessors' heart and charm, and overall it was just an amazing film full-stop from start to finish, and easily one of the best of the year.The animation is just superb here. Hardly a surprise though, as the animation was phenomenal also in Toy Storys 1 and 2, but to me it was just as sophisticated and as colourful here if not more so. I also loved the music, that said I don't think it is the best Pixar score(Up) or best score of the year, but it is almost certainly one of Randy Newman's better efforts and I liked the You've Got a Friend in Me repeat.The pacing is just fine as well, and the story is tremendously engaging with plenty of humorous, tense, exciting and genuinely affecting scenes. The ending especially resonated with my entire family, especially my brother, while the scene in the dump is for me Pixar's most intense scene.I was also delighted with the film's script. The dialogue was always witty and sharp, none of it felt forced in any way. There was the brilliantly judged humour- Buzz speaking Spanish was just one of the highlights and the beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs- and also the poignant parts that avoided being overly-sentimental and mawkish.Another strength is in the characters. All the main characters are as likable as ever, Woody is still determined, Buzz is a sheer delight, Jessie(though I actually like her) is more tolerable here and Mr Potato Head is hilarious. But the new characters are just as wonderful, the baby is both creepy and cute and I felt for him at the end, the cymbal monkey especially for that shriek is one of Pixar's scariest characters, Lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady and bitter with an unrelenting past and Ken is cool without being bland or annoying.As ever, the voice work is brilliant from all involved, not just from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen but also from Ned Beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted Lotso like a glove.In conclusion, a truly brilliant film and a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",me this is by far large best pixar film date,me pixar have never yet made bad film even their weakest cars is actually very good like lot people here i grew up with loved first two toy story films still love them as is consistently case with pixar they are superbly animated sophisticated had great characters toy story 3 somehow managed do seemingly impossible while its toy storys 1 2 have special place my heart this film was even better perhaps toy story 3 isnt most original trilogy or pixar films but that made little difference me while darkest three it still maintained predecessors heart charm overall it was just amazing film full stop start finish easily one best year animation is just superb here hardly surprise though as animation was phenomenal also toy storys 1 2 but me it was just as sophisticated as colourful here if not more so i also loved music that said i dont think it is best pixar score up or best score year but it is almost certainly one randy newmans better efforts i liked youve got friend me repeat pacing is just fine as well story is tremendously engaging with plenty humorous tense exciting genuinely affecting scenes ending especially resonated with my entire family especially my brother while scene dump is me pixars most intense scene i was also delighted with films script dialogue was always witty sharp none it felt forced any way there was brilliantly judged humour buzz speaking spanish was just one highlights beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs also poignant parts that avoided being overly sentimental mawkish another strength is characters all main characters are as likable as ever woody is still determined buzz is sheer delight jessie though i actually like her is more tolerable here mr potato head is hilarious but new characters are just as wonderful baby is both creepy cute i felt him at end cymbal monkey especially that shriek is one pixars scariest characters lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady bitter with unrelenting past ken is cool without being bland or annoying as ever voice work is brilliant all involved not just tom hanks tim allen but also ned beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted lotso like glove conclusion truly brilliant film fitting conclusion amazing trilogy 10 10 bethany cox,0.6559685425685426,0.30003881673881666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,Pixar's Best Movie And Truly A Masterpiece,"Is ""Toy Story 3"" good? Yes, it is. Is it exciting? Yes. Is the animation good? Excellent. Is it worth the money? It's worth. Is it better than the previous two? Much, much better. ""Toy Story 3"" is an excellent movie for all ages.First, the animation. The moves of the characters are simply perfect. Ken and Barbie, they're robotic moves are so breathtaking. The moves are simply so detail and mesmerizing. The appearances. Not much to talk about. But, the appearances of the characters were perfectly designed. The main characters were really cool. Ken and Barbie, they're really designed in detail. For Barbie, the line where is visible in the neck was really detail. Ken is also really detail especially with his body. Lot-o-Huggin'-Bear was also carefully designed by the paper which often appears on dolls listing the warning or whatever.The way the movie is presented. Very well done. In around 90 minutes of running time (excluding ""Day & Night""), the movie was not boring at all. It had some laughable expressions which are pretty funny. I liked it when Buzz turns into Spanish mode where most of the audience laughed. That moment was hysterical. The scenes were also thrilling like the end scene (which I'm not going to tell you) or the scenes in Sunnyside. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.The new characters. Well, I think there's one negative point. I think little kids around the age of 3, 4 or 5 might be scared with the appearance of Big Baby, because, his appearance is kind of scary for little kids.The 3D effects. Not so cheesy and not so breathtaking but pretty good. The depths of the items in the film were not bad. The sound acting. They were really good. Tom Hanks on Woody was really good. He really projected his voice until he becomes a real Woody. Tim Allen on Buzz Lightyear was also good and satisfying. He really sounded like a real astronaut or space ranger. The others were also good. But, I think Tom Hanks on Woody still has the best projection of voice in the film.Final thing, the short film attached to it: ""Day & Night"". It was shockingly, awfully, crazily cool. That short film was quite funny. It was really good. Overall, the short film compliments to the film to be a very good movie.A short advise, you might want to prepare some tissues to wipe your tears as there are some pretty sad moments in the film. The scenes were just so sad that that's another praise for Lee Unkrich on his directing. So, if you don't prepare those tissues, I hope you have something you can use to wipe your tears.As an amazing end to such a magnificent trilogy, ""Toy Story 3"" is a must watch movie. Watching it in 3D is not a bad choice. Your kids will definitely be thrilled watching this film. I truly believe this is the best animated film of the year, or even the best film of all 2010 films. If you haven't watched this yet, what are you waiting for? Go purchase your tickets and enjoy this masterpiece. I guarantee you that you won't regret watching this movie. Overall, I give this movie a perfect score of 10 stars.

8.0,Toy Story 3 is not a movie for adults who DO NOT want to cry during a movie.,"The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar's WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don't have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films.",toy story 3 is not movie adults who do not want cry during movie,only disney movie i cried was lion king other disney film that came close was pixars wall e i did not cry during toy story 3 i went home walked into my room realized that my optimus prime is not at foot my door my sylvester cat stuffed toy was not my bed my mcdonalds sonic hedgehog toy was not my shelf my conner only housed my stack video games i asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission at that moment is when i thought about last 30 minutes toy story 3 i started cry this film was carelessly thoughtful stoke genius it keeps both children adults entertained lots drama lots suspense lots toys disney pixar outdid themselves with this one toy story was smash hit when it first hit screens toy story 2 my opinion was not as good as its first installment but it was film that almost never hit theaters so ill give them benefit doubt but toy story 3 set bar infinity beyond va cast was phenomenal visuals were stunning script was enjoyable this movie reached all corners film greatness its kids movie i have no idea how disney pixar knock out great movies like this they make it look easy i related andy this film just as i did toy story 3 ending was so tough watch without sniffling because if you watched toy story at around andys age during time you watch toy story 3 around andys age now he was 17 i am 22 went through roughly same hassle as he did when he was moving out college you would feel wallop emotion toy story 3 is must see if you dont have children take go see this film then take friends who saw first two films,0.5879629629629631,0.19830246913580252,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Just amazing,"After seeing Toy Story 1 and 2, they quickly became my favourite set of films ever and just last year when i heard there was going to be a 3rd, my heart immediately sank. As with sequels before, i thought it was going to be aimed at an entirely new audience, for the sake of profit and would squeeze the love i had for the series right out of it.Then i began to read about interviews and the plot line and how it continues from both previous films, with Andy just a child back then, he has now become a teenager ready for college. This got me a little excited and for the rest of the year building up to it i was looking more and more forward to it.Usually, walking out of cinema doors, i have a feeling of disgust and disgrace having just watched an awful film for a high price. So, it would have been safe to say my expectations for this film were ridiculously high, i mean there is not many series' of films that keep followers for 15 years.It felt like a mere 10 minutes that i had been in my seat when the film finished. I was on the verge of tears, had a huge smile on my face and almost felt the need to jump up and clap. There are few films like this out there, Toy Story 1 and 2 being the exceptions. It continued the story so well, you still had the same love for the main characters that you always did.For a film aimed at children, it had an amazing plot, that never confused but always kept you guessing. It is perfect for all ages, whether old or young, it is a magical story.My only criticism would be at the lack of characters from previous films. It was explained immediately whether they had been sold or lost but i really felt disappointed that some old favourites were missing.Still apart from that, the film was faultless. I recommend going immediately and watching it in 3D. Nothing really pops out in your face, but it is made really well to fit 3d.",just amazing,after seeing toy story 1 2 they quickly became my favourite set films ever just last year when i heard there was going be 3rd my heart immediately sank as with sequels before i thought it was going be aimed at entirely new audience sake profit would squeeze love i had series right out it then i began read about interviews plot line how it continues both previous films with andy just child back then he has now become teenager ready college this got me little excited rest year building up it i was looking more more forward it usually walking out cinema doors i have feeling disgust disgrace having just watched awful film high price so it would have been safe say my expectations this film were ridiculously high i mean there is not many series films that keep followers 15 years it felt like mere 10 minutes that i had been my seat when film finished i was verge tears had huge smile my face almost felt need jump up clap there are few films like this out there toy story 1 2 being exceptions it continued story so well you still had same love main characters that you always did film aimed at children it had amazing plot that never confused but always kept you guessing it is perfect all ages whether old or young it is magical story my only criticism would be at lack characters previous films it was explained immediately whether they had been sold or lost but i really felt disappointed that some old favourites were missing still apart that film was faultless i recommend going immediately watching it 3d nothing really pops out your face but it is made really well fit 3d,0.47763847894529704,0.14167601338055882,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Blew me away,So I'm 26 and jaded. I most often hate the world and everything in it. Well that being said I absolutely lost myself watching this movie. I had seen the two before it as a kid growing up but I never felt so strong about them as I do with this one. I have spent the last couple weeks after seeing this movie spreading the word about how awesome it was. The theme is so universal that anyone despite their background or feelings can absolutely relate. We've all been to that place were we feel like we've been used and that were done with. The feeling as if we have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. I really want everyone to experience the overwhelming feelings that boiled inside of me as this movie came to an end. The second the toys held hands at one point my face absolutely exploded and from there it didn't relent. Seriously I could not breathe it was almost to much. But its not. Go see it. Now.......................................what are you waiting for?,blew me away,so im 26 jaded i most often hate world everything it well that being said i absolutely lost myself watching this movie i had seen two before it as kid growing up but i never felt so strong about them as i do with this one i have spent last couple weeks after seeing this movie spreading word about how awesome it was theme is so universal that anyone despite their background or feelings can absolutely relate weve all been that place were we feel like weve been used that were done with feeling as if we have nowhere go or anyone turn i really want everyone experience overwhelming feelings that boiled inside me as this movie came end second toys held hands at one point my face absolutely exploded there it didnt relent seriously i could not breathe it was almost much but its not go see it now what are you waiting,0.5377777777777779,0.14666666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Back to childhood with a masterpiece...,"I am now 20 years old and so, it was at the age of 7 when I first watched Toy Story. I found it amazing that the toys were alive and all the story was superb either. When I found out that a 3rd part was up to be released I had been dreaming of it all the time. So, I went to watch it. In the theatre there were parents with their kids and thankfully they were really quiet. When the film started with the narration of the ages that had passed, I felt so touched. During the film I was back in my childhood when everything seemed -and were- so easy and I was with no concerns. All the purity of that age came and hit me, although I knew that would happen. I admit that I first found the story average, but when the film was on I was enchanted. There were no thoughts in my mind. I was there watching a masterpiece that in my point of view can be truly appreciated by only us, those who matured since the first movie, but still carrying all the heroes into our hearts. I must admit that I was up to cry in several moments, especially when the toys were in fire and in the end. Leaving the cinema and though I cried -cause, yes, I did!- I was too happy. Entering the house I was singing the theme song...I highly recommend it to you all!!!! 10/10...",back childhood with masterpiece,i am now 20 years old so it was at age 7 when i first watched toy story i found it amazing that toys were alive all story was superb either when i found out that 3rd part was up be released i had been dreaming it all time so i went watch it theatre there were parents with their kids thankfully they were really quiet when film started with narration ages that had passed i felt so touched during film i was back my childhood when everything seemed were so easy i was with no concerns all purity that age came hit me although i knew that would happen i admit that i first found story average but when film was i was enchanted there were no thoughts my mind i was there watching masterpiece that my point view can be truly appreciated by only us those who matured since first movie but still carrying all heroes into our hearts i must admit that i was up cry several moments especially when toys were fire end leaving cinema though i cried cause yes i did i was too happy entering house i was singing theme song i highly recommend it you all 10 10,0.4582456140350876,0.21017543859649127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.15}"
