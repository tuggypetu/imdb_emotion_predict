10.0,Unmatched accomplishment,"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species. For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as ""boring"" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. This is the film that put the science in ""science fiction"", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done. The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development. It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue. There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.",unmatched accomplishment,sometimes reading user comments imdb fills me with despair species anybody dismiss 2001 space odyssey as boring they must have no interest science technology philosophy history or art film making finally i understand why most hollywood productions are so shallow vacuous they understand their audience thankfully those that cannot appreciate kubricks accomplishment are still minority most viewers are able see intelligence sheer virtuosity that went into making this epic this is film that put science science fiction its depiction space travel mankinds future remains unsurpassed this day it was so far ahead its time that humanity still hasnt caught up 2001 is primarily technical film reason it is slow filled with minutae is because aim was realistically envision future technology past awe inspiring opening scenes films greatest strength is details remember that when this film was made man still hadnt made it out moon but there it is 2001 thats just start journey create such incredibly detailed vision future that 35 years later it is still best we have is beyond belief i still cant work out how some shots were done films only notable mistake was optimism with which it predicted mankinds technological social development it is our shame that year 2001 did not look like film 2001 not kubricks besides incredible special effects camera work set design kubrick also presents viewer with lot food thought about what it means be human where human race is going yes ending is weird hard comprehend but thats nature future kubrick clarke have started task envisioning it now its up audience continue theres no neat resolution no definitive full stop because then audience could stop thinking after final reel i know thats what most audiences seem want these days but kubrick isnt going let us off so lightly im glad see that this film is imdb top 100 films only wish that it were even higher stanley kubrick is one very finest film makers world has known 2001 his finest accomplishment 10 10,0.5526190476190477,0.16038690476190473,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,Legendary,"A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, ""2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?"", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you ""get it"" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is ""...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness."" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, ""Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?"" The New York Times remarked, ""Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."" ""Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,"" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 ""trash masquerading as art"". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for ""if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning"", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause ""cultural shock and social disorientation"". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing ""Daisy"" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous ""Star Gate"" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a ""Space Baby"", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, ""North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.""""But why all the slow parts?"" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI ""Sight and Sound"" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"".2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them.

,It's a puzzlement...,"There are two schools of thought about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material.",its puzzlement,there are two schools thought about 2001 space odyssey one is that it is greatest science fiction epic ever made this is supported by those who claim understand complexities involved leading up star child ending others like myself find it as absorbing as watching paint dry woodwork musical background is glorious colors are dazzling theres interesting use hal as villainous computer beyond that there is nothing least bit interesting about human characters trite dialogue no personality or warmth any individuals pace is unbelievably slow so intellectually gifted can philosophize mysteries space payoff at end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours nothingness i had same letdown feeling when i watched clockwork orange so your like or dislike this movie is purely dependent personal taste intellectuals will take position that you are mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion movie so be aware that this is not conventional story telling any sense whatsoever only those who admire stanley kubricks way with unlikely cinematic material,0.489625850340136,0.1342403628117914,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
7.0,Ahead of its time but...,"I felt the need to review this movie after reading some reviews from other users, simply because I agreed with all. Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn't make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don't really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOWThe end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel, the space child... Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but spending two and a half hours looking at space, slooowww space, and in the end just watch a man in bed, then a baby in a bubble, no explanations, no nothing... Truly, if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it ""art"" or whatever, simply explain it to me, I would be very thankful, not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it, maybe ten years from now.That been said, why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time, I should put myself at the time, the era, the social paradigm, the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note, that I am talking about the visual effects, and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era, a filmmaker, visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating, maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can't reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece, is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it, so the movie reaches its goal: to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this, we just watch them to get some good action scenes, visual effects, whatever, but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype, controversy and most importantly, a vision of the future, he is creating a cult movie...a classic. To sum up, as I said in the beginning, when i read people calling it a classic, a masterpiece, I have to agree, but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true.",ahead its time but,i felt need review this movie after reading some reviews other users simply because i agreed with all those who love it those who hate it those who enjoyed it all them reason is simple everything they say makes sense me i watched movie first time about 10 years ago watched it again last night it still doesnt make perfect sense me i mean story is absent characters dont really get through you ending who gets that ending belowthe end makes no sense me psychedelic travel space child maybe im just plain stupid but spending two half hours looking at space slooowww space end just watch man bed then baby bubble no explanations no nothing truly if someone got it has hability explain it me without calling it art or whatever simply explain it me i would be very thankful not kidding maybe that way i would be able enjoy it next time i watch it maybe ten years now that been said why would i rate it 7 i believe when i watch movie first time i should put myself at time era social paradigm movie was released this movie is cleary ahead its time note that i am talking about visual effects general idea movie this movie clearly marked era filmmaker visual effects idea what space was like that it deserves high rating maybe highest not mention hype movie still causes we still cant reach understanding is it masterpiece is it overrated only way really be able discuss it form your own opinion is watch it so movie reaches its goal be watched debated blockbuster rarely does this we just watch them get some good action scenes visual effects whatever but when filmmaker creates movie that creates hype controversy most importantly vision future he is creating cult movie classic sum up as i said beginning when i read people calling it classic masterpiece i have agree but i also agree with those who say its overrated boring me both sentences are true,0.4574651567944252,0.10995644599303138,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,A film of monolithic proportions.,"A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended.",film monolithic proportions,review i have put off far too long bluntly 2001 is one best science fiction films made date if not very best stanley kubrick was genius film maker this is one his very best works although it is misunderstood by many respectively underrated it is considered one best films all time ill have agree back 1968 no one had done anything like this before no one has since it was marvel special effects breakthrough back then seeing how effects hold up today it is no wonder as why film still looks marvelous after almost forty years take note cgi people through use large miniatures realistic lighting kubrick created some best special effects ever put celluloid this aspect alone almost single handedly created chilling void space atmosphere which is also attributed music realistic sound effects i cant think another film where you cant here anything space like it is reality not only is absence sound effects space realistic it is used cleverly as tool establish mood it works flawlessly aside magnificent display ingenious special effects there are other factors that play part establishing feel film music played all classical compliment what eyes are seeing make you feel significance mans journey through his evolution ape space traveler story while seemingly simple is profound sequentially several mysterious black monoliths are discovered basically trigger certain events integral film what are they where did they come what do they do these are all questions one asks oneself while watching story develop is asked find his own way while most come away with general idea what took place story each individual will have decide what it means them any way one decides answer these question results profound solutions its not left entirely up interpretation but some aspects it is experience it more clarification end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution while it is long film sometimes slows down it has be order accurately portray journey man its not subject that would have faired well shorter film faster paced feature those with short attention spans need not apply last but not least is epitome remorseless antagonist hal 9000 computer never has machine held such chilling screen presence which reminds me film with such profound ambition execution there is surprisingly little dialogue another sign kubricks genius all all one best films made date one very best science fiction films made personal favorite everyone must see this film at least once very highly recommended,0.5119298849298849,0.19401111851111857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,Cosmic Art,"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.""2001 ...

10.0,"My god, it's full of stars","For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (""like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?""), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.  '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different KINDS of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.

10.0,Tribute to one of the top 5 filmmakers of our time...,"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.",tribute one top 5 filmmakers our time,i write this review just after hearing stanley kubricks death its great loss i write about 2001 space odyssey because i feel it is consummate kubrick film one he will be most remembered it is picture like no other not only revolutionizing science fiction but changing way films are conceptualized it was probably americas first art film has inspired likes george lucas countless other writers directors aside its visual greatness reason film spawns so much discussion analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations it kubrick arthur c clarke his co writer had vision but we have never really found out what was going through their minds course skinny its message is how technology future will take over humanity decide course our lives unless we are careful 2001s ending is one hope version our rebirth through star childs flight back earth it is meaningless many but discerning filmgoers will understand although 2001 does not have wicked dark humor dr strangelove or clockwork orange or contain strong eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like paths glory or spartacus i still feel he wouldve liked be remembered most this if anything hal will be his most memorable character dangerous murderous artificial it was half decade making at time when hollywood was still churning out dull musicals just waking up new wave french italian cinema kubrick was maverick director who made great films his own terms his own time everyone else marvel at he will be missed,0.5615719696969697,0.16747159090909092,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,My brief review of the film,"A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue  the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover.

10.0,2001: A Mesmerising Odyssey,"To me, this is not only Kubrick's best film but also a milestone of the genre. It is quite long at around two and a quarter hours, and it is slow, that I agree with. But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't. Besides, and this is up to interpretation, but I think the slow pacing is deliberate, it adds to the haunting and eerie quality 2001 has and also to assimilate every shot which speak volumes, and also 2001's greatest strength is actually in the details.The story is somewhat abstract in its structure but is also quite complex, innovative and interesting yet has a simple message, and the screenplay and direction by Kubrick are superb. The acting is not the film's best asset, but it is good enough, with Douglas Rain the standout as the voice of HAL 9000 as he is really quite brilliant. Two things especially make 2001 so good. One are the visuals- even after all those years they are simply outstanding. The cinematography is indeed splendid, as are the colours and settings, but there are so many memorable images. The images of the giant Starchild floating through space and the tribe of apes painfully putting two and two together still resonate considerably even now. The other is the music. Coming from a big classical music enthusiast, I was delighted by the use of Also Sprach Zarathustra and On the Beautiful Blue Danube and how they combined with the visuals were exceedingly clever.Overall, this is a truly wonderful film that is worth seeing for the visuals and music alone and still continues to intrigue and perplex with the ending.

10.0,Greatest Movie of All Time,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time: 1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the hieght of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) The controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",greatest movie all time,instead writing paragraph ill give four good reasons why 2001 is greatest cinema experience all time 1 it is visual odyssey that could only be told big screen special effects that won kubrick his only oscar are most stunning effects before that age jurassic park t2 they allow kubrick give accurate or at least are most accurate depiction space travel date silence that fills space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science but also adds mood film be discussed later point with hal fact that kubrick shot moon scenes before apollo landing is gutsy yet fulfilling move many have said that upon its original release it was favorite trip movie i can think no other movie that has such amazing visuals its time even all time sorry phantom menace fans 2 kubricks directing style is terrific as all his films kubrick likes use his camera as means delve into psychology his characters plots his camera is not as mobile as other greats such as scorsese but instead sits watches narrative unfold faces are key element kubrick film like classic movies such as m touch evil kubrick focuses characters faces give audience psychological view point even he uses extreme close ups hals glowing red eye show coldness determination computerizd villain i could go but summation kubrick is at hieght his style 3 hal 9000 is one most villainous characters film history i whole heartedly agree with late gene siskles opinion hal 9000 most this film takes place space through use silence darkness space itself mood isolation is created dave his crewmen are isolated between earth jupiter with nowhere escape combine this mood with cold calculated actions hal 9000 you have most fearful villain imaginable i still although having see this film several times feel my chest tighten particular scene 4 controversial ending 2001 always turns people away this film instead trying give my opinion what it means what my idea 2001s meaning general is id like discuss fact that ending serves leave movie open ended kubrick has stated that he inteded make 2001 open discussion he left its meaning hands viewer by respecting audiences intelligence kubrick allowed his movie be beginning not end meaningful discussion mans past present future beauty 2001 is that ending need not mean anything deep it can just be purely plot driven explanation entire movie can be viewed as entertaining journey through space no other movie save great citizen kane leaves itself open discussion like 2001 it is truly meant be surreal journey that involves not only eye but mind instead waiting long lines phantom menace rent widescreen edition 2001 enjoy greatest cinematic experience,0.582595948827292,0.1441942075337598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...,"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...But ""2001"" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's, instead, a philosophical enigma, a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things, and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else...""2001"" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of thingsthe mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock's ""Psycho""), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!As a spectacle ""2001"" assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the ""Starchild"" returning home to charm the orb...""2001"" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...""2001"" is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question...

10.0,"If only one film makes it off this planet, it should be 2001.","If the Earth was about to blow up and I could choose only 1 film to survive us, it would definitely be this. What's funny is ""2001"" isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question ""what is the meaning of life?"", and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding ""black box"" that appears in the film, it remains exactly that: a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God & science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to ""get"" this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized.

10.0,Thought provoking and beautiful,"This definitely requires more than one viewing. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) not only boasts some of the most stunning cinematography and timeless special effects on film, but it has a story with so many layers that a revisit or two is mandatory if you even want to begin to understand it. The ending alone has been baffling people for over forty-five years. Another hundred could pass and there will still be discussions about this film.Just do yourself a favor, relax, and watch this. Don't expect lots of action or dialogue, or the sort of roller-coaster rides that science fiction movies have become.

10.0,Dare I Say Kubrick's Best Film?,"When it comes to discussing influential movies of all time, I'd call you crazy if you did not mention 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film influenced science fiction of the future, so without this film there would be no Star Wars. This film influenced the style of future directors like Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, whom are fantastic filmmakers. Not only is the film influential, it's also a great movie in general. When it was first released in 1968, it was met with mixed reviews. People saw a vision that has not been seen before, and they had no idea what to think of it. I read reports of walkouts at the premiere that occurred and those who remained complained of boredom. The film is deliberately slow-paced, but my interest was held over the duration of the film. I loved the film very much, but there are so many complicated ideas. Your brain is meant to be put to use because of all these abstract ideas. I've seen the film three times already, and I'm still not sure if I fully grasped all the concepts of the film. But the bottom line is 2001 is more concerned about inspiring our awe, not thrills.One of the big reasons why we are supposed to feel a sense of awe is the music itself. You know, originally the film had an original composition by Alex North. Director Stanley Kubrick had a back up soundtrack he used to help him with the editing process. The problem is (in North's case) the music just worked too damn well with the film to not use it. He used various classical compositions such as The Blue Danube and Also sprach Zarathustra composed by Richard Strauss. The music played a huge role in the film. I feel as if it was used as the main dialogue. There is some dialogue of course, but the music tells the story and pulls the emotional strings. Kubrick's film has no dialogue the first and final twenty minutes of the film. It is all music, and the placement is right on the money.It's hard to describe what this film is actually about. There is no single plot line. Instead, the film and its themes are about the evolution of mankind. There are four main segments to the film. The first part takes place in prehistoric times. A group of apes discovered this shiny black monolith which of course is made by intelligent beings of some kind. Somehow, the monolith convinced the apes were able to discover that bones could be used as weapons. The next section takes place a few millennia later, and this is where we have the famous docking scene played to the tune of The Blue Danube. We are given a sense of realism of the docking because of the deliberately slow pace. After the docking scene, we discover a second monolith which delivers us to the next segment involving the spaceship Discovery and its intelligent mind, HAL. The ship is on a mission of some kind, although we don't glimpse many details. The final segment is the famous Stargate sequence featuring astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) as he travels through some wormhole to some unexplained space.This is one of those rare films where acting does not matter. There are not many actors present after all. Sure, I guess you could call Dullea's performance good, but he doesn't seem to matter in the film. The computer system, HAL probably shows the most emotion of anyone in the film. His voice even sounds panicked when he realizes he is about to be unplugged for good. This is one of the early films to use the theme of man versus machine. HAL believes he has good intentions, but at the sake of the astronaut's lives. He has been holding back information and later on in the minds of the astronauts, he is believed to be the bad guy.Ah, now lets talk about the spectacle of the film. The visuals are amazing, even today after all these years. We are now in the digital age, where CGI looks consistently impressive (or in some cases, not at all). But the special effects, designed with the help of Douglas Trumbull, look very convincing because the film gives off an aura of being a documentary, and the effects follows suit. They just look very real for the setting they are in. The spaceship itself looks real and I loved the docking sequence. Towards the end, where we witness the vast amount of colors and the Star Child, I was basked in a glow of delight watching the effects come to life.What I like about all of Kubricks film is that they ask us deep questions. For example, this film concerns mankind and evolution. The film asks us who we are and what is life about. Kubrick never gave in to tell us what the film is about. He opened the film up for interpretation and every idea is a plausible idea, according to Kubrick. We are just not skin and bones, but we are intelligence. We live not on planet Earth, but amongst the stars. These are just some of the ideas Kubrick was trying to convey. There are many themes to get out of the movie, being such an abstract film.This is Kubrick's most ambitious and most likely his greatest film he has ever made. I loved his previous film, Dr. Strangelove but he reaches news heights with this film. This is not a narrative story in the common sense so if you've never seen this film, just heed my warning. I love how the movie opens up for debate/interpretation and to this day, people debate about the themes and just how influential the movie is. Featuring amazing visuals and musical cues, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest, most influential movies of all time.My Grade: A+",dare i say kubricks best film,when it comes discussing influential movies all time id call you crazy if you did not mention 2001 space odyssey this film influenced science fiction future so without this film there would be no star wars this film influenced style future directors like steven spielberg ridley scott whom are fantastic filmmakers not only is film influential its also great movie general when it was first released 1968 it was met with mixed reviews people saw vision that has not been seen before they had no idea what think it i read reports walkouts at premiere that occurred those who remained complained boredom film is deliberately slow paced but my interest was held over duration film i loved film very much but there are so many complicated ideas your brain is meant be put use because all these abstract ideas ive seen film three times already im still not sure if i fully grasped all concepts film but bottom line is 2001 is more concerned about inspiring our awe not thrills one big reasons why we are supposed feel sense awe is music itself you know originally film had original composition by alex north director stanley kubrick had back up soundtrack he used help him with editing process problem is norths case music just worked too damn well with film not use it he used various classical compositions such as blue danube also sprach zarathustra composed by richard strauss music played huge role film i feel as if it was used as main dialogue there is some dialogue course but music tells story pulls emotional strings kubricks film has no dialogue first final twenty minutes film it is all music placement is right money its hard describe what this film is actually about there is no single plot line instead film its themes are about evolution mankind there are four main segments film first part takes place prehistoric times group apes discovered this shiny black monolith which course is made by intelligent beings some kind somehow monolith convinced apes were able discover that bones could be used as weapons next section takes place few millennia later this is where we have famous docking scene played tune blue danube we are given sense realism docking because deliberately slow pace after docking scene we discover second monolith which delivers us next segment involving spaceship discovery its intelligent mind hal ship is mission some kind although we dont glimpse many details final segment is famous stargate sequence featuring astronaut dave bowman keir dullea as he travels through some wormhole some unexplained space this is one those rare films where acting does not matter there are not many actors present after all sure i guess you could call dulleas performance good but he doesnt seem matter film computer system hal probably shows most emotion anyone film his voice even sounds panicked when he realizes he is about be unplugged good this is one early films use theme man versus machine hal believes he has good intentions but at sake astronauts lives he has been holding back information later minds astronauts he is believed be bad guy ah now lets talk about spectacle film visuals are amazing even today after all these years we are now digital age where cgi looks consistently impressive or some cases not at all but special effects designed with help douglas trumbull look very convincing because film gives off aura being documentary effects follows suit they just look very real setting they are spaceship itself looks real i loved docking sequence towards end where we witness vast amount colors star child i was basked glow delight watching effects come life what i like about all kubricks film is that they ask us deep questions example this film concerns mankind evolution film asks us who we are what is life about kubrick never gave tell us what film is about he opened film up interpretation every idea is plausible idea according kubrick we are just not skin bones but we are intelligence we live not planet earth but amongst stars these are just some ideas kubrick was trying convey there are many themes get out movie being such abstract film this is kubricks most ambitious most likely his greatest film he has ever made i loved his previous film dr strangelove but he reaches news heights with this film this is not narrative story common sense so if youve never seen this film just heed my warning i love how movie opens up debate interpretation this day people debate about themes just how influential movie is featuring amazing visuals musical cues 2001 space odyssey is one greatest most influential movies all time my grade,0.5156167328042327,0.2264923791486291,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Solid cinematographic science fiction,"This film is unique and a very important influence for science fiction cinema.This film is very interpretive, which makes it very special and allows you to open your mind to develop and theorize the situations and events that are in the story, which is very different and reflects the creativity and originality of its creator, although it can be a little slow and it can stop a lot in the scenes, but that gives it a lot of realism and makes you feel like you're actually in space. Visually it's unique and spectacular, the use of practical visual effects and the way they look so real even though the technology wasn't that advanced at the time is something unique and not used to seeing nowadays, the sets are put together in an intelligent and very complete way, every detail is there, this makes the film feel very real. The music is fascinating, each moment has the perfect and memorable musicalization, functioning as one more character in the story, the character development is very complete. The beauty of this film is that you can interpret it as you want and create many theories that will be correct since this film is made for that, some of the things that this film represents are that technology can ruin us by abusing it so much, curiosity of the human being to know what there is in space is very great, and that this curiosity can lead us to our perdition or to transcend as a species, among other things. The production design is impressive and it really seems that you are in those places, the costumes are also very good and the conceptualization of the future is very successful since at present many things that the film exposes, today exist or are in the process of being created.It's a unique film, made with a lot of imagination but also with a lot of research and scientific precision, just like it's perfect in every cinematographic aspect there is and it's also a reference to all the science fiction movies that have been made since then, it's purely perfect.",solid cinematographic science fiction,this film is unique very important influence science fiction cinema this film is very interpretive which makes it very special allows you open your mind develop theorize situations events that are story which is very different reflects creativity originality its creator although it can be little slow it can stop lot scenes but that gives it lot realism makes you feel like youre actually space visually its unique spectacular use practical visual effects way they look so real even though technology wasnt that advanced at time is something unique not used seeing nowadays sets are put together intelligent very complete way every detail is there this makes film feel very real music is fascinating each moment has perfect memorable musicalization functioning as one more character story character development is very complete beauty this film is that you can interpret it as you want create many theories that will be correct since this film is made that some things that this film represents are that technology can ruin us by abusing it so much curiosity human being know what there is space is very great that this curiosity can lead us our perdition or transcend as species among other things production design is impressive it really seems that you are those places costumes are also very good conceptualization future is very successful since at present many things that film exposes today exist or are process being created its unique film made with lot imagination but also with lot research scientific precision just like its perfect every cinematographic aspect there is its also reference all science fiction movies that have been made since then its purely perfect,0.5914464285714286,0.36441964285714284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Kubrick's Masterpiece,"What can I really say about one of the greatest films of all time that hasn't been said already? The first time I saw it as a teenager I was left amazed at what I had seen but at the same time confused as to what it all meant. This was the first movie I saw that didn't spell everything out for me. It took time for me to learn to enjoy that. It's a beautiful film. I've heard it described as visual poetry and I think that is as accurate a way of putting it as anything else. The visuals are stunning. The special effects, sets, costumes are all first-rate. I recently watched it with my girlfriend who had never seen it and has tastes that are strictly mainstream. She was in awe of the look of the film, particularly given its age. Not enough good things can be said about Kubrick's use of classical music in this, as well. It's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it's received. Obviously a film that every serious film fan has to see. It might not be to everybody's tastes but it's an experience unlike any other and, in my opinion, worth repeated viewings.

10.0,Mesmerizing experience,"(r#54)Only Stanley Kubrick could create a film like 2001. It is unlike anything made before or after it and whether you like it or not, it is an unforgettable experience. I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance - I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images, from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series, movies, parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is, in every sense of the word: a masterpiece. Nothing is half-baked or average about 2001 - it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of movie-making itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (which were all far more accessible movies) after 2001, he couldn't top this: his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001 - it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact, neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film: It's all in the images and music, and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked, and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a super-intelligent computer called HAL-9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming, you must be some kind of super genius; as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie, ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible: vast, endless, dark, empty, and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space, but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull, Kubrick uses this to his advantage: the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary, working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer, and 2001 is the prime example of this: The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening, and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters, murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud, action-packed Star Wars-type adventure. The long periods of near-complete silence, the low-key dialogue, HAL's monotonous voice (a stroke of genius) and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers. The special effects are pitch-perfect, still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years, 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this (as well as many of his other films), the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies, give 2001 another chance. At first viewing, I thought it was tiresome and drawn out. At second viewing, it was the most perfect movie ever made. If you're open minded, this is for you, if Pirates of the Caribbean is your favourite movie of all time, it's not - and I don't say this to insult fans of Pirates, I'm just saying that this film might not be up your alley.I hope I don't sound too pretentious because I know how horrible many of 2001's rabid fans can be. I know for sure that it is not certain you'll enjoy 2001 - but I urge you to give it a chance. It is the ultimate acquired taste, and in my opinion, a masterpiece of epic proportions.",mesmerizing experience,r only stanley kubrick could create film like 2001 it is unlike anything made before or after it whether you like it or not it is unforgettable experience i urge anyone who disliked this film give it at least one more chance i can honestly say that film was way too far off wall me appreciate it first time i watched it 2001 is overflowing with iconic images opening scene accompanied by richard strauss thus spoke zarathustra bone being tossed into air by ape it has become such huge phenomenon that even today tv series movies parodies comics continue spoof it it is impossible hear blue danube without associating it kubricks masterpiece that is what it is every sense word masterpiece nothing is half baked or average about 2001 it is work enormous attention detail love art movie making itself although kubrick continued direct amazing movies like shining clockwork orange full metal jacket which were all far more accessible movies after 2001 he couldnt top this his crowning achievement its easy see how viewers may be put off by 2001 it doesnt follow usual movie formula where plot comes conclusion at end fact neither before nor after 2001 has movie been made same way plot line characters are more or less redundant this film its all images music what it all means i wont go into point 2001 since i havent read book i think it is up each viewer decide himself what it all means movie jumps very dawn mans use weapons time when space is heavily trafficked continues show us fate some unlucky astronauts at hands super intelligent computer called hal 9000 i wont spoil what happens end but i will say that if you could see it coming you must be some kind super genius as far as im concerned it is single least predictable ending movie ever kubrick is only director that i know who has portrayed space most realistic way possible vast endless dark empty soundless its admirable that director goes out his way make sure no sounds are heard space but rather than let this make movie dreary dull kubrick uses this his advantage chilling silence some scenes actually help build up atmosphere way that no movie has done before some scenes are outright scary working at almost subconscious level kubrick has always been master creating moods emotions with viewer 2001 is prime example this climactic scene bathroom is unbelievably frightening kubrick creates sense dread purely without monsters murderers or loud music its amazing movie is highly meditative definitely not one watch if you want loud action packed star wars type adventure long periods near complete silence low key dialogue hals monotonous voice stroke genius scattered pieces classical music set you state complete relaxation makes you think i realize this is highly personal will not work all viewers special effects are pitch perfect still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago while digital effects star wars prequels will be outdated 10 years 2001 will continue stun people with its shockingly realistic believable effects although i would have preferred kubrick win best director oscar this as well as many his other films best effects award is completely deserved 2001 still beats many todays movies terms best effects if youve grown tired mediocre movies give 2001 another chance at first viewing i thought it was tiresome drawn out at second viewing it was most perfect movie ever made if youre open minded this is you if pirates caribbean is your favourite movie all time its not i dont say this insult fans pirates im just saying that this film might not be up your alley i hope i dont sound too pretentious because i know how horrible many 2001s rabid fans can be i know sure that it is not certain youll enjoy 2001 but i urge you give it chance it is ultimate acquired taste my opinion masterpiece epic proportions,0.5713133394383391,0.14682234432234426,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Dueling Gods,"Spoilers herein.Since the disaster of `Sparticus.' Kubrick has centered each project on the mysteries of the narrative. Each film explores some theory or notion about the paths of storytelling and the fragility of those paths. Some get very abstract, like `Barry Lyndon,' where identities are adopted and plowed into nature. Some are rather simple, like `Shining' where the building is the author and teller of the story. But this is the most fun and in many ways the most interesting.Here we have three warring gods. Each might be the one who has created this reality or part of it. Each might be the liar who is telling the story. None can be trusted, or can they? The three are the `real' reality in which we live, but that of course may be completely unfettered by any logic. In the sequel, Clarke has this reality subject to jingoistic forces. The new gods in the equation are two:An extraterrestrial force. It may have even made us and how we see. It may have made all the reality we see as well. It is incomprehensible and capable folding time and consciousness. It may have made the story we are seeing.Dueling with it are humans and HAL. HAL is a machine with reasoning skills beyond that of humans. Thrust into this aether of creation, it may have gained extra powers over what is real and what is not. It may be at odds with the humans or the aliens. It may not be, in fact the aliens may be machines and see HAL and siblings as the point of their efforts. HAL sometimes seems human, sometimes reason itself (Dr. Spock is the palest of imitations), sometimes in cahoots with either or both camps.HAL might be telling us the story, a point underscored by his camera eye. We can't trust anything we see. But along the way, we see some pretty impressive things. It it hard to describe today when every third movie has a spaceship. But when this appeared, there was nothing at all like it.

8.0,The Biggest Fast Forward,"What the meaning of the black monolith is in 2001: A Space Odyssey has been puzzling moviegoers for generations. I confess I haven't any better idea than any of the others who have written on this board. I guess Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke wanted everyone to make their own evaluation. A little more evidence could have helped.The awesome visual affects of 2001 for which the film won its only Oscar in 1968 have blinded a lot of viewers to the ultimate incomprehensibility of the plot. That big black rock means something a whole lot different to the prehistoric caveman than to the futuristic astronauts. To one it means power, the other understanding. It's like some all powerful creator has left this touchstone for mankind to take another leap forward.The film begins with the cave people who are struggling to survive against animal creatures who are better equipped than they are for dominance. But contact with the rock, so glaringly out of place from the surroundings awakens the latent intelligence in the cave folk and they stage a comeback against their foes. It's the beginning of man's dominance.In the biggest fast forward in screen history, we are now in the future and another of these things has been discovered on a moon of Jupiter, the first sign of intelligent life away from earth. Scientists Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood and three other scientists in cryogenic suspension are sent to investigate. Remember we haven't discovered warp drive yet. Civilization may have taken too far a leap forward because these guys are in the hands of an all powerful computer named HAL who controls the ship and their very lives by definition. What's supposed to be a tool for man now is his dominator.When man does come in contact with that monolith on a Jupiter moon, my own interpretation is that the contact represents an all powerful creator telling man to reflect on what he has achieved and to warn him to not go too fast forward in the future. The monoliths represent signposts, like checkpoints in a race to God only knows what end.I'm always leery of rating a film like 2001 too high when the plot is so vague and speculative. But the special effects and Kubrick's use of classical music to create that space ballet just so dwarf the human beings involved, in effect the film itself is a warning. And all that music was in the public domain so MGM didn't have to lay out big bucks for a composer. I always favor story over spectacle which is why I can never give 2001: A Space Odyssey the highest rating. But when the spectacle is as awesome as what Stanley Kubrick gives us, you just sit there amazed.Of course 2001 came and went and instead of reaching for the rest of the solar system and beyond, mankind regressed into barbarism with the most notable event being a planned massed murder. Mankind needs to touch the monolith and make another leap forward. Maybe Kubrick should have looked farther ahead and called his film, 2101: A Space Odyssey.I hope we touch the monolith before that.",biggest fast forward,what meaning black monolith is 2001 space odyssey has been puzzling moviegoers generations i confess i havent any better idea than any others who have written this board i guess stanley kubrick arthur clarke wanted everyone make their own evaluation little more evidence could have helped awesome visual affects 2001 which film won its only oscar 1968 have blinded lot viewers ultimate incomprehensibility plot that big black rock means something whole lot different prehistoric caveman than futuristic astronauts one it means power other understanding its like some all powerful creator has left this touchstone mankind take another leap forward film begins with cave people who are struggling survive against animal creatures who are better equipped than they are dominance but contact with rock so glaringly out place surroundings awakens latent intelligence cave folk they stage comeback against their foes its beginning mans dominance biggest fast forward screen history we are now future another these things has been discovered moon jupiter first sign intelligent life away earth scientists keir dullea gary lockwood three other scientists cryogenic suspension are sent investigate remember we havent discovered warp drive yet civilization may have taken too far leap forward because these guys are hands all powerful computer named hal who controls ship their very lives by definition whats supposed be tool man now is his dominator when man does come contact with that monolith jupiter moon my own interpretation is that contact represents all powerful creator telling man reflect what he has achieved warn him not go too fast forward future monoliths represent signposts like checkpoints race god only knows what end im always leery rating film like 2001 too high when plot is so vague speculative but special effects kubricks use classical music create that space ballet just so dwarf human beings involved effect film itself is warning all that music was public domain so mgm didnt have lay out big bucks composer i always favor story over spectacle which is why i can never give 2001 space odyssey highest rating but when spectacle is as awesome as what stanley kubrick gives us you just sit there amazed course 2001 came went instead reaching rest solar system beyond mankind regressed into barbarism with most notable event being planned massed murder mankind needs touch monolith make another leap forward maybe kubrick should have looked farther ahead called his film 2101 space odyssey i hope we touch monolith before that,0.5409291521486645,0.1950319396051103,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.01, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.47}"
