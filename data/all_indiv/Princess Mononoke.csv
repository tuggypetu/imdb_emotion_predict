10.0,one of the best films i've ever had the chance to see,"Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke!

10.0,Allegory on the balance between humans and nature,"This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war. The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards. The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance. But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance. The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy. The story is not easy to understand. It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore. And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted. Japanese television documented a lot of the production. The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work). Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that. His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute. There is no other animation like it. This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",allegory balance between humans nature,this seems be miyazakes most personal work clearly serious design it is set imaginary time which blends time ancient gods shinto style gods place nature with settlement humans coming metalworking war world is not balance distant conflict between industry nature has wounded one gods forest which is then killed by sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards evil controlling it transfers him beginning slow takeover he must journey origin conflict find way cure himself incidentally as he will learn try restore balance but this is not simplistic tale he finds there are other characters play there is good evil everyone no easy balance princess hime story is mysterious human who has been raised by wolves which are themselves powerful forest gods little reminiscent amerindian coyote myth who becomes both his ally his enemy story is not easy understand it has many japanese mythic elements but even then it is work miyazakes unique imagination is not intended be simple or have clean resolution animation is spectacular unusual with new elements even miyazake marks new departure style which you can see continued his next film sen chihiro more nature more wild more jamming elements japanese myth folklore continuing trend be more personal concerned with ethics character less sci fi there are at least half dozen well developed characters threaded through story their animation is wonderful displaying subtle character original japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing draws upon some best talent available voices japan miyazake is universally known this was masterpiece carefully crafted japanese television documented lot production english translation drew some good talent but they seem not have gotten it quite so intensely as japanese crew if you havent seen miyazake give it try but maybe look at sen chihiro first or even laputa or kikis delivery service easier lighter introduction his work some say he is japanese disney but i dont like that his work has depth sophistication that goes beyond disney cute there is no other animation like it this is truly adult work children might like some visuals but i doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about even adults will get more out this each time you see it again,0.4652705627705628,0.1251010101010101,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.55}"
10.0,"Breathtaking. Watch with ""eyes unclouded.""","In its theatrical Japanese release of 1997, PRINCESS MONONOKE was the hugest box office grossing movie of all time in the land of the Rising Sun until it was overtaken by James Cameron's TITANIC, and, four years later, director Hayao Miyazaki's own SPIRITED AWAY. No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real ""hero"" or ""villain"") trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.This is not a movie for young children, as there are disturbing shots of decapitations, amputations, and occasional blood spurts. Sometimes these elements of violence turn squeamish viewers away from Anime (especially when they're done gratuitously), but Hayao Miyazaki presents it not to sicken people but to show it for the horror that it is (plus, in this film, the violence is not overdone). Take, for example, the scene where the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka of the Emishi Tribe, possessed by a curse he received from killing a Demon God (in trying to protect his village), tries to stop samurai attacking innocent people, and in doing so shoots the arms off of one man, and, later, takes off a man's head with two arrows. The sight is horrifying to see, but the deed also increases Ashitaka's demon mark on his arm, which is slowly preparing to take his life. This is a truly horrible depiction about the dangers of violence.Also worth noting is Princess Mononoke herself, a human girl named San raised by the Animal Gods, and her struggle against Lady Eboshi of Iron Town, who is destroying the forest merely for her people's own good (the folks are outcasts, including lepers and prostitutes). San distrusts and despises all humans, and is especially determined to destroy them all (particularly Eboshi)... or die trying. When she's rescued by Ashitaka, however, a conflict within her begins to surface: are *all* humans evil, or is there at least one who is trustworthy? If there is any character who could be considered a villain, it would be the monk, Jigo, who wants the head of the Spirit of the Forest to bring to the Emperor. Such a deed would destroy the entire forest (as we find out in the film's chilling climactic scenes) but even Jigo has his own motives, too. He is not so much evil as much as he is just ""trying to get by"". This pretty much sums up the conflicts between all our characters here.PRINCESS MONONOKE may not have enjoyed similar box office success here in America, but at least a lot of work and care went into the translation. As with Disney's other English language tracks for Miyazaki's films, this one is very, very well done. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman worked on the script, rewording it only to a) fit the mouth flaps, and b) make it understandable to a non-Japanese audience who would probably not comprehend a lot of the cultural nuances found in this film. Added to which, the voice cast includes a commendable list of stars; Billy Crudup is perfect as Ashitaka, eliciting just the right amount of warmth, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and courage, while Claire Danes delivers passionately angry, conflicted turmoil to San. (Folks said she was miscast, but I beg to differ; her character is *required* to be outraged and aggressive, and Danes does have a strong voice to carry such emotions.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (a grossly underrated performance; his Southern drawl adds to the character), Minnie Driver (elegant choice!) as Lady Eboshi, Gillian Anderson as the Wolf-Goddess Moro, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as the friendly (if no-nonsense style) worker Toki. The translation flows smoothly to those who are not familiar with Japanese folk tales, and the story succeeds in making its point, too.This movie may not be for everybody, as it is the kind of film that may disturb young children, but older audiences will find themselves absorbed in the artwork, which showcases gorgeous, unmatched imagination, from the finely detailed forests to the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will to the Forest Spirit itself -- a huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes. And at night he becomes a ghostly specter known as the Nightwalker, traveling higher than the trees. Such images warrant the purchase of this film. Better yet, its message is not too preachy, and rarely do animated movies (save those from Japan) showcase characters portrayed as, well, human beings.",breathtaking watch with eyes unclouded,its theatrical japanese release 1997 princess mononoke was hugest box office grossing movie all time land rising sun until it was overtaken by james camerons titanic four years later director hayao miyazakis own spirited away no wonder this movie like earlier project miyazakis nausicaa valley wind explores mans relationship with nature hatred causing destruction more importantly real characters other words no real hero or villain trying get by world continually torn by war this is not movie young children as there are disturbing shots decapitations amputations occasional blood spurts sometimes these elements violence turn squeamish viewers away anime especially when theyre done gratuitously but hayao miyazaki presents it not sicken people but show it horror that it is plus this film violence is not overdone take example scene where protagonist prince ashitaka emishi tribe possessed by curse he received killing demon god trying protect his village tries stop samurai attacking innocent people doing so shoots arms off one man later takes off mans head with two arrows sight is horrifying see but deed also increases ashitakas demon mark his arm which is slowly preparing take his life this is truly horrible depiction about dangers violence also worth noting is princess mononoke herself human girl named san raised by animal gods her struggle against lady eboshi iron town who is destroying forest merely her peoples own good folks are outcasts including lepers prostitutes san distrusts despises all humans is especially determined destroy them all particularly eboshi or die trying when shes rescued by ashitaka however conflict within her begins surface are all humans evil or is there at least one who is trustworthy if there is any character who could be considered villain it would be monk jigo who wants head spirit forest bring emperor such deed would destroy entire forest as we find out films chilling climactic scenes but even jigo has his own motives too he is not so much evil as much as he is just trying get by this pretty much sums up conflicts between all our characters here princess mononoke may not have enjoyed similar box office success here america but at least lot work care went into translation as with disneys other english language tracks miyazakis films this one is very very well done acclaimed writer neil gaiman worked script rewording it only fit mouth flaps b make it understandable non japanese audience who would probably not comprehend lot cultural nuances found this film added which voice cast includes commendable list stars billy crudup is perfect as ashitaka eliciting just right amount warmth kindness compassion wisdom courage while claire danes delivers passionately angry conflicted turmoil san folks said she was miscast but i beg differ her character is required be outraged aggressive danes does have strong voice carry such emotions rest cast includes billy bob thornton as jigo grossly underrated performance his southern drawl adds character minnie driver elegant choice as lady eboshi gillian anderson as wolf goddess moro jada pinkett smith as friendly if no nonsense style worker toki translation flows smoothly those who are not familiar with japanese folk tales story succeeds making its point too this movie may not be everybody as it is kind film that may disturb young children but older audiences will find themselves absorbed artwork which showcases gorgeous unmatched imagination finely detailed forests cute little tree spirits who appear disappear at will forest spirit itself huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes at night he becomes ghostly specter known as nightwalker traveling higher than trees such images warrant purchase this film better yet its message is not too preachy rarely do animated movies save those japan showcase characters portrayed as well human beings,0.514566838783706,0.07545037292025243,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Absolutely breathtaking!,"Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time, and is up there with Studio Ghibli's best along with Spirited Away. I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",absolutely breathtaking,princess mononoke is one best animated movies i have seen long time is up there with studio ghiblis best along with spirited away i will say i am probably biased as i am huge studio ghibli fan love all their films i even like cat returns which along with pompoko is considered as one weaker ghibli efforts animation princess mononoke is absolutely stunning with rich detailed backgrounds brilliant character animation image stag actually made my jaw drop music is fantastic as well although environmentalism is subject matter very difficult get right what filmmakers succeeded doing was making highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded not being preachy at all film is also helped by high calibre vocal talents minnie driver claire danes billy bob thornton et al voicing quite remarkable characters strong script true some images like demon worm may frighten younger viewers but it is fair say they were very powerful all all princess mononoke is breathtaking i recommend it highly 10 10 bethany cox,0.6700821018062397,0.3728407224958949,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,Very touching movie!,"The first time I saw Princess Mononoke I was completely moved and surprised. Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn't a ""they all lived naively ever after"" film. There were no complete ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki's films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka's romance and Moro's views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.Like many Miyazaki movies, the animation (as always) is wonderful and nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine Disney films lack (thank goodness for Studio Ghibli). The music was beautiful and well suited to the movie.The only predicament to the movie is that it is a bit downbeat and does not contain much happy laughter (oh well, I can watch My Neighbor Totoro - also a good movie - for happy laughter.).10/10 - And my favourite movie of all time.",very touching movie,first time i saw princess mononoke i was completely moved surprised since it was studio ghibli film dubbed by disney i liked fact that it wasnt they all lived naively ever after film there were no complete good or bad guys even lady eboshi most antagonist character movie had reasonable motive trying get rid animal gods cutting down forest although it her actions were environmentally damaging wrong general she did it help her people survive which is what all species earth strive another wonderful aspect plot is that it sends message protect earth all will survive peace message either discreetly or strongly portrayed many miyazakis films perhaps portrayal this message tiny hint san ashitakas romance moros views nature was what made film so touching me like many miyazaki movies animation as always is wonderful nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine disney films lack thank goodness studio ghibli music was beautiful well suited movie only predicament movie is that it is bit downbeat does not contain much happy laughter oh well i can watch my neighbor totoro also good movie happy laughter 10 10 my favourite movie all time,0.6904214559386974,0.30095785440613027,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.14}"
10.0,Enthralling and Artistic,"Studio Ghibli has been Japan's leading anime Production Company since the 1980's, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic ""Princess Mononoke"".The film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe's wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka's efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side's bid for allegiance.""Princess Mononoke"" is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki's best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, ""Mononoke"" has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters' nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli's other works, which were aimed mostly at children.Of course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film's wonder, because Miyazaki's true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of ""Princess Mononoke"" is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi's music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.Overwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg's ""E.T."", ""Princess Mononoke"" became Japan's No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion.

10.0,A masterpiece,"Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by animation, I watched way too many cartoons and would often drawn them myself. I never thought of animation as ""real art"" or anything fancy, just one of life's simple pleasures. Sure Disney had made some ground-breaking animated features, and technology was allowing for more and more detailed and intricate animation techniques, but no animated film had ever moved me as much as a Godfather or Unforgiven or Dr. Strangelove, that is until one fine day in 1999. I was in high school, and Princess Mononoke was premiering at the Coolidge Theater in Brookline, I was pumped as I really enjoyed Castle in the Sky and Totoro, so I went to the theater with a few friends and was absolutely clown away for this. This film is so spectacular in almost every way and every piece comes together perfectly. The animation is top-notch, not that shoddy 1980's anime style, but the mind-blowing animation techniques that made Miyazaki the maestro his is today. The score by Joe Hisaishi is tremendous, though at times it may seem a bit overly dramatic (I mean this is an animated feature, not Lawrence of Arabia), but this is the ultimate animated epic, so it fits in well. The plot is dense and the characters are well-developed, there are no true ""good"" or ""bad"" guys in this film...and Miyazaki includes his favorite underlying theme of Man vs. Nature throughout.

10.0,One of the best in history,"When I first saw 'Princess Mononoke' on Christmas eve back in 2006 I was 10 years old and couldn't really follow the story since I was quite disturbed from the explicit graphic content. Especially the giant pig suffering of a demonic disease scared the hell out of me back than. But never less is knew that this movie is something special, something I have never seen before. Since then I became a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and watched nearly everything they have produced. But still 'Princess Mononoke' stands out to me as their best work and to me is Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece. The topic of this movie is just as simple as complex. It's the fight between human culture coming with the technologic industry versus the nature and its variety of animals living in it and to this day it's a pretty relevant topic. The way both sides are portraied in this movie is just beautiful. Miyazaki manages to show both sides with all their strength and weaknesses. There's no good side or bad side. Instead every side can be understood by the viewer and even if you don't agree with their opinions you still are able to see why each side acts like they do. The visual work is top notch like always with Studio Ghibli. I love how they create a feeling for nature as one whole organism. I really recommend everyone to go watch this movie.

9.0,Studio Ghibli Fest 2018,"I'm so thrilled that I decided to watch Princess Mononoke for the first time ever on the big screen. Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence.

8.0,"""The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away"".","A difficult story to follow and decidedly scary animation at times makes this more an adult film than one for younger fans. It's not too hard to follow in the early going but when the hero Ashitaki makes his way East to the land of the Forest Spirit he's faced with choices that put him on questionable sides of relationships already formed. While trying to save his own life endangered by a poisonous encounter with the boar demon Nago, his overriding mission is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hate'. For this he must valiantly strive to understand the motivations and prerogatives of those he meets, including monk Jigo, Lady Eboshi of Irontown and the wolf princess San, a human raised by wolves. In turn, each of these individuals comes to understand that good and evil are not mutually exclusive character traits, but exist in all to varying degrees. The way this all plays out can be confusing and is not made easier by the depiction of characters like Moro, the large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider a male, but in actuality is the mother of San. It's an intricately woven tale and loyal fans of anime will find it spellbinding, though I must admit, for myself it took a concerted effort to follow and understand.",forest spirit gives life takes life away,difficult story follow decidedly scary animation at times makes this more adult film than one younger fans its not too hard follow early going but when hero ashitaki makes his way east land forest spirit hes faced with choices that put him questionable sides relationships already formed while trying save his own life endangered by poisonous encounter with boar demon nago his overriding mission is see with eyes unclouded by hate this he must valiantly strive understand motivations prerogatives those he meets including monk jigo lady eboshi irontown wolf princess san human raised by wolves turn each these individuals comes understand that good evil are not mutually exclusive character traits but exist all varying degrees way this all plays out can be confusing is not made easier by depiction characters like moro large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider male but actuality is mother san its intricately woven tale loyal fans anime will find it spellbinding though i must admit myself it took concerted effort follow understand,0.5557539682539683,-0.0746693121693122,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.47}"

Even with the language barrier, the film is of such intense emotion that it caries you through to the end.

10.0,mind-shattering anime; my favorite of Miyazaki's films,"Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends.",mind shattering anime my favorite miyazakis films,some might watch princess mononoke find ambiguity at times its goes beyond formula into something that challenged me interplay between forces nature where sometimes seemingly good side is not what it seems until bigger darker picture comes into view its purely imaginative effort with level dramatic more over cinematic power that id compare with kurosawa level princess mononoke its uncompromising way details violence without pulling away while also being rather anti violent process it is also hard pinpoint any one level visually its got so much going practically experience abstractions that hayao miyazaki folds up into rest story story itself trails along with best epic fantasy with this crucial earth shattering quest that works that level action adventure possibly more adults despite pg 13 rating here states as well as mythological side things some have written that it is bit complex film structure storytelling bordering confusing i would disagree though i can see what they mean you have pay closer attention than usual more american films but more profound level if one could call it such its really not hard follow hero film interesting enough is type tragic hero though with one clear sight amid chaos two sides he encounters peace he is cursed by sort wormy jelly demon that runs unyielding darker recesses world he searches something rid him his scars while human side at some points mostly dominated by women impressed or against his skills with those wolves other side title character is part latter though also human bringing little more underlying symbolism with character then there are also boars ready destroy humans even their demise amid battles that rage leading significance certain deer god as centerpiece balance forests civilizations not too much is made explicit at same time side taken by cursed hero is even questioned by one character with that part connected with others story trumps what could have been kind smothering over symbolic representation into what is necessary spectacular about film fact i would estimate just near bravery what miyazaki is achieving film its one best films its kind its kind this case is animated film that breaks conventions typical good vs evil logic many times suddenness things had me wide eyed each creature or little variance creations both good evil are elaborated with out compromise digitally animated worm jelly type monsters are some more memorable ones be sure as they book end picture different extraordinary ways climax particular probably ranks with best last decade or so tiny bobble headed alien creatures are also delight as they rattle gather multiply flee all around this is kind scene that is dream like truly weird bright sensibility many scenes that have more that samurai movie quality them again kurosawa are extremely well done their own as then they become mixed around again with fantasy elements say that film is really family film might be not entirely accurate as some battle attack footage is pretty graphic its own ways if not as much as other more adult anime like fist north star or ninja scroll there are even moments i would say that had i been little watching some more twisted macabre scenes i might have cried it but this is credit miyazaki his studio ghibli older kids this could mark as something that is indeed foreign their expectations at least american ones it is work art not just animation that takes chances isnt afraid go right twists leaps creation at same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing its film i cant wait see again likely my favorite filmmakers too with same cinematic drive as other works ive seen but reaching ambitious heights it intends,0.5303124027388733,0.13582516339869277,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.47}"

,Not perfect but still wonderful,"When he is touching by a demon while defending his village, Ashitaka is sent out to the West, from where the crazed demon originated, seeking a cure for the demon infection that will otherwise kill him. However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Town's iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of it's trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that. This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness. The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai). However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away. The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it. The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying. I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters. However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka. Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her. Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast. Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast. I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast. Driver is OK but her character wasn't. Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work. Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added). Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai. Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki. It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is! It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids' animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of it's weaknesses. The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices aren't that good. The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story.

9.0,A Film Animal Lovers Will Love: Respect Nature For It Can Destroy You.,"Princess Mononoke is a grand, beautifully animated, heartfelt epic. It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.What I like the most about Princess Mononoke is beyond all of these wonderfully delivered elements of a great movie. It's a movie about compassion and understanding towards animals. Yes, these animals are represented by gargantuan, violent beasts, but the movie is about human headstrong influence vs. animal outlook, sense, and behaviorism. It's about how astonishingly much more acute and attuned an animal's understanding is of the world's natural order than that of a human's.I think Princess Mononoke, while being a beautifully made action-adventure, it's an important film, especially for Miyazaki's younger fans.

10.0,"""Why are you here?"" ""To see with eyes unclouded by hate.""","'Princess Mononoke' is, quite frankly, one of the greatest animated films of all time. It's a classic, filled with terrific, eye-popping imagery, complex characters, and it is truly powerful in its dramatic impact. I came close to tears by the film's end.The first thing you will notice about 'Mononoke' is the animation. Animation god Hayao Miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors and bizarre fantasy creatures (personal favorite: Ashitaka's deer/horse steed Yakul). It's a far cry from the increasingly cheap animation we have in America. The movie is ambitious in its scale, and there are some truly magnificent set-pieces, like the near-apocalyptic ending.Also of particular note is the story. These characters and this plot are not black-and-white. Lady Eboshi may be cutting down the forests and angering the gods, but she truly believes it will help her people; she shows compassion to outsiders like lepers and prostitutes, and her regret at Ashitaka's cursed arm is sincere (she did, after all, cause the boar god's madness). San, the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title, has shades of gray, too: Yes, we sympathize with her desire to protect the forest, but she is not innocent of bloodshed. Even Jigo, a con man/priest who wants the Forest Spirit's head for the Emperor (which is obviously a bad idea), has his reasons for committing what may be considered ""evil"".The English voice cast has divided people, but I liked it. Billy Crudup brings gravity and stoicism to Ashitaka, and Claire Danes is appropriately fierce as San. The standouts, however, lie in the supporting cast. Minnie Driver is perfect as Eboshi, bringing wit and elegance to the role; Gillian Anderson breaks from her Scully persona to deliver a powerful performance as ancient wolf god Moro; Keith David, one of America's most underrated actors, rules as the boar god Okkoto, and Billy Bob Thornton is very funny as Jigo. Thornton's Southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans, but I think it adds to the character's charm.'Princess Mononoke' is a masterpiece. To find a flaw in this movie is impossible.",why are you here see with eyes unclouded by hate,princess mononoke is quite frankly one greatest animated films all time its classic filled with terrific eye popping imagery complex characters it is truly powerful its dramatic impact i came close tears by films end first thing you will notice about mononoke is animation animation god hayao miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors bizarre fantasy creatures personal favorite ashitakas deer horse steed yakul its far cry increasingly cheap animation we have america movie is ambitious its scale there are some truly magnificent set pieces like near apocalyptic ending also particular note is story these characters this plot are not black white lady eboshi may be cutting down forests angering gods but she truly believes it will help her people she shows compassion outsiders like lepers prostitutes her regret at ashitakas cursed arm is sincere she did after all cause boar gods madness san princess mononoke title has shades gray too yes we sympathize with her desire protect forest but she is not innocent bloodshed even jigo con man priest who wants forest spirits head emperor which is obviously bad idea has his reasons committing what may be considered evil english voice cast has divided people but i liked it billy crudup brings gravity stoicism ashitaka claire danes is appropriately fierce as san standouts however lie supporting cast minnie driver is perfect as eboshi bringing wit elegance role gillian anderson breaks her scully persona deliver powerful performance as ancient wolf god moro keith david one americas most underrated actors rules as boar god okkoto billy bob thornton is very funny as jigo thorntons southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans but i think it adds characters charm princess mononoke is masterpiece find flaw this movie is impossible,0.6137426900584796,0.11805555555555557,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.3}"

7.0,Japanese Cartoon Classic,"On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime.While Americans rarely see much for cartoons beyond the world of Walt Disney (or perhaps Don Bluth), we can thank fantasy author Neil Gaiman for getting this Japanese film properly released in the states. Between ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"", there is much to be seen in the way of Japanese animation beyond the omnipresent anime.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke ""a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year."" He is not alone in that sentiment. Almost twenty years later, the film has not decreased in its critical praise.",japanese cartoon classic,journey find cure tatarigamis curse ashitaka finds himself middle war between forest gods tatara mining colony this quest he also meets san mononoke hime while americans rarely see much cartoons beyond world walt disney or perhaps don bluth we can thank fantasy author neil gaiman getting this japanese film properly released states between princess mononoke spirited away there is much be seen way japanese animation beyond omnipresent anime roger ebert chicago sun times called princess mononoke great achievement wonderful experience one best films year he is not alone that sentiment almost twenty years later film has not decreased its critical praise,0.38229166666666664,0.2729166666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,A beautiful blend of an adventure and fairytale.,"You really don't have to be into anime to appreciate some of the movies that the genre has to offer. Some of them are being simply so good and captivating that basically everybody should be able to get grabbed by it. And I feel that this is one of those movies, that is being a great blend of adventure and fairytale elements.It's really a movie that speaks to your imagination. It's set in a fantasy world, that still feels and looks a lot like our world and the movie is literally loaded with some great and impressive looking fantasy creatures, with the one even bigger and more amazing than the other. In essence this is a mankind versus nature type of movie, in which nature does a lot of fighting back! I can definitely see how ""Avatar"" got 'inspired' by this movie and it features some similar themes and at times also a similar type of atmosphere in it. And I should say though that I liked this movie far better than ""Avatar""! The themes worked out better and were overall more effective and as a whole the story of this movie worked out more pleasantly.I should admit though that the movie can get quite hard to follow at times, will all of its things that are happening and characters that are in it. But this is a 'problem' I have with basically every anime and it very rarely ever ruins the movie experience for me, so it's no complaint or problem really. The movie has some great strong characters in it that can hold their own, amidst all of the great and powerful looking creatures in this movie. And there really are a whole bunch of characters in this movie but this never becomes anything distracting and the movie also never looses its focus. All thanks to some great storytelling skills of course, by Hayao Miyazaki.The animations are absolutely great looking and help to give the movie a great and effective fantasy atmosphere. What I also like about it is that's being such an easy thing to exaggerated things when your animation it, especially all of the action but everything in this movie feels 'real' and doesn't goes over-the-top with things, despite the presence of lots of fantasy elements and characters in it.Another thing worth mentioning is the musical score by Joe Hisaishi. Some great stuff!Whether you like anime or not, this is a great fantasy-adventure movie for everybody, everywhere!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.nl/",beautiful blend adventure fairytale,you really dont have be into anime appreciate some movies that genre has offer some them are being simply so good captivating that basically everybody should be able get grabbed by it i feel that this is one those movies that is being great blend adventure fairytale elements its really movie that speaks your imagination its set fantasy world that still feels looks lot like our world movie is literally loaded with some great impressive looking fantasy creatures with one even bigger more amazing than other essence this is mankind versus nature type movie which nature does lot fighting back i can definitely see how avatar got inspired by this movie it features some similar themes at times also similar type atmosphere it i should say though that i liked this movie far better than avatar themes worked out better were overall more effective as whole story this movie worked out more pleasantly i should admit though that movie can get quite hard follow at times will all its things that are happening characters that are it but this is problem i have with basically every anime it very rarely ever ruins movie experience me so its no complaint or problem really movie has some great strong characters it that can hold their own amidst all great powerful looking creatures this movie there really are whole bunch characters this movie but this never becomes anything distracting movie also never looses its focus all thanks some great storytelling skills course by hayao miyazaki animations are absolutely great looking help give movie great effective fantasy atmosphere what i also like about it is thats being such easy thing exaggerated things when your animation it especially all action but everything this movie feels real doesnt goes over top with things despite presence lots fantasy elements characters it another thing worth mentioning is musical score by joe hisaishi some great stuff whether you like anime or not this is great fantasy adventure movie everybody everywhere 9 10,0.5768181818181819,0.36769696969696974,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.4}"
