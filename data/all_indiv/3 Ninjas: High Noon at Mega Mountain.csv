2.0,High Noon at Mega Suck-fest,"First off, this is a kids movie so certain allowances should be made for its rubbishness. But I expect that the majority of 7 year olds would find High Noon an unrewarding and painful experience.The film concerns a group of extremely unscary baddies who decide that world domination can be best achieved by hijacking an amusement park. Two things prevent the villains from carrying out their evil plan. Firstly, the bad guys find themselves easily defeated at every turn by three children and Hulk Hogan. Secondly, those aforementioned bad guys are morons.The three children are, of course, the 3 Ninjas. They defeat fully grown men in martial art combat at every turn. Particularly remarkable, since one of the kids appears to be about four years old. Of especial note is the second youngest as he sports a haircut that is so abysmally misguided it makes Billy Ray Cyrus's mullet look tasteful. It is a bowl-cut/pony-tail combo; two haircuts from hell all on one head - it is truly horrendous and should really not be seen by younger viewers.An interesting aspect of the movie is that despite the fact that the fairground has been hijacked, no one seems to have informed the extras. They carry on enjoying the rides as if nothing has happened. As I said earlier, the bad guys are essentially idiots, so its just possible that they have not got their heads round the technicalities of hijacking. But, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter as the film is not exactly convincing in a general sense.Do I recommend it? Not really but it is an ideal birthday present for a child you dislike.",high noon at mega suck fest,first off this is kids movie so certain allowances should be made its rubbishness but i expect that majority 7 year olds would find high noon unrewarding painful experience film concerns group extremely unscary baddies who decide that world domination can be best achieved by hijacking amusement park two things prevent villains carrying out their evil plan firstly bad guys find themselves easily defeated at every turn by three children hulk hogan secondly those aforementioned bad guys are morons three children are course 3 ninjas they defeat fully grown men martial art combat at every turn particularly remarkable since one kids appears be about four years old especial note is second youngest as he sports haircut that is so abysmally misguided it makes billy ray cyruss mullet look tasteful it is bowl cut pony tail combo two haircuts hell all one head it is truly horrendous should really not be seen by younger viewers interesting aspect movie is that despite fact that fairground has been hijacked no one seems have informed extras they carry enjoying rides as if nothing has happened as i said earlier bad guys are essentially idiots so its just possible that they have not got their heads round technicalities hijacking but at end day it doesnt matter as film is not exactly convincing general sense do i recommend it not really but it is ideal birthday present child you dislike,0.520877976190476,-0.03616815476190473,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"

10.0,Wonderful Flick,"This movie was a real treat. I say ""treat"" in the sense that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, hence I love it. The plot is ridiculous & other posters have done a good job at pointing out the shortcomings so I'll keep this brief. As someone alluded to previously & after a secondary viewing last night re-enforced, it is quite comical how the ""terrorists"" go through extreme measures to get into the park (ie; having a ship offshore, jet skis, scuba diving, underwater lasers etc,) when they could just pay the nominal fee to gain access to the park! That was great. Hulk Hogan as always, is a crowd pleaser. I like at the end when he knocks off the tops of the underwater breathing apparatuses with a single blow & they masquerade as oxygen diffusing projectiles! Jim Varney obviously was funny in his role as the antagonist, no doubt ashamed to be cast in such a lousy movie. And the three ""ninjas""? Don't even get me started. So cheesy with the Ayais! over & over. Terrible actors, but it all adds to the ambiance of a wonderful film, albeit low budget & misconstrued, unintentional comedy. Would highly recommend, & it goes without saying that a solid buzz while embarking on such a journey will no doubt add to the enjoyment derived from this little gem.

,CRRRRRRRRRAP!!!!!!!!,"1992's ""3 Ninjas"" was a really cool movie, back in 2nd grade! I felt that it would of been best to leave it alone. But, like all money hungry executives do, they have to go and make 3 lame sequels that overexpose what made the first one successful: fighting. And I don't know what the hell the filmakers were doing while shooting these movies and casting the stars? I guess they filmed the third one right after the first and intended for that to be the second one, since the kids in it are the same as the kids in the first! (still with me?) But overall, this is the worst of the four. Was it supposed to be a prequel or something, 'cause all three kids look about 5 years younger than in the previous movies. And even if it was a prequel, the filmakers obviously didn't realize the kids don't get their names until later. Please don't rent this movie to enjoy it with your kids or yourself. Rent it to make fun of it with a friend or sibling, but beware, it might bore you or cheese you to death before you finish it!!Note: A black belt doesn't screech out a high-pitched ""HI-YA"" when doing something like throwing an egg at a bad guy or cutting a rope that releases an anvil or something of that sort that black-belts don't do.",crrrrrrrrrap,1992s 3 ninjas was really cool movie back 2nd grade i felt that it would been best leave it alone but like all money hungry executives do they have go make 3 lame sequels that overexpose what made first one successful fighting i dont know what hell filmakers were doing while shooting these movies casting stars i guess they filmed third one right after first intended that be second one since kids it are same as kids first still with me but overall this is worst four was it supposed be prequel or something cause all three kids look about 5 years younger than previous movies even if it was prequel filmakers obviously didnt realize kids dont get their names until later please dont rent this movie enjoy it with your kids or yourself rent it make fun it with friend or sibling but beware it might bore you or cheese you death before you finish it note black belt doesnt screech out high pitched hi ya when doing something like throwing egg at bad guy or cutting rope that releases anvil or something that sort that black belts dont do,0.3711813186813187,0.026758241758241777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,Awesome,Hasn't anyone ever dreamed of being a ninja as a child? I watched this movie years ago and would have told you then that the 3 ninjas movies were the absolute best movies ever made. Looking at this movie from an adults perspective defeats the propose of this being a Children's MOVIE. From a child's perspective this movie is one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win? This movie was a favorite of mine growing up and I would still sit down and watch all of the 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as a child.,awesome,hasnt anyone ever dreamed being ninja as child i watched this movie years ago would have told you then that 3 ninjas movies were absolute best movies ever made looking at this movie adults perspective defeats propose this being childrens movie childs perspective this movie is one best martial arts movies ever made think back when you were kid wouldnt you love see movie where kids your age can take fully grown men win this movie was favorite mine growing up i would still sit down watch all 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as child,0.47171717171717176,0.44949494949494945,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.15}"

10.0,This is the best film ever!!!,"This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Watched it on a hangover with a mate and we couldn't stop laughing the whole time and, despite having a lot of work to do, were compelled to watch to the end to see if the 3 ninjas won. It's the most ludicrous story line I've ever seen in a film, I was just sitting there thinking how is that little kid beating up grown men 'ninjas' - surely just knee him in the head, he's about 6. And that ridiculous girl with all the gadgets, ""Let me just reroute the encryption through the CPU"" or some bollox, on what was essentially a toy computer. The female leader of the terrorist looks like an 80s porn star (so does the Hulk as well, I guess), speaking of which, Mr. Hogan put in one of his best performances since Muppets from Space. It is genuinely the worst, least believable film you will ever see and as a result is truly hilarious. Also, one of the kids has literally the worst haircut you will ever see, it's worth watching the film purely for that.

While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius.

9.0,Would you please stop trashing this series?,"I've waited over four years to see this movie, and people have to stop trashing this series. Having taken karate myself as a kid and working in an amusement park, this movie is far from stupid. If you're a fan of the series, you'll love this one.The only negative point I can see is that they didn't use the original actors except for Grandpa Mori; however, in this case it doesn't hurt the movie. The kids were far better at karate and the action was great.If you like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Power Rangers, you'll like this movie too.9 out of 10.Peace out.",would you please stop trashing this series,ive waited over four years see this movie people have stop trashing this series having taken karate myself as kid working amusement park this movie is far stupid if youre fan series youll love this one only negative point i can see is that they didnt use original actors except grandpa mori however this case it doesnt hurt movie kids were far better at karate action was great if you like teenage mutant ninja turtles or power rangers youll like this movie too 9 out 10 peace out,0.6454545454545454,0.125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1.0,this movie STINKS,"This movie is the most awful karate movie i have ever seen. The moves the kids did stunk, the plot was lame, and the ending was dumb. At the end, the bad guy offers a fight deal against the grandpa when he is his prisoner. If the bad guy had half a brain, he would have simply kept him as a prisoner. When the ninja kids do their moves, they do not look realistic and they do not actually hit the targets when they do the moves, but the bad guys get hit anyway. Also, to hold off the criminals in their home, the ninjas give two of them diarrhea?? How lame is that? DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! IT STINKS!!! This movie is currently on my top 10 of worst movies of all time. Oh, by the way, the kids looked like they were 3 yrs younger than before and the middle aged boy's hairdo gave me nightmares.

7.0,Good for children... Not for adults.,"The thing that most people have to realize when watching a movie such as this one is its not made to be reviewed by people over, lets say 10. But seeing as how most under the age of ten have the attention span of a wet rock, I'll do it for them.I recently showed this movie to my kids, all of which are under the age of ten. And they loved it. I on the other hand walked out of the room. My kids were so entralled that two of them have now taken up karate lessons.that means Its served its purpose... they stayed still for 2 hours and I got to get some work done.",good children not adults,thing that most people have realize when watching movie such as this one is its not made be reviewed by people over lets say 10 but seeing as how most under age ten have attention span wet rock ill do it them i recently showed this movie my kids all which are under age ten they loved it i other hand walked out room my kids were so entralled that two them have now taken up karate lessons that means its served its purpose they stayed still 2 hours i got get some work done,0.4477272727272727,0.15227272727272725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.2, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.13}"

1.0,"Was it just me, or did anyone else feel like they were watching a Kraft cheese commercial?","I swear at the beginning with the parents, I felt like they were just smiling too much and it looked like they were just going to say cliché' things like ""Oh, you kids!"" or ""That's coming out of your allowance"" while smiling at the camera on cue.Now, granted, this is a movie for kids, but I think we are starting to insult our kids just a little bit. I mean, we do actually have a decent cast for a kid's flick, but these adults really sunk beyond the kid's humor. While it has some good morals and another happy ending, just the jokes got old and I think we are just insulting our kid's intelligence and humor.1/10 PS: Loni, lay off the fake tan!",was it just me or did anyone else feel like they were watching kraft cheese commercial,i swear at beginning with parents i felt like they were just smiling too much it looked like they were just going say clich things like oh you kids or thats coming out your allowance while smiling at camera cue now granted this is movie kids but i think we are starting insult our kids just little bit i mean we do actually have decent cast kids flick but these adults really sunk beyond kids humor while it has some good morals another happy ending just jokes got old i think we are just insulting our kids intelligence humor 1 10 ps loni lay off fake tan,0.48108974358974366,0.012820512820512827,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.14}"
