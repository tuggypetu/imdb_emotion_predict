10.0,When dreams give you the ability to fly,"Udaan must be one of the best Hindi films I've ever seen - realistic, simple, engaging, riveting, inspiring and deeply moving. Vikramaditya Motwane's direction deserves the highest of praise, and the script, written by Motwane and the great Anurag Kashyap, is superbly written. The film looks authentic and is easy to relate to and yet it has an impressive larger-than-life quality to it that makes wonders. This poignant story is brought out exceedingly well on-screen, and the depiction of the subject matter is brutally honest, at times disturbing and excruciating and yet totally encouraging. Made with sheer graciousness and sincerity, Udaan perfectly captures the adolescent days of a young teenager named Rohan, and it follows his dreams, desires and growing maturity.After being in a boarding school for 8 years, Rohan is expelled and is forced to return to Jamshedpur to live with his terribly authoritarian father and a younger half-brother about whose existence he never knew. The story follows Rohan's life with his domineering father, who maltreats him and disapproves of his dreams to become a writer by forcing him to study engineering and work at his steel factory, by treating him like a recruit, by abusing him physically and emotionally, and by scorning his writing skills. But life there actually causes Rohan to mature. His pain inspires him to write and he gradually grows to love his poor and helpless young brother Arjun, who, orphaned from his mother, equally yet quietly bears the brunt of his father's cruelty and is intimidated into silence by his despotism.Udaan is about chasing your dreams and living your life as fully as possible despite everything. It, in a sense, celebrates the power of the human spirit, showing us that we can fly very high and fulfill our most impossible dreams if we only believe in ourselves and summon up the courage to fight for our happiness. All that is presented through the character of Rohan, which is incredibly well written. He is smart, talented, compassionate and he does not spend time feeling sorry for himself for having a true monster of a father. On the contrary, it gives him the strength to create and write more, never letting his father's attempts to morally abuse him into submission deter him, lose his sense of life or stop writing. That's what makes this movie so spirit lifting.The narrative style is exemplary. The movie is amazingly realistic and intense and while some may say it is a bit slow in pace, according to me it's thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Not even once does it lose its consistency and integrity. Every scene is brilliantly shot and directed and is important to the film's proceedings. The portrayal of relationships is also aptly done here. Rohan's friendship with his schoolmates is portrayed exceptionally, despite the minimal screen time it's given. You just feel it's always there. Where its technical aspects go, Mahendra Shetty's cinematography is fantastic and so is Dipika Kalra's effective editing. Amit Trivedi's music is absolutely spot on for this movie. The songs bring the film to life and are truly uplifting and fun.The acting is roundly excellent by one and all. Even the tiniest roles look believable and genuine and they greatly contribute to the film. Rajat Barmecha debuts in this movie in a role that young aspiring actors can only dream of. He is one of the most promising actors of the current breed of fresh talents and although he clearly is going to have a great career, this is probably the role he will be most remembered for. He acts with complete understanding of the character, making it very convincing and relatable by naturally displaying Rohan's anguish, vulnerability and compassion, and later on his coming-of-age, courage and determination to do it his way.Ronit Roy is excellent as the merciless father. He manages to be as hateful as possible, yet at times he shows sparks of regret and humanity, which may be very few and barely noticeable to some, but are enough to understand that it is his own weakness and struggle that made him act as he did. Ram Kapoor in a relatively small part leaves a mark as the kind uncle of the kids, who is the complete opposite of his hot-blooded brother. The same can be said about Manjot Singh, who makes his second film appearance after a memorable performance in Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!. His ten-minute role here as Rohan's best friend is so likable and well-played that you feel like having watched him there throughout the entire movie. The film's brightest spot is undoubtedly Aayan Boradia. He is simply outstanding as Arjun and is easily one of the cutest kids in recent movies. This is a strikingly convincing portrayal; he smiles very few times throughout and conveys so much of his loneliness and pain through his innocent eyes and touching silence, without ever overdoing it. His quiet suffering and heartbreakingly accepting attitude of growing without a mother and without the care of a loving parent, on top of that having a merciless and violent father instead, make you really feel for him. It's almost impossible to believe anyone could harm such a poor creature. This is according to me one of the finest performances by a child actor, up there with the unforgettable Jugal Hansraj of Masoom.Udaan does not work because of what it 'has' but more because of what it 'is', and that's why it's so great. The ending is extraordinary, and it brings forth the long-awaited catharsis. The climactic sprinting scene is a triumph on its own - exhilaratingly exciting and hauntingly memorable. A magnificent song called ""Aazaadiyan"" perfectly concludes this terrific story, effectively presenting the film's ultimate 'udaan' (flight). Udaan is an ineffable cinematic experience and to put it simply, the best Indian film I've seen in years. Truly one gem of a movie.",when dreams give you ability fly,udaan must be one best hindi films ive ever seen realistic simple engaging riveting inspiring deeply moving vikramaditya motwanes direction

9.0,Lots of soul in the movie,"You might find the poster of the movie a bit misleading – because the poster and the trailer of the movie seem to suggest that it is college- teen story. And Udaan is anything but that. It is, however, a intensely heartfelt movie with a strong emotional connect – and with so much realism, that I cant shake the feeling it is, to a large extent, autobiographical. Even though it is populated with largely unknown faces, set in a bleak industrial city, yet this movie will linger in your minds for a long time after you exit the hall.The plot of the movie is essentially a two liner. A 17 year old is kicked out of boarding school for playing truant and is forced back to an apathetic father – and to a 6 year old half brother he didn't know existed. Stuck in a small town with no friends, forced to study engineering and work in his father's iron and steel works, Udaan is a story of Rohan's struggle with his loneliness and desperation. It is not pure entertainment, but it has got a lot of soulThe overbearing character in the movie is Bhairav Singh, played by Ronit Roy. A despotic father (with some probable army background, though its never suggested) – who does not listen to any opinion that doesn't match his own and runs his life with army-like discipline. He even insists his sons call him Sir. He stands starkly in contrast with his younger brother, the affable Ram Kapoor. He is the only beacon of light in Rohan's new world.And amongst them, sitting quietly in a corner is his younger brother Arjun – who doesn't speak much, yet wins your heart. Everything from the background music to the photography is perfect for the movie – Amit Trivedi's music melodious yet not distracting from the movie and the bleak shots of Jamshedpur accentuating the void that Rohan feels around him. Udaan is a coming-of-age movie that you will identify with because of its honesty and sincerity. Newcomer Rajat Barmecha delivers one of the most subtle, yet effective roles in sometime – putting up a stoic face against the circumstances, yet showing us the vulnerable teenager within. The movie takes a slow pace, which in my opinion is essential for the viewers to share Rohan's desperation – but some of my friends thought otherwise. That is probably the only slight flaw in this fabulous movie.

8.0,This Udaan will fly high....,"Udaan First time director Vikramaditya Motwane has done a brilliant job with Udaan. This film was truly worthy of a screening at Cannes. The simplicity of this movie is probably what makes this movie wonderful. Its a story which is not too uncommon in India, but the way its been shown, is what brings the freshness in the film.Rohan(Rajat Barmecha) has just been rusticated from his boarding school along with his 3 friends for they were caught watching an adult film of sorts(Kanti Shah ke Angoor) by their dean. As it turns out, Rohan has to go back to his home in the small industrial town of Jamshedpur, To add to his woes we find out that he hasn't met his father(Ronit Roy as Bhairav) in 8 years and he doesn't even know of the existence of a step-brother(Aayan Boradia as Arjun) at his home. Reaching there he learns that he has to work with his father at his factory and enroll in engineering college. And the disciplinarian his father is, he can't even question him. As he is stuck there with his dream of becoming a writer seemingly getting shattered, he learns to cope with life. He learns to love his kid step-brother, manages to write between work and college, sneaks out for a drink or two at night, but inspite of all this, he is getting suffocated. He wants to escape. He wants to fly.Udaan is a simple, emotional story about a boy in a small town, learning to live with his disciplinarian of a father. It is actually as simple as that. It might not sound interesting like this but the fact is that the way this normal coming of age story has been showed is just brilliant. There is nothing 'bollywood' about this film, its as if this movie was shot with a handy-cam, capturing the lives of a real family. But that doesn't make this one bit boring, because obviously there are some exaggerations, some gags, some drama but all in all its very real and believable. I'm sure everyone one of us would be able to relate to this film in some way or the other.The high point of the movie is the performances by the leading men(there are hardly any women in this film). Ronit Roy as a single father has done his job with perfection. He drinks, smokes, but still goes for a jog every morning, which also turns out to be a very important aspect in the story. He sometimes loses his cool, uses force in teaching his kids a lesson, but at times we also see that he is caring and probably a little vulnerable. He's acted so well, that you can feel it when he is drunk, you even get scared when he is angry, that good is his screen presence. I was wrong to write off this TV actor. Rajat Barmecha too has done an impeccable job in portraying a kid, who has lived his life in one of the best boarding schools of India and now is stuck in a small town. He does the usual, sneaks out at night for drinks and smoke, steals his fathers cars for doing so, but still makes it on time in the morning for his daily run with his dad. His writings are beautiful too, so credit must go to the original writer as well. But the award must go to Aayan Boradia who is one of the best child actors I have ever come across in Indian cinema. He is so real, so cute and you will just fall in love with him. He is somewhat aware of what is going on but obviously at his age he just can;t do anything about it as his understanding does not go that deep. And then lastly Ram Kapoor as Jimmy, Bhairav's younger brother brings a very good contrast between his authoritarian brother and his practical chilled out of sorts character. He understands Rohan's dreams and aspirations but he can only do so much to convince his big brother to change his mind. A very intriguing relationship between the two brothers I must say.Running time of over 2 hours, this might at times seem a little slow, but you gradually understand the importance of those long silent shots as the film progresses to its climax. There are scenes that will send chills down your spine. There scenes that will inspire you to 'fly out of a cage' if you are in one, metaphorically speaking of course. Its just filled with those moments that will be with you for sometime to come. It won't be easy to forget this movie soon. And let me assure you, you will come out highly satisfied after watching this movie. A big thumbs up for Motwane! Looking forward for more! Cheers to all the actors as well!",this udaan will fly high,udaan first time director vikramaditya motwane has done brilliant job with udaan this film was truly worthy screening at cannes simplicity this movie is probably what makes this movie wonderful its story which is not too uncommon india but way its been shown is what brings freshness film rohan rajat barmecha has just been rusticated his boarding school along with his 3 friends they were caught watching adult film sorts kanti shah ke angoor by their dean as it turns out rohan has go back his home small industrial town jamshedpur add his woes we find out that he hasnt met his father ronit roy as bhairav 8 years he doesnt even know existence step brother aayan boradia as arjun at his home reaching there he learns that he has work with his father at his factory enroll engineering college disciplinarian his father is he cant even question him as he is stuck there with his dream becoming writer seemingly getting shattered he learns cope with life he learns love his kid step brother manages write between work college sneaks out drink or two at night but inspite all this he is getting suffocated he wants escape he wants fly udaan is simple emotional story about boy small town learning live with his disciplinarian father it is actually as simple as that it might not sound interesting like this but fact is that way this normal coming age story has been showed is just brilliant there is nothing bollywood about this film its as if this movie was shot with handy cam capturing lives real family but that doesnt make this one bit boring because obviously there are some exaggerations some gags some drama but all all its very real believable im sure everyone one us would be able relate this film some way or other high point movie is performances by leading men there are hardly any women this film ronit roy as single father has done his job with perfection he drinks smokes but still goes jog every morning which also turns out be very important aspect story he sometimes loses his cool uses force teaching his kids lesson but at times we also see that he is caring probably little vulnerable hes acted so well that you can feel it when he is drunk you even get scared when he is angry that good is his screen presence i was wrong write off this tv actor rajat barmecha too has done impeccable job portraying kid who has lived his life one best boarding schools india now is stuck small town he does usual sneaks out at night drinks smoke steals his fathers cars doing so but still makes it time morning his daily run with his dad his writings are beautiful too so credit must go original writer as well but award must go aayan boradia who is one best child actors i have ever come across indian cinema he is so real so cute you will just fall love with him he is somewhat aware what is going but obviously at his age he just can t do anything about it as his understanding does not go that deep then lastly ram kapoor as jimmy bhairavs younger brother brings very good contrast between his authoritarian brother his practical chilled out sorts character he understands rohans dreams aspirations but he can only do so much convince his big brother change his mind very intriguing relationship between two brothers i must say running time over 2 hours this might at times seem little slow but you gradually understand importance those long silent shots as film progresses its climax there are scenes that will send chills down your spine there scenes that will inspire you fly out cage if you are one metaphorically speaking course its just filled with those moments that will be with you sometime come it wont be easy forget this movie soon let me assure you you will come out highly satisfied after watching this movie big thumbs up motwane looking forward more cheers all actors as well,0.5527809106098583,0.21314973038657248,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,"Abusive father, idealistic son, and complex modern India middle class...","Udaan (2010)On the main level this is a gripping, realistic, deeply moving story of a sensitive boy with an abusive father growing up in a culturally complex India. This is the main point here, and the reason to see it. The leading part played by this boy, Rohan, is a magnificent acting debut for Rajat Barmecha. He was twenty playing a seventeen year old schoolboy, but he's convincing, and nuanced, with both great emotional vulnerability and flashes of rebellion and fire. The other level to consider from this movie is as a cultural lens. I write from the U.S. and know only what I see from here, but it seems like a coming of age movie with the tinges of generation gap and young rebellion seen blossoming (in the movies and in life) here in the 1960s and 70s. Rohan's father is ""old school"" in that he's tough on his son, thinking the son needs discipline and hard work to grow up and be functional. The boy though is a writer at heart (there are several scenes where he recites poems or tells stories and they are spellbinding, if brief), and the father won't hear of that. Raising Rohan without a mother seems to give him so leniency for his stubbornness, but not for his violence, and Rohan, somehow, must react.The third character of note is not a girl--a nice change from many young men growing up stories--but a little half-brother who Rohan ends up befriend and ultimately kind of mentoring. The little one is super cute and delicate, and the three males with all their problems and conflicts make for a rich, intense interplay.The other cultural aspect (besides how young people might be seeing their morality shift from their parents and grandparents) for an outsider is to see contemporary India in a rather true, ordinary way. I mean, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was amazing and sensational in its own way, but it pushed buttons and pushed boundaries. This movies stays within boundaries to that being edgy isn't interfering with the reality of the story and all its successive stages. It's really great stuff overall. The one thing that will seem odd, maybe, to some is the inspirational feel-good music with lyrics written for the film. It's almost saccharine it's so idealistic, but then, it's probably when every struggling 16 year old in Mumbai or New Delhi or wherever needs to hear. That part of the movie is not for an outsider at all, which is okay. I think people see the American classic ""The Graduate"" and have similar problems with the coming of age problems being mid-1960s in flavor, and the music having a pretty tenor not always up a contemporary alley.So see Udaan for what it is. Rooted in expert and conventional filmmaking and storytelling, but powerful stuff.",abusive father idealistic son complex modern india middle class,udaan 2010 main level this is gripping realistic deeply moving story sensitive boy with abusive father growing up culturally complex india this is main point here reason see it leading part played by this boy rohan is magnificent acting debut rajat barmecha he was twenty playing seventeen year old schoolboy but hes convincing nuanced with both great emotional vulnerability flashes rebellion fire other level consider this movie is as cultural lens i write u s know only what i see here but it seems like coming age movie with tinges generation gap young rebellion seen blossoming movies life here 1960s 70s rohans father is old school that hes tough his son thinking son needs discipline hard work grow up be functional boy though is writer at heart there are several scenes where he recites poems or tells stories they are spellbinding if brief father wont hear that raising rohan without mother seems give him so leniency his stubbornness but not his violence rohan somehow must react third character note is not girl nice change many young men growing up stories but little half brother who rohan ends up befriend ultimately kind mentoring little one is super cute delicate three males with all their problems conflicts make rich intense interplay other cultural aspect besides how young people might be seeing their morality shift their parents grandparents outsider is see contemporary india rather true ordinary way i mean slumdog millionaire was amazing sensational its own way but it pushed buttons pushed boundaries this movies stays within boundaries that being edgy isnt interfering with reality story all its successive stages its really great stuff overall one thing that will seem odd maybe some is inspirational feel good music with lyrics written film its almost saccharine its so idealistic but then its probably when every struggling 16 year old mumbai or new delhi or wherever needs hear that part movie is not outsider at all which is okay i think people see american classic graduate have similar problems with coming age problems being mid 1960s flavor music having pretty tenor not always up contemporary alley so see udaan what it is rooted expert conventional filmmaking storytelling but powerful stuff,0.5093464868464868,0.15180180930180928,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"

9.0,An insightful and must watch take on adolescence with a hidden message.,"Adolescence is one of those rare subjects on which we haven't witnessed many movies made in Bollywood. Therefore UDAAN comes as a pleasant surprise from a debutant director Vikramaditya Motwane, who boldly makes his first movie on an important subject and delivers a fine polished product proving his unique thought process with a style.First of all the film is not preachy as it may seem to be from its look and promos. It's a simple story of a young boy and his relationship with his rigid father and helpless younger step brother told in the most simplistic way. But as it is said, 'The beauty lies in its simplicity', UDAAN becomes worth watching because it's truthfully simple without any added flavors or colors.It starts superbly with its first 20 minutes depicting the mischievous days of 4 young friends living in a boarding school. The sequence of their running from the school to watch an adult movie in the night show sets the mood in for the viewers. But this particular section of the film indisputably belongs to Manjot Singh alone (the young Lucky from 'Oye Lucky Lucky Oye""), as he clearly outshines everyone on the screen with his famous realistic dialogue delivery style and comic persona. After its funny half an hour, UDAAN takes a serious turn and then moves into a completely different shell talking about the difficulties faced by a young boy while interacting with his ruler kind of a father. At this stage the narration becomes serious and the pace slows down drastically. But very soon you find yourself involved in this little family of three men living in the same house as strangers.In every family, a young male child always has his own contradictions with his father. There is difference of opinion, difference of vision and most probably the fight is over the issue of the stream or line in which the child desires to make a career in. UDAAN rightly focuses on this relevant issue and therefore every young boy watching the movie would easily relate to the script and the characters in a big way.The movie may not find a thumbs up from every section of the viewers as its basically meant for the fans of realistic cinema who are used to a slower pace and can appreciate the social subject of the script. It also has some minor flaws in its charactersiation like, how can a child steal money and car from his father who has a reign of fear in the family and yet cannot revolt right away. But even after these minor glitches, it still remains a well crafted film standing out of all those usual projects offered to us in 2010.In real terms there are few visible and one invisible aspect of ""UDAAN"", which makes it a worth watching project.The visible aspects mainly include the outstanding confrontation sequences between the father and the son about their different styles of living and choice of professions. Both Rajat Barmecha as the young boy and Ronit Roy as the father truly excel in their scenes together. Then just watch out for the young kid Aayan Boradia, playing the silent step son, who mutely keeps suffering the merciless beatings of his father and doesn't utter a word. He is simply adorable and loving with his innocent smile and dialogues. And then there are two sparkling performances by Ram Kapoor and Manjot Singh. Especially the silent conversation scenes between Ram and Rajat are a treat to watch. Finally the most impactful visible aspect of the movie remains its climax where Rajat along with his writer Anurag Kashyap and director Motwane defines the meaning of their title ""UDAAN"" in an exceptional way. In fact the concluding scene of the movie is capable of lifting up every viewer from his seat in sheer joy.Coming to the invisible but in my opinion the most important aspect of ""UDAAN"", which puts it in a completely different league, is the way it expresses the need of A MOTHER in every child's life. The film makes you feel the incomparable role of a female or a mother in a family who cannot be replaced by any amount of love, compassion or care provided by the other members. A mother, who can finish off all the differences in a family with her kind presence, love and calmness. A mother, who in disguise is just GOD living in our homes for taking care of us in the needy times. And a Mother whose debt we cannot repay in any form in our whole life on this planet.Both the director and the writer need to be congratulated on this hidden aspect of the movie which may not strike all the viewers at first. But if you can think for a moment, then all the sufferings in the movie are only there due to the missing factor in the family called ""MOTHER"".So, in a way ""UDAAN"" also makes you realize this Biggest Gift of God to the mankind by very softly portraying the fact that a family becomes completely dry and stiff in absence of a motherly abode. I hope the film encourages every son or daughter to remember that they are blessed to have their mothers around them in this tender age and they do take care and love her to the best of their abilities forever. Summing up, its a recommended flick since it has an important message for all fathers and families having their kids in the adolescence age. And indeed a must watch for its invisible merit, indicating the role of a Mother in a happy family.(The movie right away moves into my ""Movies To See Before You Die"" list cause it makes you realize the most precious gift of God to us and that's our Mother.)",insightful must watch take adolescence with hidden message,adolescence is one those rare subjects which we havent witnessed many movies made bollywood therefore udaan comes as pleasant surprise debutant director vikramaditya motwane who boldly makes his first movie important subject delivers fine polished product proving his unique thought process with style first all film is not preachy as it may seem be its look promos its simple story young boy his relationship with his rigid father helpless younger step brother told most simplistic way but as it is said beauty lies its simplicity udaan becomes worth watching because its truthfully simple without any added flavors or colors it starts superbly with its first 20 minutes depicting mischievous days 4 young friends living boarding school sequence their running school watch adult movie night show sets mood viewers but this particular section film indisputably belongs manjot singh alone young lucky oye lucky lucky oye as he clearly outshines everyone screen with his famous realistic dialogue delivery style comic persona after its funny half hour udaan takes serious turn then moves into completely different shell talking about difficulties faced by young boy while interacting with his ruler kind father at this stage narration becomes serious pace slows down drastically but very soon you find yourself involved this little family three men living same house as strangers every family young male child always has his own contradictions with his father there is difference opinion difference vision most probably fight is over issue stream or line which child desires make career udaan rightly focuses this relevant issue therefore every young boy watching movie would easily relate script characters big way movie may not find thumbs up every section viewers as its basically meant fans realistic cinema who are used slower pace can appreciate social subject script it also has some minor flaws its charactersiation like how can child steal money car his father who has reign fear family yet cannot revolt right away but even after these minor glitches it still remains well crafted film standing out all those usual projects offered us 2010 real terms there are few visible one invisible aspect udaan which makes it worth watching project visible aspects mainly include outstanding confrontation sequences between father son about their different styles living choice professions both rajat barmecha as young boy ronit roy as father truly excel their scenes together then just watch out young kid aayan boradia playing silent step son who mutely keeps suffering merciless beatings his father doesnt utter word he is simply adorable loving with his innocent smile dialogues then there are two sparkling performances by ram kapoor manjot singh especially silent conversation scenes between ram rajat are treat watch finally most impactful visible aspect movie remains its climax where rajat along with his writer anurag kashyap director motwane defines meaning their title udaan exceptional way fact concluding scene movie is capable lifting up every viewer his seat sheer joy coming invisible but my opinion most important aspect udaan which puts it completely different league is way it expresses need mother every childs life film makes you feel incomparable role female or mother family who cannot be replaced by any amount love compassion or care provided by other members mother who can finish off all differences family with her kind presence love calmness mother who disguise is just god living our homes taking care us needy times mother whose debt we cannot repay any form our whole life this planet both director writer need be congratulated this hidden aspect movie which may not strike all viewers at first but if you can think moment then all sufferings movie are only there due missing factor family called mother so way udaan also makes you realize this biggest gift god mankind by very softly portraying fact that family becomes completely dry stiff absence motherly abode i hope film encourages every son or daughter remember that they are blessed have their mothers around them this tender age they do take care love her best their abilities forever summing up its recommended flick since it has important message all fathers families having their kids adolescence age indeed must watch its invisible merit indicating role mother happy family movie right away moves into my movies see before you die list cause it makes you realize most precious gift god us thats our mother,0.5141382150344416,0.1972544174902665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,Spread Your Wings And Fly To Your Destiny,"For some reason I have been postponing watching 'Udaan' until finally I watched it last night. I figured, why shouldn't it be the first film I watch this year? I had only heard many good things about it but even then it surpassed my expectations. 'Udaan' is one of those rare Indian films that scores high on every component of filmmaking, be it, direction, writing, cinematography, casting, score... It looks authentic and it feels honest.What particularly stands out about 'Udaan' is how true to life it is and at the same time it's not a documentary style film but one with a great big heart that tells an inspiring story of a teenager fighting for his dream to become the man he aspires to. Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap have done an outstanding job in the writing department. It's very detailed without being showy, poetic without being operatic, subtle without being too restrained and poignant without being preachy.In addition, Motwane does a phenomenal job translating the words from paper to screen. The narrative style is superb and remains consistent throughout. The characters are very human and easily recognizable mostly because of how the relationships are depicted, with sincerity.Shetty's cinematography works in a subtle way. Every frame is photogenic but not to the point of looking like a postcard or being distracting. Trivedi's score is used very efficiently, never intrusive but rather contributing by echoing the mood of the sequences. Kalra's editing is solid as never does the pace feel uneven nor does the film lose its focus at any point.Now coming to the performances, each and every actor's portrayal is genuine. Starting with newcomer Rajat Barmecha who is spot on as he looks the part and acts sublime. Ronit Roy finally gets a role that showcases his previously unknown talent. This is definitely a breakthrough performance for the actor who's been in movies for almost two years. While his portrayal of the authoritarian father is haunting one can also sympathize for him as he himself is a victim of abuse and he really does believe that he's doing the best for his sons and yet shows signs of regret at some of the wrong decisions. Ram Kapoor is equally convincing as the supportive light-hearted uncle who is the polar opposite of the quick tempered father. And of course, last but not least, there is young Aayan Boradia who delivers one of the most accurate performances of a child. It's amazing how, mostly through non-verbal gestures, he displays Arjun's innocence, loneliness, quiet suffering and longing with such precision While most of the first act and second act of the film depicts Rohan and Arjun's quiet suffering, the final act is excellently cathartic. I don't mean cathartic in the sense that events take an explosive turn that involves loud confrontations. Here it's rather matter-of-factly but at the same time energetic, invigorating and symbolic. Even though I was expecting what Rohan would eventually do for himself to escape his father's imprisonment, there are some precious little surprises that happen along the way, making 'Udaan' a one-of-a-kind gem.'Udaan' is a celebration of the human spirit. I'm very glad I picked this movie to start the year.",spread your wings fly your destiny,some reason i have been postponing watching udaan until finally i watched it last night i figured why shouldnt it be first film i watch this year i had only heard many good things about it but even then it surpassed my expectations udaan is one those rare indian films that scores high every component filmmaking be it direction writing cinematography casting score it looks authentic it feels honest what particularly stands out about udaan is how true life it is at same time its not documentary style film but one with great big heart that tells inspiring story teenager fighting his dream become man he aspires vikramaditya motwane anurag kashyap have done outstanding job writing department its very detailed without being showy poetic without being operatic subtle without being too restrained poignant without being preachy addition motwane does phenomenal job translating words paper screen narrative style is superb remains consistent throughout characters are very human easily recognizable mostly because how relationships are depicted with sincerity shettys cinematography works subtle way every frame is photogenic but not point looking like postcard or being distracting trivedis score is used very efficiently never intrusive but rather contributing by echoing mood sequences kalras editing is solid as never does pace feel uneven nor does film lose its focus at any point now coming performances each every actors portrayal is genuine starting with newcomer rajat barmecha who is spot as he looks part acts sublime ronit roy finally gets role that showcases his previously unknown talent this is definitely breakthrough performance actor whos been movies almost two years while his portrayal authoritarian father is haunting one can also sympathize him as he himself is victim abuse he really does believe that hes doing best his sons yet shows signs regret at some wrong decisions ram kapoor is equally convincing as supportive light hearted uncle who is polar opposite quick tempered father course last but not least there is young aayan boradia who delivers one most accurate performances child its amazing how mostly through non verbal gestures he displays arjuns innocence loneliness quiet suffering longing with such precision while most first act second act film depicts rohan arjuns quiet suffering final act is excellently cathartic i dont mean cathartic sense that events take explosive turn that involves loud confrontations here its rather matter factly but at same time energetic invigorating symbolic even though i was expecting what rohan would eventually do himself escape his fathers imprisonment there are some precious little surprises that happen along way making udaan one kind gem udaan is celebration human spirit im very glad i picked this movie start year,0.5300114155251141,0.233972602739726,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,The story about a boy unwelcome in his own home...unpleasant but well made.,"If you don't like unpleasant films, then you should not see ""Udaan"". Now I am NOT saying it's a bad movie--it's actually very good. But the subject matter clearly isn't fun or entertaining...nor should it be.When the film begins, four teens from a boarding school are caught sneaking off campus. Considering they've all been in trouble before, the group is expelled. The story then focuses specifically on one of the boys, Rohan. His situation is pitiful, as he's been at this school 8 years and he's never been home. Clearly he's a lost soul.Rohan soon arrives back home and your worst fears are confirmed--his father is garbage. Not only is he neglectful, which was obvious, but he's also a nasty, violent brute. He has no love in him whatsoever and he bullies Rohan and his little brother. Speaking of little brother, this 6 year-old has never even met Rohan! Throughout the course of the film, the father bullies, threatens and uses violence and Rohan's response is covert insolence--pretending to work hard at school but instead running around and wasting his life. What's to happen to this miserable young man and his tiny brother?In many ways this movie reminds me both of Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" (about an abused and neglected teen who ends up in reform school) and Majid Majidi's ""The Color of Paradise""--a brilliant Iranian film about a father who is ashamed to have a blind son and abandons him to a boarding school. None of these films are fun but they are brave and compelling. In the case of ""Udaan"", like these other films, it's also very well made--and NOT at all like a stereotypical Bollywood production.",story about boy unwelcome his own home unpleasant but well made,if you dont like unpleasant films then you should not see udaan now i am not saying its bad movie its actually very good but subject matter clearly isnt fun or entertaining nor should it be when film begins four teens boarding school are caught sneaking off campus considering theyve all been trouble before group is expelled story then focuses specifically one boys rohan his situation is pitiful as hes been at this school 8 years hes never been home clearly hes lost soul rohan soon arrives back home your worst fears are confirmed his father is garbage not only is he neglectful which was obvious but hes also nasty violent brute he has no love him whatsoever he bullies rohan his little brother speaking little brother this 6 year old has never even met rohan throughout course film father bullies threatens uses violence rohans response is covert insolence pretending work hard at school but instead running around wasting his life whats happen this miserable young man his tiny brother many ways this movie reminds me both truffauts 400 blows about abused neglected teen who ends up reform school majid majidis color paradise brilliant iranian film about father who is ashamed have blind son abandons him boarding school none these films are fun but they are brave compelling case udaan like these other films its also very well made not at all like stereotypical bollywood production,0.6091666666666667,-0.05828703703703705,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,Take this flight of freedom....,"In our pressure cooker society, an adolescent's aspirations are woven from the expectations of their parents. In earnest efforts to fulfill those expectations, the youth have often strangled their dreams and yet, hidden in those glimmering eyes is the hope to become a writer, the excitement of living life to its fullest everyday, the recklessness of a brat, the spirit of adventure, the fear of his father's wrath over his carefree attitude, the discomfort of living the alternate life and the determination to break free. Such is the glimmer seen in the eyes of Rohan (Rajat Barmecha) in debutant director Vikramaditya Motwane's 'Udaan' which is co-written and produced by Anurag Kashyap; from whom, only excellence is accepted.Udaan is indeed a flight of dreams for cinema. Motwane depicts a simple but relevant story with the most exhaustive and impeccable narrative. Seldom has reality been so refreshingly poignant as it has with Rohan's journey of chasing his dreams. Having spent 8 years in boarding school, away from his stern father, Rohan hones his writing skills after occasional escapades with his foolhardy friends with whom he shares a bond of freedom, fear, hope, joy and dreams. After they cross the limits of discipline in the school's standards, their expulsion sends each of them back to their families and Rohan, to Jamshedpur, where his hot tempered father (Ronit Roy) leaves him no choice but to work with him in his foundry and study in the city's engineering college. Rohan also discovers his step brother he did not know about and while he remains aloof from that innocent child, we can feel the growing tension between a rigid father and his audacious son. Bhairav's brother Jimmy (Ram Kapoor) also plays an important part in being an understanding guide to Rohan's ambitions but even he cannot confront the rudeness and apathy of his elder brother for too long. Rohan's mornings involve long runs with his father around the city, hours of hard labor in the foundry, followed by hours of incurious attendance in college, followed by circuitous paths back home where he writes his stories and poetry on railway tracks and river banks and finally, back to the tense environment of home. It is quite shocking to see him sneak out with his father's car and drive around the city to revel in its night life with a new bunch of foolhardy goons. At some point you almost cover your face because you are more afraid of the result of his actions than he is! The younger son, Arjun (Aayan Boradia) is hospitalized after receiving a discreet beating by his father and while the tyrant leaves for a few days, a heart-warming bond develops between the brothers through the writer's stories. The tension between Bhairav Singh and Rohan is beautifully balanced with Arjun's placid innocence and his relationship with Rohan. Concurrently, Rohan is tempted to join his hostel friends in Bombay where they now run a restaurant. He only becomes more desperate as his father attempts to renew his personal life in an attempt to seek solace.In the end, Rohan's flight of dreams turns into a Flight to freedom as he breaks the shackles for his Udaan. The moment is inspiring, uplifting and relieving after a final race between an apathetic enforcer and a dreamer. Unlike 'Iqbal' and 'Taare Zameen Par', Udaan has the capability to engage you in a personal manner as one can relate to the mature protagonist either with one's own history in adolescent years or having a friend/brother who was in similar circumstances. We have all lived some of the moments that Rohan experiences. Those late night escapades, watching C grade movies in small towns, drinking to life with friends, just picking on a fight because you feel like it, being rebellious against the dictating conventions and introspecting into one's conscience to find life's meaning. Rajat Barmecha is a revelation with a mature and sincere performance in a challenging role as the adolescent. Ronit Roy as Bhairav Singh delivers a shocking performance. He is so well versed with the character that it makes it one of the most natural performances we have seen. Indeed, it is sad to see him overact in his alternate avatar on TV. Ram Kapoor brings liveliness with deep understanding of the emotions of his character. Little Aayan Boradia is remarkable for his age and debut while we wish to see more of Manjot Singh in a comic role as he was just hilarious in every scene!Amit Trivedi's soulful musical journey is only optimized with Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics which will narrate the movie's essence. While being meaningful in lyrics, the music is very contemporary in its beats and rhythms. The inspiring words in Ek Udaan, the uplifting tone and feel of Aazaadiyan, the hopeful and soul stirring Kahaani, the literally refreshing Geet (Kuch naya toh zaroor) and the insulting Motu Master are truly unique compositions that will remain with you as long as the movie will. Mahendra Shetty's exemplary photography depicts Jamshedpur in all its green splendour. The indoor camera angles too suit the mood of the scene and put even more life into the characters. Abstaining from the conventional medium of telling stories, Motwane chose to be real yet artistic in his direction of Udaan. Such film-making speaks aloud of how far Indian films have come. With the most appropriate utilization of music in situations, the writers also add depth with Rohan's poetry. The visuals support such adept collaboration of script and performances while neglecting all the clichéd dramatization. Udaan resonates the deeper cords to leave a lasting impression. Its rich narrative, powerful performances, sincere making and inspiring music are to be cherished for they do not come so often in such a vivid form.

9.0,A captivating and culturally symbolic coming-of-age film!,"After being expelled from boarding school for sneaking out to watch an x-rated movie, Rohan comes back home and sees his father after eight years and becomes overwhelmed by his new life. He is forced to deal with the fact that he has a half-brother, to suppress his artistic desires and dreams of being a writer, to work as an engineer at his dad's factory, and to live a regimented life at the order of his authoritative father. It is uplifting to see, though, how amidst such a dull and draining life, he is able to just barely keep his spirit alive, whether it be through writing poems by the river, chatting with his uncle, or telling stories to a sick, elderly man at the hospital. He also begins to sympathize for his half-brother, especially after seeing that their dad abuses him. This new relationship makes Rohan's life ever more complicated as running away would be the easy solution; now the future of a young child will be determined by Rohan's actions. Fantastic direction and great performances by the supporting cast, especially the little half-brother.One of the final scenes where Rohan outruns his father is beautifully captured. This image leaves a long-lasting impression on the viewer, and in my opinion, this still image of Rohan sprinting is very symbolic of the new Indian culture. India's youth is forging ahead, making a name for itself, breaking the shackles of convention, and redefining the future. Many years from now, this striking image will be remembered as an iconic allegory of the youth of India's new attitude and determination to succeed and live life as they envision it.",captivating culturally symbolic coming age film,after being expelled boarding school sneaking out watch x rated movie rohan comes back home sees his father after eight years becomes overwhelmed by his new life he is forced deal with fact that he has half brother suppress his artistic desires dreams being writer work as engineer at his dads factory live regimented life at order his authoritative father it is uplifting see though how amidst such dull draining life he is able just barely keep his spirit alive whether it be through writing poems by river chatting with his uncle or telling stories sick elderly man at hospital he also begins sympathize his half brother especially after seeing that their dad abuses him this new relationship makes rohans life ever more complicated as running away would be easy solution now future young child will be determined by rohans actions fantastic direction great performances by supporting cast especially little half brother one final scenes where rohan outruns his father is beautifully captured this image leaves long lasting impression viewer my opinion this still image rohan sprinting is very symbolic new indian culture indias youth is forging ahead making name itself breaking shackles convention redefining future many years now this striking image will be remembered as iconic allegory youth indias new attitude determination succeed live life as they envision it,0.5270914502164502,0.12509740259740262,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,And the award for the best movie of 2010 goes to Udaan !!,"Very rarely have I come across a film which is so captivating that it simply bowls you all over. I was literally enthralled on seeing and was especially overjoyed to see that this is a bollywood film (Yeah, that's right ! Its made in India). I was just glued to my seat for those 2 hours 15 minutes. The debutante director Vikramaditya Motwane strikes gold and has produced the finest film of 2010. (As I had mentioned in my earlier reviews that Kaminey was the best movie of 2009 and now Udaan is the best movie of 2010, hands down ! and no 2 opinions on that !) .The story has been narrated in the most realistic and simplistic way. The story is very novel and I must comment Vikramaditya Sir that he had taken lots of courage to swim against the tide and attempt such a film and that too as his debut ! This movie just made me clap my hands in joy in the end of the movie. I believe it truly deserves a standing ovation.Now coming to the acting. I was very much impressed by Ronit Roy as he was given the most difficult role to play and he accomplished it with élan'. The child artists Rajat Barmecha and Aaayan Boradia also acted competently.P.S.:- This is a must see for every parent and his child",award best movie 2010 goes udaan,very rarely have i come across film which is so captivating that it simply bowls you all over i was literally enthralled seeing was especially overjoyed see that this is bollywood film yeah thats right its made india i was just glued my seat those 2 hours 15 minutes debutante director vikramaditya motwane strikes gold has produced finest film 2010 as i had mentioned my earlier reviews that kaminey was best movie 2009 now udaan is best movie 2010 hands down no 2 opinions that story has been narrated most realistic simplistic way story is very novel i must comment vikramaditya sir that he had taken lots courage swim against tide attempt such film that too as his debut this movie just made me clap my hands joy end movie i believe it truly deserves standing ovation now coming acting i was very much impressed by ronit roy as he was given most difficult role play he accomplished it with lan child artists rajat barmecha aaayan boradia also acted competently p s this is must see every parent his child,0.5264430014430014,0.313037518037518,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,A tale of an indomitable spirit,"""Udaan"" is the story of a 17 year old boy-his dreams, his fears, his passions, his poems, his stories, his friends and most importantly his courage to live his life the way he wants to! Udaan teaches you the simple lesson-if you are passionate about your dreams, you will realise them one day or the other. The intense scenes between the father (Ronit Roy) and the protagonist (Rohan) brings out the frustrations of a middle class small town parent, his selfish ambitions and his ruthless way of stifling a child's dreams! The movie on its own is enlightening because it shows us how to break free- to spread your wings and fly away (UDAAN means flight BTW!). Over all a very commendable piece of work by the débutant director and the rest of the crew.",tale indomitable spirit,udaan is story 17 year old boy his dreams his fears his passions his poems his stories his friends most importantly his courage live his life way he wants udaan teaches you simple lesson if you are passionate about your dreams you will realise them one day or other intense scenes between father ronit roy protagonist rohan brings out frustrations middle class small town parent his selfish ambitions his ruthless way stifling childs dreams movie its own is enlightening because it shows us how break free spread your wings fly away udaan means flight btw over all very commendable piece work by d butant director rest crew,0.6095864661654137,0.1005980861244019,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,"""Is life over? Or is is about to begin?""","The literal translation of the word 'Udaan' is 'flight', and that becomes the story of seventeen year old Rohan Singh (Rajat Barmecha), who desperately seeks the means to flee a dreadful family situation made bitter by an abusive father. It's the age old story of a man who wants the son to follow in his own footsteps, deciding his career path in advance, and tormented by the teenager's insistence on following his own path. Though the idea is not new, the story provides additional resonance when Rohan learns that his father's abuse has become physical with a younger sibling that Rohan never knew he had as a result of Bhairav Singh's (Ronit Roy) second marriage after the boy was enrolled in boarding school. This is where some of the story's credibility suffers somewhat however. One has to wonder how hospital staff would have missed the bruise marks left by a belt that the father used to punish the young boy. Throughout the story, the father earns a reputation as one of the most vile villains in Hindi cinema, as he harbors not a shred of remorse toward his boys. A late apology for berating them is quickly followed by a promise to send eight year old Ariun (Aayan Boradia) off to boarding school, and a demand that Rohan spend an additional three hours daily at work in an iron forge. So much for compassion. Rohan understandably realizes that he must take the step-brother under his wing and leave the toxic family situation, certain that either he or his brother might one day follow in the father's footsteps as angry, frustrated individuals.This is one of the better Hindi films I've managed to view, all of which have been recommended via IMDb's 'Top 250' lists over the past few years. Not all have been worthy of inclusion, so catching a good one now and then has been a rare treat. The one head-scratcher in this film however was presented by the eighty year old patient in the hospital who enjoyed Rohan's story about Chandu and his bicycle. The man responded to one of Rohan's observations by stating ""Day destroys the night, night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide. Break on through to the other side."" It sounded like a cryptic reply intended to appreciate Rohan's ambition as a future writer, but all it did was make me wonder - what are the odds an eighty year old Hindi man would be quoting a line from a 1967 song by Jim Morrison and The Doors?",is life over or is is about begin,literal translation word udaan is flight that becomes story seventeen year old rohan singh rajat barmecha who desperately seeks means flee dreadful family situation made bitter by abusive father its age old story man who wants son follow his own footsteps deciding his career path advance tormented by teenagers insistence following his own path though idea is not new story provides additional resonance when rohan learns that his fathers abuse has become physical with younger sibling that rohan never knew he had as result bhairav singhs ronit roy second marriage after boy was enrolled boarding school this is where some storys credibility suffers somewhat however one has wonder how hospital staff would have missed bruise marks left by belt that father used punish young boy throughout story father earns reputation as one most vile villains hindi cinema as he harbors not shred remorse toward his boys late apology berating them is quickly followed by promise send eight year old ariun aayan boradia off boarding school demand that rohan spend additional three hours daily at work iron forge so much compassion rohan understandably realizes that he must take step brother under his wing leave toxic family situation certain that either he or his brother might one day follow fathers footsteps as angry frustrated individuals this is one better hindi films ive managed view all which have been recommended via imdbs top 250 lists over past few years not all have been worthy inclusion so catching good one now then has been rare treat one head scratcher this film however was presented by eighty year old patient hospital who enjoyed rohans story about chandu his bicycle man responded one rohans observations by stating day destroys night night divides day try run try hide break through other side it sounded like cryptic reply intended appreciate rohans ambition as future writer but all it did was make me wonder what are odds eighty year old hindi man would be quoting line 1967 song by jim morrison doors,0.4452323991797675,0.058888699020277956,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Superb,"There are few films on father-son in Bwood, KAASH(1987), AKELE HUM AKELE TUM(1995) are some of them. UDAAN released in 2010 when rubbish films like Golmaal 3 were superhits, UDAAN got critical acclaim but flopped at the BO sadly The film however was selected at Cannes and got cult status plus some awards. The film is treated in a superb manner, it starts off with the hero(Rajat Barmecha) getting expelled as he was watching a movie bunking school, then he comes to his house in Jamshedpur where he is treated harshly by his father Ronit Roy. the whole film deals with his trials and tribulations and leaves a huge impact. TZP is one of the best child based films in India, but UDAAN is also superb and less commercial. There are several superb scenes: The spat between Ronit and Rajat in Ram Kapoor's house, the clash between Rajat and his step brother, Ronit Roy confronting Rajat after knowing of his results, Ronit making Rajat race every morning, Ronit Roy- Ram Kapoor clash scene and outburst of Rajat and the climax The film at 2:20 hours run time is superb though at times it does get slow paced but the handling is deftDirection by Vikramaditya Motwane is superb Music is superb and is used as background score and blends wellRonit Roy made a terrible debut in Bollywood with JAAN TERE NAAM(1993) which was a runaway hit though, he played younger brother to Ajay Devgn in the flop HULCHUL(1995) and then moved to TV and won stardom with Kasauti and some shows He is back in UDAAN and leaves a terrific impact The film is a perfect showreel for him and he makes the best of it Rajat is superb too in his role, he is a welcome addition in the list of talented child artists Ram Kapoor is delightful in his role, recently seen in itsy bitsy roles in EMAT and Agent Vinod, he has a meaty role and does a great job Amongst his friends in school Manjot Singh is funny and all are good too The film casts most unknown films and all leave a mark Rajat's step brother too is a natural",superb,there are few films father son bwood kaash 1987 akele hum akele tum 1995 are some them udaan released 2010 when rubbish films like golmaal 3 were superhits udaan got critical acclaim but flopped at bo sadly film however was selected at cannes got cult status plus some awards film is treated superb manner it starts off with hero rajat barmecha getting expelled as he was watching movie bunking school then he comes his house jamshedpur where he is treated harshly by his father ronit roy whole film deals with his trials tribulations leaves huge impact tzp is one best child based films india but udaan is also superb less commercial there are several superb scenes spat between ronit rajat ram kapoors house clash between rajat his step brother ronit roy confronting rajat after knowing his results ronit making rajat race every morning ronit roy ram kapoor clash scene outburst rajat climax film at 2 20 hours run time is superb though at times it does get slow paced but handling is deftdirection by vikramaditya motwane is superb music is superb is used as background score blends wellronit roy made terrible debut bollywood with jaan tere naam 1993 which was runaway hit though he played younger brother ajay devgn flop hulchul 1995 then moved tv won stardom with kasauti some shows he is back udaan leaves terrific impact film is perfect showreel him he makes best it rajat is superb too his role he is welcome addition list talented child artists ram kapoor is delightful his role recently seen itsy bitsy roles emat agent vinod he has meaty role does great job amongst his friends school manjot singh is funny all are good too film casts most unknown films all leave mark rajats step brother too is natural,0.6533333333333333,0.39952380952380956,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.17}"
