10.0,An Emotional and Light Hearted Journey !!!!,"It is one of the best performances by Chiyaan Vikram. Right from the first scene when he is thrown on street till the last court sequence, he is there playing his part well. Anyone who watches the movie will love Krishna. Such is Vikram's performance as he brings out the innocence of the character well. As a father, friend and guide, he is scintillating.Sarah is rare find. She is cool in her emotions and performs with ease. It's a different Anushka in 'Deiva Thirumagal'. No glamour but leaves a mark with her decent portrayal.Amala Paul impresses in few scenes. There is Nasser, playing his part as advocate and Santhanam is good not just in humour but also in emotional scenes.Nirav Shah's extraordinary visuals and G V Prakash Kumar's music are life and blood to the tale. Na Muthukumar's lyrics add pep to the songs. Vijay has handled things in a mature manner. He is sure to leave an impression.One should watch this film in theaters to see the story and how it unfolds,because it has a great visual grip over you.This movie wasn't made with mega budget or keeping 'hero image' in mind. It is a movie made for a story to be told. Worth your money.

10.0,Unconditional Love well portrayed.,"Deiva Thirumagal - Must watch in a theater. The bond between 'Krishna' and 'Nila' and the way they have portrayed it will never be forgotten for a long time. We couldn't control our tears towards the end of the movie. Perfect blend of all elements - Music, Screenplay, Dialogues, Camera and acting.. Can never be made better. Music by GV Prakash is fabulous. The theme music still plays back in my mind.Vikram - Bow down to your acting, sir!Baby Sarah as Nila - Great potential.. Very cute acting and her cuteness is the ultimate emotional factor in this movie!Santhanam's comedy is good, but is not very hilarious.Anushka did justice to her role.Amala Paul - Artificial acting apparent.The movie is absolutely fabulous and you will come out of the movie hall with a heavy heart and a smile on your face!!",unconditional love well portrayed,deiva thirumagal must watch theater bond between krishna nila way they have portrayed it will never be forgotten long time we couldnt control our tears towards end movie perfect blend all elements music screenplay dialogues camera acting can never be made better music by gv prakash is fabulous theme music still plays back my mind vikram bow down your acting sir baby sarah as nila great potential very cute acting her cuteness is ultimate emotional factor this movie santhanams comedy is good but is not very hilarious anushka did justice her role amala paul artificial acting apparent movie is absolutely fabulous you will come out movie hall with heavy heart smile your face,0.5438312894834634,0.17835377183203266,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.2}"

6.0,Polished version for the polished audience,"The movie starts off in a pretty off-beat manner. If only the same bit of off-beat attitude was maintained for the rest of the movie, this movie would have been a better experience for me. The director treats the viewer the same way he is treating Vikram's character. The movie is very simple and laid in a format that will connect with a majority of the audience. Hence the only part where the movie really steers away from the regular path is the performance department. Both Vikram and Sarah has done a brilliant job. In fact, I have fallen in love with Sarah's acting. It is just amazing. And Anushka is doing something other than flaunting her beautiful curves and she pulls it of brilliantly too. And moreover being an inspiration from I am Sam (which I haven't watched), there will be a lot of comparisons. But viewing this as a single movie without comparing it, I would say it was a decent movie. Watchable once with minor episodes of boredom.",polished version polished audience,movie starts off pretty off beat manner if only same bit off beat attitude was maintained rest movie this movie would have been better experience me director treats viewer same way he is treating vikrams character movie is very simple laid format that will connect with majority audience hence only part where movie really steers away regular path is performance department both vikram sarah has done brilliant job fact i have fallen love with sarahs acting it is just amazing anushka is doing something other than flaunting her beautiful curves she pulls it brilliantly too moreover being inspiration i am sam which i havent watched there will be lot comparisons but viewing this as single movie without comparing it i would say it was decent movie watchable once with minor episodes boredom,0.5498505880084826,0.24317042606516295,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,Deiva Thirumagal,"Love is what the world expects, if we see this movie we will get that for sure, at least we would think about the movie for 2 days after watching it. The Baby Sara has done her best, But full credit goes to Chiyan Vikram and Director Vijay. Heroines have done their roles. Comedy sequence with MS.Baskar and Pandy was the only black mark in this movie, it showed too much vulgarity in the movie. If its not there this would have got 10 points for sure from all rating sites.Music GV Prakash rocks with all the songs and Background music. The court sequence in this movie totally made everyone in the movie theatre silent and i felt what love is and eagerly waiting to see Vikram getting another national award to hi pocket, And the baby child too will join hands with him.Final Note: Please share your love to your surroundings.",deiva thirumagal,love is what world expects if we see this movie we will get that sure at least we would think about movie 2 days after watching it baby sara has done her best but full credit goes chiyan vikram director vijay heroines have done their roles comedy sequence with ms baskar pandy was only black mark this movie it showed too much vulgarity movie if its not there this would have got 10 points sure all rating sites music gv prakash rocks with all songs background music court sequence this movie totally made everyone movie theatre silent i felt what love is eagerly waiting see vikram getting another national award hi pocket baby child too will join hands with him final note please share your love your surroundings,0.5936507936507935,0.25595238095238093,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Vikram is back,"Deiva Thirumagal (2011) is Vikram's show from Scene One. After the depressing Raavanan (2010), here he is, playing the role of a lifetime. The audience will be engulfed in the character's web of emotions that are on simultaneous display. Krishna (Vikram) is a mix of joy, perplexity, hope, helplessness and disappointment, all at once. He turns on the required emotion at will and makes the scene his own.However, I cannot say the same about the director, Vijay. He had the script of I am Sam (2001) in hand and decided to stick to it completely rather than correct the mistakes and improve the aesthetics. You cannot help but think that a more capable director with the same cast and story-line could have turned it into pure magnificence. Whatever said and done, this film is still worth applauding. Even Anushka has done her role to perfection. Nasser has always been a powerhouse and in this movie as Mr Bashyam - he brings class and maturity once again. Its been quite a while since courtroom scenes occupied such prominence in Indian movies and they have been shot well. The climax is heart-rending but very real and sensible. Nila & Krishna will not not be forgotten by tamil audiences anytime soon.",vikram is back,deiva thirumagal 2011 is vikrams show scene one after depressing raavanan 2010 here he is playing role lifetime audience will be engulfed characters web emotions that are simultaneous display krishna vikram is mix joy perplexity hope helplessness disappointment all at once he turns required emotion at will makes scene his own however i cannot say same about director vijay he had script i am sam 2001 hand decided stick it completely rather than correct mistakes improve aesthetics you cannot help but think that more capable director with same cast story line could have turned it into pure magnificence whatever said done this film is still worth applauding even anushka has done her role perfection nasser has always been powerhouse this movie as mr bashyam he brings class maturity once again its been quite while since courtroom scenes occupied such prominence indian movies they have been shot well climax is heart rending but very real sensible nila krishna will not not be forgotten by tamil audiences anytime soon,0.39571428571428563,0.126734693877551,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7.0,Eternal sunshine of spotless mind,"""I am Sam "" is one of the best movies done on the subject of a person with subnormal intelligence & issues of child custody associated with the same. The movie had one of the best performances ever by Sean Penn & was realistic to the core with a pragmatic ending. When an Indian adaptation of the same is made one might not think of anyone other than KamalHassan or Vikram to reprise the role. Also it would invariably have all those additive elements that a commercially viable movie should have according to trade.""Deiva Thirumagal"" is an adaptation of ""I am Sam"" presented in a palatable manner for the Tamil audience. With judicious mixture of melodrama , feel-goodedness , mindless comedy , comic-book song sequence & excellent acting , ""Deiva Thrirumagal"" has in it to become a commercial hit. Though the movie is ""filmy"" to the core Vijay has managed to present a tale which intrinsically has the danger of getting boring in an interesting manner. Never once in the 2 hour 30 minute stay in the theater one gets uninterested in the proceedings. Vikram is excellent in his portrayal of the protagonist with subnormal intelligence. There is always a danger of portraying such a character either comically or theatrically but Vikram has managed it with élan. The body language , dialog delivery & demeanor clinically depicts the joy , agony , anger & sorrow of the character of Krishna , a grown up child with the mental age of 5. Anushka is adequate in her role of a struggling young lawyer who takes up the protagonist's case. Amala Paul has nothing much to do while Nasser is as good as ever. Shanthanam is comical with his characteristic one liners. The supporting cast are good .Nirav Shah's cinematography is outstanding as ever. Technically the movie is brilliant. Vijay has once again vindicated that he is one of the most promising young director in Tamil cinema today with his ""Deiva Thirumagal "" which is a worthy follow-up to his brilliant ""Madarasapatinam"".On the whole , ""Deiva Thirumagal"" is a must watch especially to Savior Vikram's acting. Bottomline : Eternal sunshine of spotless mind.",eternal sunshine spotless mind,i am sam is one best movies done subject person with subnormal intelligence issues child custody associated with same movie had one best performances ever by sean penn was realistic core with pragmatic ending when indian adaptation same is made one might not think anyone other than kamalhassan or vikram reprise role also it would invariably have all those additive elements that commercially viable movie should have according trade deiva thirumagal is adaptation i am sam presented palatable manner tamil audience with judicious mixture melodrama feel goodedness mindless comedy comic book song sequence excellent acting deiva thrirumagal has it become commercial hit though movie is filmy core vijay has managed present tale which intrinsically has danger getting boring interesting manner never once 2 hour 30 minute stay theater one gets uninterested proceedings vikram is excellent his portrayal protagonist with subnormal intelligence there is always danger portraying such character either comically or theatrically but vikram has managed it with lan body language dialog delivery demeanor clinically depicts joy agony anger sorrow character krishna grown up child with mental age 5 anushka is adequate her role struggling young lawyer who takes up protagonists case amala paul has nothing much do while nasser is as good as ever shanthanam is comical with his characteristic one liners supporting cast are good nirav shahs cinematography is outstanding as ever technically movie is brilliant vijay has once again vindicated that he is one most promising young director tamil cinema today with his deiva thirumagal which is worthy follow up his brilliant madarasapatinam whole deiva thirumagal is must watch especially savior vikrams acting bottomline eternal sunshine spotless mind,0.4662878787878786,0.18806818181818177,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
