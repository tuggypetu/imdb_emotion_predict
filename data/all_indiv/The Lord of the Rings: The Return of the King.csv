10.0,All Good Things come to an End!,"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some...",all good things come end,all threads tolkiens magnum opus come together most elegant fashions final part peter jacksons adaptation humanity makes last stand at minas tirith hobbits travel through mordor our heroes try by time frodo complete his mission evil sauron gets tired whole game lashes out with all his might fury return king is 4 hours payoff third act gigantic epic rather than mere film its own as such it is intensely dramatic dynamic you can very much sense that though peter jackson spared no effort previous episodes this is clearly his favorite film floats by at thunderous pace taking us through unforgettable moments such as battle minas tirith itself marvel seamless animation epic film making it demands be seen as it has too many jaw dropping moments choose quieter character moments keep gaining potency full weight stakes their heartbreaking consequences is never doubt cast these films have played their parts perfection again jackson deserves overall credit choosing actors that so perfectly match tlolkiens creations ian mckellen christopher lee are their own usually excellent selves hobbits remain endearing but all uniformly great cast true standouts are viggo mortensen david wenham as tragic faramir whose relationship with his brutish father is most traumatic film jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at few key moments practice employed powerful effect by tolkien books daring undertaking that works wonders though he may offer one ending too many he does have decency show off each surviving character with appropriate screen time respect now that trilogy is complete it can be viewed as one big film as it should be after 8 years jackson has done impossible he has taken tolkiens huge legend made films that stand their own have revolutionized film making setting new benchmark cinematic epics changes have been made tolkiens source novels but they make better more fluid films more faithful spirit tolkiens myth than anyone had right hope masterpiece whether as part bigger whole or its own well deserving all high praise thrown at it then some,0.5639592046371706,0.19534595348154668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.46}"

10.0,Pretty much outstanding,"I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",pretty much outstanding,i admit it i love all three lord rings films people may say return king is best trilogy some may say it is worst i personally think two towers is best its scope better exploration some characters but while it is still great return king is better than fellowship ring my only slight disappointment is ending it does feel overlong bloated me almost as if there was more than one ending filmed that said what does make ending at least watchable me is way it is shot marvellous score performance gollum despite this minor discrepancy return king is extremely good my view one better best picture winners last decade peter jacksons direction is very impressive here scope is massive just dazzling watch all three films trilogy are very well made but return king defines term epic cinematography is mind blowing scenery is superb costumes make up are well tailored effects are superb dont distract too much lighting is authentic score is phenomenal fellowship ring had some ethereal rousing haunting charming themes whereas two towers was somewhat darker more complex return king merges these together result is perfect mixture charm darkness etherality complexity story is compelling with themes friendship strength loyalty screenplay is well written literate while film is very long three hours or so fly by seamlessly characters are engaging aragorn is even more interesting here than he is previous films while gollum continues steal every scene he appears acting is very good orlando bloom who i can find dashing yet uncharismatic bland john rhys davies are given less do but do carry their parts very well elijah wood is likable enough sean astin captures sam perfectly provides heart picture viggo mortenssen is at his charismatic best here ian mckellen is perfectly cast while design gollum is still superb andy serkis is equally phenomenal i was slightly disappointed by lack any sarauman but i was more than i was satisfied with final result all all outstanding entry great trilogy 10 10 bethany cox,0.6057377049180328,0.3766939890710383,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10.0,Unprecedented.,"Peter Jackson has done it. He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?Perfect.I've never seen a series like this. A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible? I have always loved the original ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where ""Two Towers"" ends, so brush up before seeing it. I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done ""right"". And when it happened, it was. I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.The cast comes through once more. The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power. The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along. The battles are monumentally huge and exciting. There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather. And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years. It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no ""Rings"" movie in 2004. I will miss this talented group of actors.As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. This film is so much more than a simple ""fantasy"" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been.I will miss looking forward to a new ""Rings"" movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a ""Top 40"" soundtrack. George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase.Each film has earned a ""10"" from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity. This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors. The Academy had better not look over this film for ""Best Picture"" of 2003. To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.",unprecedented,peter jackson has done it he has created all encompassing epic saga tolkiens lord rings books after coming away final chapter how does this rate not only as film its own but as part whole perfect ive never seen series like this trilogy movies created with such love care utter perfection craft that you cant help but walk away wonder how did peter jackson make this possible i have always loved original star wars indiana jones series their epic storytelling just just fitting as great moment cinema this should be will be remembered with as much revered fondness generations come they do not make films like these anymore as stand alone film it picks up immediately where two towers ends so brush up before seeing it ive read books anticipation seeing some more profound moments this film made me kind view it with rushed sense perspective i wanted make sure everything this film was done right when it happened it was i will need see this again enjoy everything more casual level cast comes through once more musical score retains its beauty elegance power special effects notably gollum again are nothing less than breathtaking simply move story along battles are monumentally huge exciting there are some liberties taken with story especially during end with homecoming yet everything that needed be covered regarding main characters was handled after greatest moment series resolves itself story provided breather gives good bye friends seen screen last three years it was truly bittersweet feeling realizing that there will be no rings movie 2004 i will miss this talented group actors as with first two film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it this film is so much more than simple fantasy epic its story about strength character friendship loyalty love while every member fellowship has their part play i finally understood why some critics have said this series is story about sam its his unwavering resolve that led quest its victory sean astin is true credit adding inspirational heart this epic as as far as ending goes they ended it way that it had be ended jackson ended this film way it should have been i will miss looking forward new rings movie but these movies provide hope that high quality films can still be made without special effects taking over story bathroom humor or top 40 soundtrack george lucas could learn lot these films about how not alienate fanbase each film has earned 10 me last two years which me give is rarity this one however is as equally deserving as its two predecessors academy had better not look over this film best picture 2003 do so would be greatly disrespectful craft care that anyone involved with these films put into them,0.6288270803270801,0.3314949494949495,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,They saved the best for last,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10",they saved best last,obviously im aware fact that lord rings trilogy is actually one giant movie but since it was released parts thats how im judging them return king is final chapter since it is climax resolution epic journey it has little more intensity urgency than previous installments at this point everyone has come know love all characters stakes have become tremendously high kingdoms are at their knees only two characters who can save day are getting weaker weaker tension was very high this episode i can honestly say that out all 3 this was only one that had me edge my seat there were many memorable scenes one my favourites including part with giant spider that made this classic that it is sure stay decades come this is longest series mostly because ending that seems last while this was good ending i can see why frodo did what he did he us audience have gone through incredible ordeal i think we needed that 20 minute linger when battle is over celebrations have ended there is sad emptiness felt films spanned over 3 years there have been extended cuts course but after that its all over peter jackson gave us ending that was both appropriate admirable these were some amazing movies this one particular is best my opinion as whole lord rings is phenomenon absolute phenomenon much more than just movies they have universal appeal have touched hearts imaginations millions im one them sorry if im being all fanboyish kissing this movies ass but i really admire it it may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems be movie event century there will never be another lord rings film thats bit depressing my rating 10 10,0.5738689458689458,0.21915811965811968,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Perfect way to finish the trilogy,"Finally, the last movie in the series. Finally, Peter Jackson makes his intentions clear. Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion.The centrepiece of the film is the battle for Minas Tirith, a huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before. An army of 300,000 riders on the heroes who defend their city with courage and spirit. Dragons fly down from the sky, huge boulders are tossed back and forth, and an army of trolls and oliphants are sent in to obliterate the heroes. Everything is dark and gruesome; Jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic and gruesome deaths which somehow make the 12A certificate a bit of a joke. Men are decapitated, crushed, impaled, and burnt. Heads fly over city walls and the viewer just sits and gapes at the magnificence of it all.The casting is excellent. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen come into their own. Billy Boyd is given serious stuff to deal with now, not just comic relief: his singing over the death of the soldiers is extremely moving and a stand against all generals who sit back and send their men to certain death. Miranda Otto comes into her own. The new character of Denethor is great, just as in the book. Legolas and Gimli are still there, although on the sidelines as always. But the real emotion comes from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin: this pair are brilliant, and their final journey to Mount Doom will bring tears to anybody's eyes through the heartache involved. Gollum is a force to be reckoned with this time and cannot be forgotten.After the slow build-up of the initial hour, things explode in cinematic heaven. The battles are amazing, topped by the arrival of the ghost army, sheer brilliance. Shelob is a wonderful special effect and extremely frightening. There is so much to love and thankfully the powerhouse ending doesn't disappoint. The only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before the credits, and Jackson fills the final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening. Sadly, it doesn't spoil what's come before; I just tune out at this part.",perfect way finish trilogy,finally last movie series finally peter jackson makes his intentions clear now we realise that first two movies this series were just build up this epic film masterful masterpiece flawless work cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short i dont have much say about this i dont want spoil anything but this is big one it completely blows other two great movies out water suddenly everything is more adult more dramatic ten times emotion you could call it emotional roller coaster ride certainly jackson touches nerves heart strings more than one occasion centrepiece film is battle minas tirith huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before army 300 000 riders heroes who defend their city with courage spirit dragons fly down sky huge boulders are tossed back forth army trolls oliphants are sent obliterate heroes everything is dark gruesome jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic gruesome deaths which somehow make 12a certificate bit joke men are decapitated crushed impaled burnt heads fly over city walls viewer just sits gapes at magnificence it all casting is excellent ian mckellen viggo mortensen come into their own billy boyd is given serious stuff deal with now not just comic relief his singing over death soldiers is extremely moving stand against all generals who sit back send their men certain death miranda otto comes into her own new character denethor is great just as book legolas gimli are still there although sidelines as always but real emotion comes elijah wood sean astin this pair are brilliant their final journey mount doom will bring tears anybodys eyes through heartache involved gollum is force be reckoned with this time cannot be forgotten after slow build up initial hour things explode cinematic heaven battles are amazing topped by arrival ghost army sheer brilliance shelob is wonderful special effect extremely frightening there is so much love thankfully powerhouse ending doesnt disappoint only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before credits jackson fills final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening sadly it doesnt spoil whats come before i just tune out at this part,0.61672952468407,0.17624240237876598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,The first great cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century.,"I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck me as being among the worst films ever made. I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has disappointed me. The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the kingdom of Gondor. The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen, even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding. Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard Shore's memorable musical score. So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo Mortensen or Bernard Hill. Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed? Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.",first great cinematic masterpiece twenty first century,i am i admit unlikely convert religion tolkienism i have never read books having i thought been put off them life by sort obsessive freaks who read them when i was at school one classmate then aged about sixteen told me with great pride that he had read whole lord rings at least fifty times i also have never been great admirer sword sorcery school fantasy writing or film making indeed some this genre mostly those starring current governor california struck me as being among worst films ever made i was however persuaded see first trilogy fellowship ring by its overwhelmingly positive reception critics was quickly won over by scope peter jacksons vision i had been expecting some twee tale elves gnomes fairies what i experienced was genuine epic true sense that overused word ever since december 2001 i have been waiting parts two three trilogy be released neither has disappointed me story lord rings is too complex be told review such as this suffice it say that it revolves around magic ring which will give its possessor immense power power hungry dark lord sauron figure who is never actually seen screen desires obtain ring order dominate middle earth his enemies led by wizard gandalf are seeking destroy ring which can only be used evil purposes not good at beginning final part trilogy saurons forces are massing attack kingdom gondor film relates story conflict which follows this leads some most spectacular battle sequences i have seen even more impressive than those two towers inevitably film makes much use computer generated effects but unlike many films dominated by special effects plot character are not neglected acting is uniformly good some cases outstanding special mentions must also go camera work which made best possible use magnificent new zealand scenery howard shores memorable musical score so looking forward oscar ceremony i have no doubt that this should be best film that peter jackson who has amply fulfilled promise shown excellent heavenly creatures should be best director best actor i would find it difficult decide between competing claims sir ian mckellen who brings wisdom kindliness required touch steel his portrait gandalf elijah wood who plays brave resourceful hobbit frodo whom falls dangerous task ensuring rings destruction best supporting actor my own nomination would be sean astin as frodos loyal companion sam but several others might have claims notably viggo mortensen or bernard hill is this best movie ever made as some its admirers have claimed possibly not that is after all very large claim make i have no doubt however that trilogy as whole is first great cinematic masterpiece twenty first century it has certainly inspired me start reading tolkiens original novels 10 10,0.573952380952381,0.26816594516594516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,I lived to see them all!,"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied ""The Lord of the Rings"" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.",i lived see them all,i am awe knowledge some reviewers ive been disappointed with virtually every film version beloved book that i have seen i have not studied lord rings though i have read trilogy twice parts several times i know what scholar tolkien was admire his work linguistics as well as storytelling two entities do not need cross over if one really wanted make book you would have about two hours poetry 56 hour movie movie making is unfortunately forced play by different rules first all this film could not have been made until now imagine people dressed as trees remember those old superman serials where whenever man steel flies he becomes animated now that is genuinely bad what peter jackson did here will be his legacy had he died day film was complete he would go down film history everything is set up ring must be returned frodo is drunk with power is latched by forces evil those continuing quest must face ultimate some do gollum is way using his wiles drive ring back him visual magnificence mount doom mordor are unbelievable one thing that is never mentioned is incredible acting most characters jackson may be master spectacle but frodos character is mass impulses expressions he believes he is going die is afraid do you see little bit christianity mixed here im not going down that road because course bible is epic too has its own story this is movie about how friendship loyalty sacrifice will out against evil evil is so remarkable so oppressive i cant begin talk terms other reviewers but i do need make sure that i weigh this film other two because this is product our society that we can all be proud,0.5519607843137255,-0.03966503267973857,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,The Supreme Motion Picture of All Time...,"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is by far the most moving, inspirational and epic of the three parts in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece. After proving that this trilogy can carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film, and that fantasy can be surreal, but grounded to reality.I saw this film at 8:00 PM, and missed school the following day -- exactly similar to The Two Towers when it was released. After seeing The Return of the King I was speechless. Never before had a film made such an impact on me as this conclusion did, and now with it completed, The Lord of the Rings is truly the best of the best.Jackson has treated this trilogy as one film, following to Tolkien's linear time-line, and not the way the books were written, which makes this a film that flows and never loses track of pacing. The dialogue is emotional, be it the speech between Gandalf and Pippin before the gates of Minas Tirith, or inspirational, such as the rousing deliveries by Theoden and Aragorn. The vast emotion makes this a film for the ages. Following our heroes adventure since film one, we have grown compassion for each and everyone of them. Sam's devotion to Frodo is something that can inspire, and the eu-catastrophe is fully used here once again, because just as it seems that all hope has been lost, it shines through the void and victory is achieved. If one were to fear that the ending would feel like there was no closure, then have none, because The Return of the King has a 20-minute denouement that goes as far as four-years into the future, and the ending on the shores of the Grey Havens brought me to tears.The special effects are nothing short of amazing. The blend of miniatures/bigatures and CGI is believable beyond comprehension, and the addition of New Zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples' wildest dreams. The level of detail on Minas Tirith is something no one has ever seen before, the massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts, and we see the Mumakil and the Fell Beasts in full fruition, as hinted in The Two Towers. What could've seem fatal, as cinematic history has shown before, is the introduction of Shelob the spider. The special effects team has created the most memorable spider in film history. She terrifies and drops jaws at the realism of such a beast.The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated, that the filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation to how epic it could've been. The scope is just extraordinary. The battle of the Pelennor Fields is so huge in the book, yet it has been fully realized in Jackson's film. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving, it's hard to think that any action could top what was previously seen, but it is done so with vision beyond imagination.Howard Shore's music is also some of the most impressive and beautiful orchestration ever done for film. Besting its predecessors, The Return of the King's score is pure genius. From the new theme for Gondor, to the moving Into the West, Shore's composition sweeps and soars. Now that each of the three films' complete recordings have been released, I strongly urge a fan of the music to buy them, because they really are the best of the best.The acting even surpasses the first two, having the evolution of each character add to the dramatic effect, be it the loss of a life, or the triumph over evil. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is like a Godsend. Sean Astin steals nearly every scene he is in as Sam, making us hope he helps Frodo get rid of the Ring of Power. Once again, Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. The full weight of the Ring is realized in this film, and Elijah Wood makes us see his struggle like the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers only hinted upon.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is remarkable. The battles are amazing, never making the film drag, and always heightening the tension. From the acting to the sound editing, this film delivers in what it promises, and that is the supreme motion picture of our lifetime, and many more years to come.",supreme motion picture all time,lord rings return king is by far most moving inspirational epic three parts peter jacksons take tolkiens fantasy masterpiece after proving that this trilogy can carry weight truly enormous body text with fellowship ring two towers jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought film that fantasy can be surreal but grounded reality i saw this film at 8 00 pm missed school following day exactly similar two towers when it was released after seeing return king i was speechless never before had film made such impact me as this conclusion did now with it completed lord rings is truly best best jackson has treated this trilogy as one film following tolkiens linear time line not way books were written which makes this film that flows never loses track pacing dialogue is emotional be it speech between gandalf pippin before gates minas tirith or inspirational such as rousing deliveries by theoden aragorn vast emotion makes this film ages following our heroes adventure since film one we have grown compassion each everyone them sams devotion frodo is something that can inspire eu catastrophe is fully used here once again because just as it seems that all hope has been lost it shines through void victory is achieved if one were fear that ending would feel like there was no closure then have none because return king has 20 minute denouement that goes as far as four years into future ending shores grey havens brought me tears special effects are nothing short amazing blend miniatures bigatures cgi is believable beyond comprehension addition new zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples wildest dreams level detail minas tirith is something no one has ever seen before massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts we see mumakil fell beasts full fruition as hinted two towers what couldve seem fatal as cinematic history has shown before is introduction shelob spider special effects team has created most memorable spider film history she terrifies drops jaws at realism such beast tension siege minas tirith is so highly anticipated that filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation how epic it couldve been scope is just extraordinary battle pelennor fields is so huge book yet it has been fully realized jacksons film final stand at black gate is so emotional involving its hard think that any action could top what was previously seen but it is done so with vision beyond imagination howard shores music is also some most impressive beautiful orchestration ever done film besting its predecessors return kings score is pure genius new theme gondor moving into west shores composition sweeps soars now that each three films complete recordings have been released i strongly urge fan music buy them because they really are best best acting even surpasses first two having evolution each character add dramatic effect be it loss life or triumph over evil viggo mortensen as aragorn is like godsend sean astin steals nearly every scene he is as sam making us hope he helps frodo get rid ring power once again andy serkis provides stirring great performance as smeagol gollum full weight ring is realized this film elijah wood makes us see his struggle like fellowship ring two towers only hinted upon overall lord rings return king is remarkable battles are amazing never making film drag always heightening tension acting sound editing this film delivers what it promises that is supreme motion picture our lifetime many more years come,0.5485571488696488,0.2278189634439634,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,A monumental film,"Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .",monumental film,feeling weary battle worn i have just staggered out cinema after three half hours special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures i had taken refreshments but barely touched them probably because film i had watched is one most mesmerising evocative inspiring awesome i have witnessed any big adventure epic not mention superb ensemble acting moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles colossal proportions convincing bloodshed beauty wonderment fantastic natural artificial landscapes cityscapes touches humour well paced dramatic tension human bonding that is moving enough just let you dry your eyes as unassuming credits flash by return king is greatest tolkien trilogy by new zealand director peter jackson although ive seen other two read book i felt it would also stand alone well enough people who hadnt done either storytelling is much more professional that first one which maybe laboured introduce so much information or second one which has little let up tension long battle scenes return king there is emotional sting at start as we watch transformation gollum warm fun loving guy murderous mutated wretch movie then moves deftly between different segments story sadness lovely soft focus liv tyler as fated arwen whose travails womans love succeeds having sword that was broken mended comradeship sam frodo sean astin elijah wood that is tested limits strong commanding presence gandalf ian mckellen who keeps eye things whilst turning oscar worthy performance ingenious very varied battle scenes mythical cities that rise out screen provide key plot elements this is fairy story human endeavour defeating power cliques triumph human spirit that could almost be compared wagners gotterdammerung it is fairy story without any sugary sweetness fairy story likes which hasnt been told so well before is even unlikely be done so well future haunting scream nasgul stays with you physical attractions are not airbrushed battles are about as far pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get ingenious monsters keep you edge your seat whole narrative maintains spirit if not archival detailed accuracy original makes you want read book or read book again worst i can say about it is that it is maybe tad long but not that youd notice,0.5319441487474275,0.17357621886310406,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,Part 3: It's Not Really the Thought that Counts,"Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit ""Chronological"" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.",part 3 its not really thought that counts,just as peter jackson felt that lotr had be made as one large three part cinematic piece i decided write my imdb review all three movies as single multi part essay click my screen name hit chronological view my reviews fellowship two towers i make no guarantees about quality consistence my review but i do guarantee that these three films offer very high very consistent quality beginning end acting cinematography art direction simply can not be beat which three movies is my favorite varies with my mood same holds true tolkiens books when i am immersed story rotk is my favorite when i simply want have fun with whole experience i love fellowship when i want something intense evocative thoughtful i go two towers frodo sam golem are their way mount doom their bodies nerves relationships have borne greatest burden middle earth rest fellowship is rallying defense minas tirith preparing even more deadly battles come heroism romance are incredibly moving when was last time you saw entire audience leaving theater after fantasy movie rubbing their eyes sets are breathtaking even moreso than previous two films casting acting are superb film delivers at every level is jewel trilogys well earned crown return king offers resolution all major story arcs lotr as with classic tolkien trilogy however you may be able predict some what will occur but never all it youll never guess how you will get there same fatalistic paradoxically unpredictable feeling tolkiens grand plots is present throughout rotk especially major theme rotk however is varied ways means heroism both intentional unintended tolkiens examination sacrifice heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle amazingly it all comes through films even more than previous two films jackson his writers took liberties with story line like others however this serves film better than simple adaptation one medium another by reordering some chronology adding scenes plot devices which are consistent with tolkiens world characterizations film makers actually do better job preserving concepts themes story than they could have with pure adaptation lengthy epilogue tolkiens book is greatly reduced reordered somewhat changed order work film some parts actually appear very early rotk some aspects tolkiens epilogue are disclosed two towers though not directly depicted but all really important components epilogue are at least strongly implied if not well illustrated rotk,0.4871658163265306,0.22900552721088435,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,My objective and unhyped view? Stunning. Simply stunning.,"Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film. For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent. Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well. I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes. There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end. To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!) This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent. Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension). Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role. I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things. Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny. Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish. He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way. It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment. Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game. Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was! This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film. Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film. It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.",my objective unhyped view stunning simply stunning,frodo sam continue their quest destroy ring led by untrustworthy gollum meanwhile rest fellowship prepare another battle hold human city against onslaught orcs if you check my other reviews you will note that i wasnt massive fan first two films i loved them but was not blind their faults however let me just lay my cards out here i was totally blown away by this film vast majority more that later narrative flowed really well where other two films had struggled really keep consistent here various strands work well together while characters have only brief times tell stories whole it manages it well i got feeling that film really let rip it knew this was ending it did feel that everything came together collection noise energy which really made it feel like final part trilogy rather than just stand alone film one area where film really stutters actually caused people leave cinema annoying numbers is ironically place where jackson is true book thats final 20 minutes there is clear scene where film ends however it then runs another 20 minutes which is mix scenes that all fade out like they were end joe public ie me i would have been happy not have all loose ends tied up way book does it film should have ended high with king being crowned etc but instead it seems crawl end way that is not line with momentum film if not whole trilogy this problem is minor grand scheme things but i would rather have left cinema my high than be made wonder whens this ending is this end now oh maybe this is it now but i do understand why it was done this way cast as they have been all way are excellent woods frodo changes well during this film while astin is touching his portrayal unerring friendship bloom rhys davis had less do but came into their own during battle scenes adding both action odd comic touch that still counts as one being accepted by audience as chance break tension mortensen is title character serves it well with mckellen also continuing his strong role i could list through whole cast but i will stick with noting two things firstly both monaghan boyd had bigger more meaningful roles rose them well secondly i continue with my belief second film that serkis is stand out actor trilogy his gollum is so much more than effect he is tragic fearsome hateful funny praise course goes special effects making this character tell so much with expression but pretend that work actor is secondary character as opposed look is foolish he deserved one two towers so i hope oscar goes his way it was shame not have screen time lee but film works well without him it was brave move by editors special effects do not stand out thats compliment even state art movies late i have been aware that i could be watching video game here i only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects even though majority film was this is how they should be used not as draw their own right but as part film whether it be massive battle scenes that are spectacular or animated spider or just fact that i forget that gollum is only effect i cannot fault its use effects or sheer visual feast that is this film i have tried not gush because there will be plenty others do that without me joining them but it is hard really fault this film it is strongest trilogy brings it all together really well it is emotional event more than film if jackson needs 20 minutes slow closure finish it his satisfaction then i can give him that return all hours wonderful cinema that he has given me,0.514219867434153,0.15715964590964587,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
,Summary: Film and extended DVD versions,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***Over the years, I've read Lord of the Rings four times. During the holiday season of 2003/4, I watched Return of the King four times. While I embraced ROTK as the third part of a dream come true, I was not totally happy, left wondering why so many things vital were missing. The 4-hour extended DVD version explains a lot.My biggest beef was on so much missing about Aragon, and I found most of them in the DVD. One of the vital elements in the Fellowship's strategy is to draw Sauron's eye away from Frodo, and here Aragon's role is crucial. The ""last debate"" in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it very clear, with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to Sauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist.Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas Tirith first and foremost as a HEALER, not as a king. The kingship comes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in the DVD, although still missing a lot of details from the book.Still disappointing, even for the DVD, is that so little is given to the story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate, although that's a least a slight improvement from the film version.Another disappointment is Aragon's arrival at the Pelennor Fields, which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book: amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships, Aragon's standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast: ""There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but seven stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought of mithril gold."" The treatment of Gandalf's confrontation of the Witch King in the DVD departs from the book, in which the two are locked in a face off, then Rohan's horns are heard and the Witch King swings around and leaves. What in heaven's name is in Peter Jackson's mind when he had Gandalf's staff broken by the Witch King. But this did explain a mystery that has been bugging me for a year  why Gandalf had to snatch a spear from the guard when he saved Faramir from the pyre of Denethor.Enough on the DVD.I shall be remiss if I do not pay tribute to Peter Jackson for the wonderful film he and his dedicated crew have created.Most inspired is the lighting of the beacons to summon help from Rohan. In the book, this is observed by Pippin in the ride to Minas Tirith. To satisfy Pippin's curiosity, Gandalf explains the background to him in a somewhat factual manner. Jackson turns this into one of the most exciting moments in the film, with aesthetically superb shots of the 13 beacons (yes, I counted them) being lit up in succession, accompanied by beautifully rousing music score, culminating in Theoden's heroic utterance of ""Rohan will answer"". Watching this has to be among the most uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema.Most poignant is the Faramir's suicidal attempt to retake Osgilaith, under the orders of an unloving father. Starting from the soldiers of Gondor filing out of Minas Tirith in what looks almost like a funeral march to the letting loose of the swarm of arrows by the orcs in Osgilaith, every image of this scene is so hauntingly heartrending. It reminds me of John Woo's favourite scenes, although here, the music is Pipppin's actual singing rather than adapted background music, rendering the tragic mood even more devastating.Directly opposite in mood is Rohan's charge in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Even if this mission is, in a way, equally suicidal, the spirit is sky high, radiating dauntless heroism and lust for battle. This scene also reminds me of the legendary battle scene in Spartacus (1960) which is universally recognised as the model in depiction of battle strategies. Rohan's charge in Pelennor Field, no the other hand, exemplifies heroism unsurpassed.Although ROTK is first and foremost the King's story, we should not forget, in the overall scheme of things, the ring bearers (no typo here because Frodo did acknowledge Sam as a fellow ring bearer in the end of the book). Elijah Wood and Sean Astin (particularly Astin) have played their roles to perfection. Towards the end of the quest, when Frodo's strength was almost fully spent, to hear Sam say ""I cannot carry it (the ring) for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you"" and not be moved, one will have to be a hopelessly and irreversibly hardened cynic. The background music, incidentally, is ""Into the west"".It is certainly a good sign that the general audience worldwide has reacted favourably to the long aftermath following the destruction of the ring, indicated that their capacity to appreciate has not been impaired by the proliferation of Hollywood style slam-bang endings. Viggo Mortensen's line to the Hobbits ""My friends, you bow to no one"" is delivered with sincerity and conviction. The final scene at the Grey Havens is graceful, touching, stylish. However, there is one shot that I must mention: Galadriel's final enigmatic, alluring, half-smiling glance at Frodo before she disappears into the ship. Cate Blanchett is among the most versatile actresses around today and in LOTR, she is Galadriel incarnate.",summary film extended dvd versions,spoilers spoilers over years ive read lord rings four times during holiday season 2003 4 i watched return king four times while i embraced rotk as third part dream come true i was not totally happy left wondering why so many things vital were missing 4 hour extended dvd version explains lot my biggest beef was so much missing about aragon i found most them dvd one vital elements fellowships strategy is draw saurons eye away frodo here aragons role is crucial last debate movie is totally inadequate explaining suicidal march black gate but dvd makes it very clear with additional scene aragon revealing himself sauron though palantir he is bait that sauron cannot resist another important aspect is that aragon comes into city minas tirith first foremost as healer not as king kingship comes afterwards this is again brought out additional scenes dvd although still missing lot details book still disappointing even dvd is that so little is given story eowyn faramir dialogue through which they come accept each other could very well be most beautiful entire book few shots dvd that trace development their relationship are far adequate although thats least slight improvement film version another disappointment is aragons arrival at pelennor fields which is hopelessly lame compared with original treatment book amidst despair rohan gondor soldiers witnessing approaching black ships aragons standard suddenly unfurls at main mast there flowered white tree that was gondor but seven stars were about it high crown above it signs elendil that no lord had borne years beyond count stars flamed sunlight they were wrought gems by arwen daughter elrond crown was bright morning it was wrought mithril gold treatment gandalfs confrontation witch king dvd departs book which two are locked face off then rohans horns are heard witch king swings around leaves what heavens name is peter jacksons mind when he had gandalfs staff broken by witch king but this did explain mystery that has been bugging me year why gandalf had snatch spear guard when he saved faramir pyre denethor enough dvd i shall be remiss if i do not pay tribute peter jackson wonderful film he his dedicated crew have created most inspired is lighting beacons summon help rohan book this is observed by pippin ride minas tirith satisfy pippins curiosity gandalf explains background him somewhat factual manner jackson turns this into one most exciting moments film with aesthetically superb shots 13 beacons yes i counted them being lit up succession accompanied by beautifully rousing music score culminating theodens heroic utterance rohan will answer watching this has be among most uplifting moments one can experience cinema most poignant is faramirs suicidal attempt retake osgilaith under orders unloving father starting soldiers gondor filing out minas tirith what looks almost like funeral march letting loose swarm arrows by orcs osgilaith every image this scene is so hauntingly heartrending it reminds me john woos favourite scenes although here music is pipppins actual singing rather than adapted background music rendering tragic mood even more devastating directly opposite mood is rohans charge battle pelennor fields even if this mission is way equally suicidal spirit is sky high radiating dauntless heroism lust battle this scene also reminds me legendary battle scene spartacus 1960 which is universally recognised as model depiction battle strategies rohans charge pelennor field no other hand exemplifies heroism unsurpassed although rotk is first foremost kings story we should not forget overall scheme things ring bearers no typo here because frodo did acknowledge sam as fellow ring bearer end book elijah wood sean astin particularly astin have played their roles perfection towards end quest when frodos strength was almost fully spent hear sam say i cannot carry it ring you mr frodo but i can carry you not be moved one will have be hopelessly irreversibly hardened cynic background music incidentally is into west it is certainly good sign that general audience worldwide has reacted favourably long aftermath following destruction ring indicated that their capacity appreciate has not been impaired by proliferation hollywood style slam bang endings viggo mortensens line hobbits my friends you bow no one is delivered with sincerity conviction final scene at grey havens is graceful touching stylish however there is one shot that i must mention galadriels final enigmatic alluring half smiling glance at frodo before she disappears into ship cate blanchett is among most versatile actresses around today lotr she is galadriel incarnate,0.4695841150719199,0.1152204502814259,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Brilliant. Simply brilliant,"Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.I could happily have sat through this again and again.

10.0,Quite Literally the Greatest Trilogy Ever Made,"I'm not sure what could be said about LOTR that hasn't already been said, other than that I personally think it's best trilogy ever put to screen, and I really can't think of anything close. Peter Jackson took on the most demanding project imaginable and created a series that will be remembered forever. He respected Tolkien's literature and stuck so incredibly close to the source material and translated it so effortlessly in such grand fashion. I highly recommend the extended editions, as they devote more time to building Middle Earth and developing their incredible characters ever further. 20 years later and the series still looks incredible, especially in 4K. What Jackson did here could never be replicated; he created the best trilogy ever made.",quite literally greatest trilogy ever made,im not sure what could be said about lotr that hasnt already been said other than that i personally think its best trilogy ever put screen i really cant think anything close peter jackson took most demanding project imaginable created series that will be remembered forever he respected tolkiens literature stuck so incredibly close source material translated it so effortlessly such grand fashion i highly recommend extended editions as they devote more time building middle earth developing their incredible characters ever further 20 years later series still looks incredible especially 4k what jackson did here could never be replicated he created best trilogy ever made,0.5580994152046784,0.37815789473684214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.57, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,A fantastic conclusion to a great trilogy,"After a brief prologue showing us how Sméagol came to get the ring and how he came to be the pitiful creature we know the film proper starts where The Two Towers left off; Sméagol is continuing with his plan to lure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelob's lair and Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard.When Pippin looks into the palantír, a sort of dark crystal ball, he sees the city of Minas Tirith under attack, unfortunately he himself is seen by Sauron. Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle.I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in order to end Sauron's reign once and for all.This is probably the best film of the trilogy, I can see why it raked in the awards, the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the Shire... even though I'm aware that this was in the book.

10.0,The greatest epic ever made,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is, hands down, among the most spectacular and magnificent films of all time.A short run-down of the plot: After the battle of Helm's Deep and Saruman's imprisonment in his tower Orthanc, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf re-group with Merry and Pippin in Isengard. There they learn that the army of Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the largest city of men - Minas Tirith in Gondor. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the steward of Gondor, of the threat from Mordor. Defenses are built up as the army of Sauron marches across the Pelennor Fields towards Minas Tirith. A distress call is sent to Rohan, still recovering from Helm's Deep. Rohan manage to muster a large army, and set out for Minas Tirith, but the battle has already begun. In the meantime, we continue with Sam and Frodo on their quest to destroy the One Ring.A major achievement of this epic film is the character development. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever, and manages to turn Frodo against Sam, who is desperately trying his best to get his old Frodo back. Merry and Pippin are no longer just a source of comic relief, both of them prove themselves worthy as they are split up for the final battle. We learn about the true bravery and potential of hobbits as Merry helps cut down the Witch King. Eowyn also proves herself in the film, as she defies her uncle and sets out to Pelennor fields with the other Rohirrim, and eventually destroys the Witch King, and makes a very feminist remark while doing so. We learn to loathe Denethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son, Faramir, who really hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor is reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead of Boromir, his brother. And then, right after that, Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide, and Faramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to, in a final attempt to please his father. And of course, Aragorn learns to accept his fate as the true king of men.In fact, the character development is so powerful that we actually participate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and agony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain as Frodo is turned against him. And, just briefly, we participate in Gollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy for Gollum and just for a brief moment, Frodo becomes the bad guy as he tries to take the ring back. All in all, Return of the King contains the most moving, emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy, and some of the best acting, especially from Sean Astin (Sam), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), John Noble (Denethor, he is very successful in adding depth to his character), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), and of course, Andy Serkis (Smeagol, and top-notch at it, just like in The Two Towers).The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic sequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields shows the true cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants; trolls are heavily used in the battle, as warriors and as beasts of burden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle, and while the Witch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book, the nine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do lots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul really are. And of course, the men from the south and their massive oliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt triumphant, in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly, as the Rohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The triumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves, as the Rohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won, but we're not happy, we're grieved for all the destruction, all the losses. It's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep, and makes this battle all the more superior.Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire trilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields and Osgiliath, Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's cave near Minas Morgul, Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact of these landscapes and images.Many people may complain about the changes in the movie, especially the significant cut of Saruman from the end, but you must realize that if they would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would have continued another hour and a half. Don't fret; Peter Jackson said the scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The ending is long enough as it is, and the film continues at least another half an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the shire, and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned king, and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course, one of the most moving scenes in the movie, in which Frodo gets on the last ship to the Undying lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the last of the elves (Galadriel and Elrond to name a few), and must part with his three hobbit friends for good.All in all, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one the most fine-tuned, cinematically perfect films ever made, it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history, and all three movies are together, without a doubt, the greatest epic ever made.",greatest epic ever made,lord rings return king is hands down among most spectacular magnificent films all time short run down plot after battle helms deep sarumans imprisonment his tower orthanc aragorn legolas gimli gandalf re group with merry pippin isengard there they learn that army sauron is planning full scale attack largest city men minas tirith gondor gandalf pippin ride minas tirith warn denethor steward gondor threat mordor defenses are built up as army sauron marches across pelennor fields towards minas tirith distress call is sent rohan still recovering helms deep rohan manage muster large army set out minas tirith but battle has already begun meantime we continue with sam frodo their quest destroy one ring major achievement this epic film is character development gollum becomes more cunning sneaky than ever manages turn frodo against sam who is desperately trying his best get his old frodo back merry pippin are no longer just source comic relief both them prove themselves worthy as they are split up final battle we learn about true bravery potential hobbits as merry helps cut down witch king eowyn also proves herself film as she defies her uncle sets out pelennor fields with other rohirrim eventually destroys witch king makes very feminist remark while doing so we learn loathe denethor because his hatred his last remaining son faramir who really hasnt done anything wrong peak our hatred denethor is reached scene where he tells faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead boromir his brother then right after that denethor sends faramir into certain suicide faramir immediately accepts mission he is appointed final attempt please his father course aragorn learns accept his fate as true king men fact character development is so powerful that we actually participate characters feelings we feel frodos exhaustion agony as he literally drags himself across mordor we feel sams pain as frodo is turned against him just briefly we participate gollums triumph as he finally gets one ring we are actually happy gollum just brief moment frodo becomes bad guy as he tries take ring back all all return king contains most moving emotional touching scenes entire trilogy some best acting especially sean astin sam elijah wood frodo ian mckellen gandalf john noble denethor he is very successful adding depth his character miranda otto eowyn course andy serkis smeagol top notch at it just like two towers battle pelennor fields may be most spectacular epic sequence film history unlike helms deep pelennor fields shows true cleverness saurons army orcs are not only participants trolls are heavily used battle as warriors as beasts burden nazgul are very significant battle while witch king didnt actually lead battle as he did book nine ringwraiths their fell beasts still play key part do lots damage battle we see just how powerful nazgul really are course men south their massive oliphaunts play significant part while helms deep we felt triumphant pelennor fields we only feel triumph briefly as rohirrim make their charge into horde orcs trolls triumph pelennor fields almost immediately dissolves as rohirrim are trampled down by oliphaunts battle is won but were not happy were grieved all destruction all losses its totally different feeling than helms deep makes this battle all more superior return king features most magnificent visuals entire trilogy whether they are minas tirith pelennor fields osgiliath mordor slopes mt doom or climb shelobs cave near minas morgul peter jackson really shows us true impact these landscapes images many people may complain about changes movie especially significant cut saruman end but you must realize that if they would have featured whole part with saruman movie would have continued another hour half dont fret peter jackson said scenes will all appear extended version film ending is long enough as it is film continues at least another half hour after ring is no more hobbits return shire sam marries rosie aragorn meets his fate is crowned king is finally reunited with arwen course one most moving scenes movie which frodo gets last ship undying lands with bilbo gandalf last elves galadriel elrond name few must part with his three hobbit friends good all all lord rings return king is one most fine tuned cinematically perfect films ever made its absolutely flawless every aspect lord rings trilogy as whole is spectacular achievement film making history all three movies are together without doubt greatest epic ever made,0.5582524985302763,0.20679379776601994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,"""Put aside the Ranger, become who you were born to be.""","Weary beyond words, Hobbit companions Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring, with the sinister Gollum still their guide. The film opens interestingly with Gollum's origin story, capturing his descent into depravity and madness, finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect it's bearer, and not for good.With the battle of Helm's Deep over and Saruman's power gone, the attention focuses on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy, while those visible are more of a threat than ever. ""The Return of the King"" in it's way is as much Aragorn's story as it is Frodo's; a reluctant noble struggling to find his destiny who comes to accept and eventually embrace it under the tutelage of the White Wizard Gandalf. The subtle subtext of Aragorn's relationship with Lady Arwen of the Elven realm leads to his triumph with no illusions for Eowyn, establishing a noble grace and dignity for the new King.Upon my second viewing of the entire trilogy, I was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn to the character of Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's faithful companion. This in large part to the excellent portrayal by Sean Astin, showing a range of emotions throughout the film that proffered him as the most well developed character of the story. He's a loyal friend through thick and thin, understanding clearly that by the journey's near end, Frodo's mind may no longer be his own.Gimli is another character to keep a close eye on for the understated humor John Rhys-Davies brings to the story. The personal competition he began with Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in ""The Two Towers"" finds comic resonance here; as Legolas brings down a rampaging olyphant on the Pelennor Fields, Gimli tempers his congratulations with ""That still only counts as one"" - marvelous! With the One Ring destroyed, so is Sauron's awesome power, and a quest resolved for the fortunes of mankind. The film's multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings in the viewer, those of loyalty, honor, love, sacrifice and friendship. As a unit, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy stand as probably the ultimate in cinematic adventure to this point in time. Truly, I can only make one suggestion to make the series even more poignant, that for a film that reveals the discovery of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins, the basis for the adventure that begins in ""The Hobbit"".",put aside ranger become who you were born be,weary beyond words hobbit companions frodo sam continue their journey destroy one ring with sinister gollum still their guide film opens interestingly with gollums origin story capturing his descent into depravity madness finding ring much same manner which he lost it ring has power affect its bearer not good with battle helms deep over sarumans power gone attention focuses capital gondor minas tirith there race men must make last stand before growing might unseen enemy while those visible are more threat than ever return king its way is as much aragorns story as it is frodos reluctant noble struggling find his destiny who comes accept eventually embrace it under tutelage white wizard gandalf subtle subtext aragorns relationship with lady arwen elven realm leads his triumph with no illusions eowyn establishing noble grace dignity new king upon my second viewing entire trilogy i was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn character samwise gamgee frodos faithful companion this large part excellent portrayal by sean astin showing range emotions throughout film that proffered him as most well developed character story hes loyal friend through thick thin understanding clearly that by journeys near end frodos mind may no longer be his own gimli is another character keep close eye understated humor john rhys davies brings story personal competition he began with legolas orlando bloom two towers finds comic resonance here as legolas brings down rampaging olyphant pelennor fields gimli tempers his congratulations with that still only counts as one marvelous with one ring destroyed so is saurons awesome power quest resolved fortunes mankind films multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings viewer those loyalty honor love sacrifice friendship as unit lord rings trilogy stand as probably ultimate cinematic adventure this point time truly i can only make one suggestion make series even more poignant that film that reveals discovery one ring by bilbo baggins basis adventure that begins hobbit,0.542203392813149,0.1730510681730194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,Awe-evoking.,"**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!!**Sequels are inherently difficult to make and review review, because on top of the usual expectations for a film, everyone has to deal with expectations created by the previous films. Return of the King faced expectations equal to those of any other film, and like the protagonists at Helm's Deep, fended them off and crushed them.ROTK begins where ""The Two Towers"" concluded. As Gandalf said at the end of TTT, ""The battle for Helm's Deep is over; the battle for Middle Earth has begun."" Frodo & Sam are still moving toward Mordor; Merry & Pippin are hanging out w/ the Ents at Isengard; and the rest of the fellowship has defeated the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep. With Saruman defeated, the focus now shifts east, where man must make a final stand against Sauron, while Frodo & Sam attempt to destroy the One Ring.As opposed to the breakneck opening scenes of TTT, ROTK starts slowly, but the early character development in lieu of action sequences is equally enjoyable and enlightening. Thank goodness for the deliberate beginning though, because if the intensity of the latter two-thirds of the film lasted for the full running time, paramedics would have been required on site to assist with heart failures and burst blood vessels, inevitable side effects of the remarkable tension that director Peter Jackson creates. Speaking of Jackson, let's hear it for him and his crew (pause for standing ovation).That crew has once again created a mythical world without a trace of fictitiousness. Through the jaw-dropping visualization of massive battles, fortresses, monsters, and more, the cinematography and effects uphold and improve the standard set by the predecessors. Gollum now has more to work with as an ""actor"", and the digital whiz kids step up to the challenge, blending him into the shots perfectly, particularly in a brilliant reflection scene. More sweeping battle scenes and more gorgeous landscapes are among the stellar shots lensed by Andrew Lesnie. The first shot of Minas Tirith stands to be my movie moment of the year; it will absolutely take your breath away. But the beauty lies in the fact that you scarcely know the difference between beautiful reality and equally natural effects. Outside of a couple apparent blue-screen shots, I never once doubted the veracity of the world of Middle Earth. Considering the enormity of that task, those at WETA Workshop who dazzled us with their talent deserve every award they get over the next couple months.On the musical front, Howard Shore is back as composer, and his work shines as never before. He provides grand and booming orchestral sounds when battles require them, yet still manages to evoke emotion without lapsing into melodrama during poignant scenes. Mixing and tweaking familiar themes with new melodies, Shore literally hits all the right notes. For the audience, picking out recognizable themes, such that of Rohan or the Fellowship, and hearing how Shore has kicked them into a minor key or altered those last two notes is a thrill. His score is a joy to listen to, both as it seamlessly meshes with the film and on its own. Perhaps there can be no higher compliment.Also of note is the use of vocal music voiced by the actors themselves, a technique that is new to the theatrical releases of LOTR. Of the two songs, I must mention the first one, which is utilized to stunning maximum effect. In a remarkable scene reminiscent of The Godfather, the song is sung over a scene that cuts between a character who made a decision and the grim consequences of that choice. The music, pictures, and variations in film speed combine for one of the best scenes of the year.None of the acting work stood out to me, and by that I mean no individual was head-and-shoulders above the rest. I could still make a legitimate Oscar case for at least four cast members (Astin, McKellen, Mortensen, Wood), which is a tribute to the overall strength of the ensemble cast. Everyone fits into and builds upon their roles so very well, and the camaraderie that I've seen glimpses of behind the scenes carries over wonderfully. The acting serves as a means rather than an end. A la ""Band of Brothers"", the combined ten hours of film allow time for the characters to be developed and known, an advantage fully used in ROTK, which has more fulfilling scenes packed with emotion where we see decisions being made. Those scenes are what elevate this film to another level. On top of the nonpareil action sequences that shame other ""epics"", it has a human soul, one that comes to the fore in final act, when the friendships that have been established take center stage. To me, friendship is the core theme of LOTR, and thanks to the fabulous acting of all participants, that theme is displayed in all its glory in ROTK.WARNING! THE NEXT PARAGRAPH DISCUSSES THE CLOSING SCENES!! In an unusual but welcome departure from the cinematic norm, the denouement of ROTK lasts a good twenty minutes after the climax. Too many movies, like ""Matrix Revolutions"", wrap too quickly, leaving fates either unresolved or resolved, but sloppily and unsatisfactorily. Others, such as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", do have an extended ending but don't require one and thus fill it with fluff. Here we find a perfect mean. Considering that Jackson and company have over ten hours of film and numerous character arcs to wrap up, twenty minutes is probably the minimum required to let the audience absorb all that has happened. After three or four possible end points, each of which concludes various stories, Sam returns to the Shire and enters his home, closing the door on both the camera and the trilogy. While the finish may seem odd, I consider it perfect. Sam has just come to the end of a fantastic adventure, a journey mirrored by that of the audience. The ending leaves each party back where they began, in a satisfying yet admittedly bittersweet manner. Like it or not, ""I'm back.""END OF MAJOR SPOILERS.Is this film perfect? Probably not. Sure, certain characters like Denehor could have been developed more. But while that knowledge would have been helpful, the time it would have taken to expound on those people likely would not have been worth the knowledge gained. There are a handful of other cardinal sins, such as scarcely showing the ultimate villain and Arwen's near random appearances. But most of those trace back to the original books, not to errors by Peter Jackson. The fact that the entire series works so well without fully disclosing many details speaks to the phenomenal power of Tolkien's books and superb work in Jackson's films. The bottom line is that nobody cares about the flaws because they're entranced by the literary and cinematic magic on display.Bottom Line: ROTK, the greatest final film in a trilogy of all time (go ahead...name a better one) culminates the best overall film trilogy ever, ten hours of film that transcend the medium. As I told my brother as we reluctantly but contentedly departed the theater, we will never experience anything like this again.

,"Not only the best of the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, but sets a new standard of epic filmmaking.","Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.",not only best lord rings series but sets new standard epic filmmaking,saying that this film starts where two towers left off is somewhat misleading film starts great distance walls helms deep return king opens with flashback smeagol andy serkis obtaining one ring power origin his deterioration into creature gollum this opening recaptures emphasis that was somewhat lost within epic battles two towers at thats ring first installment fellowship ring provided heaps exposition rings importance influence return king we see it pay off big time after armies isengard have been defeated due allegiance between theoden bernard hill king rohan elves main threat middle earth is now concentrated kingdom mordor controlled by dark lord sauron sauron has turned his eye towards realm gondor last free kingdom men wizard gandalf ian mckellan must warn denethor john noble steward gondor impending attack while aragorn viggo mortenson heir throne gondor theoden gather men aid against armies mordor dark lord sauron needs only regain one ring power conquer all middle earth two hobbits frodo elijah wood ring bearer sam sean astin must continue their journey directed by gollum mount doom only place where ring can be destroyed got all that if not you need bone up your lord rings before expecting follow this film since all three epics were filmed simultaneously each individually has feel being part larger picture except this one return king is just too big most epic set epic films now that director peter jackson has brilliantly constructed characters plotlines throughout first two films he puts them use all characters have their best moments within this film pair mischievous hobbits merry dominic monaghan pippin billy boyd are no longer tree ornaments they were two towers but are split up take their characters completely new directions aragorn played with unmatched sense honor by viggo mortenson is about meet his destiny as future king all men while andy serkis continues his expert portrayal gollum serkis provided not only voice gollum but also assisted during production by acting out scenes computer generated character with his fellow actors however real acting triumph film is elijah wood as frodo baggins he continues his descent into corruption with incredible talent that many could not pull off woods performance is so critical film because it determines rings power corrupt which needless say is absolute first two films established jackson as incredible visionary shooting vast landscapes his native new zealand with return king jackson really gets chance show off with hands down most beautiful visuals trilogy jackson makes return king gorgeous feast eyes while never resorting mcg level over topness jackson stays very grounded his characters not letting effects tell story but only assist wonderful dialogue characters think return as mix fellowship two towers with enough action character development worthy ending film event this magnitude bottom line fans films will not be disappointed hardcore tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes interpretations made by jackson other writers however it is unrealistic expect completely true adaptation novels being that film is entirely different medium despite alterations jackson consistently stays true major themes ideas original text while adding some finest filmmaking ever put screen lord rings return king is one most finely tuned cinematically perfect films ever made not only best trilogy but crowning achievement epic filmmaking,0.5378822951739618,0.2049680836139169,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,A Breathtaking Conclusion To Cinema`s Greatest Fantasy Epic,"It takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in cinema chains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker . How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!I do conclude there are some people in the world who can`t see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It`s simply explained , these epic movies aren`t a childish fantasy , they`re like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that it`s not a family film never mind a "" childish fantasy "" . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing appears CGI : Gollum isn`t computer generated he`s a living being and Peter Jackson doesn`t use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts , it`s like they`re appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlativeThere are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven . John Noble`s character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn`t sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we`re shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music. Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene which... It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it`s somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn`t ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it`s not , FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we`ll see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at lastAs for the Oscars themselves I`m puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shore`s score is beautiful and haunting but it`s far from original with much of the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT ( The Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but it`s shameful Andy Serkis wasn`t nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! I`ve no idea how John Lesnie`s camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we`ll see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesn`t stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson .

10.0,In many ways grander in scale than the first two installments of the trilogy.,"The hobbits approach the slopes of Mount Doom, preparing to dispose of the cursed Ring, while the forces of good and evil are rallied in anticipation of the ultimate battle. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the only time in history a fantasy film has done so.The Return Of The King is the longest of the three films, which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands, and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other, like jet planes waiting to land, the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. Most audiences will forgive Peter Jackson for that, for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subject; thrilling spectacle is underscored with palpable human drama, and it finally becomes clear why J.R.R. Tolkien's books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of so many.",many ways grander scale than first two installments trilogy,hobbits approach slopes mount doom preparing dispose cursed ring while forces good evil are rallied anticipation ultimate battle film won academy award best picture only time history fantasy film has done so return king is longest three films which suffers having cut between disparate story strands its final half hour stacks up endings one after other like jet planes waiting land director visibly reluctant let these characters go most audiences will forgive peter jackson that this is fitting conclusion series films made with tremendous artistry affection their subject thrilling spectacle is underscored with palpable human drama it finally becomes clear why j r r tolkiens books continue ring such bells so loudly lives so many,0.6126811594202899,0.11630434782608695,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,LOTR ROTK Review,"After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.At this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail.As before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever.Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style.If you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",lotr rotk review,after last two lord rings films journey so many heroes has come so far it all leads up this darkness falls upon all middle earth huge armies orcs march upon kingdoms men one ring comes closer its evil master could this be end world or start new beginning this final chapter film series starts off with incredibly moving sequence heartbreaking tale gollums origins it picks right back up where last films left off chronicling journey frodo sam gollum as they tread dark dangerous territory combating orcs one giant spider ultimately themselves as they approach threshold mount doom at same time film presents some biggest most epic scenes ever committed film battle minas tirith it is huge spectacle that fills up entire screen with thousands thousands orcs men war machines lumbering beasts nazg l cavalry massive elephants even ghosts it is long struggle that fills up most movies runtime but its always awe inspiring as if thats not enough film then brings battle gates mordor one grand climax even calm before each battle film remains as captivating as its predecessors thanks its style storytelling prowess if theres anything truly complain about it would be lengthy denouement overall however experience return king has never failed invoke feelings awe at this point characters film are well established intimately familiar but film does take its time explore more familiar faces elaborate fresh new characters they all come together contribute multiple conflicts tying every strand plot one epic climax its sublime union that makes everything three movies relevant provides satisfying closure all around many liberties are taken original novels but big screen it works generate best possible spectacle make plot work evenly themes war corruption addiction good evil adventure all prevail as before this film is crafted with excellent photography editing all major players return contribute fantastic performances their respective roles especially viggo mortensen who stands out more this film than before but it is always pleasure watch ian mckellen as gandalf along with rest fellowship all their allies writing is superb this production boasts some excellent sets props costumes special effects are huge at its time it was most groundbreaking generating biggest armies ever seen screen all at once despite aging bit effects are still impressive howard shores music score is as masterful as ever return king delivers best possible payoff lord rings trilogy it might even outshine hobbit saga end not only does it boast some biggest battles but it is also film with power beauty it has cemented itself as one my all time favorites was my number one favorite quite few years lord rings saga overall remains one most sublime marriages between spectacle storytelling style if you watch extended edition this film you will be treated about hour bonus scenes which offers lot excellent substance among additions there are longer battle scenes scene showing fate saruman wormtongue extended encounter with army dead parley with mouth sauron more i think most these scenes are really awesome this version film is definitely worth seeing 5 5 experience perfect story perfect film perfect,0.6162445887445888,0.30316355519480526,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"
