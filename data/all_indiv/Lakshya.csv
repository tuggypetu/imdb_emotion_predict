10.0,Lakshya!!What a movie,"I'm the kind of guy who enjoys mindless action movies as well as movies that are intelligent,sensitive&thought-provoking.Lakshya falls in the latter category. The promos were slick and the music sounded good.But when i read the box-office report on this movie i was surprised at the lukewarm response this movie got because i thought this movie would be a runaway hit.However what can people like us do when such gifted film-makers like Farhan Akhtar are discouraged because their movies don't spoon-feed facts to the audience.But all said and done,This is among my personal favourites and i'm giving it a 10/10.2004 has produced some mature and intelligent movies like Lakshya,Yuva,Hum Tum,Swades etc and i'm happy that film-makers are growing up.This movie inspired me a lot and has played a role in me realising the truth that we should always have an aim in life because a life without an aim is like a body minus the soul.+ points-Acting,Music(Background),Sound,Story,Tight Screenplay,Inspiring,Photography,Cinematography(nicely shot) -points-Length,Slow Pace,2nd half songs.",lakshya what movie,im kind guy who enjoys mindless action movies as well as movies that are intelligent sensitive thought provoking lakshya falls latter category promos were slick music sounded good but when i read box office report this movie i was surprised at lukewarm response this movie got because i thought this movie would be runaway hit however what can people like us do when such gifted film makers like farhan akhtar are discouraged because their movies dont spoon feed facts audience but all said done this is among my personal favourites im giving it 10 10 2004 has produced some mature intelligent movies like lakshya yuva hum tum swades etc im happy that film makers are growing up this movie inspired me lot has played role me realising truth that we should always have aim life because life without aim is like body minus soul points acting music background sound story tight screenplay inspiring photography cinematography nicely shot points length slow pace 2nd half songs,0.5303075396825397,0.2043650793650794,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,A must watch movie and yet another masterpiece from Farhan Akhtar...,"The movie is all about having a LAKSHYA (aim) in our lives. It would'nt be inappropriate at all to comment that this film in one way points out at today's indecisive youth who are not clear about what they are going to do of their lives, and change their focus every now and then.The story is about Karan (Hrithik Roshan) who is very talented but utterly confused about his future. Rather his girlfriend Romila (Preity Zinta) has since the very beginning ambition of being a news channel correspondent. Karan's indecisiveness widens the gap between him and his father (Boman Irani) who expects nothing from his son and the same thing ultimately results in his breakup with Romila too. This changes Karan's life and he gets determined of getting in the army and passes out from the IMA (Indian Military Academy) with a very enviable record. At the same time Romila too becomes a successful news channel correspondent. But both of them don't know what their futures has in store for them. They meet again after the turmoil in Romila's life from a broken engagement and this time the backdrop is the picturesque Kashmir valley and the event being the Kargil war. Karan has been deputed there as an army officer and Preity comes for a live coverage of the war. The story now flows ahead with the attempt of Indian forces to get back peak no.5179 from the Pakistani forces and the intersection of Karan's and Romila's lives at many instances acting as the currents. The ending is predictable but yet you would love to watch it.The movie is yet another masterpiece from Farhan Akhtar,the Director after the tremendous success of ""Dil Chahta Hai"". This is also yet another testimony of Javed Akhtar's writing prowess. The lyrics and dialogues are superb. Moreover the choreography (Prabhu Deva) and photography (Christopher Popp) are worthy of praises. Hrithik Roshan gives another flawless performance after ""Koi Mil Gaya"". Another attraction is Colonel Sunil Damle (Amitabh Bachchan). Amitabh Bachchan gives those dialogues a beauty and charm which is so characteristic to himself. Preity Zinta is good in her role too. You can't pinpoint anybody or anything specifically as that would diminish other's efforts as all of them have performed commendably. The backdrop of Kashmir valley and the Himalayas has been so beautifully captured in the frame. Also the war scenes look so much authentic which is very tough job to do. The running time of the film is above 3 hours but you can't realize that ( you can't help it as you get fully engrossed in the film.....). Hrithik's dancing skills are unveiled so beautifully yet again. He can easily claim to have a rubber body--so flexible,so much in tune with the rhythm. Good music from Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy trio once again. Actually i could'nt think of any flaw in the movie as every aspect has been given it's due attention.I would claim it to be a must watch movie and rate it a hefty 8.5/10",must watch movie yet another masterpiece farhan akhtar,movie is all about having lakshya aim our lives it wouldnt be inappropriate at all comment that this film one way points out at todays indecisive youth who are not clear about what they are going do their lives change their focus every now then story is about karan hrithik roshan who is very talented but utterly confused about his future rather his girlfriend romila preity zinta has since very beginning ambition being news channel correspondent karans indecisiveness widens gap between him his father boman irani who expects nothing his son same thing ultimately results his breakup with romila too this changes karans life he gets determined getting army passes out ima indian military academy with very enviable record at same time romila too becomes successful news channel correspondent but both them dont know what their futures has store them they meet again after turmoil romilas life broken engagement this time backdrop is picturesque kashmir valley event being kargil war karan has been deputed there as army officer preity comes live coverage war story now flows ahead with attempt indian forces get back peak no 5179 pakistani forces intersection karans romilas lives at many instances acting as currents ending is predictable but yet you would love watch it movie is yet another masterpiece farhan akhtar director after tremendous success dil chahta hai this is also yet another testimony javed akhtars writing prowess lyrics dialogues are superb moreover choreography prabhu deva photography christopher popp are worthy praises hrithik roshan gives another flawless performance after koi mil gaya another attraction is colonel sunil damle amitabh bachchan amitabh bachchan gives those dialogues beauty charm which is so characteristic himself preity zinta is good her role too you cant pinpoint anybody or anything specifically as that would diminish others efforts as all them have performed commendably backdrop kashmir valley himalayas has been so beautifully captured frame also war scenes look so much authentic which is very tough job do running time film is above 3 hours but you cant realize that you cant help it as you get fully engrossed film hrithiks dancing skills are unveiled so beautifully yet again he can easily claim have rubber body so flexible so much tune with rhythm good music shankar ehsaan loy trio once again actually i couldnt think any flaw movie as every aspect has been given its due attention i would claim it be must watch movie rate it hefty 8 5 10,0.5323809523809524,0.24426118326118323,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.43}"

World-class production values and high father-son, soldier-soldier emotional content that's not forced (Like the overdone mess LOC). The war scenes were brilliant. People must remember, this film was NOT BASED ON KARGIL. Akhtar took the war as a backdrop to show Karan's transformation - his path from irresponsible and misguided childhood to manhood. This film was quite an experience. I just can't understand how this flopped (If grossing 22 Crores in India can be termed ""poor box office performance""). Man, my countrymen really take the cake. Garbage like Veer Zaara (Stunning locales, beautiful people, and amazing music, but overall POOR in terms of content) and Kal Ho Na Ho are lapped up by audiences, but Yuva and Lakshya are rejected completely.

8.0,Bang on Target! (Almost perfect ),"Farhan Akhtar has shown it once again! This man is amazingly creative and magical. His style is great and his efforts of making a movie which has something to be learnt from is fantastic. His movies are not just for entertainment, but also for inspiration. Lakshya is story of a boy who hasn't an aim, a LAKSHya in his life. He doesn't know what he wants to be or what he is good at. Karan Shergill played by Hrithik Roshan (a very sincere actor) is like any other person who wants to know what he wants to be. Inspired by his friend he applies for military school and joins it and then his journey of becoming a MAN from a BOY starts... Performances: Hrithik Roshan: Great performance, just awesome. This actor is the brightest actor in Bollywood today. His performance in KMG was highly appreciated and this performance is on par with his KMG act. Om Puri: great actor.. some of the really great dialogs were given to him.. He is a living legend. Amitabh Bachchan: Great performance, His eyes and silence in the movie say a lot more than words. Preity Zinta: good performance, the character wasn't well-sketched but still good efforts from her side in some of the scenes. Sushant Singh: This actor is superb, one more under-rated great performance of him after his awesome acting in TLOBS. Boman Irani: This man is good in everything. His telephone scene with Hrithik Roshan was great. One of the best scenes in the movie.Overall: A very well-made movie. Great acting by almost everyone in the cast.

,Lakshya - Landmark Indian Movie,"I found Lakshya to be a refreshing step up in the quality of Indian films. It depicted courage, loyalty and other exemplary values in an interesting storyline. The musical song-dance numbers were well done, and the background musical scores were also emotive. I found the cinematography really stood out in this movie as above par, showing off the scenic landscape of the mountainous Kargil region. Regarding krishnam's commentary, I really have to disagree. Firstly, it's silly and petulant to single out this movie for such criticisms while ignoring the glaring errors and inaccuracies typical of most other Indian movies.

10.0,Cinematographic Excellence!,"Farhan Akhtar (Dil Chahta Hai) outdoes himself on his sophomore directorial effort the lesser successful Lakshya, which deals with a young man coming of age and trying to find himself in the world. The ever charming Hrithik Roshan plays Karan Shergill, a preppy happy-go-lucky slacker who is just comfortable going to school, hanging out with his best buddy Romila Dutta (Preity Zinta sporting really bad hair in the first half of the film) and just taking it easy in his parents house. Everything is fine until one day, his father begins to pressure and pester him about what he intends to do with his life, then he compares him to his brother who lives and works abroad which brings down Karan's spirit. He (Karan) tries to seek comfort with Romila but in the long run, she stands up to him as well and tells him that if he doesn't give up his slacker ways, she cannot continue to hangout with him. Most of this is told in flashback, as present day Karan (in a quest to prove himself to all of him friends and loved ones) has already joined the army and is about embark on a very dangerous journey to secure the Indian perimeter and get rid of Pakistani terrorists. Romila is the reason for most of the flashbacks, as her present day self is now a famed reporter and is engaged to somebody else. The chemistry between Zinta and Hrithik is as solid as it has been, which is probably why they have starred in so many films together. Every song and piece of music in this film is great, especially the song and dance between Karan and Romila, and not to mention that knockout 'Main Aisa Kyu Hoon.' Amitabh Bachchan, Om Puri, Sharad Kapoor, Amrish Puri (in a very special appearance) among others, round out the stellar cast in strong supporting roles.

6.0,"Appreciable, but requires patience","I watched Lakshya several times and every time I lost interest in the second half. In general, military dramas and war films strike me as intense films for a watch and they should have something very special and enough credibility to engage me. This film, despite its technical brilliance, didn't entirely do it for me, and I found many of the scenes and proceedings quite filmi and cliched. What's more, the first parts of the story are more about the character of Karan, and it sounds like a good start for an inspiring coming-of-age drama, which is sadly lost in the transition from his personal story to the war drama. The protagonist is played by Hrithik Roshan, who delivers his best performance to that point. He really got the moronic nature of Karan and played the gradual development and transformation of the character into this fierce soldier along the story well. His dance for ""Main Aisa Kyun Hoon"" is marvelous. Where the film lacks credibility, except for some of the war sequences, is in the lack of any chemistry between Roshan and female lead Preity Zinta. There was nothing between them - no tension, no true affection, no romance; it felt really forced and non-romantic. Not to say Zinta, who is one of my favourite actresses is not good; she does a good job of transforming her appearance to fit the character of a brave journalist and playing against her energetic, bubbly self. Her natural presence is actually a good added value to this male-dominated picture. I wish the film took another direction. Akhtar is a talented director, and it shows here too, but this film is overlong and quite exhausting although I can't deny its cinematic value and I can't say I didn't like it at all.",appreciable but requires patience,i watched lakshya several times every time i lost interest second half general military dramas war films strike me as intense films watch they should have something very special enough credibility engage me this film despite its technical brilliance didnt entirely do it me i found many scenes proceedings quite filmi cliched whats more first parts story are more about character karan it sounds like good start inspiring coming age drama which is sadly lost transition his personal story war drama protagonist is played by hrithik roshan who delivers his best performance that point he really got moronic nature karan played gradual development transformation character into this fierce soldier along story well his dance main aisa kyun hoon is marvelous where film lacks credibility except some war sequences is lack any chemistry between roshan female lead preity zinta there was nothing between them no tension no true affection no romance it felt really forced non romantic not say zinta who is one my favourite actresses is not good she does good job transforming her appearance fit character brave journalist playing against her energetic bubbly self her natural presence is actually good added value this male dominated picture i wish film took another direction akhtar is talented director it shows here too but this film is overlong quite exhausting although i cant deny its cinematic value i cant say i didnt like it at all,0.4761583011583011,0.2145752895752896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"

9.0,No sophomore slump from Farhan Akhtar,"When your first film is 'Dil Chahta Hai' a movie that not only clicks with Urban audiences all over India, redefines cool amongst the aspiring yuppie crowd and stylistically influences the Chopras, Johars and other filmmakers in terms of what GenNext wears and does, there are going to be huge expectations from your second effort.Director Farhan Akhtar does not disappoint with Lakshya, the story of an urbanite Delhi slacker named Karan Shergill (Hrithik Roshan) who's just graduated from college and is still not sure what he wants to be when he grows up. His patient girlfriend Romi (Preity Zinta) loves him and is confident that he will excel in whatever he sets out to do, but even she is beginning to get weary of his attitude towards his life and their relationship. On a whim, Karan decides to join the Indian Army, clearing their grueling entrance exam, with a friend. It's a decision that puts further strain on Karan's relationship with his overbearing father (played masterfully by Boman Irani).Once in boot camp however, Karan is unable to withstand the pressure & discipline that army life places on new cadets. He drops out of the academy after a few weeks and reunites with Romi at their favorite spot. Romi is however, devastated to hear Karan has dropped out and decides to end their relationship once and for all, citing that Karan has no aim in life whatsoever. This turn of events pushes Karan to return to the army and to finish what he started - for Romi, and more importantly for himself. It is at this point that the father-son pair of Javed & Farhan Akhtar make things interesting by weaving the fictional story of Karan together with an actual piece of 20th Century Indian Army history.Fans of 'Dil Chahta Hai' may be surprised at how less light-hearted the tone of the movie is especially in the second half where it strays into the realm of pure action. What Farhan displays here is how adept he is at managing realistic action and provides a fresh look at the war genre, free from the cliché-ridden plots of J P Dutta. Amitabh Bachchan makes a memorable appearance as Karan's superior officer who leads our protagonist to a final, tangible Lakshya (aim/goal/target). Cinematography in the mountain ranges of Kashmir is wonderful and as is becoming apparent with Farhan's films, the story in extremely grounded and rarely leaps into the realm of 'far-fetched'. The music by Shankar-Ehsan-Loy suits the tone of the movie, and Farhan wisely limits the number of songs to carefully selected arenas. He does however recognize that in Hrithik Roshan he has the most gifted dancer in Bollywood and in the song 'Main Aisa Kyon Hoon' he lets his star cut loose in a wonderfully choreographed piece by Prabhu Deva. I think it is Hrithik's greatest performance on the dance floor to date.Finally onto Hrithik himself, someone who I've admired more for his dexterity in dance scenes than for his acting chops. Hrithik delivers his best performance to date in Lakshya (I thought he was over the top in Koi...Mil Gaya) and manages to capture the initial confusion and eventual determination of Karan wonderfully. When his character returns to military training you see his metamorphosis into a man obsessed. The scene where he reconciles with his father over the phone before setting out on his mission is dignified and soulful. You really believe that Karan's dad has accepted his son's decision. Finally when Karan reunites with Romi after years of army service and points out to her with sincerity ""This is my Lakshya"", you believe in the conviction of this young man. This it truly Hrithik's movie all the way and for once his theatrics outshine his foot skills.Lakshya is mainstream Bollywood cinema with a difference. Just as with 'Dil Chahta Hai' there is a 'hatke' quality about this film which audiences should appreciate. Farhan doesn't make conventional 9 song love stories and he doesn't need to. His unique vision is a welcome addition to Bollywood. With Lakshya there is a lot of maturity in his storytelling and direction. The action/drama quotient has been upped in favor of humor which was a smart decision considering how sensitive and serious the final act is.In a final note, some people have commented that the factual incident weaved into the storyline & Javed Akhtar's remarks on the matter means that 'Lakshya' is an Anti-Pakistan film. I would suggest instead that it is a pro-army and pro-determination (if that's a word) film. Karan's example shows us that if we focus our minds onto achieving one task then no power on earth can prevent us. If we look inside ourselves and dedicate our energy on achieving our Lakshya then nothing is impossible. One now expects great things from Farhan Akthar's 'Don'.",no sophomore slump farhan akhtar,when your first film is dil chahta hai movie that not only clicks with urban audiences all over india redefines cool amongst aspiring yuppie crowd stylistically influences chopras johars other filmmakers terms what gennext wears does there are going be huge expectations your second effort director farhan akhtar does not disappoint with lakshya story urbanite delhi slacker named karan shergill hrithik roshan whos just graduated college is still not sure what he wants be when he grows up his patient girlfriend romi preity zinta loves him is confident that he will excel whatever he sets out do but even she is beginning get weary his attitude towards his life their relationship whim karan decides join indian army clearing their grueling entrance exam with friend its decision that puts further strain karans relationship with his overbearing father played masterfully by boman irani once boot camp however karan is unable withstand pressure discipline that army life places new cadets he drops out academy after few weeks reunites with romi at their favorite spot romi is however devastated hear karan has dropped out decides end their relationship once all citing that karan has no aim life whatsoever this turn events pushes karan return army finish what he started romi more importantly himself it is at this point that father son pair javed farhan akhtar make things interesting by weaving fictional story karan together with actual piece 20th century indian army history fans dil chahta hai may be surprised at how less light hearted tone movie is especially second half where it strays into realm pure action what farhan displays here is how adept he is at managing realistic action provides fresh look at war genre free clich ridden plots j p dutta amitabh bachchan makes memorable appearance as karans superior officer who leads our protagonist final tangible lakshya aim goal target cinematography mountain ranges kashmir is wonderful as is becoming apparent with farhans films story extremely grounded rarely leaps into realm far fetched music by shankar ehsan loy suits tone movie farhan wisely limits number songs carefully selected arenas he does however recognize that hrithik roshan he has most gifted dancer bollywood song main aisa kyon hoon he lets his star cut loose wonderfully choreographed piece by prabhu deva i think it is hrithiks greatest performance dance floor date finally onto hrithik himself someone who ive admired more his dexterity dance scenes than his acting chops hrithik delivers his best performance date lakshya i thought he was over top koi mil gaya manages capture initial confusion eventual determination karan wonderfully when his character returns military training you see his metamorphosis into man obsessed scene where he reconciles with his father over phone before setting out his mission is dignified soulful you really believe that karans dad has accepted his sons decision finally when karan reunites with romi after years army service points out her with sincerity this is my lakshya you believe conviction this young man this it truly hrithiks movie all way once his theatrics outshine his foot skills lakshya is mainstream bollywood cinema with difference just as with dil chahta hai there is hatke quality about this film which audiences should appreciate farhan doesnt make conventional 9 song love stories he doesnt need his unique vision is welcome addition bollywood with lakshya there is lot maturity his storytelling direction action drama quotient has been upped favor humor which was smart decision considering how sensitive serious final act is final note some people have commented that factual incident weaved into storyline javed akhtars remarks matter means that lakshya is anti pakistan film i would suggest instead that it is pro army pro determination if thats word film karans example shows us that if we focus our minds onto achieving one task then no power earth can prevent us if we look inside ourselves dedicate our energy achieving our lakshya then nothing is impossible one now expects great things farhan akthars don,0.5996133126133125,0.22426873126873134,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.49}"

8.0,love and war but more of the latter...,"After seeing liking Dil Chahta Hai and Don I wanted to see other films by Farhan Akhtar. Lakshya surprised me quite a bit. The coming of age of an aimless young man (Karan played by Hritik Roshan) was shown quite well in this film. His motivation is love, he decides to stop drifting and joins the army, after a false start he does shape up and then realizes he might have lost his love (Romi - Preity Zinta) to someone else in the process. Posted near the Kargil border his bravery and dedication to his country is amply tested. He also encounters Romi as a war journalist. In the end he does reach his Lakshya - his goal, and achieves personal growth in the process.The movie is beautifully shot in locale in Delhi, Dehradun and in Kashmir. The scenery is stunning and some of the war footage is mind blowing. There is a rock climbing episode that will remind the viewer of the Guns of Navarone but is spectacular all the same. Mr. Roshan make a very believable war hero and seems well capable of the heroics he performs. Miss Zinta is good in a not so major role.. The big B is very restrained as Col. Damle and the rest of the cast does their job really well. The music is good except for the first song with Hritik dancing in front of all the mirrors - that is just bad. The story has some inconsistencies - why is she the only journalist at the front line? How did they let her in so close to the fighting? But in the end Lakshya is a serious story about the journey into adulthood, and becoming man enough to shoulder responsibilities that come your way.

,"Good work, Farhan Akhtar!","Farhan Akthar has to live upto his debut 'Dil Chahta Hain' - a feat which will be difficult to match. FA will carry the DCH label forever, much like Ramesh Sippy was labeled with the Sholay tag. Comparing Lakshya with DCH is inevitable. And FA does score in many places. The story is quite simple. The setting is in late 1990s - just prior to the infamous Kargil. Roshan is Karan Shergill, the younger sibling in a well to do Delhi business family. Karan is a happy-go-lucky naive kid who has nothing to worry about in his life. His lady love, Romila Gutta aka Romy (Zinta), on the other hand, is a career minded young lady who has a clear idea what to do with her life. When placed at crossroads when all his friends are deciding about their future career prospects, Karan is influenced by one of his friends' decision and plans to join the Army. And to his own surprise finds himself in the Army training school. However, this sudden transition from his Bohemian lifestyle to army life proves to be more than he can handle and he quits the course. However, Karan realises that things will never be the same again with Romy, who clearly sees him as a quitter, a loser with no ambitions, no goals(That's Lakshya in Hindi) in life. Hurt and dejected, Karan joins the Army training again and comes out as a hard-boiled Lieutenent.Karan is posted in the volatile Dras sector, Kashmir. Here meets the stiff, focused Col. Damle (Mr. Bachchan) and his troops who make Karan realize that his Lakshya is to serve the country. Before long, there is a war brewing in the mountains, with Pakistani insurgents blocking out the supplies to various army bases high up in the mountains. Karan suddenly finds himself responsible for his country's safety and plays a key role in winning the battle against the intruders. His Lakshya is met. Technically, the film is brilliant. One of the first army movies made in Bollywood without an overdose of jingoism. German cinematographer Christopher Popp captures the night war sequences beautifully. The natural beauty of the rugged Ladakh has been brought to the screen in its whole. FA is a fine eye for the minor details, e.g., the name plates on the vehicles are in white letters written on black boards, like they were prior to 2001-2. The tense screens between Roshan and his father (played by the inimitable Boman Irani) are excellent. The film was conceived very very well. However, since nothing is perfect, no review is complete without some criticism. Lakshya has its faults - and most of these are because we had expected otherwise from the director of DCH. For one, there is not much of a script, so people watching for killing time will be bored. Unlike most war/army movies, this is more of a drama. Unlike DCH, we hardly have a light-hearted moment in the movie. Javed Akthar has returned to script writing after a long gap BUT I had expected more. Second, there are too many characters. Many actors in ""special appearances"" prove to be more distractions than integral elements of the story. Amitabh has his moments, but Om Puri, Lillette Dubey and Shushant have been wasted. At points, we feel that FA had a hard time to decide whether to keep pop-patriotism away from the movie. Songs distract and do not fit in the script, unlike DCH. My rating - 6.5/10 - for the sincerity with which the movie was made, for FA's dedication to his work, and for Hritik Roshan's performance.",good work farhan akhtar,farhan akthar has live upto his debut dil chahta hain feat which will be difficult match fa will carry dch label forever much like ramesh sippy was labeled with sholay tag comparing lakshya with dch is inevitable fa does score many places story is quite simple setting is late 1990s just prior infamous kargil roshan is karan shergill younger sibling well do delhi business family karan is happy go lucky naive kid who has nothing worry about his life his lady love romila gutta aka romy zinta other hand is career minded young lady who has clear idea what do with her life when placed at crossroads when all his friends are deciding about their future career prospects karan is influenced by one his friends decision plans join army his own surprise finds himself army training school however this sudden transition his bohemian lifestyle army life proves be more than he can handle he quits course however karan realises that things will never be same again with romy who clearly sees him as quitter loser with no ambitions no goals thats lakshya hindi life hurt dejected karan joins army training again comes out as hard boiled lieutenent karan is posted volatile dras sector kashmir here meets stiff focused col damle mr bachchan his troops who make karan realize that his lakshya is serve country before long there is war brewing mountains with pakistani insurgents blocking out supplies various army bases high up mountains karan suddenly finds himself responsible his countrys safety plays key role winning battle against intruders his lakshya is met technically film is brilliant one first army movies made bollywood without overdose jingoism german cinematographer christopher popp captures night war sequences beautifully natural beauty rugged ladakh has been brought screen its whole fa is fine eye minor details e g name plates vehicles are white letters written black boards like they were prior 2001 2 tense screens between roshan his father played by inimitable boman irani are excellent film was conceived very very well however since nothing is perfect no review is complete without some criticism lakshya has its faults most these are because we had expected otherwise director dch one there is not much script so people watching killing time will be bored unlike most war army movies this is more drama unlike dch we hardly have light hearted moment movie javed akthar has returned script writing after long gap but i had expected more second there are too many characters many actors special appearances prove be more distractions than integral elements story amitabh has his moments but om puri lillette dubey shushant have been wasted at points we feel that fa had hard time decide whether keep pop patriotism away movie songs distract do not fit script unlike dch my rating 6 5 10 sincerity with which movie was made fas dedication his work hritik roshans performance,0.48659765355417506,0.13839450404667802,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"
7.0,Farhan Akhtar hits the aim somehow but sharpness comes from Hrithik Roshan.,"Watched Lakshya (2004) : Brief Review -Farhan Akhtar hits the aim somehow but sharpness comes from Hrithik Roshan. Lakshya could have been a legendary War film or a passionate film if wanted to, I can't deny that it wasn't a fully war film and the aim was different but ultimately the involvement of Army makes it look so. It's a story of an irresponsible and spoiled young guy who doesn't have any aim, any ambition in his life. He mistakenly joins the Army Academy and then finds the first and only Aim of his life. The long runtime of 178 minutes is dragged at many places especially when the screenplay tries to explain and justify hero's personal life and personal desires. It can definitely be blamed because the narrative should have involved the country, patriosm and entire army crew to create that atmosphere and emotional connect in viewers hearts. Once the Army life and events are involved, the film should have stopped talking about his personal desires and it would have made entire scenario look prolific. I liked the prolificeness and accuracy of Films like ""Patton"", ""Das Boot"", ""Platoon"" which are legendary War films for me, and where the story never goes off track even for a moment. It stick to its war theme from the first frame till the last one. Lakshya falls short here. It suddenly interrupts the grip and linear equation by taking the story to the personal World. Despite some negative things here, there is one positive sign in that which is, Lakshya definitely works from Hero's sight and it was his story hence making the equation right. But what about the whole theme of Army? What about the perspective of other characters involved in the film? What about the country? Country and Army doesn't run on someone's personal aims, right? All those things should have been justified which didn't happen. Coming to the best part of the film which is none other than Hrithik Roshan. He was in sublime form from the start. Preity Zinta, Boman Irani, Amitabh Bachchan and rest of the cast is good. Music is decent, it is up when it's about normal life of the hero but i think his Army life deserved a special number. Cinematography and Production design fails to cover some nuances and for that even director can be bashed for his careless attitude. Farhan Akhtar hits the aim but Lakshya is more Hrithik's film than him. Hrithik adds the Sharpness and patriotic theme adds emotional touch to cover those mistakes. Lakshya could have been much better film and may be an unforgettable film if the vision had been wide and unrestricted. Like I said, somebody's personal desires can never give that kind of impact which entire army unit's desires can give you. That patriotic theme should have been elaborated and Lakshya would have ended up at high as the mountain. Overall, it is a very good film, rather almost fantastic and needs a limited vision from viewers to work upto the level.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",farhan akhtar hits aim somehow but sharpness comes hrithik roshan,watched lakshya 2004 brief review farhan akhtar hits aim somehow but sharpness comes hrithik roshan lakshya could have been legendary war film or passionate film if wanted i cant deny that it wasnt fully war film aim was different but ultimately involvement army makes it look so its story irresponsible spoiled young guy who doesnt have any aim any ambition his life he mistakenly joins army academy then finds first only aim his life long runtime 178 minutes is dragged at many places especially when screenplay tries explain justify heros personal life personal desires it can definitely be blamed because narrative should have involved country patriosm entire army crew create that atmosphere emotional connect viewers hearts once army life events are involved film should have stopped talking about his personal desires it would have made entire scenario look prolific i liked prolificeness accuracy films like patton das boot platoon which are legendary war films me where story never goes off track even moment it stick its war theme first frame till last one lakshya falls short here it suddenly interrupts grip linear equation by taking story personal world despite some negative things here there is one positive sign that which is lakshya definitely works heros sight it was his story hence making equation right but what about whole theme army what about perspective other characters involved film what about country country army doesnt run someones personal aims right all those things should have been justified which didnt happen coming best part film which is none other than hrithik roshan he was sublime form start preity zinta boman irani amitabh bachchan rest cast is good music is decent it is up when its about normal life hero but i think his army life deserved special number cinematography production design fails cover some nuances that even director can be bashed his careless attitude farhan akhtar hits aim but lakshya is more hrithiks film than him hrithik adds sharpness patriotic theme adds emotional touch cover those mistakes lakshya could have been much better film may be unforgettable film if vision had been wide unrestricted like i said somebodys personal desires can never give that kind impact which entire army units desires can give you that patriotic theme should have been elaborated lakshya would have ended up at high as mountain overall it is very good film rather almost fantastic needs limited vision viewers work upto level rating 7 10 by,0.5448125386518243,0.16823361162646883,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.52}"

,Good Attempt.,"First and foremost is the incredibly co-ordinated Hrithik Roshan with a stand-out Choreography. Hrithik is the Indian ""Michael Jackson"". He is maturing to be a great actor apart from his physical versatility akin to Circe du Solei performer. The Production is good but I am dismayed to the fact that the Indian Producers are not adept at portraying the battle scenes-they all sound like dejavue from the previous movies like ""LOC"". The Enemy is not identified well. The well intended efforts of the young and upcoming director suffers from poor editing. The continuity is disjointed so much so the the relations are fragmented and lack an emotional depth. Preity Zinta who matches Hrithik's acting prowess but she is just average and her short hair makes her look boyish. The Music by SEL, is superlative except the background Singers for the team song for the Soldiers should have sounded more Macho-it just does't fit the screaming voices as in their training. The pall-bearer is Hrithik Roshan who in the few scenes seems to be confused between his ""Jadoo"" role and the role of a teenager but does comes out with flying colors towards the end. This is undoubtedly a great actor in making. The movie suffers from a Script writer who is as confused as ""Karan"" and drifts between family drama to slopes of Kashmir-it gets very predictive. The characters or mere caricature, detached and cold as a mountain. Overhaul this is a good Pic, but there is nothing to be gung-ho over it.",good attempt,first foremost is incredibly co ordinated hrithik roshan with stand out choreography hrithik is indian michael jackson he is maturing be great actor apart his physical versatility akin circe du solei performer production is good but i am dismayed fact that indian producers are not adept at portraying battle scenes they all sound like dejavue previous movies like loc enemy is not identified well well intended efforts young upcoming director suffers poor editing continuity is disjointed so much so relations are fragmented lack emotional depth preity zinta who matches hrithiks acting prowess but she is just average her short hair makes her look boyish music by sel is superlative except background singers team song soldiers should have sounded more macho it just doest fit screaming voices as their training pall bearer is hrithik roshan who few scenes seems be confused between his jadoo role role teenager but does comes out with flying colors towards end this is undoubtedly great actor making movie suffers script writer who is as confused as karan drifts between family drama slopes kashmir it gets very predictive characters or mere caricature detached cold as mountain overhaul this is good pic but there is nothing be gung ho over it,0.5104591836734694,0.08333333333333336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.31}"

9.0,Lakshya,"Farhan Akhtar being Farhan Akhtar, beautiful and magnificent movie. Brilliant storytelling style, amazing sound from Shankar Ehsaan Loy and lyrics by Javed Akhtar.It starts off as a clueless, aimless boy Karan Shergill in Delhi, has no ambition or what they say ""Lakshya"". Romila Dutta or Romi his girlfriend tells him hard and later he joins prestigious IMA and becomes a officer. It's set in late 90's amidst the backdrop of Kargil war.To look out for - Marvellous sightings of Kargil and other terrain beautifully shot and so so good. Hardly seen in any Bollywood movie before. Cinematography by Christopher Popp is highly appreciated. The film ends with Karan leaving a military hospital and reuniting with his parents and Romi. Romi asks him that having attained his 'Lakshya' what is his next goal. To which Captain Shergill replies, ""you"", and they embrace. The movie ends on a poignant shot of Colonel Sunil Damle and Subedar Major Pritam Singh paying respect to martyrs of Operation Vijay. Since it's a war movie it does have huge Cast but everyone performed really well. Amitabh Bachchan as Col. Sunil Damle, Punjab. Hrithik Roshan as Lt. (later Actg. Capt.) Karan Shergill.

Babulal Surendra Pal as IMA Commandant M K Raina as Akhilesh Dutta (Romila's father) Amrish Puri as Brig. Gautam Puri. Lakshya was director Farhan Akhtar's second film, following the success of his first film, the cult classic Dil Chahta Hai (2001). However despite the huge hype, it didn't fare as well at the box-office. However, with repeated telecasts over the television, over the years, Lakshya has been regarded as a cult film among an audience that argues it is Hrithik Roshan's best performance to date.I absolutely loved it. Must watch. Also a tight slap on those who call Farhan Akhtar and his Dad ""Anti-national"", watch this movie once. Farhan needs to make more of these movies. Available on Netflix. Playlist is also a must, most suitable for defense aspirants and workouts. This movie has inspired so many youth male/female both to join prestigious Indian Army and other defense forces.

10.0,The only army film that the youth will relate to.,"When this film released I was a kid. I watched a few days ago as I had time. I have to say this is the best army movie to come out of india. It is a really great mix. Border is also an army movie but this is a film that the youth will relate to. Hrithik roshan is the best performer in the movie. Preity zinta and amitabh bachchan also did a good job. All the songs in the movie are fantastic especially the title song. I will call this farhan akhtar's best movie. Also it has many great scenes. I loved the scene where preity's character criticizes war and the soldier replies. The best scene comes in the end where boman irani who plays the father is talking on phone with hrithik and both of them end up in tears. Overall, I will call it a must watch for everyone.",only army film that youth will relate,when this film released i was kid i watched few days ago as i had time i have say this is best army movie come out india it is really great mix border is also army movie but this is film that youth will relate hrithik roshan is best performer movie preity zinta amitabh bachchan also did good job all songs movie are fantastic especially title song i will call this farhan akhtars best movie also it has many great scenes i loved scene where preitys character criticizes war soldier replies best scene comes end where boman irani who plays father is talking phone with hrithik both them end up tears overall i will call it must watch everyone,0.5428571428571428,0.5499999999999999,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.19}"
