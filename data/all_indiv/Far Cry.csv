5,Forget the game it is based on and you might find it watchable,"This may be Uwe Boll's best movie ever. No,I'm not a fan. How could I be. Uwe Boll is a director who shows no respect for his audience and doesn't deserve respect when it comes to making movies. He even admitted himself that he does it solely for the money. He is not skilled at all and has got the creativity of an amoeba. But is that a reason for not liking or watching his movies. Well,yes and no. It all comes down to expectation. If you have none than ""Far Cry"" will surprise you. Til Schweiger is well aware of Boll's reputation and doesn't take it seriously which shows and is one of the strong points of the movie. The second strong element are the action scenes which are actually pretty decent and fun to watch. Does this movie has anything to do with the game? Of course not(OK,maybe 1 or 2 elements are taken from the game). Does it have a good story? Guess again. What about the acting? At least it wasn't completely annoying and Til's Jack Carver was very likable. ""Far Cry"" is movie that can be fun if you are able to put your brain off.",forget game it is based you might find it watchable,this may be uwe bolls best movie ever no im not fan how could i be uwe boll is director who shows no respect his audience doesnt deserve respect when it comes making movies he even admitted himself that he does it solely money he is not skilled at all has got creativity amoeba but is that reason not liking or watching his movies well yes no it all comes down expectation if you have none than far cry will surprise you til schweiger is well aware bolls reputation doesnt take it seriously which shows is one strong points movie second strong element are action scenes which are actually pretty decent fun watch does this movie has anything do with game course not ok maybe 1 or 2 elements are taken game does it have good story guess again what about acting at least it wasnt completely annoying tils jack carver was very likable far cry is movie that can be fun if you are able put your brain off,0.5005555555555555,0.07977777777777777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.14}"
6,Not as bad as expected,"I've never seen a Boll film before but I have heard the rumours. This might be why I thought this wasn't too bad. My expectations were way, way down.However, it wasn't as bad as I feared. Now granted, I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it but it was better than some of the drivel I've seen. This, I could actually sit through and didn't think that I was completely wasting my time.The locations and sets were good, the cinematography not bad, the acting let things down a bit and the writing was very, very ordinary. I even found the references to the game (as little as they were) amusing.",not as bad as expected,ive never seen boll film before but i have heard rumours this might be why i thought this wasnt too bad my expectations were way way down however it wasnt as bad as i feared now granted im glad i didnt pay money see it but it was better than some drivel ive seen this i could actually sit through didnt think that i was completely wasting my time locations sets were good cinematography not bad acting let things down bit writing was very very ordinary i even found references game as little as they were amusing,0.5173202614379084,-0.03962418300653593,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.2}"
4,Better than bloodrayne at least,One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.While I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn't have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.,better than bloodrayne at least,one bolls better attempts just shows that if you do something long enough you have improve just by chance it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is improvement over bloodrayne main difference between bloodrayne farcry really is that story farcry wasnt games strong point whereas bloodrayne had strong story thus boll had more chance mess it up action this movie is actually fairly good occasionally touch overdone but good way worth watch just that acting wise it was pretty decent most actors are pretty good but you can tell they arent taking it seriously based comparisons with other performances but lighter mood this gives film actually helps while i think sticking little bit closer story game might have made slightly better film changes made are pretty practical not big enough make difference especially given plot game was hardly oscar winning just vehicle fps carnage would have liked it set jungle as that was pretty integral part game but canada doesnt have great deal jungle it is at least set kind rainforest why boll feels need change already professionally scripted directed game plots i dont know but he does until he starts letting source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking watch film laugh its good that maybe watching during party as drinking party fodder,0.5093749999999999,0.16015624999999997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7,Why so bad? It is not Far cry but decent movie,"So, I saw that this movie was rated 3 on IMDb so I thought; it will be bad! I watched this movie and it was a good B film, it is not a masterpiece but it is pretty decent, i mean, i have seen a lot of other films that are rated 4,5/5 and they are definitely worse than this. Good plot and pretty action sequences, maybe the problem is its title ""Far Cry"" I played the game and I noticed that it is completely different but if you forget the title, there are no problems at all. Probably people rated it 1,2 or 3 because of Uwe Boll, it is obvious that people hate him so they dislike its films by deduction. Uwe Boll made bad movies but this deserves at least a 5! So i recommend to people that hate Boll, just watch the film and try to be honest.",why so bad it is not far cry but decent movie,so i saw that this movie was rated 3 imdb so i thought it will be bad i watched this movie it was good b film it is not masterpiece but it is pretty decent i mean i have seen lot other films that are rated 4 5 5 they are definitely worse than this good plot pretty action sequences maybe problem is its title far cry i played game i noticed that it is completely different but if you forget title there are no problems at all probably people rated it 1 2 or 3 because uwe boll it is obvious that people hate him so they dislike its films by deduction uwe boll made bad movies but this deserves at least 5 so i recommend people that hate boll just watch film try be honest,0.6770833333333334,-0.10246212121212118,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"
7,"You need to know, what to expect","I went to see this film in the cinema with some friends of mine and we expected the movie to be complete trash. Since Uwe Boll is regarded the worst director ever, we expected to see a stupid, bad, ridiculous action movie with a story hardly good enough for a video game.And this was, what we got.This film will just make you laugh all the time. Not for actual jokes in the movie, but more for the ridiculous characters. Come on, a German ex-elite soldier making his living as a boat-captain in Canada, Meets the niece of another German ex-elite-soldier, who works for an evil, mad, German scientist who is trying to create the new Master-Race of biologically modified soldiers for the US-Military...in Canada. Then there are the stereotype Mercenary, the stereotype Soldiers and the stereotype Monsters.Speaking of ridiculous characters, what exactly is Emilio's role in this film? Still, the action was surprisingly good and the movie all in all was very entertaining. If you want to see art, it's your own fault you didn't like the movie. But if you want to see a movie, too ridiculous to be taken serious, I promise you, you will be fine with ""Far Cry""",you need know what expect,i went see this film cinema with some friends mine we expected movie be complete trash since uwe boll is regarded worst director ever we expected see stupid bad ridiculous action movie with story hardly good enough video game this was what we got this film will just make you laugh all time not actual jokes movie but more ridiculous characters come german ex elite soldier making his living as boat captain canada meets niece another german ex elite soldier who works evil mad german scientist who is trying create new master race biologically modified soldiers us military canada then there are stereotype mercenary stereotype soldiers stereotype monsters speaking ridiculous characters what exactly is emilios role this film still action was surprisingly good movie all all was very entertaining if you want see art its your own fault you didnt like movie but if you want see movie too ridiculous be taken serious i promise you you will be fine with far cry,0.5546212121212121,-0.05745738636363636,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.32}"
6,"It wasn't terrible, certainly not a 3/10...","I am well aware of Uwe Boll's work, I am also aware that the people on this site are not fond of his work and mercilessly down-rate his productions. That said, I don't think this movie is worth only a 3 or 4 out of 10.The acting wasn't terrible, then again there wasn't much acting to begin with. The movie seemed like something out of the 1980's with its numerous action sequences, a lot of which involved boats, water and explosions.The movie's plot didn't exactly follow the game's, but it worked to some extent. Simply put, there is a crazy scientist genetically engineering soldiers to be super soldiers. One of the normal soldiers on the island decides to organize a meeting with his journalist niece on the island to expose the work and in the process gets caught. The niece hires Jack, a guy who runs his own tourist boat, to get to the island to meet her uncle. She gets caught, Jacks goes to save her and also gets caught. Blah blah blah blah, Jack and the niece escape and live happily ever after...oh and the scientist guy dies. You know, your standard Hollywood movie plot...there's a bad guy, the good guy infiltrates and gets caught, eventually escapes and in the process kills the bad guy and destroys his evil operation.Yeah, at times it drags, and yeah the guy who plays Jack isn't a native American which doesn't really work since the guy in the game comes off as your run-of-the-mill beer drinking American. The action sequences involve fake guns and props which appear to be just that...and yes, we can blame the director as he likes to rush his dreck movies into theaters which allows for little post production time...but the movie worked well. I put it on par with any other fairly rated action movies with similar plots that lack any sort of serious character development...Collateral Damage, Eraser, Escape from LA, Mission Impossible 2, Resident Evil movies, Tango & Cash, xXx, etc. In other words, if you are looking for just another run-of-the-mill action movie where the good guy wins, bad guy loses, and there is no character development, Far Cry is another movie to put on your NetFlix.",it wasnt terrible certainly not 3 10,i am well aware uwe bolls work i am also aware that people this site are not fond his work mercilessly down rate his productions that said i dont think this movie is worth only 3 or 4 out 10 acting wasnt terrible then again there wasnt much acting begin with movie seemed like something out 1980s with its numerous action sequences lot which involved boats water explosions movies plot didnt exactly follow games but it worked some extent simply put there is crazy scientist genetically engineering soldiers be super soldiers one normal soldiers island decides organize meeting with his journalist niece island expose work process gets caught niece hires jack guy who runs his own tourist boat get island meet her uncle she gets caught jacks goes save her also gets caught blah blah blah blah jack niece escape live happily ever after oh scientist guy dies you know your standard hollywood movie plot theres bad guy good guy infiltrates gets caught eventually escapes process kills bad guy destroys his evil operation yeah at times it drags yeah guy who plays jack isnt native american which doesnt really work since guy game comes off as your run mill beer drinking american action sequences involve fake guns props which appear be just that yes we can blame director as he likes rush his dreck movies into theaters which allows little post production time but movie worked well i put it par with any other fairly rated action movies with similar plots that lack any sort serious character development collateral damage eraser escape la mission impossible 2 resident evil movies tango cash xxx etc other words if you are looking just another run mill action movie where good guy wins bad guy loses there is no character development far cry is another movie put your netflix,0.5000172532781229,-0.07457611832611831,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.48}"

4,Watchable,"There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at ID had a lot to do with Doom.

6,Reasonably entertaining - a first for a Uwe Boll movie!,"FAR CRY is the film version of a popular video game that I know nothing about. However, I do know something about the career of infamous German director Uwe Boll, a man responsible for the likes of BLOODRAYNE and ALONE IN THE DARK, and commonly thought of as one of our worst modern directors. I'm pleased to report that FAR CRY is by far the best Boll film I've thus watched; it's no masterpiece, that's for sure, but it's reasonably entertaining, unlike the majority of his output.The film contains all of the ingredients usual for a Boll-style B-movie: an ensemble cast of fading faces, lots of low rent action, some cheesy effects and the like, and plenty of cliché. However, this time around that mix is quite fun. Til Schweiger, the German actor who rose to international prominence after his part in Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, is fine as the likable and humorous hero, and Emmanuelle Vaugier and Natalia Avelon are suitably attractive female co-stars.This film is a German/Canadian co-production which is quite convincing when it comes to the styling. The action scenes are fairly well done and certainly you often see B-movie shoot-outs that are done far worse than the ones here. Some of the old-timer actors playing tough guys include Don S. Davis, Craig Fairbrass, Udo Kier, Michael Pare, and Ralf Moeller. The plot is your usual nonsense about a mad scientist creating an army of super soldiers and the one or two soldiers we do get to see here are pretty impressive, coming across as a zombie version of the ones in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER. Anyway, FAR CRY is no great shakes as a film, but it is a reasonably entertaining B-movie nonetheless.",reasonably entertaining first uwe boll movie,far cry is film version popular video game that i know nothing about however i do know something about career infamous german director uwe boll man responsible likes bloodrayne alone dark commonly thought as one our worst modern directors im pleased report that far cry is by far best boll film ive thus watched its no masterpiece thats sure but its reasonably entertaining unlike majority his output film contains all ingredients usual boll style b movie ensemble cast fading faces lots low rent action some cheesy effects like plenty clich however this time around that mix is quite fun til schweiger german actor who rose international prominence after his part tarantinos inglourious basterds is fine as likable humorous hero emmanuelle vaugier natalia avelon are suitably attractive female co stars this film is german canadian co production which is quite convincing when it comes styling action scenes are fairly well done certainly you often see b movie shoot outs that are done far worse than ones here some old timer actors playing tough guys include don s davis craig fairbrass udo kier michael pare ralf moeller plot is your usual nonsense about mad scientist creating army super soldiers one or two soldiers we do get see here are pretty impressive coming across as zombie version ones universal soldier anyway far cry is no great shakes as film but it is reasonably entertaining b movie nonetheless,0.6022513767411727,0.13266115970197598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"
4,"Actually, I had fun watching this","There are several conditions which one must abide by in order to enjoy this movie. ONE, forget the game (even though it is good);TWO,watch this movie empty headed/don't take it seriously; THREE, ignore the bad acting. If you can do these things, then you might actually like it. There were several points in the movie where I was laughing so hard, I was crying. The humor was subtle at times and others it was blatant, but it was still funny.Now, with that being said, it wasn't a quality movie by any means. The action scenes were nice, but not awesome; the acting was sub par, especially the lady in the beginning, ""But George, I want to see the whales!"" This was a part where I was cracking up. Also, the chemistry between Valerie and Jack was, well, interesting. They just sort of, ummm, came together as if they knew each other for a long time. In fact, the character development was the weakest point of the movie, but hey, like I said, condition number two.The ending was good enough, but in the end I felt like nothing was accomplished. It sounds like I hated the movie, but the humor and Shweiger's relaxed feel, even in dire situations, just made this enjoyable. Plus the ending action sequence was cool. Don't watch this if you want a serious, hard core action movie.

6,Let's get one thing straight...,"Let's face facts: if the director were anyone other than Uwe Boll this would have a much higher rating. Why? Because all in all it's not a bad movie. It's by no means great, but it's still a hell of a lot better than some trash that made it to theaters recently (I'm looking at you, new Friday The 13th). Boll's reputation certainly precedes him so there'll always be a good number of people getting exactly what they expected even if the film wasn't as bad as...say...Bloodrayne. But to be fair, not much is quite as bad as Bloodrayne. This flick is pretty much standard action fair. A bit light on the plot, but have you tried watching anything with Steven Seagal in it...ever? There's gunfights, super soldiers, some somewhat lame attempts at comedy, but in the end it's all a decent way to kill some time.I must confess...I've only played the sequel to Far Cry, never the original so I don't know how faithful the movie is to the game. But Far Cry 2 was simply awful and whatever you may think of Boll, he's usually pretty true to his source material. I mean come on, you can't tell me that the movie version of House Of The Dead was any sillier than the game. Same goes for most of Uwe's ventures into the video-game-gone-movie realm (save for the criminally underrated Postal).The purpose of this is not to make apologies for Mr. Boll. He's made some terrible stuff in the past. Does he deserve an Oscar? No, NO, one thousand times NO! But at least you know what you're in for and can hope for something a little better. And at least he's trying. If I may point further back in this post and point out that Michael Bay seems intent on simultaneously remaking horror movies that don't need to be remade and ruining them all at once.

6,you owe me a meatball sandwich....,"Jack Carver, a retired Special Forces Officer is transport for hire, by people and cargo.

He goes through hell when his boat is attacked and destroyed by an unknown party while Val is away. Surviving by the skin of his teeth, he must now find Val and uncover what is truly happening on these dark and mysterious islands....the thing is with Uwe Boll movies, is that they have a distinct feel to them.

6,This is much better than Bloodrayne or Alone In The Dark,"I just watched the movie, and I played the game, and although little more than 50% is in common, Far Cry movie isn't that bad. It isn't a summer blockbuster, nor instant classic, but, it was never meant to be. It's a nice straight to DVD action flick which will give you 1,5h solid entertainment. Other than basic stuff (characters, name, enemies), movie is set on different location, and as much faster pacing. Action sequences are nice and solid, and effects are also good considering this is a low budget movie. But that's the point, it IS a low budget title, but looking at it it feels much more expensive. Script is OK, most of the time works well, and I have to say that Jack in the movie has a lot in common with game Jack. Both make fun of almost everything, and are more phlegmatic in nature. Val on the other hand isn't that action oriented as her game counterpart. Kier does very nice job bringing Dr. Krieger to life, and frankly, I like this one better. Nobody but Kier could portrait mad German scientist. The only thing about characters that kinda annoyed me is Jack's noticeable German accent, although Till did excellent Job for the performance part. The only major disappointment what I had with the movie is that location was changed from pacific sand beaches to rocky and cold bay like in western Canada/south Alaska. Considering the budget, I understand and forgive. Film is no award nominee nor winner, but a nice rental on a hot or rainy afternoon to fill a void and have house popcorn fun. 6/10 :) P.S.

6,Action Flick 101,"One tough guy kicking butt and taking out an entire army during one weekend. That sounds like Schwarzenegger in ""Commando"" or Stallone in the 2nd and 3rd Rambo movies. Or like Til Schweiger in this film. A tough guy, who's good at heart, is forced to fight for his life and probably also for the life of the entire free World, though that last part is only not too subtly implied here. But it all works for the better and adds up to a dumb, yes, but actually enjoyable action movie.There is a variety of action scenes, some humor, and a German guy who has an inexplicably English name... Jack Carver. Oh well, maybe it's an alias. But in light of the frenetically edited, darkly themed, and super produced Bourne movies among others, this return to basics is pretty enjoyable. The only thing different here than in those crazy 80s action movies is that the bad guys aren't communists or Soviets, but a shadowy government agency and possibly an evil corporation - in other words, the people that we currently most dislike are getting their butts kicked.

5,For Uwe Boll. . .this isn't a total bomb,"First Off. . .this is an Uwe Boll Production, which places it in a category all its own.Having said that-- for a straight to DVD or Grade B- Late night Mad Scientist / Monster romp, it's actually not. . .all that Bad.It's not. . .all that Good either, but it will fill the late hour and a half if you are not yet ready to hit the sack and just wanna watch some low-grade action.Those of you who are avid FarCry players. . .Don't. Just Don't. Play the game, instead. If you DO watch this, don't go cursing or crying to anyone, because you were warned. The Game was far more dark and intense than this movie could ever be.For everyone else, it can be a chuckle-- even though it is NOT a Comedy or a Spoof. But I SWEAR that Udo Keir (Dr. Kreiger) couldn't help himself because he was delivering some ringing one-liners with a deadpan face that was DARING the viewer to laugh.The other actors can be forgiven their emotive trespasses because this is a Mad Scientist / Monster Movie. No-one expects a Oscar nomination out of this, so don't hold it against them. Be fair. Besides, the wooden, cardboard, plastic, ersatz performances of the Lead characters could be EXACTLY what Uwe wanted. Remember: This Man Sees the Cinematic world through a different lens than the rest of us Mortals. He is an Artiste!!!And several reviewers have commented rather 'objectively' on the 'romantic liaison' that both Viewers AND Actors were subjected to. Again: This is Uwe Boll. Romantic scenes are not 'Created' in Uwe's movies; they just happen. They happen without reason, without NEED for reason, like a rock dropped in a puddle, like a stinkbomb exploding in a bowl of jello. . .BOOM! Romantic moment NOW-- Kiss & Fumble and now we're done, on to the next page. . .And in Uwe's favor, upon reflection I note that all the weird Romantic Uwe Moments in all his movies are surprisingly CHASTE. I'm not gonna psycho-analyze that.So like I said, got nothing else to watch on a late Saturday night, but don't wanna hit the sack yet?

6,Another Step Up For Uwe Boll,"Jack Carver is a retired special forces soldier... but he gets sucked back in to combat when a reporter has him bring her to an island where a money-hungry German scientist is genetically modifying humans into super soldiers (not like Captain America) to be one-man wrecking machines. Will Jack be able to defeat an entire army? Uwe Boll is getting better as a director. ""Bloodrayne 2"" was good, ""Tunnel Rats"" was respectable, and now this... I liked it. The days of pure manure like ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""House of the Dead"" might finally be behind him. And it helps that he has a strong cast... Til Schweiger (""SLC Punk"", ""Inglourious Basterds"") is a great action star as Jack Carver. Emmanuelle Vaugier is annoying, but able as reporter Valerie Cardinal. I fell in love with Natalia Avelon as military leader Katja Chernov, and want to see all her movies... too bad they're in German.B-movie hack (and I say that with respect) Michael Paré is Paul Summers... and not to be missed, creepy German guy Udo Kier is Dr. Lucas Krieger! Because, you know, you can't have a good film without a mad German scientist. (There should have been some subplot of him being an ex-Nazi, but the mystery of his painting kept me intrigued well enough.) Chris Coppola shows up as Emilio the Food Guy. You might recall Coppola from other Boll films: ""BloodRayne II: Deliverance"" as Newton Piles and ""Postal"" as Richard. I wouldn't mind seeing him again... a little comic relief is important in an action film.Action, humor, sex... this is a good adaptation. And there are plenty of stunts (see the list of stunt men -- it's longer than the cast). Uwe Boll, you are beginning to pleasantly surprise me... bring on your ""Max Schmeling"" movie and bring on ""BloodRayne 3"".",another step up uwe boll,jack carver is retired special forces soldier but he gets sucked back combat when reporter has him bring her island where money hungry german scientist is genetically modifying humans into super soldiers not like captain america be one man wrecking machines will jack be able defeat entire army uwe boll is getting better as director bloodrayne 2 was good tunnel rats was respectable now this i liked it days pure manure like alone dark house dead might finally be behind him it helps that he has strong cast til schweiger slc punk inglourious basterds is great action star as jack carver emmanuelle vaugier is annoying but able as reporter valerie cardinal i fell love with natalia avelon as military leader katja chernov want see all her movies too bad theyre german b movie hack i say that with respect michael par is paul summers not be missed creepy german guy udo kier is dr lucas krieger because you know you cant have good film without mad german scientist there should have been some subplot him being ex nazi but mystery his painting kept me intrigued well enough chris coppola shows up as emilio food guy you might recall coppola other boll films bloodrayne ii deliverance as newton piles postal as richard i wouldnt mind seeing him again little comic relief is important action film action humor sex this is good adaptation there are plenty stunts see list stunt men its longer than cast uwe boll you are beginning pleasantly surprise me bring your max schmeling movie bring bloodrayne 3,0.5028314028314029,0.14145752895752897,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
5,Turn off your head and relax,"It's definitely more than 3 when you want to relax. It's not serious movie thou, not even good action one - although the action is fine. I watched it after the game and I think the game has better story. :-) But I simply forgot about the game, watched the simple movie with some action and not exactly believable romance in it, and I was relaxed. Opening scene might be the best part as it looks like sci-fi stuff, but the rest is still OK. Acting is like the movie, probably the romance in the bed is the worst part (although I generally like bed scenes and I'm very forgiving there ;-)), some action parts are way too long (one chase with the mutant) but otherwise it's quite solid average movie based on a simple script without any great idea. The thing that is great about this movie is that it's generally quite smooth and it didn't make me angry like my last bad experience (Flight of the Phoenix http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377062/). No far-fetched scenes, no embarrassing dialogs (""You better be here when I return"" :-)), no forced drama. Easy, smooth, flowing average action. There are better movies outside that made me rather unsatisfied because they looked more serious. This is NOT serious even if it's not a comedy. It's simply B class (or C?) action movie. Not a bad one. Probably the missing point is the worst problem - but hey, who would expect a point here?",turn off your head relax,its definitely more than 3 when you want relax its not serious movie thou not even good action one although action is fine i watched it after game i think game has better story but i simply forgot about game watched simple movie with some action not exactly believable romance it i was relaxed opening scene might be best part as it looks like sci fi stuff but rest is still ok acting is like movie probably romance bed is worst part although i generally like bed scenes im very forgiving there some action parts are way too long one chase with mutant but otherwise its quite solid average movie based simple script without any great idea thing that is great about this movie is that its generally quite smooth it didnt make me angry like my last bad experience flight phoenix no far fetched scenes no embarrassing dialogs you better be here when i return no forced drama easy smooth flowing average action there are better movies outside that made me rather unsatisfied because they looked more serious this is not serious even if its not comedy its simply b class or c action movie not bad one probably missing point is worst problem but hey who would expect point here,0.44412050534499525,0.0836734693877551,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
2,Yet another crap film by Uwe Boll that's based on a videogame.,"Uwe Boll has an unusual distinction. On IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List, he currently has five movies listed! This is NOT a distinction any normal person would want...though in the case of Boll, somehow studios keep giving him huge budgets, so he's probably laughing all the way to the bank! I have seen his other four entries on the list, ""BloodRayne"", ""House of the Dead"", ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"". Why? Because I have an odd obsession....to try to watch all 100 on this everchanging list!""Far Cry"" is odd in that Boll bought the rights to this videogame BEFORE the game was even released. He was lucky...the game was a hit. The public, however, wasn't...as the film stank.The plot is pretty simple. Valerie pays Jack to take her to the island where her Uncle Max works. However, after she arrives, the baddies on the island blow up Jack's boat...and he just barely escapes. Apprently Dr. Krieger* is doing evil stuff on this island and he's not allowing anyone to get in his way! But Jack is an ex-special forces guy...and soon it's him versus all of Krieger's brainless and rather indestructable genetically modified minions.A few things you are likely to notice shortly after the film begins. First, it's ultra-violent....not too unusual for Boll's films. Second, most in the cast sound either German OR they put on very fake and stupid accents in order to try to hide this. In particular, the 'American' couple on the whale trip are among the silliest fake-American accented characters I'd ever heard. Apparently Boll didn't notice...but someone should have noticed this. And, considering the film was made in Canada, there surely were some locals who sounded much more like Americans. The film also abounds with dumb writing mistakes and cliches. When Jack attacks one of the baddies, the baddie makes sure NOT to cry out for help (a common but bad cliche), a helicopter explodes for practically no reason at all, Valerie throws a grenade and forgets to pull the pin (is anyone THAT stupid???), after initially evading the baddies the pair (who just met each other) stop to make whoopie (which is odd since they ARE on an island full of folks wanting to kill them), three soldiers firing at Jack at close range with machine guns....yet he takes them all out with his pistol....and that incredible annoying fat guy with the sandwich....uggh! The bottom line is that the film is terribly written and is, at times, an insult to your intelligence...and it often uses violence and action in place of acting and writing. *I found it funny that the mad German scientist, Krieger, is the same name given to the mad German scientist on ""Archer"".",yet another crap film by uwe boll thats based videogame,uwe boll has unusual distinction imdbs infamous bottom 100 list he currently has five movies listed this is not distinction any normal person would want though case boll somehow studios keep giving him huge budgets so hes probably laughing all way bank i have seen his other four entries list bloodrayne house dead alone dark name king dungeon siege tale why because i have odd obsession try watch all 100 this everchanging list far cry is odd that boll bought rights this videogame before game was even released he was lucky game was hit public however wasnt as film stank plot is pretty simple valerie pays jack take her island where her uncle max works however after she arrives baddies island blow up jacks boat he just barely escapes apprently dr krieger is doing evil stuff this island hes not allowing anyone get his way but jack is ex special forces guy soon its him versus all kriegers brainless rather indestructable genetically modified minions few things you are likely notice shortly after film begins first its ultra violent not too unusual bolls films second most cast sound either german or they put very fake stupid accents order try hide this particular american couple whale trip are among silliest fake american accented characters id ever heard apparently boll didnt notice but someone should have noticed this considering film was made canada there surely were some locals who sounded much more like americans film also abounds with dumb writing mistakes cliches when jack attacks one baddies baddie makes sure not cry out help common but bad cliche helicopter explodes practically no reason at all valerie throws grenade forgets pull pin is anyone that stupid after initially evading baddies pair who just met each other stop make whoopie which is odd since they are island full folks wanting kill them three soldiers firing at jack at close range with machine guns yet he takes them all out with his pistol that incredible annoying fat guy with sandwich uggh bottom line is that film is terribly written is at times insult your intelligence it often uses violence action place acting writing i found it funny that mad german scientist krieger is same name given mad german scientist archer,0.5435780423280424,-0.09779761904761906,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.34}"

7,"Far Cry - Not the Game, but a descent movie","O.K., here we go. First of all, I must say, I liked the game very well (I'm talking about the first game, the second installment is still on my to do list). So, I'm speaking of a first person shooter that really got me for days (yes, it took me a while, but I like to play a game on more difficult level). But this is about the movie.I've seen a lot of so called ""video game adaptations"". And I know that the name ""Uwe Boll"" makes a lot of people say: ""Oh my God, not another movie by this guy"". BUT: When I want to see a video game adaption, I always go to the movie with the lowest expectations. Like it was with ""Far Cry"". I thought, o.k., another movie about a video game I played, let's see what they made out of it. Well, I wasn't surprised, that the story deviated from the game, I wasn't surprised that they didn't have a lot of money for the special effects, but I saw the list of actors taking part in the movie, which was really surprising.For the movie, I must say, that it is a descent action movie and that it is - of course - on a low budget scale. That includes taking the setting away from a nice tropical environment and placing it into a more Canadian and cheaper setting. That also includes, that the storyline changed - who ever made a movie based on a first person shooter and based the story only on this person? - but in a reasonable scale. This also means, that some characters were invented (e.g. the big funny guy and the uncle, you will see, if you see the movie).What I liked about it was all about the game - they implemented the cars, the boat(s), the secret experiments stuff and the one guy that got there - uninvited. What I disliked about the movie: Well, it could have been a lot closer to the game. Why not making an opening according to the game? Let the one guy making the opening with his boat getting torn apart and leaving him in a situation, where he must find out for himself. Let him discover on his own, where he is and why all this sh** is going on around him.So, if you like cheap action movies - go for it! If you want a serious storyline with academy awards performances - avoid it. I liked the movie and I must admit, that although the storyline changed and it doesn't really feel like ""Far Cry - the game"", there was a lot of fun and action in it.

6,Fight fight fight,"Yet another video game adaptation by Mr. Boll, FAR CRY has a retired Special Forces guy (Schweiger) ferrying a female reporter (Vaugier) to a remote island where her uncle is being held by mysterious forces. Turns out the island is a government institution where a mad doctor (Kier) is transforming soldiers into super soldiers. Vaugfier gets captured early on, so it's up to Schweiger to rescue her and the uncle and take on about 500 soldiers -- plus the mad doctor. Schweiger, the current generations's answer to Tom Jane and Christopher Lambert, is an affable, German-born actor probably best known for INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. Vaugier is her usual sexy self, but is little used in the film. Standard mindless fight scenes and explosions clearly inspired by UNIVERSAL SOLDIER.
