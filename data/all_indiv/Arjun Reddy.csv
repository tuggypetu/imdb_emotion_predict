8.0,May be the first modern cult classic in telugu,"It has been a refreshing experience watching this movie. The romance, characterization is at its raw best. I am glad that the director and his team did not do anything to dial it down. The performances have been great. We all know the story, but it has not been done before in Telugu cinema. In some ways, this can be called modern Devdas with realistic dialogue.Without spoiling; the story is about a young MBBS student with anger management issues falling in love. Arjun Reddy's character is deeply flawed. I must appreciate the director and crew steering away from the Telugu movie way of showing the lead character in a perfect light. I am glad the character is flawed. There are several instances in this 186 minute movie that shows us the flawed side of our hero. It works out for the story telling. Also in this tale, we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger; which does not happen in other flicks.The physical romance couldn't be more appropriate. It's is present where necessary and only promotes story telling and emotions. Also, the story is also about a bunch of characters constantly caring and supporting Arjun Reddy despite his strong requirement for sole confinement. The sick kick friend is more than a side kick shows real spine in tense moments, also providing subtle comedy in the various situations. The movie does not commit to one message. The grandma says ""a person who wants to suffer must be left alone and that person will soon get back on his feet""; But almost all characters related to the hero (Brother, friends) always keep visiting Arjun despite Arjun yelling them to go away. It was the supporting friends and family that bring back a almost lost soul back. When Arjun loses everything, left with no money and thrown on the road; it's the brother and father who spend their money to send Arjun to exotic countries to help him get over the girl.The movie doesn't seem 3 hour long, but definitely feels lengthy, often straining the eyes. Preethi's character is underdeveloped, but she did a decent job at that. The heroin side track was unnecessary and does not contribute much.Overall, this is a refreshing change in Tollywood and I can see a lot of directors experimenting by not following the Telugu formulaic trend in the upcoming years.",may be first modern cult classic telugu,it has been refreshing experience watching this movie romance characterization is at its raw best i am glad that director his team did not do anything dial it down performances have been great we all know story but it has not been done before telugu cinema some ways this can be called modern devdas with realistic dialogue without spoiling story is about young mbbs student with anger management issues falling love arjun reddys character is deeply flawed i must appreciate director crew steering away telugu movie way showing lead character perfect light i am glad character is flawed there are several instances this 186 minute movie that shows us flawed side our hero it works out story telling also this tale we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger which does not happen other flicks physical romance couldnt be more appropriate its is present where necessary only promotes story telling emotions also story is also about bunch characters constantly caring supporting arjun reddy despite his strong requirement sole confinement sick kick friend is more than side kick shows real spine tense moments also providing subtle comedy various situations movie does not commit one message grandma says person who wants suffer must be left alone that person will soon get back his feet but almost all characters related hero brother friends always keep visiting arjun despite arjun yelling them go away it was supporting friends family that bring back almost lost soul back when arjun loses everything left with no money thrown road its brother father who spend their money send arjun exotic countries help him get over girl movie doesnt seem 3 hour long but definitely feels lengthy often straining eyes preethis character is underdeveloped but she did decent job at that heroin side track was unnecessary does not contribute much overall this is refreshing change tollywood i can see lot directors experimenting by not following telugu formulaic trend upcoming years,0.4296858599490178,0.08317642396589765,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
5.0,Over hyped film of immersive misogynistic narcissism,"This is the story of a guy and somewhat a girl, who are in deep love, develop strong relations, the girl getting married off to another, the guy getting addicted to booze, drugs, and a beard - an essential accessory for any Telugu film hero with disastrous love affair. The film starts with the hero (Vijay Sai Deverakonda) as a doctor in unkempt avatar with unpleasant characteristics. The provenance of the beard can be traced back to a violent fracas on football field, causing a showdown with a colourless dean. In defence, the hero serves up first of many infantile philosophies that pepper the film. He says ""Football is a violent sport"" (it is not), he plays for satisfaction, not medals. His friend who accompanies him, orders the class to stand up and ""respect the champion"". Every student stands up instantaneously as if national anthem has been set loose all of a sudden. They are so supine, scared, and scarred by the braggadocio of the guy who is permanently angry for no reason.However he is supposed to be great at sudies, excels in sports, eventually would do record operations even when drunk and drugged, and in spare time, when not emitting sexist rants, flies spaceships (I made up one of those). He also administers anatomical drawings on body, as a teaching aid, as if he were a modern day Vesalius. The director's idea of demonstrating keen intellect is to show him staring with keen anger while delivering juvenile banter as some sort of profoundness. Women are supposed to throw at his feet, even when he hits rock bottom, drunkard and jobless drug addict - such are these Telugu films.Enter, Preeti the first year fresher, who has instant anodyne effect on the hero. Ever since he is besotted with her, he marks her as his property by planting a kiss on her cheek without her consent. Later in the film, we would hear another insipid philosophical babble on his 'private space' that should be respected by others, of course, being a 'free spirit', he could invade others' space at will if they happen to be women. There starts the dog like devotion and aggressive possessiveness of the hero. In time honoured convention in Telugu films, the hero lays claim to her, 'protects' her from ragging predators. Warming up to dog motif, again, without her knowledge, people label her 'his girl', just as one would say 'his dog', which is a good template to understand his attitude towards her. Only thing he does not objectify is one real dog in the film, which is elevated to human, whereas the girl is downgraded to a faithful dog. In many scenes, you might as well replace the dog with the girl, as the dog barely barks and the girl rarely speaks. Then he hears of Preeti being marked rather inappropriately by another male dog during Holi celebrations. That heralds a sequence of rage filled obscene expletives which are now celebrated for being bold, raw, intense never before shown in Telugu films, director breaking the conventions of ordinary films making. The abuse is of course very conventional, targeting women, uttered by the hero (yes the same guy who would prattle pretentiously on how not to objectify women), to avenge the vile touch. The girl falls into his arms for protecting her honour, somewhat in Taliban style. And Telugu hero must acquire another essential accessory - a second heroine, of course with zero dignity. His treatment of her resembles kicking out a dog when he wanted to reject her.Showdown with the girl's father: The director often needs squalid characters to show hero in better light. The domineering father is a rank casteist stereotype who detests guy. He catches him kissing her at his home and angrily confronts him. By this time the director probably has convinced some good number of audience to fondly imagine that it is perfectly acceptable to visit someone's home, kiss their daughter and demand what the hero later blathers about as 'private space'. The girl's marriage is forcefully fixed and the hero gives her six hours to make up her mind to move out with him. What is the best way to reinforce his point to the woman? Slap her of course. He is medieval, but as we are told, he is a free spirit, so it is supposed to be ok.Then there is a ridiculous, completely out of context scene about PMS, contrived to show the audience how sensitive he is to female concerns, as if to tell 'I am not a sexist beast, I have this delicate side', crassly exploiting to extract brownie points. In another scene, the director makes him sermonise a moronic NRI not to objectify women. The characters surrounding the male lead are cardboard which is at least two dimensional. The hero is unidimensional, with angry face at one end, and pseudo empathetic drivel on the other.During his disciplinary hearings, he remembers Hippocratic oath, presenting himself as a guy with integrity. Such pangs of conscience! This guy does not remember the pledge we are drilled down in schools. ""All Indians are my brothers and sisters"". This sounds like kitsch, but intended to reflect fraternal spirit from the three pillars of Indian constitution - liberty, equality, fraternity. There is little fraternal feeling in this pledge loving bloke. When the girl's father asks him to look after his daughter like a ""sister"", he utters ""he does not have sisters"" in a pompous tone mocking Preeti's father for his old fashioned thinking. His own thinking or lack of it towards women is rather antediluvian. Even then, a character admiringly rambles that he has never seen a free spirit like this guy in a democracy. He neither understands free spirit, nor democracy (unless the free spirit means free booze), and spews this arrant nonsense. Coming to think of it, people in lunatic asylum are free spirits too. A man who needs a muse to be a lamb, but deforms into a brute ('free spirit') and loses self control when he loses her is fundamentally a weak person, though his brutishness appears as a sign of strength.While he is growing a beard, Preeti is growing his child, heavily pregnant. This is going to be film about beard, borne like a cross, not a potentially career ending silly pregnancy. A shawl would have added to the hero's pathos, but is too ethnic for our westernized pseudo progressive. He is an odious sociopath, but since he is handsome, needs escape route. Conveniently grandma dies, creating instantaneous transformation, faster than 2-minute noodles, manifested by the removal of that blasted beard. He is a changed man. Whatever changed, his propensity to deliver incomprehensible gibberish as philosophy does not cease, and his dad, mesmerised, has instant transformation himself (since loss of beard is the ""game changer"" of Telugu cinema). If only his friends found him a decent barber in time...never mind, better late than never.Anthony Hopkins as Dr.Hannibal Lecter remarks while lobotomising Ray Liotta's policeman that he did not need that part of the brain dealing with good manners. Our hero surely seemed to miss this part, even without a lobotomy, as demonstrated by his crude language with nurses, about patients, friends, especially regarding women. (By the way isn't Dr.Lecter a high end 'free spirit', with impeccable manners?). Once he asks his married classmate 'inkaa neellosukoledaa', enquiring about her pregnancy. When he sees a woman, he sees them as baby making machinery of future Arjun Reddys.Finally what did this path breaking film break? The dialogues sound casual without bombastic music. Nothing new, if one observed some old Telugu films (e.g. Rojulu maaraayi (1955), shaavukaru(1950) ). Story is banal, narration is dragging; comedy shines sometimes with outstanding Rahul Ramakrishna's Siva, but comic potential in Telugu films is enormous and not particularly novel. Songs: not having been bombarded with pre-release audio tracks to condition auricular senses, did not particularly find them greatly appealing. Much is made of Vijay Devarakonda's action, but superior performances come from Kanchana and Rahul Ramakrishna who transformed normal roles into scene stealing glue that holds this dismal film together. Maniacal roles are not the best yardsticks of performance. They inject more to the character than any acting. Batman's Joker is an example, with the actors having high chance of receiving high accolades! His performance is decent, but no better than in another of his recent films 'pelli choopulu' (2016). Then what is unique? This differs from others in using cuss words, peppering with obscene gratuitous expletives, under the pretence of showing realism, and the director is showered with epithets of 'bold' 'raw', 'honest'. Perhaps, dicing the film with even filthier language would have been termed ""bolder"". And of course, heavily publicised kissing (creating a very useful marketable controversy) . He also created one of the shallowest female leads, even by the abysmal standards of Telugu cinema, quite a feat. He is hailed as some sort of Sergei Eisenstein of Telugu films for this crudity. Forgot, there is another first by our Eisenstein. Never before seen piddling in the pants. Can any one beat that? Truly, ""bold"", ""raw"" , ""path breaking"" is alive and pissing. If you are not convinced by the dog motif mentioned earlier, this scene should confirm great canine like qualities of the hero, this time marking himself - a symbolic statement of his self indulgent narcissism. The ultra westernized tenor gives pretensions of modernity covering up misogynist behaviour. We can only expect more of such 'youth' films. On the opposite end, we have traditionalists who want to impose their own authority under the pretext of protecting women from western influences. Women will be caught out in a pincer movement of devil of and the deep blue sea.",over hyped film immersive misogynistic narcissism,this is story guy somewhat girl who are deep love develop strong

1.0,Basically a psychologically disturbed who needs mental help gets in love with meek woman!,"It's one of the disgusting hopeless, cheapest movie ever!

But no, it's basically some dumbest portrayal of a mentally disturbed man, who requires mental asylum who happens to be brilliant student out of blue, fall in love with some rabbit kind of meek woman because of innocence. It got zero character building, no character arc, weak story line, pretty okish cinematography and forced emotional torture to experience one's pain of getting into drugs!.Really society needs to grow up rather than crediting their mental problems as healthy nature's projection. This is even now being made by same director, a hindi movie. I'm sure it is going to be same. I wonder what people are actually thinking to vote this movie as best. Really you people need some mental help rather than see this as some kind of amazing performance, story or realistic film as such. It's no where near to anything good to pull off.

3.0,Strong characterisation .. But story makes no sense!!,"Ok, I am lost here, saw this movie yesterday after all that hype and hungaama and I really don't get how this film is truly different and mind-blowing! Are people only talking about the characterisation, which I will agree is quite strong and unapologetic. Vijay Deverakonda lives and breathes into this role. He is soo natural, almost too natural making us wonder if he has the same off-screen personality as well, which is a bit scary. Coming to the story, I am really not sure what the director wanted to convey. Did he want to tell us that it is bad being rude and acting on impulse .. and that such people strongly needs therapy?? I understand that Arjun Reddy has anger issues and acts impulsively, but it is soo stupid that his love interest, Preeti also does the same, where she was supposed to be the sane one. She gets married to some random dude, despite being totally in love with Arjun because he did not answer his phone for a single day due to a drug overdose!!!??? And this is what people are calling as a revolutionary cult classic!!! The second half is full of his downward spiral of Arjun Reddy and it is tedious watching this! Despite all his doings, he suddenly has flashes of remorse, especially in front of the lawyers and this is soo unconvincing. The ending saves this film a bit but makes all his suffering almost pointless. At any moment, Preeti could have ended his suffering instead we get a sub-plot with a film star thrown in and also countless moments where Arjun Reddy almost gets to kick the bucket!Really, all this could have been justifiable, if the conflict point between the two lovers was strong. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, it is the weakest aspect which brings the entire film down.",strong characterisation but story makes no sense,ok i am lost here saw this movie yesterday after all that hype hungaama i really dont get how this film is truly different mind blowing are people only talking about characterisation which i will agree is quite strong unapologetic vijay deverakonda lives breathes into this role he is soo natural almost too natural making us wonder if he has same off screen personality as well which is bit scary coming story i am really not sure what director wanted convey did he want tell us that it is bad being rude acting impulse that such people strongly needs therapy i understand that arjun reddy has anger issues acts impulsively but it is soo stupid that his love interest preeti also does same where she was supposed be sane one she gets married some random dude despite being totally love with arjun because he did not answer his phone single day due drug overdose this is what people are calling as revolutionary cult classic second half is full his downward spiral arjun reddy it is tedious watching this despite all his doings he suddenly has flashes remorse especially front lawyers this is soo unconvincing ending saves this film bit but makes all his suffering almost pointless at any moment preeti could have ended his suffering instead we get sub plot with film star thrown also countless moments where arjun reddy almost gets kick bucket really all this could have been justifiable if conflict point between two lovers was strong unfortunately as i mentioned it is weakest aspect which brings entire film down,0.5173178673178672,-0.023555148555148543,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.23}"

Some brilliant performance from supporting actors like Rahul who plays his best friend Shiva. I just loved Shiva's character as he is the Spinal Cord of the movie. Soul satisfying music. Hatsoff to Director Sandeep Vanga for introducing this kind of a movie to Telugu Film industry. Very good and important messages conveyed, much needed for this generation youth.

8.0,Arjun Reddy is a raw and honest take on youthful love stories with award-winning performance from Vijay Sai Devarakonda.,"Arjun Reddy (2017): Arjun Reddy got immense craze which is no less than the craze Kabali got.Youth went crazy after watching its trailers and posters especially because of its cuss words and kiss scenes which are quite bold to Telugu audience.But what came as a surprise is its realistic and honest portrayal of love stories.Plot: Arjun Reddy (Vijay Devarakonda), an ortho doctor has issues with alcoholism. He is an efficient ortho surgeon, but on the personal front, he is an alcoholic. And the reason for his turning into one is his love failure during his college days in Mangalore Medical College.While in college, he falls for first year student of MBBS. Preeti (Shalini) too likes him and their edgy love affair begins. Her father doesn't agree to their relationship and a huge tussle happens between Arjun Reddy and Preeti's family. This results in Preeti's father marrying her off to another person.After knowing that she got married, Arjun Reddy turns alcoholic and his anger issues further escalate. He becomes a modern-day version of Devdas who takes to alcohol, drugs, and tries to distance himself from the society.Rest of the story showcases the journey of Arjun Reddy as to how he regains his senses and gets back to normal.My Review: Arjun Reddy may have attracted audience with all the cuss words and smooches but it is one of the most realistic love stories in recent times.Arjun Reddy is like Kumari 21f of males.Sandeep Vanga has chosen an unconventional way to give new feel to audience.This is the story of the lead character Arjun Reddy, and yet there isn't a story, a structure to be precise, to follow and anticipate what might happen next. It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.Sandeep presents Vijay's character from different perspectives and from each point of view; we get to understand Arjun even better. For Arjun's father, his son's actions are stains on his prestige. For his friends, Arjun's actions show his recklessness and free-spirited attitude. For Preethi, Arjun's actions show his madness and unwillingness to change, which she eventually embraces.There are lot of amazing scenes in the movie which has immense depth in it.Especially the scene where Arjun rejects a guy who came to marry his friend's sister because that guy talks cheap about females.That shows the true nature of Arjun Reddy.The scene where heroine tries to calm down infuriated Arjun is one of the best scenes of the year.It's not the number of lip-locks or the use of expletives that make Arjun Reddy a brave film. What really makes it a brave film and its director, a man with guts, is that it ventures into a space Telugu cinema has dared to enter and I doubt if it will ever. It shows that any story, when told with conviction, will be accepted and celebrated.But the major drawback is its lengthy duration which is 3hr 06 min.Almost 30mins of the movie can be edited out as most of the scenes feel repetitive in second half.It is clear that director did not want to lose any detail of Arjun reddy's fictional life but he should have written some strong scenes which are entirely missing which make us feel Arjun's pain.Vijay Devarakonda stuns you with his performance which is surely award winning. The way he brings the pathos and pain in his character is something else and drives the film completely. His dialogue delivery, the aggression he shows and the emotional manner in which he showcases his love is superb.Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.Rama Krishna who played Arjun's friend is brilliant as he entertains with his witty dialogues reactions.Actress Shalini may not look pretty but gave good performance.Yesteryear actress Kanchana is very good in the role of free-spirited grandma.Songs are good but its the BGM which is the soul of the movie.It elevated proceedings in brilliant way.So,Arjun Reddy is a raw and honest take on youthful love stories with award-winning performance from Vijay Sai Devarakonda.My rating 7.5/10",arjun reddy is raw honest take youthful love stories with award winning performance vijay sai devarakonda,arjun reddy 2017 arjun reddy got immense craze which is no less than craze kabali got youth went crazy after watching its trailers posters especially because its cuss words kiss scenes which are quite bold telugu audience but what came as surprise is its realistic honest portrayal love stories plot arjun reddy vijay devarakonda ortho doctor has issues with alcoholism he is efficient ortho surgeon but personal front he is alcoholic reason his turning into one is his love failure during his college days mangalore medical college while college he falls first year student mbbs preeti shalini too likes him their edgy love affair begins her father doesnt agree their relationship huge tussle happens between arjun reddy preetis family this results preetis father marrying her off another person after knowing that she got married arjun reddy turns alcoholic his anger issues further escalate he becomes modern day version devdas who takes alcohol drugs tries distance himself society rest story showcases journey arjun reddy as how he regains his senses gets back normal my review arjun reddy may have attracted audience with all cuss words smooches but it is one most realistic love stories recent times arjun reddy is like kumari 21f males sandeep vanga has chosen unconventional way give new feel audience this is story lead character arjun reddy yet there isnt story structure be precise follow anticipate what might happen next its rise fall rise arjun his journey love suffering is nothing short poetic heart wrenching sandeep presents vijays character different perspectives each point view we get understand arjun even better arjuns father his sons actions are stains his prestige his friends arjuns actions show his recklessness free spirited attitude preethi arjuns actions show his madness unwillingness change which she eventually embraces there are lot amazing scenes movie which has immense depth it especially scene where arjun rejects guy who came marry his friends sister because that guy talks cheap about females that shows true nature arjun reddy scene where heroine tries calm down infuriated arjun is one best scenes year its not number lip locks or use expletives that make arjun reddy brave film what really makes it brave film its director man with guts is that it ventures into space telugu cinema has dared enter i doubt if it will ever it shows that any story when told with conviction will be accepted celebrated but major drawback is its lengthy duration which is 3hr 06 min almost 30mins movie can be edited out as most scenes feel repetitive second half it is clear that director did not want lose any detail arjun reddys fictional life but he should have written some strong scenes which are entirely missing which make us feel arjuns pain vijay devarakonda stuns you with his performance which is surely award winning way he brings pathos pain his character is something else drives film completely his dialogue delivery aggression he shows emotional manner which he showcases his love is superb vijays performance as college goer with serious anger issues or as alcoholic surgeon will leave you awe his versatility pulling off such diverse avatars with ease as if it was childs play rama krishna who played arjuns friend is brilliant as he entertains with his witty dialogues reactions actress shalini may not look pretty but gave good performance yesteryear actress kanchana is very good role free spirited grandma songs are good but its bgm which is soul movie it elevated proceedings brilliant way so arjun reddy is raw honest take youthful love stories with award winning performance vijay sai devarakonda my rating 7 5 10,0.5814628805537896,0.22992541234018507,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1.0,Slow boring movie that makes no sense and hero has no likability,"The hero is born into wealth and without any effort becomes a great surgeon who has a drinking/drugs problem and anger issues. Due to his unreasonable brashness, he looses his girlfriend and sulks about it for months. Even how he got the girlfriend is disturbing; from the second she steps foot on campus he tells everyone she is his and protects her from bullying. Their difference in personalities (she's shy) and age (he's a senior) makes it seem like he is taking advantage of her rather than a natural mutual attraction. Meanwhile, in present day, he has no respect for anyone, performs surgeries drunk and brings misery to everyone in his life. However there is a happy ending as he magically gets over addiction when his grandma dies and gets back his girlfriend who turns out to be pregnant with his child. The miscommunication and reactions of the hero and girlfriend are illogical and unbelievable. Even when he have lost everything, the audience may find it to sympathize with such a terrible human being. Also the director applies slow motion to scenes often, even when it doesn't make sense. The background score is edgy and features English songs, probably inspired by Hollywood soundtracks. I agree that this is different from a typical Telugu movie but it also lacks proper plot and pacing. It glamourizes bad behavior and is more of a temper tantrum than a love story.

9.0,This is what cinema should be!,"Sitting in my room, my mind is still probing the edges of this one of a kind, beautifully executed, epic journey of a deeply flawed character that the director wanted to take us on. He has one message - love in any form is pure and free from any constraints that our culture might seemingly shackle us in. In the first act, I hated this character that was supposedly the movie's protagonist. In fact, you will like any other character over him apart from the girl's father, and that sure is a warning sign for any story. I thought I would end up disliking the movie, which almost everyone has praised. But as the film progressed, I found myself getting hooked. This director, almost implausibly, made it work, and I couldn't praise him more for handling such a tricky, controversial plot so seamlessly. With every scene, the director drags you into the messy life of Arjun Reddy. You will disagree with most of his actions, yet you find yourself relating to him. The director makes it work by focusing on the things which we all share, his emotions, his love for Prithi, and his passion for his field, the sincerity and candor in his dialogues. Every scene was shot beautifully, was interesting, and was important to the film, which is impressive considering the film was 3 hours long. It is also very easy to fall into the trap of using commonplace, hackneyed characters as your supporting cast with such a complex main character. You won't find any of that here. Each character is unique, and feels like a gust of fresh air in today's movie industry. More importantly, they all seem real. Not once, do you find any of the characters acting out of the personality and role the director has fleshed them in.Kudos to the whole team of Arjun Reddy. You have sculptured a wonderful picture!

7.0,Flawed Devdas..again!!,"It's a sad feeling that you get coming out of the theater, similar to what the main protagonist experiences throughout majority of the running time of the movie (whopping 3 hours). It's sad because such an unconventional, daring,bold, courageous movie couldn't come out if the shackles of a typical mainstream climax. Wish you could erase the final few minutes of the movie and rewrite the script to something mature and inspirational. But having said that, you would have experienced something that very rarely comes out of Telugu or Indian Cinema already which deserves rich applause to mainly the director and the male lead( which I'm sure is coming).The movie just takes off from the word go where in flashbacks, we're introduced to a good looking,hot headed, topper in the final year of his medical college. He openly dares the dean, other medicos, gets violent very often and has all the habits a doctor shouldn't have. Still he is feared and revered by all. The scenes in the college where he falls for a fresher, the ragging, romance are all shot boldly with immense realism and shock value. But somehow you connect with the male lead who is his worst enemy. The director displays the same ""I care for none"" attitude throughout the film and you hardly get time to digest the new age, open and bold dialogues (majority beeped), PDAs & fights, but still you feel for the love story when it goes awry. That is where the hero and the film start a downhill course. You don't get to feel the real reason for the separation and subsequent pain, suffering, indulgence,recklessness, but that only a minor flaw because Vijay Sai makes you feel his pain and gives a character to root for even as he slides and slides into a deep pit.it is probably his best lifetime performance. The sidekick is fantastic as well even through the dark phases of drugs, alcohol, women and the rest. Alas,we don't get any perspective from the female side which is fine till out of nowhere you get a story which is unrelatable at the end. The music and background score are one of the highlights,so are the performances of all actors. The editing makes the movie overlong & repetitive.

It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.Sandeep and Vijay, as director and hero, make the film for what it is, and both have paved the way for a new chapter in Telugu film History. If it was Pellichoopulu and Kshanam last year, it's Arjun Reddy in 2017, and these films assure there is light at the end of the tunnel.As much as the film belongs to Sandeep, who is also its writer, it equally belongs to Vijay Devarakonda, who is the life of Arjun Reddy. Vijay breathes life into the character and it's impossible to imagine anyone else in his shoes. Be it his passion, love, and rage; he portrays these several layers of his character with unparalleled realism.Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.Arjun Reddy most original, experimental and daring work to come out Telugu cinema in a long time.",arjun reddy is not film its experience thatll stay with you,love arjun reddy is pure unabashedly bold hard hitting it touches soul ways it cant be explained it gives story modern day devdas twist while making overall cinematic experience journey remember long time this is story lead character arjun reddy vijay deverakonda yet there isnt story structure be precise follow anticipate what might happen next its rise fall rise arjun his journey love suffering is nothing short poetic heart wrenching sandeep vijay as director hero make film what it is both have paved way new chapter telugu film history if it was pellichoopulu kshanam last year its arjun reddy 2017 these films assure there is light at end tunnel as much as film belongs sandeep who is also its writer it equally belongs vijay devarakonda who is life arjun reddy vijay breathes life into character its impossible imagine anyone else his shoes be it his passion love rage he portrays these several layers his character with unparalleled realism vijays performance as college goer with serious anger issues or as alcoholic surgeon will leave you awe his versatility pulling off such diverse avatars with ease as if it was childs play arjun reddy most original experimental daring work come out telugu cinema long time,0.44297283176593516,0.08249365576951785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.45}"
7.0,Spoiled to chaos with heart,"In the first act, we see Arjun Reddy as a spoiled rich and brilliant brute who does whatever he wants without any consequences. I hated the protagonist at that point. But then it started making more sense, he got a lot of negative aspects, he is nowhere near perfect even with all of his acts of righteousness, machoism and philosophy but he is honest in a society that tells you to lie at every turn of life. The misogyny and objectification through context (usual Telugu films directly do that) exist but it is also part of the world we live in and it is necessarily a part of him that makes the character more realistic that goes along perfectly with his toxic masculinity. Arjun Reddy succeeds where Kaatru Veliyidai was a failure in that sense. Vijay Devarakonda brilliantly portrays Arjun Reddy going through all those transitions. Even with all the familiar tropes at every point in the plot, the film keeps you engaged and gives some fresh perspective which may not be easily relatable but part of the world we live in.",spoiled chaos with heart,first act we see arjun reddy as spoiled rich brilliant brute who does whatever he wants without any consequences i hated protagonist at that point but then it started making more sense he got lot negative aspects he is nowhere near perfect even with all his acts righteousness machoism philosophy but he is honest society that tells you lie at every turn life misogyny objectification through context usual telugu films directly do that exist but it is also part world we live it is necessarily part him that makes character more realistic that goes along perfectly with his toxic masculinity arjun reddy succeeds where kaatru veliyidai was failure that sense vijay devarakonda brilliantly portrays arjun reddy going through all those transitions even with all familiar tropes at every point plot film keeps you engaged gives some fresh perspective which may not be easily relatable but part world we live,0.5750000000000001,0.2877525252525253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.41}"
