5,"A review of ""D-War""","To review ""D-War"" (sometimes called ""Dragon Wars"" or ""Dragon Wars: D-War"") with any real depth would be an exercise in utter futility. I mean that, really. The film is a big, loud special effects bonanza the likes of which have been seen plenty of times on United States soil, but ""D-War"" is unique in the fact that it is not an American production, but an Asian one, specifically of the South Korean kind.But just because it's a South Korean movie with American actors, does that really make it good? It's a yes/no/maybe so type of answer. ""D-War"" comes to us from South Korean import Hyung-rae Shim, who announced the project back in 2002 and has spent the last five years getting it off the ground. It's received mostly negative reviews here in the U.S. and in South Korea (where it set box office records for an opening week with an estimated five million viewers within a nine-day time-span), but the movie's special effects and action sequences are undeniably stunning. But it's a shame about the story and characters.Supposedly based on an ancient Korean legend, a 200-meter-long Imoogi (a giant serpent) called Buraki is denied a chance at immortality when two young lovers who are destined to perform the ceremonial rights run away and perish in their escape. 500 years later in Los Angeles, the man is reincarnated as American news reporter Ethan (Jason Behr), who as a child was given a powerful pendant by an elderly antiques dealer named Jack (Robert Forster) and now has to find the reincarnated woman, Sarah (Amanda Brooks), before her 20th birthday.Sure enough, in special effects sequences that seem right out of any Asian monster flick made in the last 50 years, the dragon Buraki reappears with his seemingly invincible army of demonic warriors to continue his 500-year pursuit of what is rightfully his. Lots of explosions, guns, and destruction as ancient slams head-on into 21st-century military technology, and Ethan and Sarah try to find a way to stop Buraki and his army before he destroys the city.""D-War"" is a film that looks and sounds amazing, in theory, but the execution is so poor that you'll rightfully feel that you've been cheated by the time the credits roll. Make no mistake, Buraki and his minions look pretty cool and plenty menacing, and the destruction they bring about in their action sequences is nothing short of breathtaking. In this regard, Shim has surely done his job in presenting ""D-War"" as a no-holds-barred sci-fi/fantasy action epic.On the other hand, the film's human players are drastically short-changed and given cheap, hokey dialogue and scenes that rarely connect. It seems that the only reason they're here is to give us something to root for, which is not in any real way genuine. ""D-War"" unfortunately comes off as something a lot closer to the poor American adaptation ""Godzilla"" (1998) than anything that is uniquely Korean. Another problem is that the story seems to take itself a little too seriously, with cheap humor that doesn't get anything greater from us than a weak little laugh. The acting and direction seem mediocre at best (so that you do feel a little sorry for the hokey performances of American heavyweight Robert Forster and up-and-coming Jason Behr), which is a real shame because Hyung-rae Shim is obviously a capable talent who knew what he wanted to do here and surely enough had the means to do it. His head seems full of ideas but the problem is with the execution of those ideas; maybe he was trying to do too much without really working out the material in greater detail. And the ending, a would-be ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" special effects showdown, seems pretty cheap too.I really wanted to like this movie, believe me, but ""D-War"" is a mediocre attempt at something that really had potential to be spectacular. But maybe it's because I'm an American. Maybe you'd have to be Korean to understand the mythical themes about that classic battle between good and evil. It's just too bad that the finished product of ""D-War"" appears to be like any other ""B""-grade monster movie than the extraordinary idea that the director had in mind.5/10",review d war,review d war sometimes called dragon wars or dragon wars d war with any real depth would be exercise utter futility i mean that really film is big loud special effects bonanza likes which have been seen plenty times united states soil but d war is unique fact that it is not american production but asian one specifically south korean kind but just because its south korean movie with american actors does that really make it good its yes no maybe so type answer d war comes us south korean import hyung rae shim who announced project back 2002 has spent last five years getting it off ground its received mostly negative reviews here u s south korea where it set box office records opening week with estimated five million viewers within nine day time span but movies special effects action sequences are undeniably stunning but its shame about story characters supposedly based ancient korean legend 200 meter long imoogi giant serpent called buraki is denied chance at immortality when two young lovers who are destined perform ceremonial rights run away perish their escape 500 years later los angeles man is reincarnated as american news reporter ethan jason behr who as child was given powerful pendant by elderly antiques dealer named jack robert forster now has find reincarnated woman sarah amanda brooks before her 20th birthday sure enough special effects sequences that seem right out any asian monster flick made last 50 years dragon buraki reappears with his seemingly invincible army demonic warriors continue his 500 year pursuit what is rightfully his lots explosions guns destruction as ancient slams head into 21st century military technology ethan sarah try find way stop buraki his army before he destroys city d war is film that looks sounds amazing theory but execution is so poor that youll rightfully feel that youve been cheated by time credits roll make no mistake buraki his minions look pretty cool plenty menacing destruction they bring about their action sequences is nothing short breathtaking this regard shim has surely done his job presenting d war as no holds barred sci fi fantasy action epic other hand films human players are drastically short changed given cheap hokey dialogue scenes that rarely connect it seems that only reason theyre here is give us something root which is not any real way genuine d war unfortunately comes off as something lot closer poor american adaptation godzilla 1998 than anything that is uniquely korean another problem is that story seems take itself little too seriously with cheap humor that doesnt get anything greater us than weak little laugh acting direction seem mediocre at best so that you do feel little sorry hokey performances american heavyweight robert forster up coming jason behr which is real shame because hyung rae shim is obviously capable talent who knew what he wanted do here surely enough had means do it his head seems full ideas but problem is with execution those ideas maybe he was trying do too much without really working out material greater detail ending would be raiders lost ark special effects showdown seems pretty cheap too i really wanted like this movie believe me but d war is mediocre attempt at something that really had potential be spectacular but maybe its because im american maybe youd have be korean understand mythical themes about that classic battle between good evil its just too bad that finished product d war appears be like any other b grade monster movie than extraordinary idea that director had mind 5 10,0.4899477861319967,0.09611528822055136,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.33}"
4,Great special effects...but they're completely wasted on this storyline,"How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much.",great special effects but theyre completely wasted this storyline,how this movie got made with supposedly 70 million budget without being completely retooled is beyond me storyline dialogue are beyond amateurish characters say things no real person would ever say almost never react things that were said before no one seems be grounded real world acting leads is fine given that writing is such dud but several actors supporting roles really drag production down heros hair probably shouldve gotten its own credit it was so oddly attention grabbing not mention that it gave one better performances pic finally movie about l being besieged by giant reptiles this film is shockingly boring what shame if you do see this your mind will be constantly racing thinking up ways that you could have taken sfx scenes built far better movie around them sadly it wouldnt have taken much,0.5005793650793651,0.05606349206349205,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.47, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.34}"
2,The worst major film I've seen in a long time,"I went into this movie with high hopes. Normally, I'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are *always* fun to watch, or so I thought. I'll list the good parts of this movie: -The creature effects. All of the creatures were well-done, their movements were realistic, and they fit into the other imagery well. To be honest, the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. Now, the bad things: -The acting. Good Lord, I've seen bad acting, but this movie takes the cake. Not a single one of the characters is even *close* to believable. It's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try-outs from it. I tried very hard not to giggle too loud, cause I didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre, but the acting really was THAT BAD. -The storyline: The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish. You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film. The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clichéd, not thought-out, and outright dumbest stories I've ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel. -The dialogue: This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichéd thing they possibly can, at every chance they possibly can. In this world, it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movies. It is the world of cheese and cliché. -The special effects. While the creature effects were downright awesome, the special effects fail miserably. Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of it is in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation whatsoever. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest. To sum up: Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money. The concept is good, but it is trapped in the bad directing, acting, dialogue, and cheesiness of the film. Wait til the next big monster movie comes out. It's gotta be better than this, cause Dragon Wars is absolutely horrible.",worst major film ive seen long time,i went into this movie with high hopes normally im not too picky about my movies creature movies are always fun watch or so i thought ill list good parts this movie creature effects all creatures were well done their movements were realistic they fit into other imagery well be honest creature effects were only reason i gave this movie 2 rather than 1 now bad things acting good lord ive seen bad acting but this movie takes cake not single one characters is even close believable its like director sent out casting call picked all worst try outs it i tried very hard not giggle too loud cause i didnt wanna upset anyone else theatre but acting really was that bad storyline entire story is full plot holes beginning finish you can pick at least 5 plot holes out any given 30 minutes film plot holes course are complimentary with cheese this is probably one most clich d not thought out outright dumbest stories ive ever seen put screen since i had grave misfortune sitting up one night watching parasite scifi channel dialogue this is world where everyone says cheesiest most clich d thing they possibly can at every chance they possibly can this world it seems like every line has been spoken before at least 30 other low budget creature movies it is world cheese clich special effects while creature effects were downright awesome special effects fail miserably yes they are better than those seen other movies but lot it is presentation this movie has no presentation whatsoever it looks kinda like special effects used power rangers tv show be honest sum up dragon wars is worth neither your time nor your money concept is good but it is trapped bad directing acting dialogue cheesiness film wait til next big monster movie comes out its gotta be better than this cause dragon wars is absolutely horrible,0.5236203231292519,0.006556122448979605,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
2,A sloppy translation from Korean to English,"Apparently ""D-War"" was originally a Korean film. But instead of simply translating it into English (either with captions or dubbing), they separately filmed some American actors and inserted them into the movie. Then, during portions where the Koreans talk, occasionally the narrator summarizes what they said...no captions, no dubbing...but a LOT of confusion. This is a case where a film bombed and much of it simply was because the film wasn't translated well to English-speaking audiences! It fel much like watching a film in a foreign land and understanding nothing until, on rare occasions, someone sitting behind you explains a BIT of what is going on! I think the filmmakers would have been kept the film in Korean...period.The story, because of the way it's told, is pretty confusing and I'm not going to bother recounting the script. Suffice to say that there are a lot of CGI monsters, explosions and wire fu.....all set to a story that just left me baffled. And, it left me wondering what non-Korean speaking person would sit through the movie.Overall, there is some nice CGI, some lovely acting by Korean folks and nothing of any value for non-Korean speakers! Next time you want to market a film abroad, do a better job of it! And, in light of this, I can understand why the film is #68 on the IMDB Bottom 100...at least the international/English speaking version. Pretty much unwatchable....but at least it looked nice.",sloppy translation korean english,apparently d war was originally korean film but instead simply translating it into english either with captions or dubbing they separately filmed some american actors inserted them into movie then during portions where koreans talk occasionally narrator summarizes what they said no captions no dubbing but lot confusion this is case where film bombed much it simply was because film wasnt translated well english speaking audiences it fel much like watching film foreign land understanding nothing until rare occasions someone sitting behind you explains bit what is going i think filmmakers would have been kept film korean period story because way its told is pretty confusing im not going bother recounting script suffice say that there are lot cgi monsters explosions wire fu all set story that just left me baffled it left me wondering what non korean speaking person would sit through movie overall there is some nice cgi some lovely acting by korean folks nothing any value non korean speakers next time you want market film abroad do better job it light this i can understand why film is imdb bottom 100 at least international english speaking version pretty much unwatchable but at least it looked nice,0.3738839285714286,0.07447916666666665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.5}"
5,Comparisons to Boll and Sci-Fi Channel don't apply,"This movie was not good. Let's start off with that. But it wasn't a one or two star movie like people are giving it.Pretty much, the plot is decent. It's something different. It's totally corny and implausible, but it's DRAGON WARS, it's not trying to win any Oscars. to people who say the visual effects are the worst they have seen, PUH-lease. The effects are about on par with Dragonheart and the Godzilla remake. Of course, this means the effects are ten years old, and films like T2 and Jurassic Park still look like they were made last year, but that's beside the point. The effects aren't THAT bad.The acting is average. Nothing special. Better than Keanu Reeves or Clive Owen. See, what I'm trying to do here is show you that a movie like ""Gryphon"" or ""Raptor Island"" or ""Alone in the Dark"" are much much worse than this. Stop giving unfair comparisons. The last 20 minutes of the movie actually had some good action, and the final battle was great. Lighten up. Just have sit back and MST3K it if you want. But it's cheesy monster mashing fun.",comparisons boll sci fi channel dont apply,this movie was not good lets start off with that but it wasnt one or two star movie like people are giving it pretty much plot is decent its something different its totally corny implausible but its dragon wars its not trying win any oscars people who say visual effects are worst they have seen puh lease effects are about par with dragonheart godzilla remake course this means effects are ten years old films like t2 jurassic park still look like they were made last year but thats beside point effects arent that bad acting is average nothing special better than keanu reeves or clive owen see what im trying do here is show you that movie like gryphon or raptor island or alone dark are much much worse than this stop giving unfair comparisons last 20 minutes movie actually had some good action final battle was great lighten up just have sit back mst3k it if you want but its cheesy monster mashing fun,0.46338259441707713,0.018062397372742213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.19}"

6,It's happening here too?,"First of all, let me remind you people that I'm not affiliated to this film, neither directly nor indirectly, therefore there is no reason for me to dress up my comment in any direction, which in turn enable me to put an impartial comment about this film.Second, I also watched the film, being a Korean (living in Korea of course) and the film being shown in nearby theater, so I might be able to seek out the Cons and Pros of the film more accurately than some people who just speculate on other's comment only.That being said, let me tell you what's really happening in Korea concerning D-War OK, the facts first.As of Aug 6th (Korean local time), D-War viewer counter surpassed 3 million. That's right. This movie is a huge hit in Korea, whether it is a masterpiece or crap. The increase rate of total viewer number is such that there is saying that D-War will surpass the total viewer record of 13 million, a record set by last year's The Host.For this particular film, there are ongoing struggle between two sizable forces. The Korean orthodox film-making faction, represented by 'Choong Moo Ro'  the Korean version of Hollywood - is the major force of film-making in Korea. This is where almost all Korean movies were born.And there is an unorthodox film making faction. In fact, it is so small in size and force to compare fairly with the other side. Therefore it is treated not as much as a faction, but just a time-to-time phenomenon that pops up once in a while.Director Shim belongs to the latter and his film D-War is the single most successful (as of yet, in Korean market) case.Shim was (and I believe he still is) one of the most famous (therefore successful) comedian in Korean of all time. That is a fact everyone (even the Choong Moo Ro faction) acknowledges.However, the fact that he is a successful comedian worked against his transition to a film director.I don't know about other countries, but in here, the comedian used to be treated as 'low class job' because what they do looked silly, so when he became a director, he was ruthlessly criticized by the orthodox faction.Those criticisms still exist today, as you can find those in Korean film related sites.So what happened? Almost, um... no, that's a wrong word. All of the critics rated D-War at the bottom end, sometimes even lower than some of the real crap film which did not survive in domestic market for more than a week. (Their rating was very simple. If a for-real crap film made by the orthodox faction has terrible plot, they would shrug and say, 'it's creative.') This in turn fueled the rage of people using the internet (called Netizen here), and they took their fight to the orthodox faction, creating a BIG MESS as a result.With such a huge struggle going on, general population overheard the news of it and many of them became more curious about the film of issue, the D-War I suspect this event ironically played a big role D-War getting this record breaking sale in domestic market.Now, about the film itself.As I've seen it, I don't think it is a knockout that some people say, but I don't think it's such a bad movie that some others say.The plot is there, however lacking it's smoothness in transition between the scenes. And the plot itself is not bad.The problem is how the film weaves the story. In that part, there is a major 'Whoopsie,' that in turn creates three major (serious, but not totally lethal, I think) problems.The fact that total running time is about 90mins may have affected it, but since Shim must have played a part in editing, it might not be a good excuse.First, it brings some confusion in understanding the storyline.Second, it affects the actors and actresses, making their acting look awkward and out of place sometimes.Third, it makes the first half of the movie quite boring, since that part is where the film explains the overall plots and develops them. Actually, there was some good humor evenly placed, the director Shim's trademark sort (He used to be a Comedian, if you have forgotten) to ease the boredom, but it's quite 'Korean thing,' so I doubt it might work in off-shore market.Okay, so is the D-War really crap? I wouldn't say so. Personally, I was bored to hell in the first half of the movie, but was mesmerized to the CG scene in the second half.The second half of the movie, where the action really starts is where the 'fun' begins. (That is, if you endured the first half without major outburst of anger and exited the theater by kicking the door open) Well, the battle scene is quite good, considering its CG was all domestic (I mean Korean) technology and it was really their first shot at it.Compared to Transformer? In evaluation of absolute term, Transformer is better. I mean, c'mon, what did you expect? The total cost for D-War is around 70 billion won, which is approximately $75 million. How much did the Transformer cost? I don't know. But I don't think it's anywhere near $75 mil.That fact in mind, CG in D-War is not half bad. It's even impressive in some way, as long as you don't measure it with major Hollywood block-buster film standard. I mean, you don't compare Lamborghini and Ford Mustang by same standard, do you? So, there you have it.D-War is not a 'record-setting' block-buster, but it's not a 'Straight to DVD shop' crap.Some of you might quite enjoy it, while some of you won't.",its happening here too,first all let me remind you people that im not affiliated this film neither directly nor indirectly therefore there is no reason me dress up my comment any direction which turn enable me put impartial comment about this film second i also watched film being korean living korea course film being shown nearby theater so i might be able seek out cons pros film more accurately than some people who just speculate others comment only that being said let me tell you whats really happening korea concerning d war ok facts first as aug 6th korean local time d war viewer counter surpassed 3 million thats right this movie is huge hit korea whether it is masterpiece or crap increase rate total viewer number is such that there is saying that d war will surpass total viewer record 13 million record set by last years host this particular film there are ongoing struggle between two sizable forces korean orthodox film making faction represented by choong moo ro korean version hollywood is major force film making korea this is where almost all korean movies were born there is unorthodox film making faction fact it is so small size force compare fairly with other side therefore it is treated not as much as faction but just time time phenomenon that pops up once while director shim belongs latter his film d war is single most successful as yet korean market case shim was i believe he still is one most famous therefore successful comedian korean all time that is fact everyone even choong moo ro faction acknowledges however fact that he is successful comedian worked against his transition film director i dont know about other countries but here comedian used be treated as low class job because what they do looked silly so when he became director he was ruthlessly criticized by orthodox faction those criticisms still exist today as you can find those korean film related sites so what happened almost um no thats wrong word all critics rated d war at bottom end sometimes even lower than some real crap film which did not survive domestic market more than week their rating was very simple if real crap film made by orthodox faction has terrible plot they would shrug say its creative this turn fueled rage people using internet called netizen here they took their fight orthodox faction creating big mess as result with such huge struggle going general population overheard news it many them became more curious about film issue d war i suspect this event ironically played big role d war getting this record breaking sale domestic market now about film itself as ive seen it i dont think it is knockout that some people say but i dont think its such bad movie that some others say plot is there however lacking its smoothness transition between scenes plot itself is not bad problem is how film weaves story that part there is major whoopsie that turn creates three major serious but not totally lethal i think problems fact that total running time is about 90mins may have affected it but since shim must have played part editing it might not be good excuse first it brings some confusion understanding storyline second it affects actors actresses making their acting look awkward out place sometimes third it makes first half movie quite boring since that part is where film explains overall plots develops them actually there was some good humor evenly placed director shims trademark sort he used be comedian if you have forgotten ease boredom but its quite korean thing so i doubt it might work off shore market okay so is d war really crap i wouldnt say so personally i was bored hell first half movie but was mesmerized cg scene second half second half movie where action really starts is where fun begins that is if you endured first half without major outburst anger exited theater by kicking door open well battle scene is quite good considering its cg was all domestic i mean korean technology it was really their first shot at it compared transformer evaluation absolute term transformer is better i mean cmon what did you expect total cost d war is around 70 billion won which is approximately 75 million how much did transformer cost i dont know but i dont think its anywhere near 75 mil that fact mind cg d war is not half bad its even impressive some way as long as you dont measure it with major hollywood block buster film standard i mean you dont compare lamborghini ford mustang by same standard do you so there you have it d war is not record setting block buster but its not straight dvd shop crap some you might quite enjoy it while some you wont,0.47795179547228733,0.02047228727556596,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. All we got was a mindless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this.

2,Dragon wars sucked,"This movie was horrible.They didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly. It was a definite sleeper. You'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but D-Wars surprises you with even a let down in that department. Also, the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick. And I seriously mean that.I was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad!!!

7,"Neither as Good, Nor as Bad as Critics Claim, But Enjoyable Overall","We saw this at Movies on the Parkway, Sevierville, TN.This movie was poorly advertised from the beginning. The ads hyped a dragon on dragon war wherein mankind was at risk. And it was, but not as implied, and thereby disappointing some movie goers who expected good dragons versus bad dragons, utterly destroying a big city. I won't detail the story, but let me correct some poor reporting: There IS a story - a very rich story, at that! But it was not the story indicated in the few ads that were run.This is a story- and effects-driven vehicle wherein the South Korean tale of the Imoogi is told via memories of our lead character. It could have been a well-balanced work, adding in the character-driven plot lines; however, the acting herein was so poor, as to drive this film down into the annals of the ""B"" action/horror flick.The effects are awesome! The treatment of the Eastern Dragon after transformation was nothing short of a pure work of art! This is not just another monster movie. The story line and overall finished product far outweigh any Godzilla movie of which TOHO ever dreamed.However.The film quality is poor. A better quality would have lent a great deal to this work, but even the best quality would not have overridden the stiff performances and fake smiles. Though it did not detract from the overall effectiveness of the work, it did lessen the enjoyment somewhat.Frankly, the Lord of the Rings/Star Wars-worthy CGI combined with poor acting quality and brilliant style, left this production feeling more uneven and unprepared for filming, as if the actors themselves did not have their hearts in this work.All in all? We were highly entertained by both the story and the visuals, but we cannot decide whether this should be rated as a fantastic ""B"" flick, or a decent ""A"" film.It rates a 9.9/10 on the ""B"" Scale, which is about a 7.4/10 on the ""A"" Scale, from...the Fiend :.",neither as good nor as bad as critics claim but enjoyable overall,we saw this at movies parkway sevierville tn this movie was poorly advertised beginning ads hyped dragon dragon war wherein mankind was at risk it was but not as implied thereby disappointing some movie goers who expected good dragons versus bad dragons utterly destroying big city i wont detail story but let me correct some poor reporting there is story very rich story at that but it was not story indicated few ads that were run this is story effects driven vehicle wherein south korean tale imoogi is told via memories our lead character it could have been well balanced work adding character driven plot lines however acting herein was so poor as drive this film down into annals b action horror flick effects are awesome treatment eastern dragon after transformation was nothing short pure work art this is not just another monster movie story line overall finished product far outweigh any godzilla movie which toho ever dreamed however film quality is poor better quality would have lent great deal this work but even best quality would not have overridden stiff performances fake smiles though it did not detract overall effectiveness work it did lessen enjoyment somewhat frankly lord rings star wars worthy cgi combined with poor acting quality brilliant style left this production feeling more uneven unprepared filming as if actors themselves did not have their hearts this work all all we were highly entertained by both story visuals but we cannot decide whether this should be rated as fantastic b flick or decent film it rates 9 9 10 b scale which is about 7 4 10 scale fiend,0.48634722222222215,0.07479861111111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10,"It's called ""D-War"" because its a D-Movie!","Yes, I just gave a D-Movie 10 stars. People, calm down, allow me to explain. This is yet another movie that's so bad it's good. Stop taking it so seriously! Did you really expect a movie called ""D-War: Dragon Wars"" to be good? All you have to do is look at the cast. They got B-Movie veteran Robert Forster in a small role, and with the exception of Craig Robinson (Hot Tub Time Machine), the rest of the cast were B-list stars.One thing I find absolutely amazing is that everyone says ""The special effects were great, but everything else was awful"", to which I say, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME!"". Because these were some of the worst special effects I've seen in a major production like this. No special effects shot impressed me, it all sucked. Okay, the ""dragon-ball"" and the final dragon were pretty nice looking, but that's it! Now the acting: Yes it's hokey, but that's part of the fun of any cheesy movie. Come on! The acting isn't important in a movie like this.The writing: It was bad, confusing, and stupid. But also comical. When the old lady tried to go through the fence, that was just hilarious.The direction: I have to say that this is an attractive film. Not because of the effects, but because of the colours. Overall this was a nice film to look at. The director, Hyung-rae Shim, known for his other cheesy monster movie, ""Reptilian"", may not be a Spielberg or Scorsese, but at least he has some colourful style.The highlight: The action sequence in the middle of the movie is a showstopper. Why? Because personally, I'm sick of that stupid Bourne-style action with the incoherent zooms, and the shaky camera work. Here, the action is shot in a third person perspective, allowing the audience to actually observe the action without getting nauseous. Thank god Michael Bay didn't direct this, otherwise I would've thrown up. This action scene is also impressive for being really long, however, if it ended about 3 minutes earlier, I would've been more satisfied, because it just went a little too far.The climax: It was dark, and kind of hard to see. But just watch ""AVP:R"", and this'll seem as bright as day. For anyone wondering which was the good snake, it was the lighter one. The fight scene wasn't the best, but still entertaining.Nit-Picks: A useless sub-plot involving the FBI, and the actor who played the bad guy was clearly mouthing English, but he was dubbed over with a stupid droning gibberish sound (which was supposed to make him more threatening?). If I re-watched it, I could probably find a hundred more, but I don't have that much time on my hands.The final word: Overall, a fun way to spend 90 minutes. We all have guilty pleasures, this is one of mine. This can be thoroughly entertaining if your in the right mood. This is a must see for monster movie fans. Actually, B-Movie fanatics in general. The last thing I'm going to say is that I don't understand is why people are praising ""Pirahna: 3-D"" (which I also enjoyed), despite the fact that it has a stupid plot, bad acting, and bad special effects. Meanwhile, this movie has all of those same elements, but people say that this sucks. Well, maybe it's the gore, blood and nudity, which makes everything better (*cough*). Oh yeah, ""D-War"" also throws in some martial arts, and an ancient army. In the words of M. Night Shyamalan, ""WHAT A TWIST!"". 10/10",its called d war because its d movie,yes i just gave d movie 10 stars people calm down allow me explain this is yet another movie thats so bad its good stop taking it so seriously did you really expect movie called d war dragon wars be good all you have do is look at cast they got b movie veteran robert forster small role with exception craig robinson hot tub time machine rest cast were b list stars one thing i find absolutely amazing is that everyone says special effects were great but everything else was awful which i say are you kidding me because these were some worst special effects ive seen major production like this no special effects shot impressed me it all sucked okay dragon ball final dragon were pretty nice looking but thats it now acting yes its hokey but thats part fun any cheesy movie come acting isnt important movie like this writing it was bad confusing stupid but also comical when old lady tried go through fence that was just hilarious direction i have say that this is attractive film not because effects but because colours overall this was nice film look at director hyung rae shim known his other cheesy monster movie reptilian may not be spielberg or scorsese but at least he has some colourful style highlight action sequence middle movie is showstopper why because personally im sick that stupid bourne style action with incoherent zooms shaky camera work here action is shot third person perspective allowing audience actually observe action without getting nauseous thank god michael bay didnt direct this otherwise i wouldve thrown up this action scene is also impressive being really long however if it ended about 3 minutes earlier i wouldve been more satisfied because it just went little too far climax it was dark kind hard see but just watch avp r thisll seem as bright as day anyone wondering which was good snake it was lighter one fight scene wasnt best but still entertaining nit picks useless sub plot involving fbi actor who played bad guy was clearly mouthing english but he was dubbed over with stupid droning gibberish sound which was supposed make him more threatening if i re watched it i could probably find hundred more but i dont have that much time my hands final word overall fun way spend 90 minutes we all have guilty pleasures this is one mine this can be thoroughly entertaining if your right mood this is must see monster movie fans actually b movie fanatics general last thing im going say is that i dont understand is why people are praising pirahna 3 d which i also enjoyed despite fact that it has stupid plot bad acting bad special effects meanwhile this movie has all those same elements but people say that this sucks well maybe its gore blood nudity which makes everything better cough oh yeah d war also throws some martial arts ancient army words m night shyamalan what twist 10 10,0.5344820384294069,0.06000417710944028,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.25}"

1,It's a bad sign when...,"...there's no one else watching the movie. My husband and I went to watch it last night. It's just a small theater, but there's usually a decent amount of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the ONLY people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why.The movie was by far one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. The acting, script & dialog, directing, editing, etc. was God-awful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings. It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying commanders of Sauron's army.The creatures were ridiculous. You can't just introduce legions of dino/dragon/lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies, not in an hour and a half.The scene transitions are horrible. I didn't fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was an overly simple plot, I found myself getting lost in the plot holes.The characters were caucasian Americans, but spoke almost with broken English because of the badly written dialog in the script.The final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie...failed. Ethan didn't cry when Sarah died...though he hadn't known her for very long during THIS life anyways. He didn't seem too upset to be left in ""Mordor"", not knowing where he was or how to get back. We couldn't for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there either, but if he wasn't upset we shouldn't be either.Oh, and why did the dress that Sarah's spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing...all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job. Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does this as well. Then why does Ethan get screwed? He's left alone, without the girl, without a map/compass/helicopter to help him get back. What's he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And IF he gets back home, does he just go back to his job? He should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had.Don't waste your time or money on this movie. We only stayed til the end because we'd paid for it, but as soon as the credits hit, we were out the door.",its bad sign when,theres no one else watching movie my husband i went watch it last night its just small theater but theres usually decent amount people there not this time my husband i were only people watching dragon wars last night now we know why movie was by far one worst ive ever seen yes cg was good but that was it acting script dialog directing editing etc was god awful since we were alone room we felt free talk during movie that is we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us mighty morphin power rangers godzilla mortal combat lord rings it was like we expected see rita lord zed portraying commanders saurons army creatures were ridiculous you cant just introduce legions dino dragon lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation lord rings has wide spectrum characters but it introduces develops them over 3 movies not hour half scene transitions are horrible i didnt fall asleep during movie but even though it was overly simple plot i found myself getting lost plot holes characters were caucasian americans but spoke almost with broken english because badly written dialog script final scene that could have redeemed some value movie failed ethan didnt cry when sarah died though he hadnt known her very long during this life anyways he didnt seem too upset be left mordor not knowing where he was or how get back we couldnt love god figure out where he was or how he got there either but if he wasnt upset we shouldnt be either oh why did dress that sarahs spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it queen elizabeth one more thing all 3 main hero characters were reincarnations brought back finish job sarah completes her task moves afterlife jack does this as well then why does ethan get screwed hes left alone without girl without map compass helicopter help him get back whats he supposed do send smoke signals if he gets back home does he just go back his job he should have been given same mercy getting killed out movie that other heroes had dont waste your time or money this movie we only stayed til end because wed paid it but as soon as credits hit we were out door,0.4349055177626606,-0.1133862433862434,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"

1,Pick a cliché,"I went in to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them.I don't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I do expect them to be internally consistent. This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla.A shape-shifting mystic warrior from Korea, curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess. A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent ""paranormal division"" - which has gone unremarked up to this point. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims ""I never meant for this to happen."" A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who ""died like star-crossed lovers."" Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owe a lot to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.The dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing ""Ran"" with a karaoke rendition of My Way - and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa.In short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer. I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video, but I'm not even sure that it's worth that much.",pick clich,i went see d war whim with very low expectations movie failed meet them i dont mind stories that stretch credulity remember reign fire but i do expect them be internally consistent this film leapt howler howler without pausing breath all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind likes lotr or even godzilla shape shifting mystic warrior korea curiously metamorphosed into caucasian antique dealer popping up like deus ex machina get hapless protagonists out their latest mess special agent fbi who seems be completely boned up ancient korean folklore because feds excellent paranormal division which has gone unremarked up this point lovers kissing deserted beaches where one exclaims i never meant this happen reincarnated pair long dead koreans who died like star crossed lovers mystic pendants faceless hordes robotic soldiers that owe lot peter jacksons orcs serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along distract it dialogue is appalling acting wooden effect whole was be honest tedious however me crowning moment was at end after finale when music closing credits was arirang this is rather like akira kurosawa closing ran with karaoke rendition my way let me be clear that i am no way comparing director shim kurosawa short self indulgent lackluster collection clich s narrative non sequituurs which may appeal sense melodramatic so prevalent koran popular culture but should not be worth price ticket any serious movie goer or even not so serious movie goer i would suggest that this bypass movie theaters altogether go straight video but im not even sure that its worth that much,0.5077474323062559,0.059488795518207294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.43}"
3,The monsters attacks are some of the best visuals in years. The rest of the film is one of the worst.,"First off you don't see any dragons until the end, serpents,monsters and other nasties but an actual Asian dragon only at the end.This is the story of a young man who realizes that a story that was told to him by an old guy in an antique shop is true - he is the reborn protector of a girl who has the power to make a giant serpent into a dragon- a power that the evil serpent wants to use.In the 1500's, the last time the girl was born, the protector and the girl fell in love and committed suicide when the monsters attacked. Now everyone has been reborn and the monsters-which no one believes in, at first, are on the march.The action sequences and visual effects are mostly sterling. These are mind blowing attack and monster sequences as the evil serpent tries to get the girl in 1503 with a huge army, the serpent now trying to do the same both on its own and with a huge monster army in the middle of Los Angeles, as well as final battle. As it stands now these are some of the most incredible mind blowing action scenes ever in any monster movie. I am in awe of them. they are quite simply everything you ever thought would be cool in a Godzilla movie and then some. I want to say things a great deal more, but I think that would be over selling it (which I won't do with the next bit).However............However.............Everything else in this film is awful. I mean this is one of the worst films of the year. Don't get me wrong they spent every buck on the action sequences and I'm grateful, but the rest of the film is just bad. Its badly written, badly filmed and often poorly acted, clearly it was a pay check job for most of the cast.the basic idea of the story is okay but outside of the action sequences this movie is dreadful. I can't tell you how bad it is. Its so bad that it made me wish that I had missed the set up and just came in on the monster attacks since the non-action stuff is so bad is ruins the rest of the movie.Forgive me but this is an just a really bad movie when the monsters are not on screen-so much so its very close to unwatchable.Yes I will buy it on DVD so I can see the action sequences again, but add this (minus its action scenes) to the list of films playing on eternal repeat in hell.",monsters attacks are some best visuals years rest film is one worst,first off you dont see any dragons until end serpents monsters other nasties but actual asian dragon only at end this is story young man who realizes that story that was told him by old guy antique shop is true he is reborn protector girl who has power make giant serpent into dragon power that evil serpent wants use 1500s last time girl was born protector girl fell love committed suicide when monsters attacked now everyone has been reborn monsters which no one believes at first are march action sequences visual effects are mostly sterling these are mind blowing attack monster sequences as evil serpent tries get girl 1503 with huge army serpent now trying do same both its own with huge monster army middle los angeles as well as final battle as it stands now these are some most incredible mind blowing action scenes ever any monster movie i am awe them they are quite simply everything you ever thought would be cool godzilla movie then some i want say things great deal more but i think that would be over selling it which i wont do with next bit however however everything else this film is awful i mean this is one worst films year dont get me wrong they spent every buck action sequences im grateful but rest film is just bad its badly written badly filmed often poorly acted clearly it was pay check job most cast basic idea story is okay but outside action sequences this movie is dreadful i cant tell you how bad it is its so bad that it made me wish that i had missed set up just came monster attacks since non action stuff is so bad is ruins rest movie forgive me but this is just really bad movie when monsters are not screen so much so its very close unwatchable yes i will buy it dvd so i can see action sequences again but add this minus its action scenes list films playing eternal repeat hell,0.4754440665154954,-0.04424603174603171,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.22}"
2,Black Snake Groan...Or... Do You Have the Balls?,"I knew it wasn't gunna work out between me and D-wars from the moment we met. First its title was lazy. D war. Like writing out Dragon was too much for them. Also... you really can't be that blatant with your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever the hell it wants. The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story's insane progression. Here's the film, dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks, flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows. Old shop keep reveals several terrible truths. That Bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god. tells the kid that he's a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in LA is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry. Shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness he's a 500 year old Asian. fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl. cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose. Why? Continue on dear reader if you have the Balls.so Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the benefit of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing. Its a Korean legend and she's reincarnated from a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese. Later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt, she calls the police cause it looks like she's having a heart attack. See, in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy. I have a new phobia now, and its that if i'm ever in trouble the first responders will just assume i'm crazy. I have another point of contention with my harsh mistress, Dwar. There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a café' with sassy black friend. In the scenes prior Miffed Near divinity Bauraki has killed an elephant, slithered through a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. See, people were afraid to come out after 9-11 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for. Business as usual, no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on. If i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win. After being given a satisfying dragon on Helicopter battle my cruel lover Dwar treats me to a pi$$ and vinegar filled scene to end it all with. Bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under LA i guess. They don't really say but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up, yep dragon palace. some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestle/make love whatever. And i'm not kidding good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think i'm blowing it out of proportion, i'm not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly... there! Few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god, sets Baurki on fire, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with Dragon-god, dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits... thank godNow our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times. There was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasn't helpful. He could go in your dreams when that wouldn't do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry. I like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises. The actors for the most part were great... if great somehow meant terrible. Jason Behr, whom i thought was awesome in Roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and that's pretentious, spacey and Patrick Dempsey""ish"".The one thing i love about this filthy prostitute Dwars is its lead actor, Bauraki. That Giant snake acted his heart out. I'd dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demi-god of evil then John Barrymore was at playing Richard the III or Hamlet. There was emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast. When he ate an elephant i felt like no one past, present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling. He was more then an actor, he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project. Yes damn it, my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake.

1,If only this movie had stopped after the opening credits.,"Someone asked, ""Is D-WAR really as bad as everyone says it is?"" Yes. Yes, it is.The fact that I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel was a red flag in itself, but I figured why not? Although just about everything on Sci-Fi is questionable, dragons are cool... Could it really be so bad? Yes. Yes it can.""To protect the universe or destroy the world"" is the ever-so-ominous warning at the start of the film, so we're made aware of the fact that we're in for a good one. And by good, I mean bad.There is a meandering yet somewhat confusing re-telling of a Korean tale which apparently sparked the genius behind this film. I have an IQ of 150, and I really wasn't sure exactly what all that meant. Basically, it's a very original plot: good versus evil. The ancient battle, however, goes way beyond mythology by using creatures that never lived and firepower that could not have existed at that time in history, not to mention evil soldiers that grunt like sick livestock. It may be sci-fi, but it was off to a bad start.At 19 minutes into the film (including commercials), I was sorely tempted to turn it off. With acting so bad that it makes high school musicals seem like gems and a storyline full of gaping holes (at 19 minutes!), one wonders why anyone would bother wasting his/her time with it.Summary of the pawn shop: ""Oh, hello little American boy. You are the incarnation of a warrior I raised, and you'll save the world someday. Is that okay with you?"" I did find it amusing that Sarah referred to Korean writings on yellow construction paper as ""the only things that can protect"" her. And yet she decided to leave the safety of her new décor to go out for a few beers with pals. WHY? Then walk home alone at night in Los Angeles. WHY? So I didn't turn it off, if only to find out how bad this movie would truly be. WHY?! I must admit, however, that the CGI is rather impressive. That being said, what a gigantic waste of good effects on such a very crappy movie! The old woman trying to walk through the fence. The homeless guy yelling ""bum!"" at a car that splashed mud on him. These are just two examples of completely useless entries in this movie that have nothing to do with anything and provide no purpose, not even humor at this point. The only useless but funny parts were the scenes with the zoo security guard.Do not forget a very important point presented here: Doctors will always take reporters to see anyone they want, especially if the patient is under quarantine.Another good point: If anyone tells you *not* to take the stairs and *do* take the elevator in the event of an emergency (especially an apparent earthquake), BEWARE! Question: how the hell would the DOD know that the snake is after Sarah Daniels? Honestly. It's just not remotely plausible.And, perhaps the biggest question of them all: At what point did the dark army find time to construct their city of evil? All the Mordor references are right on! As usual, all is well, the world is saved, and love carries on. Regardless, this film is now on par with my other #1 crappiest film, Carnosaur II. Thank you, D-War.",if only this movie had stopped after opening credits,someone asked is d war really as bad as everyone says it is yes yes it is fact that i saw this sci fi channel was red flag itself but i figured why not although just about everything sci fi is questionable dragons are cool could it really be so bad yes yes it can protect universe or destroy world is ever so ominous warning at start film so were made aware fact that were good one by good i mean bad there is meandering yet somewhat confusing re telling korean tale which apparently sparked genius behind this film i have iq 150 i really wasnt sure exactly what all that meant basically its very original plot good versus evil ancient battle however goes way beyond mythology by using creatures that never lived firepower that could not have existed at that time history not mention evil soldiers that grunt like sick livestock it may be sci fi but it was off bad start at 19 minutes into film including commercials i was sorely tempted turn it off with acting so bad that it makes high school musicals seem like gems storyline full gaping holes at 19 minutes one wonders why anyone would bother wasting his her time with it summary pawn shop oh hello little american boy you are incarnation warrior i raised youll save world someday is that okay with you i did find it amusing that sarah referred korean writings yellow construction paper as only things that can protect her yet she decided leave safety her new d cor go out few beers with pals why then walk home alone at night los angeles why so i didnt turn it off if only find out how bad this movie would truly be why i must admit however that cgi is rather impressive that being said what gigantic waste good effects such very crappy movie old woman trying walk through fence homeless guy yelling bum at car that splashed mud him these are just two examples completely useless entries this movie that have nothing do with anything provide no purpose not even humor at this point only useless but funny parts were scenes with zoo security guard do not forget very important point presented here doctors will always take reporters see anyone they want especially if patient is under quarantine another good point if anyone tells you not take stairs do take elevator event emergency especially apparent earthquake beware question how hell would dod know that snake is after sarah daniels honestly its just not remotely plausible perhaps biggest question them all at what point did dark army find time construct their city evil all mordor references are right as usual all is well world is saved love carries regardless this film is now par with my other crappiest film carnosaur ii thank you d war,0.575229858104858,-0.018328463203463184,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1,You rarely find movies quite like this.,"It's very rare that you find a movie this bad in theaters. Dragon Wars is worse than most made for TV or video productions. The good thing about it is I was laughing throughout the entire movie. From the ridiculous plot to the goofy dialog, this just seemed like it couldn't get any worse. The only actors in the film I recognized were Robert Forester, in what has to be the low point of his career, and comedian Craig Anton who used to be on MadTV. Neither of these actors are reasons to see this stupid, stupid movie.The plot, if you can call it that, deals with some old legend about dragons, and dragons and Korean warriors coming to LA, and the only hope of stopping them are two people who were reincarnated versions of these two Korean lovers. If you think my synopsis on what was happening is fuzzy, try seeing the movie, yours will be too. The plot was virtually nonexistent. Half of the movie was either a dream, or a flashback which didn't help us understand anything. Because of it's complicated story, the movie has Robert Forester explaining what's happening for about 15 straight minutes, and it explained nothing.I really hate bad clichéd movies, and amazingly this fits under that category too. The movie includes some light jokes, that were obviously meant to be funny, where instead they came off less funny than the rest of the movie. They had the 2 leads fall in love after only knowing each other for a literal 30 minutes. It had corny dialog that made me cringe. The special effects were very mediocre, just above what you'd expect on TV.If you want a good laugh, check this out. Otherwise steer clear of it.My rating: BOMB/****. 78 mins.

8,It's Fun to Watch...What's the Problem?,"I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we are all used to this from many other movies. It wasn't at all hard to follow. The acting by the leads was weak, but other people were quite good. There was humor throughout, too.

1,Terrible,"I'm a big dragon fan and when I saw the previews for this movie I was a little excited to see it. Wow, was I disappointed. For starters, there was no character development to speak of. The characters were just introduced, badly, and boom, we have a problem. Somehow the main character, Ethan, knew that he needed to meet this certain Sarah. No explanation of how he knows he needs to meet her, he just does. The old man in the movie, who apparently is a shape-shifter, and can fly, and can use magic, and is hundreds of years old, seems as though he could have handled everything by himself. So why search out all these other people? And Sarah, wow. I have bad dreams, so something bad is going to happen. That's it. That's her. Now run. Thank you, your scenes are over.The bad dragon somehow amasses an army from no where in particular. Even though they are ancient creatures they have rockets on their backs and blow up anything in their path. And I mean anything. Cars that are on streets that aren't in the way, buildings that happen to look like they need some reconstruction, just whatever. And then there's some guy with a sword that can disappear....awesome. He can also make fire shoot out from the ground by swinging his arm, and it looks exactly like someone put pyrotechnics in just the right spot for him, it was ridiculous.So this leads us to the end of the movie. Sarah and Ethan get caught by some flying creature, and when they wake up they're at a huge castle. Uh, okay, list that under one of the most random things I have EVER seen. Ethan is tied up on a pole, the bad guys didn't see a reason to kill him I guess, and Sarah is tied up on a sacrificial table. It all looks so bad for our ""heroes"" but then Ethan yells, ""No!"" and some stupid amulet he's had for half his life becomes shiny and kills everyone except him, Sarah, and the ""badass"" with the disappearing sword. Well well, why the hell didn't he just yell ""No!"" in the very beginning? Then he's about to get killed by disappearing sword guy but Mr. Badass deems it necessary to hit the amulet that just killed EVERYONE instead of somewhere else and *poof* he dies too. Who saw that coming? Finally you see the good dragon, and there's a lame fight and, well, I'm sure you can guess what happens. Overall, just a terrible movie with bad writing, acting, script, and everything in between. Save yourself the pain and rent something else, anything else.",terrible,im big dragon fan when i saw previews this movie i was little excited see it wow was i disappointed starters there was no character development speak characters were just introduced badly boom we have problem somehow main character ethan knew that he needed meet this certain sarah no explanation how he knows he needs meet her he just does old man movie who apparently is shape shifter can fly can use magic is hundreds years old seems as though he could have handled everything by himself so why search out all these other people sarah wow i have bad dreams so something bad is going happen thats it thats her now run thank you your scenes are over bad dragon somehow amasses army no where particular even though they are ancient creatures they have rockets their backs blow up anything their path i mean anything cars that are streets that arent way buildings that happen look like they need some reconstruction just whatever then theres some guy with sword that can disappear awesome he can also make fire shoot out ground by swinging his arm it looks exactly like someone put pyrotechnics just right spot him it was ridiculous so this leads us end movie sarah ethan get caught by some flying creature when they wake up theyre at huge castle uh okay list that under one most random things i have ever seen ethan is tied up pole bad guys didnt see reason kill him i guess sarah is tied up sacrificial table it all looks so bad our heroes but then ethan yells no some stupid amulet hes had half his life becomes shiny kills everyone except him sarah badass with disappearing sword well well why hell didnt he just yell no very beginning then hes about get killed by disappearing sword guy but mr badass deems it necessary hit amulet that just killed everyone instead somewhere else poof he dies too who saw that coming finally you see good dragon theres lame fight well im sure you can guess what happens overall just terrible movie with bad writing acting script everything between save yourself pain rent something else anything else,0.5913007054673722,-0.0948148148148148,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.31}"
3,Disappointing and Lame,"In accordance with a Korean legend, every five hundred years, a woman protected by a man transforms in a serpent to fight against a dragon in a battle between good and evil. In Los Angeles of the present days, after a mysterious accident, the reporter Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) recalls his meeting fifteen years ago with Jack (Robert Forster), who owned an antique shop and told him that he was the one supposed to protect Sarah Daniels (Amanda Brooks). Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon.""D-War"" is a disappointing movie, with a lame story of the director and writer Hyung-rae Shim associated to a terrible acting of the unexpressive lead couple. The screenplay is ridiculous and boring, supported by reasonable special effects only and together with the art of the cover of the DVD, they are the best offered by this feature. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""D-War  Guerra dos Dragões"" (""D-War  War of Dragons"")",disappointing lame,accordance with korean legend every five hundred years woman protected by man transforms serpent fight against dragon battle between good evil los angeles present days after mysterious accident reporter ethan kendrick jason behr recalls his meeting fifteen years ago with jack robert forster who owned antique shop told him that he was one supposed protect sarah daniels amanda brooks ethan seeks out sarah together they fight survive destroy devilish dragon d war is disappointing movie with lame story director writer hyung rae shim associated terrible acting unexpressive lead couple screenplay is ridiculous boring supported by reasonable special effects only together with art cover dvd they are best offered by this feature my vote is three title brazil d war guerra dos drag es d war war dragons,0.6134589947089947,-0.19867724867724867,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.27}"
6,See The Host Instead,"I was hoping for another The Host, last year's breakthrough giant monster movie for adults from South Korea. What I got was Transformers with giant lizards instead of giant robots: a lot of CGI trying to compensate for bad writing, directing, and acting. It's only 90 minutes, which make it better than the overlong Transformers. It's best in the middle, when the U.S. army fights the monsters in the streets of LA; you can focus on the spectacle, and ignore the drivel that surrounds it. But the beginning has too much exposition (some claptrap about good and evil dragons, reincarnated lovers, and destiny), and by the end I was having trouble telling the good and evil lizards apart. Dragon Wars steals shamelessly from iconic movies like Godzilla, King Kong, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and The Terminator, but doesn't come close to achieving iconic status itself. This is the sort of movie that's best to watch at three o'clock in the morning when you're stoned. Do yourself a favor: save your money and rent The Host on DVD instead.",see host instead,i was hoping another host last years breakthrough giant monster movie adults south korea what i got was transformers with giant lizards instead giant robots lot cgi trying compensate bad writing directing acting its only 90 minutes which make it better than overlong transformers its best middle when u s army fights monsters streets la you can focus spectacle ignore drivel that surrounds it but beginning has too much exposition some claptrap about good evil dragons reincarnated lovers destiny by end i was having trouble telling good evil lizards apart dragon wars steals shamelessly iconic movies like godzilla king kong lord rings star wars terminator but doesnt come close achieving iconic status itself this is sort movie thats best watch at three oclock morning when youre stoned do yourself favor save your money rent host dvd instead,0.5491228070175439,0.11578947368421054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.22}"
2,It's too bad Mystery Science Theater: 3000 is off the air,"dee.reid is far too generous in his review of this movie. Allow me to offer a more blunt assessment: it was terrible! In recent years, I've never seen a movie that was so bad that wasn't trying to be. I've seen other movies that were as bad or worse, but usually as fodder for the cast of MST: 3k, a crew consisting of one captive man and two captive robots forced to endure the most hideous B-movies in Sci-fi/fantasy history. The trio survive only by slinging wisecracks and insults in a no-holds-barred attack on the movies in question.I felt myself irresistibly compelled to do the same while watching Dragon Wars. The actors, including the leading men and woman, seemed to reel from scene to scene, unsure even of what to feel or why they made the decisions they did. I confess, I was similarly confused. For example, one scene involves sending the lead characters, Ethan and Sarah, to the top of an L.A. skyscraper so they can board a helicopter to escape the evil dragon. Once they are in the helicopter, the dragon reaches the top of the building and destroys the helicopter. The pair make it out alive and are then forced to return to the street below. This could conceivably happen when running from a dragon, but the entire sequence is absurd from a movie-making standpoint. For all of the money and effort spent producing the sequence, the characters achieved nothing more than ending up right where they started before they entered the building.This sort of wasteful use of resources betrays the director's lack of experience. The dialogue, all of it, betrays his lack of writing experience. As much money as he must have spent on the movie, he should have worked smarter, not harder. Hiring a script doctor would have been a good start; a dialogue coach and an experienced co-director could have nicely rounded out a badly needed consulting team. And while I may not appreciate Korean culture, history, or mythology the way I should, this man did not make a Korean movie; he made an American movie. And as an American movie-goer, I feel particularly qualified to make this statement: ""That is the worst six bucks I've ever spent on a movie.""",its too bad mystery science theater 3000 is off air,dee reid is far too generous his review this movie allow me offer more blunt assessment it was terrible recent years ive never seen movie that was so bad that wasnt trying be ive seen other movies that were as bad or worse but usually as fodder cast mst 3k crew consisting one captive man two captive robots forced endure most hideous b movies sci fi fantasy history trio survive only by slinging wisecracks insults no holds barred attack movies question i felt myself irresistibly compelled do same while watching dragon wars actors including leading men woman seemed reel scene scene unsure even what feel or why they made decisions they did i confess i was similarly confused example one scene involves sending lead characters ethan sarah top l skyscraper so they can board helicopter escape evil dragon once they are helicopter dragon reaches top building destroys helicopter pair make it out alive are then forced return street below this could conceivably happen when running dragon but entire sequence is absurd movie making standpoint all money effort spent producing sequence characters achieved nothing more than ending up right where they started before they entered building this sort wasteful use resources betrays directors lack experience dialogue all it betrays his lack writing experience as much money as he must have spent movie he should have worked smarter not harder hiring script doctor would have been good start dialogue coach experienced co director could have nicely rounded out badly needed consulting team while i may not appreciate korean culture history or mythology way i should this man did not make korean movie he made american movie as american movie goer i feel particularly qualified make this statement that is worst six bucks ive ever spent movie,0.5065178571428571,-0.059315476190476155,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.52}"
