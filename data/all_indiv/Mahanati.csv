8,What makes the Telugu industry so interesting again ? Mahanati.,"From a person who has almost zero knowledge about the telugu film industry and its upbringing, Mahanati's aura and atmosphere will always be distant from me. But even from that itself i was able to witness an epic, drawn from a simple script and effort that makes this a great, if not , a must watch. Telugu film industry is probably considered by many as the place that houses simple, no nonsense mass masala films. But recent times has proven us wrong. From Rangasthalam , Baahubali and Arjun Reddy, it has proven itself to be able to sustain well executed, brilliant films as well.Mahanati will be a film that has the potential to be a classic. But not all biographies achieve the reach and attention that Mahanati so easily gets. It's not about the making, but how the story is told that makes it so damn exciting. From the loose opening to the grandeur ending, Mahanati is a gift to all those who embrace film in its raw form : to tell a story. Biographies often have the tendency to fictionalize certain events for dramatic purposes. And i don't know how much Mahanati is fictionalized. As much as i can differ between those which are fictionalized and those which are real, Mahanti has done that expertly. The fictionalization is on spot. It can be compared to, perhaps as a event that is to emphasize something more, rather than just a blunt scene.Mahanati's biggest plus might be its cast. Keerthy Suresh has grown from a simple, 'cute' actress to someone who can wield powerful performances, if demanded. Dulquer, Samantha all provided the performance that everyone expects. It is sure a economical casting. Dulquer has his roots in Malayalam. So does Keerthy. Samantha has established herself a prominent actress in the whole of south India and Vijay Deverakonda's next film is sure to make the counters ticking. The cinematography does need some mention. The frames were slick, moving and fast. It doesn't sacrifice space for sub-par elements. Though the comedic scenes were bit of a mess. Perhaps it appeals to the region based film critics.Mahanati is south India's answer to a legend. And it sure is one. .",what makes telugu industry so interesting again mahanati,person who has almost zero knowledge about telugu film industry its upbringing mahanatis aura atmosphere will always be distant me but even that itself i was able witness epic drawn simple script effort that makes this great if not must watch telugu film industry is probably considered by many as place that houses simple no nonsense mass masala films but recent times has proven us wrong rangasthalam baahubali arjun reddy it has proven itself be able sustain well executed brilliant films as well mahanati will be film that has potential be classic but not all biographies achieve reach attention that mahanati so easily gets its not about making but how story is told that makes it so damn exciting loose opening grandeur ending mahanati is gift all those who embrace film its raw form tell story biographies often have tendency fictionalize certain events dramatic purposes i dont know how much mahanati is fictionalized as much as i can differ between those which are fictionalized those which are real mahanti has done that expertly fictionalization is spot it can be compared perhaps as event that is emphasize something more rather than just blunt scene mahanatis biggest plus might be its cast keerthy suresh has grown simple cute actress someone who can wield powerful performances if demanded dulquer samantha all provided performance that everyone expects it is sure economical casting dulquer has his roots malayalam so does keerthy samantha has established herself prominent actress whole south india vijay deverakondas next film is sure make counters ticking cinematography does need some mention frames were slick moving fast it doesnt sacrifice space sub par elements though comedic scenes were bit mess perhaps it appeals region based film critics mahanati is south indias answer legend it sure is one,0.5673052173052173,0.20941243441243443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.06, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10,Thank you Nag Ashwin,"I wanted to give it 9 stars because movie did take artistic liberty with a few of the scenes, but I have nothing but praise for how they went about making this film. The parallel story to help us connect with the past is brilliant story telling. The research done by the costume department paired with the cinematography of Dani Sanchez-Lopez gives us the closest one can come to time traveling into the past while staying put. Venkateswara Rao Kotagiri's editing features seamless transitions when switching between time periods and helps with Savithri's aging process without abrupt change. The soundtracks and background music isn't you typical people breaking into song and dance but an extension to the emotions experienced by the characters. The director can pat his back for the casting. You have given a chance for Keerthi to show her acting skills. The support cast did a great job too. Samanth's dialog delivery at the end of the film gave me goosebumps. DQ's performance as a charmer translated across the screen. This is the sort of cinema I have been waiting for. If film making is one of the prominant art forms of contemporary telugu people, the commercial mass films do little to progress the art form. There is art for art's sake. There is art for a reason. This film is definitely the latter. I have often wondered how we went from the likes of Satyajit Ray to what we have today. This film is what I have missed for a long time. It makes me proud of my heritage. I cant wait to watch some of the older films featured in this film.It left me teary eyed and stronger somehow. Thank you Nag Ashwin for this work.

9,A movie to be remembered as historic film in TFI,"#MAHANATI has all the fine elements of a great cinema in making like it is biopic, also a parallel plot running in 1980 (Vijay Antony and madhura vani portrayed by vijay and samantha) to tell the story of savitri amma since childhood to her death bed. Film director Nag Ashwin had taken time to research every detailed aspect of the film be it talking to savitri's family members to know about her in detailed and to study the sets for recreating 1950s era.( lot of story-boarding work was done ).Initially it takes us some time to adjust to era's of 1950s and 1980s then as we slowly encounter and adjust to characters especially little cute child savitra amma with song aagipo balyamma there is no looking back. Costumes are designed picture perfect just to mesmerize as if we are looking exactly 1950s era.Thanks to cinematographer Dani Sanchez Lopez for making us visualize resplendent montage of golden era. There is huge star cast enacted with main leads Keerthy Suresh brilliant portrayal as cute innocent #Mahanati and Dulquer salmaan as loverboy with grey shades (Gemini ganeshan) well supported by others like Rajendra prasad(chowdary garu), Mohanbabu (as Late SV Rangarao garu), Prakash raj, Krishh (legendary KV Reddy garu), Naga chaitanya (Late ANR garu ),Naresh(in a key role). One important aspect of the film is it has recreated the grandeur of small bits and pieces of famous films like mayabazaar and Devadasu (1953) to name a few which are exquisitely shot in vintage black and white. A film which tells the tale of savitri as great human being(philanthropist), vintage car enthusiast besides great acting(300 films), singing and directing across multiple languages. Music and BGM by Mickey J meyer has soothing effect which matches the golden era. This film is a honest tribute to Legendary MAHANATI Savithri Garu. Take a bow to all the cast and crew for their wonderful performances.# This film will be remembered in history of TFI as the first BIOPIC with reverences of stalwarts like NTR garu, ANR garu, K V reddy garu, SV Rangarao garu, Savitri amma, LV prasad garu, etc. , NOTE: the above are just my views and understanding ...and don't treat this as review.

7,A Compelling biopic on Savitri's reel and real persona. can't praise it enough!!,"I've never in my wildest thought would have imagined Keerthy Suresh could be a testament, her presence match on par to the late Savitri that there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection leaving a mark which will remain with you long after the cinema. It was a facepalm moment for the Keerthy Suresh critic in me while witnessing Mahanati, the star who has slogged her way through so much mediocre films, has had her fair share of significance in tinsel town to woo bozos with her expressions. Well let me stop, this was my perception of the star and it's a kick in the teeth moment for me after getting to see Mahanati. Well I wanted to do my ritual of having a little booze before entering a mediocre film with my friends. To add to the tragedy with a day left for Karnataka elections, Government had notified pubs and bars to be closed till 12th of May. Well, a U-turn to return home was couple of Kms away, but stayed for the sake of Dulquer Salman. Tada, a decent reason to put aside the cringe Keerthy Suresh and watch the film. So entered the cinema hall full sober in Gandhinagar which is the hubspot of cinema fans across Bangalore.The movie ended, i walked out of cinema with such a great joy of seeing a good Telugu film after ages. The last movie which fits the bill will forever be 2013's 'Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu'. Keerthy Suresh had maintained a childlike innocence throughout the runtime, might look artificial and cringey but the score helps. As you may be aware that the story follows Savitri's exodus from her village to Madras who dreams of making it big while her well-wishers believe that she can create waves in repertoire cinema. She then meets the Quixotic Gemini Ganeshan and her life blooms as she travels in green pastures.Well good things come to an end so does this love story of rags to riches and riches to rags. I don't want dig more on the story as the movie plays out like a partly like a melodrama documentary. The screenplay filled with subtext provided a sort of ongoing commentary on the story that makes it much more interesting. Seeing obvious parallels with the lead actress' reel and real lives collide is odd, but like the parallels between Savitri and the character she is preparing to play, it only adds depth to the story and gives us more insight into what is happening and mixes effortlessly with the central story. Sure to captivate, Mahanati is a fine piece of film which will be lauded by cinema enthusiasts.",compelling biopic savitris reel real persona cant praise it enough,ive never my wildest thought would have imagined keerthy suresh could be testament her presence match par late savitri that there is not frame this film that doesnt feel her infection leaving mark which will remain with you long after cinema it was facepalm moment keerthy suresh critic me while witnessing mahanati star who has slogged her way through so much mediocre films has had her fair share significance tinsel town woo bozos with her expressions well let me stop this was my perception star its kick teeth moment me after getting see mahanati well i wanted do my ritual having little booze before entering mediocre film with my friends add tragedy with day left karnataka elections government had notified pubs bars be closed till 12th may well u turn return home was couple kms away but stayed sake dulquer salman tada decent reason put aside cringe keerthy suresh watch film so entered cinema hall full sober gandhinagar which is hubspot cinema fans across bangalore movie ended i walked out cinema with such great joy seeing good telugu film after ages last movie which fits bill will forever be 2013s seethamma vakitlo sirimalle chettu keerthy suresh had maintained childlike innocence throughout runtime might look artificial cringey but score helps as you may be aware that story follows savitris exodus her village madras who dreams making it big while her well wishers believe that she can create waves repertoire cinema she then meets quixotic gemini ganeshan her life blooms as she travels green pastures well good things come end so does this love story rags riches riches rags i dont want dig more story as movie plays out like partly like melodrama documentary screenplay filled with subtext provided sort ongoing commentary story that makes it much more interesting seeing obvious parallels with lead actress reel real lives collide is odd but like parallels between savitri character she is preparing play it only adds depth story gives us more insight into what is happening mixes effortlessly with central story sure captivate mahanati is fine piece film which will be lauded by cinema enthusiasts,0.4893055555555555,0.15947916666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9,Telegu Who Knew?,"I'm mostly familiar with Bollywood, although I have seen a few Tamil movies. This title was both a cinematic and a learning experience for me. It's a biopic of the most famous actress in Telegu cinema of the 50's and 60's. The story may seem awfully familiar, but I guess that's the fate of fame. Here's what I loved about this film: the integration of two stories, one modern, one historical; the amazing abilitiy, innocence, sweetness and essential goodness of Savitri (and the actress who portrayed her); the use of the black & white recreations of old film; the depiction of a wide-open film industry like Hollywood was said to be in the 1930's; and finally, the scaled-down musical numbers (I really don't like the nouveau Bollywood musical numbers, with the hip-hop, modern clothing and blondes). I did some reading and You-Tubing after I watched this, and the accuracy of this depiction seems spot-on. I don't give 10s as a rule, but this film is 9+.",telegu who knew,im mostly familiar with bollywood although i have seen few tamil movies this title was both cinematic learning experience me its biopic most famous actress telegu cinema 50s 60s story may seem awfully familiar but i guess thats fate fame heres what i loved about this film integration two stories one modern one historical amazing abilitiy innocence sweetness essential goodness savitri actress who portrayed her use black white recreations old film depiction wide open film industry like hollywood was said be 1930s finally scaled down musical numbers i really dont like nouveau bollywood musical numbers with hip hop modern clothing blondes i did some reading you tubing after i watched this accuracy this depiction seems spot i dont give 10s as rule but this film is 9,0.38282828282828285,0.1421717171717172,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.55}"
8,An unfinished beautiful painting,"A rags to riches story fascinates and provokes admiration, just as riches to rags story evokes sympathy. How are we to feel about the life of Savithri who in a short life span of 45 years combined both? She was never in destitution, to be sure, but the film wants the audience to experience extreme highs and lows along with her, and by and large delivers. The film fields some of the biggest names, even in minor roles, a sign of the admiration, nay, veneration with which she is held. It is an honor just to be part of this film.It begins at the end, with a poignant scene of one of greatest actresses, lively and proud, who reached highest levels of stardom brought down on a stretcher, to the lowly grungy hospital floor as an unknown, nearly lifeless and in coma. The exploration of her past comes in the form of two journalists Samantha's Madhuravani (surely a tribute to Savithri's outstanding role in kanyaasulkam which unfortunately does not feature in the film), and Vijaya Devarakonda's Anthony. Child Savithri shelters a stray dog when she herself is seeking a shelter. If true, what happened to that dog may forever be lost to the posterity. What we know, however, is unlike some dog lovers, her caring and sharing nature extended to 'stray' humans who often repaid this magnanimity with emotional and financial exploitation.We see that Savithri is raised in her uncle and aunt's home after her father passes away when she is still a months baby. The uncle (ably played by Rajendra Prasad) motivated by the lucrative glitter of film world puts every effort to make her an actress. He is protective more than affectionate, merely a guardian, not a father figure she craves for. Then in her first visit to Madras she comes into contact with Gemini Ganesan. Dulqer Salman whose supremely charming portrayal will win many a female hearts, gives a hint of what impact handsome Gemini Ganesan had on an impressionable young teenager who finds in a guy twice her age what she misses in her life - caring father figure and an attentive romantic lover. A tiny detail of his being an already married man, with kids, and with an appetite for extramarital affairs on the side is hidden from her until she is already emotionally too far into the relationship to step back.In the popular imagination, marrying an already married man was the source of her tribulations. Surprisingly, as per the film, it plays little role in her downfall. One gets the impression that things would pan out in the same way, if she were the only married wife of Gemini Ganesan. The first wife rarely comes into picture, and the husband convinces Savithri with his male sophistry that his relationships with multiple women weighed less than his love for her. Then the film dwells into some of her finest performances, and lucky breaks, for her and for Telugu cinema, like missamma. The film initially, tantalizingly predicts her acting with NTR and ANR, but all three were never shown together in any frame, in spite of excellent candidates like missamma and gundamma katha (the latter did not make it to the cut, though superior to doctor chakravarthy which did). Mohan Babu's SVR got more screen presence with her and the only major actor shown talking about her acting prowess. Why? Because there is also an elephant in the room - in this case missing - when depicting her film career: NTR. He is virtually absent. Reportedly this was due to the refusal of Jr NTR portraying the legend, out of some pig headed humility, and the director refusal to field any one else. Unfortunately, even while making such great films, crass clannish considerations seep into and blight Telugu cinema. The director simply should have fielded some one else. This was an egregious blunder. At least among Telugu audience, depicting Savithri's professional world without NTR is akin to showing her personal world without Gemini Ganesan. The cracks appear in the marriage when her career is taking off when husband's is nosediving. Skirmishes are legion. When she takes to acting the guy takes to drinking and philandering. He protests disingenuously that she knew all this before the marriage. That was 'when she was Savithri, but now she is Savithri Ganesan' is her caustic reply. What she valued above anything else was trust and when people close to her break it, she is broken, repeatedly. The emotional turmoil compels her to walk out on Gemini Ganesan, in the process, severing her from the only support system she would otherwise have had in handling her finances which fall prey to a series of misjudgments and chicanery by the people she trusted.All this was by and large known and it was the details that were lacking in the public domain. How well she was taken care of during her last months had been a controversy. Her own daughter, in earlier interviews, and her son, more recently, have refuted allegations that Savithri suffered due to neglect. There were millions of her admirers and reportedly some donors who came forward to bear the expenses. The film could have been an opportunity to set the record straight.This most crucial and tragic phase of her life remains unanswered, due to director playing it safe. Admittedly it is a tightrope act to make a bioepic that could potentially offend those who are still alive. One gets the feeling that his role as a husband has been sanitized.Where the director excels is in the script and the introduction of fictional characters in the form of journalists. In the interleaving of past and present, their love is blossoming at the same time Savithri's is wilting. While the biography limits the director's ability to take too many liberties with the story, no such restraint existed for the fictional part and he exploits this creative dimension to the hilt and provides contrasting comic, but empathetic juxtaposition to increasingly gloomy downturn of Savithri's life. Madhuravani's Samantha speaks in stutters because she got stammer. There is no reason for Vijay Devarakonda speaking as if he is about to acquire one. He appeared to be the same character downloaded from his earlier 'pelli choopulu'. He could have been cast bit differently. However, both of them carried their roles with aplomb. So did Mohan Babu as SVR. It is charming to see the roles of legendary figures like Marcus Bartley, Singeetham, KV Reddy, mercurial Chakrapani. We miss countless others like Jamuna, Relangi, Suryakantam, Gummadi, redoubtable Adurti Subbaarao; and no MGR, Sivaji Ganesan either. The film could have an extended version for non-theatrical release. There is little mention of living contemporaries like Jamuna (Gudipudi Srihari, giant of a film critic, places her ahead of Savihtri), Kakarala Satyanarayana, who, but for his age, could have walked into SVR's role.Even these excellent performances are majestically upstaged by mesmerizing Keerthi Suresh in the title role. Her portrayal in the iconic 'aha naa pellanta' song is so close to the original that people, even without the excuse of short sight could mistake one for the other. This is just one of the many scenes she radiates as the legend. This is also severe indictment of hidebound Telugu film's habit treating female leads as decorative pieces instead of harnessing their talent.The director's another significant achievement is to bring Savithri to a new generation of young people. Finally this film is a beautiful, albeit an unfinished painting on a great canvas. I highly recommend seeing this on big screen.",unfinished beautiful painting,rags riches story fascinates provokes admiration just as riches rags story evokes sympathy how are we feel about life

10,Must watch,"I am not one of the best describer but here it goes. The movie was beautiful and it teared up people. One main thing to keep in mind is that don't expect Keerthi Suresh to be exactly like Savithri. In my opinion Keerthi's acting was perfect, in few scenes it was as if it was Savithri herself. Dulqar Salman acting as Gemini Ganesan was good. They way he would call her ""Amadi"" with affection was so beautiful. Samantha and Vijay Devarakonda, they did their best, the comedy was plesant. I love how the late 80's is shot, it was as if we are watching 80's movie. There were many actors whom I didn't expect to be in the movie but did well, even Sandeep Vanga was there. Shalini Pandey has not so big but imporatant role which she did perfectly. Ending credits showed old pictures and new pictures imitating old pictures. The way it would change from present to past is fluid. They did their best to fit everything in three hours. The costumes were beautiful. Director, producers and everyone else did such a good job. They did their research, I read how they spent long time recreating the costumes and jewelry. If the team is reading this, you people did your best. I haven't seen old people, my grandparent's generation coming to theaters to watch movies but there were people of all age groups, especially older people.Please don't miss this movie.

10,Savithri - The Lioness!,"Excellent movie that lives upto the expectations of a biopic about the legendary actress!Let me start with what I remembered when I heard the name Savithri until I saw the movie. I remembered the queen of weepy movies that the kid in me didn't want to watch on a Sunday evening. I remembered my grandmother's heavy praises about her acting. I remembered her masculine acting in the movie Maya Bazaar, the movie I loved. I remembered mentions about her being a drunkard which made me wonder why would such a popular actress go mad like that. Little did I know that she was a fun-loving person with interest in race cars, a philanthropist and had so much complications with marriage and life but lived like a lioness until she fell prey for alcoholism.I went to the movie expecting a linear narrative of Savithri's life story but was pleasantly surprised to see that the director Nag Ashwin decided to take us through the journey of a lady journalist in 80s who was covering Savithri's death (Two Period movies in one). Here I am thinking high about this young pony-tailed newbie director just for taking up such an attempt instead of the usual masala and he strikes me even hard with his attention to detail, unexpected comedy and handling of emotional scenes with finesse. It only makes me wonder how many producers are out there (other than his father-in-law who produced this movie) who can bankroll for this crazy guy's future ambitions. Needless to say he has been added to my short list of directors to watch for.Keerthy Suresh! She really makes sure that nobody can brush aside her choice for Savithri as just by chance for being a close look-alike physically. While it's not a surprise that she shines in the early portions as a playful teenager which she has portrayed already in other movies, she also proves that she can deliver a plethora of emotions including fit of rage, helplessness etc. Her mimic-ing of 60s like facial expressions and jaw movements also help the role. I would have liked to see less of her teeth in some scenes though. But I have to say I expected more from Dulquer. I didn't see Gemini Ganesan's soft-spoken charm come across but he does score in later scenes while expressing frustration. Samantha does her part well but I am not sure what exactly others see as special in the climax scene. It was just usual.Coming to the shortcomings of the film, I felt Nag could have tried to replaced certain scenes with just a dialogue/narration to avoid the awkwardness. For ex, the laddu eating scene right after showing her marriage problems, comical engagement scene of Samantha while the audience is trying to digest the fact that Savithri became an alcoholic. It's like eating dessert between sambar rice and rasam rice! Hope he will learn with more films how important it is to maintain the emotional state of audience. Oh and btw, padding actor's face with stuff just to show that she put on weight doesn't help with expressing emotions. Even Kamal did this mistake in Dasavadharam so I don't blame Nag much. I have one burning question though. How does the story of Savithri (going from success to failure due to her ""love"" for a married guy who cheats her later) inspire Samantha to ""kick""-start her love life opposing even her parents, I don't know. What would have been a perfect end to her story is if she develops courage to fight against male chauvinism inspired by Savithri. Poor Nag might have been worried about alienating male audience too much. Overall, If you're crazy bugged about the formula movies that they're spinning nowadays and would like to spend some worthy time in nostalgia, go watch this movie.",savithri lioness,excellent movie that lives upto expectations biopic about legendary actress let me start with what i remembered when i heard name savithri until i saw movie i remembered queen weepy movies that kid me didnt want watch sunday evening i remembered my grandmothers heavy praises about her acting i remembered her masculine acting movie maya bazaar movie i loved i remembered mentions about her being drunkard which made me wonder why would such popular actress go mad like that little did i know that she was fun loving person with interest race cars philanthropist had so much complications with marriage life but lived like lioness until she fell prey alcoholism i went movie expecting linear narrative savithris life story but was pleasantly surprised see that director nag ashwin decided take us through journey lady journalist 80s who was covering savithris death two period movies one here i am thinking high about this young pony tailed newbie director just taking up such attempt instead usual masala he strikes me even hard with his attention detail unexpected comedy handling emotional scenes with finesse it only makes me wonder how many producers are out there other than his father law who produced this movie who can bankroll this crazy guys future ambitions needless say he has been added my short list directors watch keerthy suresh she really makes sure that nobody can brush aside her choice savithri as just by chance being close look alike physically while its not surprise that she shines early portions as playful teenager which she has portrayed already other movies she also proves that she can deliver plethora emotions including fit rage helplessness etc her mimic ing 60s like facial expressions jaw movements also help role i would have liked see less her teeth some scenes though but i have say i expected more dulquer i didnt see gemini ganesans soft spoken charm come across but he does score later scenes while expressing frustration samantha does her part well but i am not sure what exactly others see as special climax scene it was just usual coming shortcomings film i felt nag could have tried replaced certain scenes with just dialogue narration avoid awkwardness ex laddu eating scene right after showing her marriage problems comical engagement scene samantha while audience is trying digest fact that savithri became alcoholic its like eating dessert between sambar rice rasam rice hope he will learn with more films how important it is maintain emotional state audience oh btw padding actors face with stuff just show that she put weight doesnt help with expressing emotions even kamal did this mistake dasavadharam so i dont blame nag much i have one burning question though how does story savithri going success failure due her love married guy who cheats her later inspire samantha kick start her love life opposing even her parents i dont know what would have been perfect end her story is if she develops courage fight against male chauvinism inspired by savithri poor nag might have been worried about alienating male audience too much overall if youre crazy bugged about formula movies that theyre spinning nowadays would like spend some worthy time nostalgia go watch this movie,0.4899648526077098,0.11554251700680272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10,Mahanati Telugu Movie Review,"Mahaanati stands out as an epic biopic of Mahanti Savitri gaaru, directed by Nag Ashwin. Mahaanati is the first ever biopic of a Telugu actor/actress and it turned out be a masterpiece. Hats-off to Nag Ashwin for bringing out this epic to TFI, he redefined the word biopic with Mahaanati. Each and every scene in this movie is so precious and narrated in an enormous way. While watching this movie you will get a feel that you are also a part of the story and everything looks so real. The film's sets also appears so real and convinces us with 40's and 80's backdrop set ups. Keerthy Suresh is a perfect replica of Savitri gaaru and portrayed her role very well. This is a lifetime role and achievement for Keerthy Suresh and she will cherish this role for life long. It is a treat to watch Keerthy playing Mahanati's role. In a few instances and moments we get a feeling that Savitri gaaru is actually portraying her own role. One cannot imagine any other heroine portraying Savitri gaaru's role. Keerthy's dedication, sincerity, hard work and commitment towards her role is incredible. May be she won't get a such great tailor made role for her in future. The innocence, naughtiness, stardom, heartbreak, alcoholism and kindness of Savitri's has been showcased very well and Keerthy portrayed them with nerve. I want to see Keerthy in such roles again in future in her upcoming movies. We all owe her one with this film. She up-stepped as an actress with her scintillating performance throughout the film, especially in the second half. Her performance towards the climax is quite emotional. It looks like cake walk to her in acting emotional scenes. Keerthy Suresh is ultimately the sole reason for the film's grandeur and success, I could say that. Dulquer Salmaan is a well known versatile actor of this generation. He is a god gifted actor to Indian cinema. He is familiar to Telugu audience with Ok Bangaram movie. Dulquer is the perfect choice for playing Gemini Ganesan's role. He just lived in the character of Gemini Ganesan. It's a treat to watch him and Keerthy together on screen. On screen chemistry between Dulquer and Keerthy worked out very well. Dulquer portrayed his role to the best. Samantha Akkineni as Madhuravani is pretty impressive. Her dubbing with stammering worked out very well too. Her emotional performance in the climax speaks the volume of her acting skills. Undoubtedly this is her career best performance. Vijay Devarakonda as Vijay Anthony provides ample support to Samantha. All his scenes with Samantha came out very well. Their love story is another added attraction to this movie. Rajendra Prasad gets a meaty role after a long time. He is exceptional in his character. Relationship between Rajendra Prasad and Keerthy Suresh brings a lot of depth and emotional touch to the story. Shalini Pandey and Malavika Nair are too good in their limited roles. The veteran actors like Naresh, Bhanupriya, Tulasi and Tanikella Bharani were major attractions to the film. Coming to the cameos, Naga Chaitanya as Akkineni Nageswara Rao gaaru, Mohan Babu as SV Ranga Rao gaaru, Prakash Raj as Aluri Chakrapani gaaru, Director Krish as KV Prasad gaaru, Srinivas Avasarala as LV Prasad gaaru and Sandeep Reddy Vanga as Subba Rao gaaru were nothing short of spectacular. Their cameos stands out and adds attraction to this epic cinema. Jr.NTR could have played Sr.NTR gaaru, that would become a biggest asset to the film. Jr.NTR could have accepted the chance to play Sr.NTR, because no one could play his role. The only disappointment is we saw NTR gaaru in CGI for just a moment. Coming to the technical department, music by Mickey J Meyer is fresh and breezy and his background score elevates the film big time and brings lot of depth to the proceedings. All the songs were shot beautifully. Production values are top notch as the film and sets appears so real and rich. Cinematography by Dani Sanchez-Lopez is extraordinary as the visuals are eye catchy. Editing is sleek. Costume designers needs special mentions for the costumes of Keerthy Suresh and all other characters, they have done a splendid job. After delivering a masterpiece like Yevade Subramanyam, director Nag Aswin chosen a biopic and stayed true and loyal to the subject. He never deviated form the story and didn't add any unnecessary scenes or songs and forceful comedy. Everything about Savitri's life has been showcased in artistic manner. We can hope Nag would deliver more films like Mahanati and to become a great director in our era. On the whole, Mahanati is an artistic tribute to the legendary actress Mahanati Savitri gaaru. This film showcases everything that Savitri gaaru gone through her life in an effective way. Her childhood, struggles, emotions, naughtiness, innocence, kindness, heartbreak and alcoholism has been showcased very naturally. Mahanati is nothing short of an epic and this film speaks the volume of our TFI's talent in making biopics. We can expect more biopics of our legendary actors/actresses in future, Mahanati will remain as the root and inspiration for them. Mahanati is a heart-warming film to each and every section of audience. Don't miss it.

What a performance by him!Coming to the movie, director Nag Ashwin, wrote the screenplay in the greatest manner ever. He makes the simple story of savitri into a complex screenplay that builds emotion. He continues the story through Samantha where it continues in a nonlinear pattern for the next 20 minutes. This engages us and builds curiosity. The first half goes greatly with comedy entertainment, engaging screenplay, and building up of the story.Although the 1st half is absolutely amazing the second half is even better. How did Savitri's rise start and how did her downfall start. This simple story was narrated, executed, directed so well you will be mind blown. The second half will pull you in so much emotionally that you will feel as a part of the story. After you know what happened to Savitri your mind will completely emotionally block because of how much you were invested in the story.Throughout the movie Ashwin did not shy away from the negative side such as her drinking habit.

6,One-Line Review: Mahanati (6 Stars),"Nag Ashwin's Mahanati (The Great Actress) is that typical, fast-paced South Indian biopic that takes its viewers through almost the entire life of its subject - actor Savitri (played by the expressive and talented Keerti Suresh) who ruled the post-Republic India's Southern film industry - and which acts as a walk down memory lane for people who feel nostalgic about the bygone era of South Indian classic films and have a diehard fanaticism for her, all without boring the hell out of you.

10,Mahanati - The lady to be known and remembered,"It is not a trivial thing if I give 10/10 to a movie, and that too when I don't understand the language. Watched it in Telugu with English subtitles. I couldn't resist to express my feelings for this film. The movie is set in the olden times of 1930s-1970s and the background shown makes that clear. The story moves ahead very naturally, not allowing the viewers to take their eyes off. It very beautifully tells the story of a woman who may not be known today by the youth, but one that needs to be known by everyone. You'll be mesmerized with the beauty and performance of Keertri Suresh. She justifies the role of the legend and plays all the phases of her life with ease and conviction. She starts off as a young, simple village girl who does theaters and later aspires to join cinema. Then she's portrayed as a successful actress, lover, mother, and finally as a sufferer of alcoholism. The amount of joy and satisfaction which you get by seeing her in most part of the film, an equal level of pain and helplessness is felt in the latter part when she suffers and sees her life falling apart. It'd be hard for anyone to not empathize with her. Dulquer and others have also played their parts well to make this wonderful creation. The roles of Samantha and Vijay are just enough to complement the actual story of Savitri. The narrative style adopted here is well received by the audience. A good movie makes its audience happy, but a great one inspires them and goes deep inside their hearts, making them contemplate even after the curtains are down. This one belongs to the latter category. Movies like this should be an inspiration to Telugu/Tamil cinema and Indian cinema in general. Well done crew members.",mahanati lady be known remembered,it is not trivial thing if i give 10 10 movie that too when i dont understand language watched it telugu with english subtitles i couldnt resist express my feelings this film movie is set olden times 1930s 1970s background shown makes that clear story moves ahead very naturally not allowing viewers take their eyes off it very beautifully tells story woman who may not be known today by youth but one that needs be known by everyone youll be mesmerized with beauty performance keertri suresh she justifies role legend plays all phases her life with ease conviction she starts off as young simple village girl who does theaters later aspires join cinema then shes portrayed as successful actress lover mother finally as sufferer alcoholism amount joy satisfaction which you get by seeing her most part film equal level pain helplessness is felt latter part when she suffers sees her life falling apart itd be hard anyone not empathize with her dulquer others have also played their parts well make this wonderful creation roles samantha vijay are just enough complement actual story savitri narrative style adopted here is well received by audience good movie makes its audience happy but great one inspires them goes deep inside their hearts making them contemplate even after curtains are down this one belongs latter category movies like this should be inspiration telugu tamil cinema indian cinema general well done crew members,0.47764126984126987,0.21951111111111107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10,Best Biopic and a True Masterpiece!,"First of all, Mahanati is a movie that keeps you thinking and wondering about the real life of the legendary actress Savitri even after you're done watching the movie. It is very touching and moving. It is fabulously directed by Nag Ashwin. I don't think there was a single dull moment in the movie. Now comes the performances- Keerthy Suresh's best performance! She is absolutely amazing and suits very aptly to the role of Savitri. Dulqeer Salman was great too,so were the other actor's. Mahanati is the best biopic in Telugu Film Industry and we're gonna have to wait for quite a long time till another movie is made of this caliber. Truly a masterpiece and one of the best Telugu films I've watched!",best biopic true masterpiece,first all mahanati is movie that keeps you thinking wondering about real life legendary actress savitri even after youre done watching movie it is very touching moving it is fabulously directed by nag ashwin i dont think there was single dull moment movie now comes performances keerthy sureshs best performance she is absolutely amazing suits very aptly role savitri dulqeer salman was great too so were other actors mahanati is best biopic telugu film industry were gonna have wait quite long time till another movie is made this caliber truly masterpiece one best telugu films ive watched,0.5454481792717087,0.4995238095238096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.58, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.23}"
