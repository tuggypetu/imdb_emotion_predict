10.0,One of the best Hindi movies that I have seen.,"I saw Lage Raho Munnabhai last night and it's still in my head today. I always go to watch sequels with a bit of trepidation but Mr. Hirani soon eased my fears with a wonderfully thought out comedy that is funny and has a message which he puts across without being preachy. Most of the same cast back again with only Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi reprising their roles and playing the same characters again. This movie cannot be considered as a sequel as it is more of an episode in Munnabhai's life not unlike James Bond films or Charlie Chaplin's tramp.Sanjay Dutt is just perfect as Munnabhai... i cannot imagine anyone else playing this role. It was said that Munnabhai was first offered to Shahrukh Khan, while i do like the King Khan i feel he would have gone overboard with this role. Sanju baba plays with a lot of conviction and i believe his true character and honesty shine throughout the film. He handles the comedic and emotional scenes with ease.... so naturally. Good rapport with the Bapu character.Arshad Warsi a.k.a Sarkeshwar a.k.a Circuit was also brilliant ...excellent chemistry with sanju and had some nice sequences. I liked him since the time he appeared in Tere Mere Sapne... and is coming into his own as a Bollywood star in his own right.Vidya Balan was bright and chirpy... great teeth! Only disappointment was that Boman Irani did not have the same impact as he did with Dr. Astana but still a great performance. He makes the audience like and empathise with him even though he could be considered the villain of the piece.Direction was excellent, song sequences were handled beautifully with most of the songs being situational all well shot especially 'Samjho ho hi gaya' & 'Pal Pal Har pal'. This movie just proves that Bollywood movies can be just as good and entertaining as Hollywood while still giving us all the masala.We should all follow ""Gandhigiri"" but first let's support this great movie by praising it and WATCH IT IN THE CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!10/10.",one best hindi movies that i have seen,i saw lage raho munnabhai last night its still my head today i always go watch sequels with bit trepidation but mr hirani soon eased my fears with wonderfully thought out comedy that is funny has message which he puts across without being preachy most same cast back again with only sanjay dutt arshad warsi reprising their roles playing same characters again this movie cannot be considered as sequel as it is more episode munnabhais life not unlike james bond films or charlie chaplins tramp sanjay dutt is just perfect as munnabhai i cannot imagine anyone else playing this role it was said that munnabhai was first offered shahrukh khan while i do like king khan i feel he would have gone overboard with this role sanju baba plays with lot conviction i believe his true character honesty shine throughout film he handles comedic emotional scenes with ease so naturally good rapport with bapu character arshad warsi k sarkeshwar k circuit was also brilliant excellent chemistry with sanju had some nice sequences i liked him since time he appeared tere mere sapne is coming into his own as bollywood star his own right vidya balan was bright chirpy great teeth only disappointment was that boman irani did not have same impact as he did with dr astana but still great performance he makes audience like empathise with him even though he could be considered villain piece direction was excellent song sequences were handled beautifully with most songs being situational all well shot especially samjho ho hi gaya pal pal har pal this movie just proves that bollywood movies can be just as good entertaining as hollywood while still giving us all masala we should all follow gandhigiri but first lets support this great movie by praising it watch it cinema 10 10,0.6211011904761905,0.3946428571428572,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Munna Meets Mahatma Gandhi!!,"The second innings of Munna Bhai and Ciruit in 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai' is one cracker of an innings! It's better than the first one, extracts more laughs and punches and the characters have a more humane temperament that explores the other side of 'bhaigiri'. The plot is truly the winning card of the movie, not to discount the effective casting, dialogues that are a mix of funny and introspective, a rib-tickling screenplay, enjoyable situational songs and a first rate direction. Sanjay Dutt as Munna Bhai and Arshad Warsi as Circuit wear their characters as their second skins, more comfortably, more snuggly and are more lovable than their avatars in the earlier Munna Bhai MBBS. Ditto for Boman Irani who dons the role of Lucky Singh, a sardarji builder; a meanie with a heart. Vidya Balan also puts her best foot forward as a radio jockey who makes Dutt's heart goes hmmm... Dia Mirza and Jimmy Shergill justify their cameo appearances. A surprise element during the climax is a thoughtful addition and cheers the audience, specially the female audience threefold. Though the film is not a sequel to Munna Bhai MBBS, Lage Raho Munna Bhai retains the characters of Munna and Circuit in the lead roles and their nontoxic, almost childlike idiosyncrasies. This idea also gives an unlimited scope for possibilities the hit pair of Munna and Circuit can indulge into in future. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is a story about Murli Prasad Sharma aka Munna who meets Mahatma Gandhi and undergoes a heart transformation. For Munna, breaking bones and abducting people at the snap of his fingers was easier than the courage it required to walk on the path of non-violence and truth. Hesitatingly and unwittingly he takes the road less traveled, which is thorny and full of obstacles in return for self revelation and a guilt-free conscience that fears nothing and no-one. The 'Gandhivad' is turned into 'Gandhigiri' by self proclaimed Professor Murli Prasad Sharma for its practical implementation in the present day, without sounding preachy or heavy-duty. There is a similar 'offering the other cheek' when someone slaps you, confessions of truth and also the 'satyagrah' for a bunch of old people who lose their house called 'Second Innings' to the manipulative and greedy Lucky Singh. Sad but true that our nation won freedom but lost its people, Murli tries to revive faith, courage, truth and justice in people from different walks of life. With his new found ideology or the chemical 'locha' in his brain, he triumphs over the cynics or the lost souls and also wins the love of his life. An interesting observation can be made between Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra's 'Rang De Basanti' and Rajkumar Hirani's 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai', the fact that though the theme of both films is more or less the same, the approach to resolving the conflict is in complete contrast with each other, like two ends of the same thread. Yet both films succeed in their own unique ways and deliberate the depths of human emotions and reflections in an identical manner. In the end, hats off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for producing a film that is a wholesome entertainer and succeeds in giving a heartfelt message in the times where films are made merely to fulfill the whims and fancies of egoistic filmmakers.-Nidhi Kathuria",munna meets mahatma gandhi,second innings munna bhai ciruit lage raho munna bhai is one cracker innings its better than first one extracts more laughs punches characters have more humane temperament that explores other side bhaigiri plot is truly winning card movie not discount effective casting dialogues that are mix funny introspective rib tickling screenplay enjoyable situational songs first rate direction sanjay dutt as munna bhai arshad warsi as circuit wear their characters as their second skins more comfortably more snuggly are more lovable than their avatars earlier munna bhai mbbs ditto boman irani who dons role lucky singh sardarji builder meanie with heart vidya balan also puts her best foot forward as radio jockey who makes dutts heart goes hmmm dia mirza jimmy shergill justify their cameo appearances surprise element during climax is thoughtful addition cheers audience specially female audience threefold though film is not sequel munna bhai mbbs lage raho munna bhai retains characters munna circuit lead roles their nontoxic almost childlike idiosyncrasies this idea also gives unlimited scope possibilities hit pair munna circuit can indulge into future lage raho munna bhai is story about murli prasad sharma aka munna who meets mahatma gandhi undergoes heart transformation munna breaking bones abducting people at snap his fingers was easier than courage it required walk path non violence truth hesitatingly unwittingly he takes road less traveled which is thorny full obstacles return self revelation guilt free conscience that fears nothing no one gandhivad is turned into gandhigiri by self proclaimed professor murli prasad sharma its practical implementation present day without sounding preachy or heavy duty there is similar offering other cheek when someone slaps you confessions truth also satyagrah bunch old people who lose their house called second innings manipulative greedy lucky singh sad but true that our nation won freedom but lost its people murli tries revive faith courage truth justice people different walks life with his new found ideology or chemical locha his brain he triumphs over cynics or lost souls also wins love his life interesting observation can be made between rakeysh om prakash mehras rang de basanti rajkumar hiranis lage raho munna bhai fact that though theme both films is more or less same approach resolving conflict is complete contrast with each other like two ends same thread yet both films succeed their own unique ways deliberate depths human emotions reflections identical manner end hats off vidhu vinod chopra producing film that is wholesome entertainer succeeds giving heartfelt message times where films are made merely fulfill whims fancies egoistic filmmakers nidhi kathuria,0.4515977961432508,0.17763085399449033,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Excellent!,"Incredible movie! The comedy was expected, and having developed his characters so well, Rajkumar Hirani couldn't possibly not make people laugh in this movie, but the most inspiring aspect was the message which was conveyed in such a beautiful, unpreachy way, something the audience would connect to. Definitely, no documentaries or books about Mahatma Gandhi could have had such an impact on the audience, and after watching this movie, I respect him much much more. The screenplay and direction was flawless. There was not a single moment when you wanted to take your eyes away from the screen, and the dialogues were as good as the first part, in fact better. Sanjay Dutt and Munnabhai are made for each other, and he couldn't have played the role better. But yeah, without Arshad Warsi, the movie wouldn't be half as good, and like the previous one, he's delivered. Vidya Balan really adds life to the movie, and if you really want to compare, I'd say she's done much better than Gracy Singh in the previous one. Incredibly beautiful, and she's got grace, I can only but praise her in this movie. Boman Irani, Diya Mirza and others have done there bit, and Hirani has very nicely used all these characters around the main ones. And last but not the least, Mahatma Gandhi, played by Dilip Prabhavalkar is something you will not forget. Throughout the movie, he wears this enlightened smile you fall in love with!The movie does have technical glitches, for instance, if vidya balan works at worldspace, how did her show air on FM radio and things like that, but you don't really care much about these things when you've just been through 2 and half hrs of sheer entertainment, where you laughed, cried, and every possible emotion you can go through with a movie. The movie has an incredible feel-good factor to it.So all said and done, the movie is a must watch, watch it asap! I doubt I'd find a single person around me who wouldn't like it.",excellent,incredible movie comedy was expected having developed his characters so well rajkumar hirani couldnt possibly not make people laugh this movie but most inspiring aspect was message which was conveyed such beautiful unpreachy way something audience would connect definitely no documentaries or books about mahatma gandhi could have had such impact audience after watching this movie i respect him much much more screenplay direction was flawless there was not single moment when you wanted take your eyes away screen dialogues were as good as first part fact better sanjay dutt munnabhai are made each other he couldnt have played role better but yeah without arshad warsi movie wouldnt be half as good like previous one hes delivered vidya balan really adds life movie if you really want compare id say shes done much better than gracy singh previous one incredibly beautiful shes got grace i can only but praise her this movie boman irani diya mirza others have done there bit hirani has very nicely used all these characters around main ones last but not least mahatma gandhi played by dilip prabhavalkar is something you will not forget throughout movie he wears this enlightened smile you fall love with movie does have technical glitches instance if vidya balan works at worldspace how did her show air fm radio things like that but you dont really care much about these things when youve just been through 2 half hrs sheer entertainment where you laughed cried every possible emotion you can go through with movie movie has incredible feel good factor it so all said done movie is must watch watch it asap i doubt id find single person around me who wouldnt like it,0.5011904761904761,0.30487301587301585,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Munnabhai - the magic recreated!!!!,"Probably, this is the best movie sequel ever produced in the Hindi cinema and surely would be one of the top ten comedy Hindi movies of all times. I can't remember if any comedy movie (hindi or other) ever been able to deliver such a strong message in such a subtle and non-preachy manner. Coming out of the cinema hall, you can't help from having that huge delightful smile on your face.. This movie isn't a sequel in its true sense; apart from the characters of Munnabhai and Circuit, there is nothing in common with its predecessor (unarguably, the movie would not have been possible without these two characters as in their original form). Few reasons which turn it to a must watch movie:1) awesome movie, with astounding screenplay, story, characterization and many other things. Its a 100% clean movie with no risqué dialogues, no item number, no vulgar dresses and no vulgar scenes, which is an achievement in today's times. 2) Performance of Munnabhai and Circuit duo - Sanjay dutt is undoubtedly the most lovable bollywood bhai, he is bit old now but still going very strong and Circuit has come up with his magic yet again, this guy's timing of dialogues is perfect... In all, the duo rocks!!!!!!! 3) Strong, strong and very strong message delivered... I won't delve much onto this or else risk disclosing the story and henceforth the fun... Everybody is going to respect Mahatma even more after watching this movie - bet you are going to love that enigmatic smile 4) Jhanavi (Vidya Balan)... such a graceful beauty, her face is like bright morning light; gosh, the lady literally smiles with her eyes, you are bound to fall in love with this gurl, just like Munnabhai.. apart from that she acts very well and gives a strong performance... There are many more things that make this movie memorable and a treat to watch.... surely, something to watch before you die :-)",munnabhai magic recreated,probably this is best movie sequel ever produced hindi cinema surely would be one top ten comedy hindi movies all times i cant remember if any comedy movie hindi or other ever been able deliver such strong message such subtle non preachy manner coming out cinema hall you cant help having that huge delightful smile your face this movie isnt sequel its true sense apart characters munnabhai circuit there is nothing common with its predecessor unarguably movie would not have been possible without these two characters as their original form few reasons which turn it must watch movie 1 awesome movie with astounding screenplay story characterization many other things its 100 clean movie with no risqu dialogues no item number no vulgar dresses no vulgar scenes which is achievement todays times 2 performance munnabhai circuit duo sanjay dutt is undoubtedly most lovable bollywood bhai he is bit old now but still going very strong circuit has come up with his magic yet again this guys timing dialogues is perfect all duo rocks 3 strong strong very strong message delivered i wont delve much onto this or else risk disclosing story henceforth fun everybody is going respect mahatma even more after watching this movie bet you are going love that enigmatic smile 4 jhanavi vidya balan such graceful beauty her face is like bright morning light gosh lady literally smiles with her eyes you are bound fall love with this gurl just like munnabhai apart that she acts very well gives strong performance there are many more things that make this movie memorable treat watch surely something watch before you die,0.6094764957264959,0.35516025641025634,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,One of the best movies in recent times!,"This is one the excellent movie that refreshed me to the core. A classic Vinod Chopra production, this movie does not only fulfill high expectations of the audience, being a sequel of Munnabhai MBBS, but exceeds it.A decent and hilarious comedy throughout, you can watch this movie with family and realize that superb comedy can be created even without vulgarity.On acting front, it is difficult to rank the actors as everyone has made his role alive. Sanjay Datt (Munnabhai), Circuit (Arshad Varsi) & Bomman Irani (Lucky Singh) have given their best performances.Cinematography is excellent and songs are appropriate to the situations.SO what is the best thing about this movie?

8.0,Why not more people make moves like thisthis is AWWWWEEESOMME MAAMOO,"""Lage Raho Munnabhai"" , the second film in the Munnabhai series and perhaps the most eagerly awaited movie of the year at least for the people who like meaningful cinema.This one was supposed to be a sequel but it has a story of its own and its refreshingly original and no connection with the first movie except the Munnabhai and circuit and their gang. I saw the movie and was completely spellbound by it.I was glued to the screen for the entire duration and enjoyed every bit of bit.To call this movie a comedy would be wrong this one is a mix bag you've got comedy, romance , emotions (and yes lots of them) and a beautiful script to tag along.The entire cast is simply lovable and all have acted their part to the book. Sanjay Dutt excels in the role of Munna hes is well complemented by ever smiling Arshad Warsi as circuit who surprisingly shows his softer side in some well acted emotional scenes. Vidya Balan looks fresh and acts her part well. Boman Irani as The Punjabi builder is first rate,people get to see the various shades of his character.The supporting cast of elderly persons is also good. Dia Mirza provides glamor to the film in a brief but sweet role. Jimmy Shergill is likable in the scenes where he gets footage.But the real star of the movie is ""RajKumar Hirani"" , yes the director of the movie. he has told the story in a very unique manner which appeals to the masses.I wont go into the details as it will spoil the fun but this man is a class apart, he has handled each and every scene with perfection be it comedy , emotional or drama brilliantly.Music is perhaps the only weak point of this film. Though the songs blend well with the story but no songs stands out to be a chart buster. The picturisation of the songs is beautiful and visually appealing.On the whole ""lage raho munnabhai"" is an excellent movie not to be missed. The movie will tickle your funny bone as well as bring tears to your eyes in some situations. Its unique way of story telling will find praises not only from the masses but from the critics as well. the movie has a surprise package in the character of ""mahatma Gandhi"" and the actor who's played the part suits the role wellI can't wait for another outing with Munna&Circuit but good things come at a price. The price here is Another Wait Till Then patience rakho ""MAAMOO"".",why not more people make moves like thisthis is awwwweeesomme maamoo,lage raho munnabhai second film munnabhai series perhaps most eagerly awaited movie year at least people who like meaningful cinema this one was supposed be sequel but it has story its own its refreshingly original no connection with first movie except munnabhai circuit their gang i saw movie was completely spellbound by it i was glued screen entire duration enjoyed every bit bit call this movie comedy would be wrong this one is mix bag youve got comedy romance emotions yes lots them beautiful script tag along entire cast is simply lovable all have acted their part book sanjay dutt excels role munna hes is well complemented by ever smiling arshad warsi as circuit who surprisingly shows his softer side some well acted emotional scenes vidya balan looks fresh acts her part well boman irani as punjabi builder is first rate people get see various shades his character supporting cast elderly persons is also good dia mirza provides glamor film brief but sweet role jimmy shergill is likable scenes where he gets footage but real star movie is rajkumar hirani yes director movie he has told story very unique manner which appeals masses i wont go into details as it will spoil fun but this man is class apart he has handled each every scene with perfection be it comedy emotional or drama brilliantly music is perhaps only weak point this film though songs blend well with story but no songs stands out be chart buster picturisation songs is beautiful visually appealing whole lage raho munnabhai is excellent movie not be missed movie will tickle your funny bone as well as bring tears your eyes some situations its unique way story telling will find praises not only masses but critics as well movie has surprise package character mahatma gandhi actor whos played part suits role welli cant wait another outing with munna circuit but good things come at price price here is another wait till then patience rakho maamoo,0.6206250000000001,0.28906249999999994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,very entertaining movie,"you have to understand folks that this is not an artistic film nor does it pretend to be an artistic film. it's really intended to be pure entertainment with a message. And that is why this movie accomplished these goals in mind. entertainment - entertainment - entertainment!i really admire the gandhi pacifist theme to this film. the acting was great throughout. great to see a movie with sanjay dutt as the top billed actor. sometimes you just want to see a common looking person and not an overtly handsome male lead like SRK or Salman or Saif Ali.Sanjay can really carry this movie with his acting. I loved his crying scene with gandhi - he was so believable. boman irani and vidya balan are just as great as he is. boman's body language in his character role was amazing. vidya balan is such a natural performer, she's better than meryl streep because her acting skills are more nuanced and less technical than meryl's. if you love movies then you'll love the spiritual quality of this movie with the ghost of gandhi popping in and out. the musical numbers are also fun but add more to the story by showing you how the characters truly feel about what is happening to them.KUDOS to Cinematography C. K. Muraleedharan and Director Rajkumar Hirani and Producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Screenplay by Abhijat Joshi is just brilliant.

10.0,Munna Bhai back!!!,"To start of with i didn't had much of expectation on this movie since I assumed that a second series to Munna Bhai might not be good as the original based on my previous experiences. But this movie 'ROCKS' with a different story line all together, still keeping the characters of MunnaBhai(Sanjay Dutt)in place. The crew is pretty much the same from the original except for the heroine Vidya Balan and she does her part in style with others.

10.0,One of the Greatest...,"I haven't seen something so vibrant and refreshing and don't get me wrong, I'm only 14 but, I know a lot about Hindi Movies and this is one to brag about. I was laughing so hard I would hiccup and even during parts that you would think are only to be tense, Munnabhai and Circuit do the unbelievable and turn it into something that will make you tear...The other thing is that, although it may not impact anyone because it is a hard message to go by, the whole idea of the teachings of Mohindra Karamchod Ghandi being incorporated was a twist unlike any other. I'm going again this weekend and watching it again, the great thing is... I have hardly any remembrance of the movie because I was laughing so hard.Of course there are also things that weren't incorporated, like why Ghandi died... Of course it was a serious matter that couldn't be very much enlightened by the duo. Some say that his student was crazy and did it out of spite and jealousy. Others say that Ghandi deserved it because he agreed to help the British in their workings in order to get them to leave but, this is only because it was the peaceful way out...Now here are some points about this movie: - It is a hilarious spectacle that could rob you of all of your oxygen as you thrust out all the air in your body in reaction to the laughter.It has a lesson that you may want to ignore or may want to use, in American society it's useless because there are much different problems now then there are in India...I can't say much more than that it's the Kingda Ka of all roller-coaster rides that will be sending you twisting and turning as you work through this storyline.Thanks for reading, have a nice time watching it...",one greatest,i havent seen something so vibrant refreshing dont get me wrong im only 14 but i know lot about hindi movies this is one brag about i was laughing so hard i would hiccup even during parts that you would think are only be tense munnabhai circuit do unbelievable turn it into something that will make you tear other thing is that although it may not impact anyone because it is hard message go by whole idea teachings mohindra karamchod ghandi being incorporated was twist unlike any other im going again this weekend watching it again great thing is i have hardly any remembrance movie because i was laughing so hard course there are also things that werent incorporated like why ghandi died course it was serious matter that couldnt be very much enlightened by duo some say that his student was crazy did it out spite jealousy others say that ghandi deserved it because he agreed help british their workings order get them leave but this is only because it was peaceful way out now here are some points about this movie it is hilarious spectacle that could rob you all your oxygen as you thrust out all air your body reaction laughter it has lesson that you may want ignore or may want use american society its useless because there are much different problems now then there are india i cant say much more than that its kingda ka all roller coaster rides that will be sending you twisting turning as you work through this storyline thanks reading have nice time watching it,0.6078160919540229,0.03597701149425288,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,A total different sequel,"I did not dislike Munnabhai MBBS, neither did I love it in my opinion it was OK, plenty of laughter and light moments, in fact a realization how much effect a jaadu ka jhappi can make to one's close people. The rare departure of a vasooli gangster to a kind hearted bhai is really adorable to watch, therefore I watched Lage Raho Munnabhai with no expectation at all, just keeping in mind the huge success and revolution it has made in India.I really respect the makers of LRMB for not trying to recreate any magic or moments of the MBBS prequel, neither did they bank on any aspect from the previous movie. In fact this was a fresh start for the characters and the whole storyline itself. With the success of this installation, I will not be surprised if Munnabhai turns out to be a famous franchise of Bollywood film industry, the first of its kind.The combination of Munnabhai and Circuit manage to churn out plenty of laughter, at the same time bring realization among the youngsters who seem to have forgotten their roots and history of India. This movie is not just applicable to Indian community, but also throughout the world where all of us have forgotten to appreciate small things in life and forget to do good to others. The whole execution of the storyline is admirable, as there is no bit of rona-dhona, overly emotional or drama involved, yet it manages to reach the heart of the viewers.The ending, is simply superb, one moment you might be feeling a drop of tear in your eyes, and the next moments its so funny, you just feel happy and fall in love with life.

9.0,This movie rocks and how !!!,"I just saw the first day first show of this sequel to Munnabhai MBBS and I must say that the team has come up with an excellent sequel !! The original title was supposedly Munnabhai meets Mahatma Gandhi but due to reverence or whatever reason, the new title has come up...the original title fits the movie like a glove... Munnabhai actually turns nonviolent and starts speaking only truth and also suggests several hapless humans of this new millennium to follow Mahatma's experiments with truth... The story with all its references to current changing scenario of the society is actually not interfering with the comedy that thrives in situations that our Munnabhai creates thanks to the affairs of the heart and the first half goes in a jiff without one realizing how time passed so fast !! actually, at interval time, I was feeling so fortunate to be watching such a great movie- first day first show !!!! the movie continued in the same vein in 2nd half too but the last twenty minutes robbed one star from the movie...it wasn't all that entertaining coming after such a rollicking 2 hrs that preceded it.. Nevertheless, highly recommended for people of all ages !! Sanjay Dutt lives the role and Arshad is not far behind either...Vidya looks good in modern dresses and is quite charming too...Boman, Jimmy, Dia all do justice to their roles as expected...music is good too...As a bonus, you get to see trailers of Don and Ekalaiva - both seem to be very interesting to say the least !!",this movie rocks how,i just saw first day first show this sequel munnabhai mbbs i must say that team has come up with excellent sequel original title was supposedly munnabhai meets mahatma gandhi but due reverence or whatever reason new title has come up original title fits movie like glove munnabhai actually turns nonviolent starts speaking only truth also suggests several hapless humans this new millennium follow mahatmas experiments with truth story with all its references current changing scenario society is actually not interfering with comedy that thrives situations that our munnabhai creates thanks affairs heart first half goes jiff without one realizing how time passed so fast actually at interval time i was feeling so fortunate be watching such great movie first day first show movie continued same vein 2nd half too but last twenty minutes robbed one star movie it wasnt all that entertaining coming after such rollicking 2 hrs that preceded it nevertheless highly recommended people all ages sanjay dutt lives role arshad is not far behind either vidya looks good modern dresses is quite charming too boman jimmy dia all do justice their roles as expected music is good too as bonus you get see trailers don ekalaiva both seem be very interesting say least,0.47355506282335535,0.17010716925351074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Brilliant Entertaining Movie..Better then the First....MUST SEE,"Munnabhai MBBS was a Fabulous movie that was very entertaining. Looking at the trailer and storyline i assumed the Second Munnabhai will not bee as good. I was wrong, I absolutely Loved the second one much more then the first. There is plenty of humour with mature comedy, with lots of heart warming scenes mixed with serious issues providing High Class Entertainment. Sanjay Dutt is Superb yet again portraying the lovable Good hearted Goon. Arshad Warsi is fantastic as the loyal sidekick, He is brilliant in almost every scene. My Favourite Scene has to be when Munnabhai and Circuit hug and make up, a very heart warming scene. Vidya Balan is alright i guess although her voice is a little annoying when she repeatedly says Good morning Mumbai! Boman Irani is great just like the first. Jimmy is hardly there and could of been deleted out. Diya Mirza looks Sexy and was perfect. This is a FANTASTIC MOVIE and deserves to win awards.",brilliant entertaining movie better then first must see,munnabhai mbbs was fabulous movie that was very entertaining looking at trailer storyline i assumed second munnabhai will not bee as good i was wrong i absolutely loved second one much more then first there is plenty humour with mature comedy with lots heart warming scenes mixed with serious issues providing high class entertainment sanjay dutt is superb yet again portraying lovable good hearted goon arshad warsi is fantastic as loyal sidekick he is brilliant almost every scene my favourite scene has be when munnabhai circuit hug make up very heart warming scene vidya balan is alright i guess although her voice is little annoying when she repeatedly says good morning mumbai boman irani is great just like first jimmy is hardly there could been deleted out diya mirza looks sexy was perfect this is fantastic movie deserves win awards,0.6232843137254901,0.3523774509803922,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.16}"
,My Experiments with the taporis,"I am sure there are many stalwarts out there who can slice-and-dice a movie. Hence I shall KISS - Keep It Short and Simple. (PJ!! PJ!! PJ!!).Mr. Hirani you are in form man - the tapori's are just extremely lovable. Munna and Circuit bonding is given due importance here. Father-son conversation (Parikshit Sahni and Jimmy Shergill) is touching. Love thy neighbour is explained in true Indian terms. I wish Satyagraha was bit more elaborate. The method to curb bribe was innovative. And so was the myth about astrology. Did I miss the Gandhian fast-unto-death concept?The first half was amazing while the latter was logic tolerant. The radio counselling concept was novel - found improper only at the climax. Performances - thumbs up for everyone. Dutt Saab, we miss you in this one. Even when Circuit twitched, I laughed hard. Vidya Balan has amazing screen presence. I couldn't take my eyes off her even when she howled ""Good Morning Mumbai"". Only a slight hitch - she appears dwarf next to Lambu Munna. Dilip Prabhavalkar once again displays his histrionics as Mahatma Gandhi. Comparions to hosts of other actors including Ben Kingsley are bound to arise - but hey, this Mahatma Gandhi can be, what Munnabhai wants to. And Munnabhai's Gandhi is fantastic.""Bande Mein Tha Dum"" awakens the patriotism in you while ""Pal Pal"" is foot tapping.

10.0,Please Lagey Raho Munna Bhai,"Nice movie For the movie that teaches patience, it surely doesn't test ours right away, cuz thankfully it wasn't long like other so called big movies of the year. They kept it short and sweet. The movie was full of moments ... be it the laughters or the triumph of truth, both pleased the audience like a charm. The plot was intelligent to say the least as it carries a lesson in its comic theme. I don't know if any documentary on Gandhi could ever have an impact on such a mass audience; this one filled in a lot of trivia on Gandhi for me and it was truly inspirational. You can see some parallels to Rang De Basanti and quite ironically, these two seem to be the no.1 and no. 2 movies of the year.While it doesn't exceed the original Munna Bhai MBBS, it doesn't fall behind either. It does have its glitches and some weak script moments, but it can all be forgiven for its sheer brilliance and lively performances. You can't help but fall in love with Munna and Circuit; they just happen to create magic on the screen together. Vidya Balan plays her role well; she was very charming and outright adorable. Her 'Good Morning Mumbai' expression was cool. Boman Irani didn't have as meaningful role as the first one, but he did complete justice with it. He came out safe even playing the antagonist of the movie. The cameo trio of Jimmy Shergill, Dia Mirza and Abhishek were justified as well... well may be not Abhishek's role, but Dia Mirza added the glamor and Jimmy did his bit with one of the most sentimental scenes of the movie. The guy who played Gandhi deserves major props. The songs weren't forced and the cinematography is excellent ... the ""samjho ho higaya"" had excellent blends.Wow... didn't even realize i wrote that much... i guess i was bit impressed :)This movie is beyond the traditional comedies like Hera Pheri, Chup Chup K and Malamaal Weekly, it has bigger than life moments. Abhi tak parh rae la hai, watch it already ""Mamu... boley tou Abhi-ich make a plan to watch it"", you won't be disappointed.

10.0,"Perfect, just perfect","I don't think you can actually make movies that can be rated 10 on 10. But Lage Raho is just one of those. Its just flawless. It is a real laugh, with some strong messages in it.Based on its prequel, MBBS, Lage Raho, features the two primary characters, Munna and his henchman Circuit. True that MBBS, focused on the primary characters a bit more, whereas here, the focus is a little less, since the director had to accommodate too many characters here. The entire cast seems to have remained the same, but unlike MBBS, where the comedy was in short spurts, Lage Raho is a constant laugh. The only negative aspect that this movie seem to have is the lack of proper songs. MBBS had far more superior songs compared to these lame tracks, but what the hell, I am here for the movie review right ??Vidya Balan looks amazing in this movie, looks wise and acting wise. Sanjay Dutt is the same Munna, with his swears and typical 'Tapori' language. Circuit has a much larger role to play here than the previous movie. But still he is a killer. Boman Irani, yet again puts on some heavy make up, but that doesn't mask his amazing acting abilities. He is fast catching up to Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever with regards to comedy. Diya Mirza and Abhishek Bachchab gives more of guest performances than a proper role to comment on. Jimmy Shergill's character is shorter than the previous outing, but still he has a credential in this one.All in all, in MBBS, where the message of the movie was very strong, here, the message is kept subtle throughout the movie, until the very end when a five minute sequence projects strongly the theme of the movie. I wont go on harping on the plot because almost everyone knows about it. The direction is superb, acting superb, camera work, whatever was needed was superb.

9.0,Get Well Soon Mamu!,"A goon promoting the principles of Mahatma Gandhi - Sounds unusual and ironic, doesn't it? No big challenge for Raju Hirani who transports the viewer into the colorful world of Munna and Circuit. LRMB leaves you with a huge smile refusing to fade away alongside a number of beautiful lessons in a very enlightening manner. Munna and Circuit are small time goons who work for Lucky Singh. Munna is in love with Janvi and pretends to be a history professor and tells her he is a big follower of Gandhi to impress her. A turn of events leads Janvi to know Murli's truth. What happens next? Watch LRMB and find out.LRMB is one of those rare films that never lose steam. There's a perfect mix of comedy and emotions. Best of all, it has tremendous repeat value. Scenes to look out for? Too many but here's a few.The very first scene - Munna answering questions on radio - Munna's first meeting with Janvi - Scenes between Munna and Gandhi and especially the ones featuring Circuit. - Munna spreading Gandhigiri all over. - Munna's revelation on why he sees Gandhi. - ClimaxThose are just some of the moments not to miss. Actually, you really cannot afford to miss any. Music is okay but sounds much better in the movie. Situational like the last Munnabhai. The writing is nearly flawless and dialogue is applaud worthy. Just brilliant. They tear you up, either in laughter or emotions. Vidiya Balan is fantastic. Suits the role to the T. Boman Irani is first rate. Gives a fine act. Diya Mirza, Khulbushan Karbhanda is as always. Jimmy Shergill is good. Ditto for Surab Shukla.Special mention for Dilip Pravakar as Gandhi. He's terrific. Of Course the 2 goons steal the show on screen as Munna and Circuit. The acting, the chemistry, the delivery - just astounding. Brilliant act by both. Sanjay Dutt is born for this role and he does full justice. He's lovable. Arshad Warsi is at his best when he plays Circuit. He brings the house down with some of the best lines.The hero off screen is director Raj Kumar Hirani.

The story unfolds in a magnificent way, the characters become less two- dimensional, and the message of the films shines through so brightly ... well, I won't say any more as I'll leave that for you to discover.After the first ten to fifteen minutes I would probably have given this movie 3 out of 10, but by the time the final credits rolled that had gone right up to a well earned 9 out of 10.",film two halves,me start this movie was so cheesy i actually turned it off as after watching first ten minutes or so i really didnt think it was something id enjoy however my wife i decided give it another go we stuck with it managed get beyond terrible opening boy am i glad we did as movie progresses it just seems get better better every way story unfolds magnificent way characters become less two dimensional message films shines through so brightly well i wont say any more as ill leave that you discover after first ten fifteen minutes i would probably have given this movie 3 out 10 but by time final credits rolled that had gone right up well earned 9 out 10,0.5457393483709274,0.15363408521303257,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,An Amazing film!,"Every once in a while, there comes a movie which makes you feel good about yourself: suddenly, the possibility that we can all be better human beings becomes all so real, if only for the next two days. And then, when the feeling seems to be getting stale- movies after all are make-believe- you go again and watch that film. Over and over again.Frank Capra did it with Mr Smith Goes To Washington and The Lost Horizon. Spielberg worked that magic by reviving the child in all of us with ET. More recently, there was As Good As It Gets. But that's Hollywood. In European cinema, Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy stands out. Such films are rarer still in India, more so Bollywood. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand was definitely one such film. Now, after a gap of over three decades comes Lage Raho Munnabhai.I will not discuss the film here. But if you do not leave whatever it is you're doing and rush to the nearest cinema-hall near you, then you are really missing out on one helluva an experience.Remember: don't walk.
