10.0,"""The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.""","There aren't many fight movies I'd rate as high as a '10', and by fight movies I'm talking about boxing as the subject. ""Rocky"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are the only two I can think of off hand. But this movie transcends the genre and is so much more than a film about a pair of brothers reaching for the gold ring in the arena of mixed martial arts. There's a lot of human drama on display, and the three principals in the story pull off some of the most incredible performances one is likely to see in a film like this.I was taken aback a bit by the number of other reviewers on this board who admitted to shedding a tear over parts of the story line. Some of the scenes affected me the same way and it's a little difficult to explain why, but the characters are so anguished and real that one can relate to them on some visceral level. I was especially heartened to see how the students of Sparta High School got behind their physics teacher, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) during the War at the Shore. That just showed a whole lot of loyalty and civic pride for the school to turn out the way they did.The entire backdrop to the fight story of course is the anguished and disrupted home life of Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), an alcoholic on the mend approaching a thousand days of sobriety, but with the inability to connect with the sons who abandoned him. I was a little surprised that the resolution to the story didn't involve Nolte's character engaging more purposefully with either Brendan or Tommy (Tom Hardy). It's left open ended, just as Tommy's status with the military is left open ended, though if you follow your instincts, the outcomes wouldn't necessarily be rewarding.As for the fight scenes, I'd have to go on record stating that this movie has the best edited action in the ring I've ever seen. Though the pace is often relentless, none of it looks staged or phony, a credit to all the players involved and the principal photographer. Regarding the outcome of the final match, well before ring time one's brain scrambles trying to guess the outcome, as this is one film and one battle where you don't want either brother to lose, and you can't imagine the twist that will make the final verdict worthwhile. I won't spoil it here either, you'll just have to see and judge it for yourself.",devil you know is better than devil you dont,there arent many fight movies id rate as high as 10 by fight movies im talking about boxing as subject rocky million dollar baby are only two i can think off hand but this movie transcends genre is so much more than film about pair brothers reaching gold ring arena mixed martial arts theres lot human drama display three principals story pull off some most incredible performances one is likely see film like this i was taken aback bit by number other reviewers this board who admitted shedding tear over parts story line some scenes affected me same way its little difficult explain why but characters are so anguished real that one can relate them some visceral level i was especially heartened see how students sparta high school got behind their physics teacher brendan conlon joel edgerton during war at shore that just showed whole lot loyalty civic pride school turn out way they did entire backdrop fight story course is anguished disrupted home life paddy conlon nick nolte alcoholic mend approaching thousand days sobriety but with inability connect with sons who abandoned him i was little surprised that resolution story didnt involve noltes character engaging more purposefully with either brendan or tommy tom hardy its left open ended just as tommys status with military is left open ended though if you follow your instincts outcomes wouldnt necessarily be rewarding as fight scenes id have go record stating that this movie has best edited action ring ive ever seen though pace is often relentless none it looks staged or phony credit all players involved principal photographer regarding outcome final match well before ring time ones brain scrambles trying guess outcome as this is one film one battle where you dont want either brother lose you cant imagine twist that will make final verdict worthwhile i wont spoil it here either youll just have see judge it yourself,0.5073931623931625,0.12316239316239315,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,"Emotions on par with The Fighter, one of the top combat sport movies since Rocky, one of the best of 2011","Every so often you'll come across a combat sport movie that manages to find just the right balance of drama and action – that is, more drama than action. When fights are justified with backstories full of crushing emotion, they become all the more intense and gratifying. Warrior brings to the table the world of mixed martial arts, where punches, kicks, holds, and everything else goes. The inception of new international tournament ""Sparta"" puts on a collision course Paddy (Nick Nolte), Brendan (Joel Edgerton), and Tom Conlon (Tom Hardy), all part of an estranged family torn apart in the past by abuse, favoritism, and abandonment. Tom resurfaces in society to enlist the help of his formerly alcoholic father Paddy to train him for the tournament, while at the same time Brendan revisits his UFC training in hopes to win the $5 million purse for his struggling family. The two underdogs face some of the toughest MMA fighters on the planet, but the true struggle appears to lie within them. Paddy battles for forgiveness against the resentment of his sons, Tom fights to prove to himself that he is strong, and Brendan struggles to come to terms with his older family while trying to support one of his own.The fantastic thing here is two protagonists entering the same tournament. Each brother has his own respectable reasons for fighting, a fact that is sure to divide the audience when it comes time to choose which one to root for. The story truly is gut-wrenchingly powerful and presented in an engaging fashion. Little by little through the film's dialogue, we are allowed a glimpse into the past hardships of the Conlon family, and the characters' motivations for retaining such hatred are revealed gradually. Through the incredible acting talents of Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte, this confused and passionate chemistry really comes alive. All three actors put up some of the most convincing and heartbreaking performances of their careers; and seeing as how The Fighter garnered so many Oscar nominations, I can't see why Warrior will not do the same. My only beef with the movie is its clichéd climax and rather bleak inconclusive ending, though it still does good to the emotional schism the movie intended to create. Warrior is one of those sports films with a magical mixture of emotional and physical battle. It's a wonderful story showing how sometimes the world's strongest forces are insignificant in comparison to the troubles of a scarred family. Warrior is without a doubt worth a visit to the theater. One of the best of 2011! And whether you're an MMA fan or not, the adrenaline-pumping fights will have you up and cheering and applauding.9/10",emotions par with fighter one top combat sport movies since rocky one best 2011,every so often youll come across combat sport movie that manages find just right balance drama action that is more drama than action when fights are justified with backstories full crushing emotion they become all more intense gratifying warrior brings table world mixed martial arts where punches kicks holds everything else goes inception new international tournament sparta puts collision course paddy nick nolte brendan joel edgerton tom conlon tom hardy all part estranged family torn apart past by abuse favoritism abandonment tom resurfaces society enlist help his formerly alcoholic father paddy train him tournament while at same time brendan revisits his ufc training hopes win 5 million purse his struggling family two underdogs face some toughest mma fighters planet but true struggle appears lie within them paddy battles forgiveness against resentment his sons tom fights prove himself that he is strong brendan struggles come terms with his older family while trying support one his own fantastic thing here is two protagonists entering same tournament each brother has his own respectable reasons fighting fact that is sure divide audience when it comes time choose which one root story truly is gut wrenchingly powerful presented engaging fashion little by little through films dialogue we are allowed glimpse into past hardships conlon family characters motivations retaining such hatred are revealed gradually through incredible acting talents tom hardy joel edgerton nick nolte this confused passionate chemistry really comes alive all three actors put up some most convincing heartbreaking performances their careers seeing as how fighter garnered so many oscar nominations i cant see why warrior will not do same my only beef with movie is its clich d climax rather bleak inconclusive ending though it still does good emotional schism movie intended create warrior is one those sports films with magical mixture emotional physical battle its wonderful story showing how sometimes worlds strongest forces are insignificant comparison troubles scarred family warrior is without doubt worth visit theater one best 2011 whether youre mma fan or not adrenaline pumping fights will have you up cheering applauding 9 10,0.5382161562717117,0.24346440596440597,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,A different interpretation of the ending.,"Please don't read this if you don't want the ending given away.I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the ending spoils the film and is clichéd because the underdog and not the better fighter wins.I'm not suggesting that my interpretation is the right one but my view is somewhat different than the one some people hold. It is perfectly logical to point out that Brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that Tommy has had a much easier route.However, the point is that he made that route easier because of his rage. Tommy is only the more destructive force because of that. His demons are driving him on because he is lost. He cannot or will not reach out to connect with his father or brother. The point is that the dam is broken when he sees his father in the hotel room raging against Ahab. This is deeply symbolic. I think you are meant to draw the connection with Ahab who was driven by his own rage with the rage of the father which destroyed his family to the rage which Tommy now feels. Even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers to Tommy as Ahab and bellows at him to stop the ship. At the point that Tommy takes him in his arms and holds him he begins the healing process but loses what makes him such a formidable fighter. Thus he is simply unable to blow his brother away in the way that he has done to every other opponent.The other crucial point (and you would have to be a younger brother to fully get this one) is that Tommy doesn't really want to beat his brother at that point. He needs to know that his brother loves him and perhaps that he regrets not reaching out to him when they were younger. The fact that he taps out only at the point when Brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. Had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit.In other words, for me it was the perfect ending and the more you think about the film the more profound it seems.All in my view of course. Which could be a load of old rubbish.",different interpretation ending,please dont read this if you dont want ending given away ive noticed lot people complaining that ending spoils film is clich d because underdog not better fighter wins im not suggesting that my interpretation is right one but my view is somewhat different than one some people hold it is perfectly logical point out that brendan had hard fights get final that he would probably have been exhausted that tommy has had much easier route however point is that he made that route easier because his rage tommy is only more destructive force because that his demons are driving him because he is lost he cannot or will not reach out connect with his father or brother point is that dam is broken when he sees his father hotel room raging against ahab this is deeply symbolic i think you are meant draw connection with ahab who was driven by his own rage with rage father which destroyed his family rage which tommy now feels even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers tommy as ahab bellows at him stop ship at point that tommy takes him his arms holds him he begins healing process but loses what makes him such formidable fighter thus he is simply unable blow his brother away way that he has done every other opponent other crucial point you would have be younger brother fully get this one is that tommy doesnt really want beat his brother at that point he needs know that his brother loves him perhaps that he regrets not reaching out him when they were younger fact that he taps out only at point when brendan says he loves him is significant as is fact that he breaks down corner before final round had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit other words me it was perfect ending more you think about film more profound it seems all my view course which could be load old rubbish,0.5462861212861213,0.03389295889295889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Joel and Tom are magical.,"At first, I thought, ""man, should have shown a little more backstory, why so much hate among the family and whatever"". But then I understood, that would have made it just another family drama movie, which it cannot be. This movie is about the raw unsaid emotion of a family that always remains there. No matter what.Joel was perfect in the role as a passionate, loving and fierce boxer and family man. Hardy was also great in the little convulated army-disgraced man who just wanted to do right by his fallen comrade. Nick Nolte did most of the magic with his eyes. And the last 20 minutes of the movie can make any grown man AND woman cry.Cheers.",joel tom are magical,at first i thought man should have shown little more backstory why so much hate among family whatever but then i understood that would have made it just another family drama movie which it cannot be this movie is about raw unsaid emotion family that always remains there no matter what joel was perfect role as passionate loving fierce boxer family man hardy was also great little convulated army disgraced man who just wanted do right by his fallen comrade nick nolte did most magic with his eyes last 20 minutes movie can make any grown man woman cry cheers,0.6564835164835164,0.23199633699633698,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,What You Fight For,"""Warrior"" may be one of the best movies of the year that no one sees. That in itself is puzzling. Mixed martial arts and UFC are in the cultural mainstream; in fact MMA is more popular than professional boxing. Director and writer Gavin O'Connor did the amazing ""Miracle"" a few years back about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. So he has the touch for inspirational sports stories. In ""Warrior"" estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) fight each other in the finals of the winner take all mixed martial arts tournament Sparta in Atlantic City. ""Warrior"" is an inspired story of family, honor, and redemption. I applauded at the end of the movie along with the rest of the audience.""Warrior"" is a paradox of styles as inspired by its leads. Tommy (Hardy) is the AWOL Marine war hero from Afghanistan. He literally tore off a submerged tank door, saving those inside. Tommy plows through opponents with sheer rage and power. He is explosive technique. We witness this as he savagely dismantles world middle weight contender ""Mad Dog"" Grimes (cocky Erik Apple) with kicks, punches, and throws in an impromptu sparring session. Tommy mysteriously appears at his Dad's door step in Pittsburgh. He blames Paddy (powerful and sublime Nick Nolte) for the death of his mother. Brendan (Edgerton) is the high school physics teacher and former UFC fighter. He and his wife Tess (strong Jennifer Morrison) work several jobs to pay their upside down mortgage. Brendan gets an entry into Sparta to save his family home. He is smart and willing to take punishment to leverage his opponent's mistakes—getting a tap out. Brendan like Tommy has no love for their recovered drunk Dad (Nolte).At the narrative arc Brendan says to Tommy, ""I love you!"" And neither will back down. I think O'Connor and writers Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman at times overstate the family dysfunction. ""Warrior"" could have been leaner, as strange as that sounds. The mixed martial arts fighting are world class and many of the fighters are MMA stars. Former professional wrestling champion Kurt Angle is fierce and dominating as Russian champ Koba. His match with Brendan is vicious and amazing. ""Warrior"" authentically gets the brutality and precision of mixed martial arts. Hardy and Edgerton are awesome. I read that Hardy trained intensely gaining 30 pounds of muscle. He broke ribs and fingers. Edgerton tore his knee out during the shoot.""Warrior"" has a gritty atmosphere that is all about character and adversity. O'Connor seamlessly captures this in the simple camera shots and intimate dialog. He generates amazing performances. Edgerton is the delicate balance of compassion and focus. His Brendan is a good and decent man. Hardy has an electrifying enigmatic presence. He provokes a painful sadness and rage in Tommy, for whom honor and family are everything. Nick Nolte poignantly plays their broken father, who is pivotal in the redemption of his sons. Ultimately, ""Warrior"" is about forgiveness and love. It is one of the year's best.",what you fight,warrior may be one best movies year that no one sees that itself is puzzling mixed martial arts ufc are cultural mainstream fact mma is more popular than professional boxing director writer gavin oconnor did amazing miracle few years back about 1980 u s olympic hockey team so he has touch inspirational sports stories warrior estranged brothers brendan conlon joel edgerton tommy conlon tom hardy fight each other finals winner take all mixed martial arts tournament sparta atlantic city warrior is inspired story family honor redemption i applauded at end movie along with rest audience warrior is paradox styles as inspired by its leads tommy hardy is awol marine war hero afghanistan he literally tore off submerged tank door saving those inside tommy plows through opponents with sheer rage power he is explosive technique we witness this as he savagely dismantles world middle weight contender mad dog grimes cocky erik apple with kicks punches throws impromptu sparring session tommy mysteriously appears at his dads door step pittsburgh he blames paddy powerful sublime nick nolte death his mother brendan edgerton is high school physics teacher former ufc fighter he his wife tess strong jennifer morrison work several jobs pay their upside down mortgage brendan gets entry into sparta save his family home he is smart willing take punishment leverage his opponents mistakes getting tap out brendan like tommy has no love their recovered drunk dad nolte at narrative arc brendan says tommy i love you neither will back down i think oconnor writers anthony tambakis cliff dorfman at times overstate family dysfunction warrior could have been leaner as strange as that sounds mixed martial arts fighting are world class many fighters are mma stars former professional wrestling champion kurt angle is fierce dominating as russian champ koba his match with brendan is vicious amazing warrior authentically gets brutality precision mixed martial arts hardy edgerton are awesome i read that hardy trained intensely gaining 30 pounds muscle he broke ribs fingers edgerton tore his knee out during shoot warrior has gritty atmosphere that is all about character adversity oconnor seamlessly captures this simple camera shots intimate dialog he generates amazing performances edgerton is delicate balance compassion focus his brendan is good decent man hardy has electrifying enigmatic presence he provokes painful sadness rage tommy whom honor family are everything nick nolte poignantly plays their broken father who is pivotal redemption his sons ultimately warrior is about forgiveness love it is one years best,0.49168488160291446,0.11251105906843611,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,One of the best of the year,"I love movies of all kinds regardless of their age. 2011 so far has been a very hit-and-miss year, luckily alongside Drive and The Tree of Life(though both won't appeal to all) Warrior is among my favourites of this year.Warrior is a well made and directed movie, with lighting that consistently fits with the mood and cinematography that is skillful and intelligently used. The dialogue was thought-provoking and written with vigour and heart, the fight scenes are incredible feeling both authentic(you can smell the sweat and feel the tears) and harrowing and the story for me was absorbing and hit me hard emotionally.The characters are fully credible too, and the wonderful performances help. Tom Hardy is outstanding in one of his best performances to date, and Joel Edgarton is every bit his equal, but Nick Nolte is a sheer delight and comes close to stealing the film on several occasions.

6.0,Clichéd sports movie with some good points,"A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great.

10.0,A powerful masterpiece about desperate men,"Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton feud as estranged brothers at the Pentagon. Nick Nolte plays a rehabilitating father with deep-seated demons. From these dynamics emerges a family drama that on the surface dances to the usual Rocky schema - but again, not at all. Warrior is, in fact, a very special sports film. Not just because of its specific sport (MMA is unlikely to play a role on the big screen anytime soon), but the storytelling of how director Gavin O'Connor manages to weave together the emotional facets of this masculine world.For both Tom Hardy and especially Joel Edgerton, this film was their big breakthrough. Since then, Hollywood has been hot on their heels for almost everything. After seeing this flick, one has to honestly say that this is totally fine. Although I don't think too much of Edgerton's rather stoic and monotonous acting, he fits the role of Brendan perfectly. A ""reasonable"" family man with clear principles, but who has never lost his passion for fighting from his younger years. Even more on the nail, however, is Hardy's embodiment of his character Tommy. Although he is actually sullen and taciturn for the entire 130 minutes of running time (just a typical Hardy), you always have the feeling that there is so much more to this loveless-looking person. When you learn more about his background in the second half of the film, the other character traits clearly come into play. In that respect, Hardy was of course given the more interesting and diverse character, but his rousing performance never really makes you dislike this fundamentally unlikable person after all. The acting masterpiece of the film, however, goes to the account of a gentleman who had long been considered an icon in Hollywood at that time: Nick Nolte. After he had disappeared into oblivion for some time before, Nolte returns here in absolute top form. The role of the recovering alcoholic is tailor-made for Nolte. He plays everything from totally grumpy and distant to empathetic and highly emotional, and in the final part he provides one of the most memorable individual scenes in recent memory, at least in my opinion. You understand this man, want to hug him for his crumbling relationship with his sons, but can still understand why they want to avoid him.At first glance, the film's unwinding seems generic and genre-oriented. However, if you venture beneath the surface and get involved with the not-uncomplex plot, you are completely caught off guard and left wondering. If I weren't a cold hearted person when it comes to crying at movies, I probably would have shed enough water for ten. Warrior gives you so much more than just half-naked men beating the crap out of each other in a pointless martial art. It's about passion, revenge and reconciliation. These elements are conveyed by O'Connor and the cast in such an incredibly authentic and profound way that you almost can't believe that the declared genre of this film is ""sports movie"". Rather, it is a breathtaking roller coaster of emotions with a lot of heart with an admittedly slightly exaggerated ending.",powerful masterpiece about desperate men,tom hardy joel edgerton feud as estranged brothers at pentagon nick nolte plays rehabilitating father with deep seated demons these dynamics emerges family drama that surface dances usual rocky schema but again not at all warrior is fact very special sports film not just because its specific sport mma is unlikely play role big screen anytime soon but storytelling how director gavin oconnor manages weave together emotional facets this masculine world both tom hardy especially joel edgerton this film was their big breakthrough since then hollywood has been hot their heels almost everything after seeing this flick one has honestly say that this is totally fine although i dont think too much edgertons rather stoic monotonous acting he fits role brendan perfectly reasonable family man with clear principles but who has never lost his passion fighting his younger years even more nail however is hardys embodiment his character tommy although he is actually sullen taciturn entire 130 minutes running time just typical hardy you always have feeling that there is so much more this loveless looking person when you learn more about his background second half film other character traits clearly come into play that respect hardy was course given more interesting diverse character but his rousing performance never really makes you dislike this fundamentally unlikable person after all acting masterpiece film however goes account gentleman who had long been considered icon hollywood at that time nick nolte after he had disappeared into oblivion some time before nolte returns here absolute top form role recovering alcoholic is tailor made nolte he plays everything totally grumpy distant empathetic highly emotional final part he provides one most memorable individual scenes recent memory at least my opinion you understand this man want hug him his crumbling relationship with his sons but can still understand why they want avoid him at first glance films unwinding seems generic genre oriented however if you venture beneath surface get involved with not uncomplex plot you are completely caught off guard left wondering if i werent cold hearted person when it comes crying at movies i probably would have shed enough water ten warrior gives you so much more than just half naked men beating crap out each other pointless martial art its about passion revenge reconciliation these elements are conveyed by oconnor cast such incredibly authentic profound way that you almost cant believe that declared genre this film is sports movie rather it is breathtaking roller coaster emotions with lot heart with admittedly slightly exaggerated ending,0.4757640369580667,0.061407249466950954,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
