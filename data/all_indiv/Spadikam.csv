10,A must watch for all those who love cinema. A terrific performance by MOHANLAL.,"One of the best performances By Mohanlal and Thilakan. Backed up with a very good story and direction which leaves a raw image after u come out of the cinemas. I pity that friend of mine who mentioned about the film as just a mediocre one!!! Wonder why films aren't being made of this class in the current malayalam film industry. Its rated as Mohanlal's, who is considered as one of the finest actors in the industry, one of the best performance so far in his career. The Mohanlal-Thilakan combo scenes are a treat to be watched. Cant really rate who's better. Aaduthoma,the protagonist of the story, is one of the finely etched out characters by the Director-Writer Bharathan. The real life-like characters which used to appear in malayalam film industry as in Sphadikam is gone missing.",must watch all those who love cinema terrific performance by mohanlal,one best performances by mohanlal thilakan backed up with very good story direction which leaves raw image after u come out cinemas i pity that friend mine who mentioned about film as just mediocre one wonder why films arent being made this class current malayalam film industry its rated as mohanlals who is considered as one finest actors industry one best performance so far his career mohanlal thilakan combo scenes are treat be watched cant really rate whos better aaduthoma protagonist story is one finely etched out characters by director writer bharathan real life like characters which used appear malayalam film industry as sphadikam is gone missing,0.5061025641025642,0.25305982905982904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10,That rare masala movie with soul,"This movie is filled with action and may be be best known for the signature Mohanlal-mundu attack, but the father-son relationship is the center-stage for the whole movie. Some scenes are very moving. For example, the scene where Thoma's father is to invite Thoma to his sister's wedding, Mohanlal driving the lorry in anguish, the hospital scene, and yes, the climax.Mohanlal doesn't have a chiseled body or bulging biceps. But his gait, body language, dialogue delivery - all ooze masculinity. Wonderful acting by Mohanlal and Thilakan. This movie seems something at first, but turns out to be something else.The story (based on a real-life person), background score and acting all fit into place.

10,The movie represents the obscure relationship between a father and a son in the most legendary fashion and the result is one of the best Indian movies,"Sphadikam, belongs to the class of south Indian cinema which is almost extinct at the present time. One of the most prodigal characters, Thomas chako aka aadu thoma along his father chako maash(kaduva chako) make the movie the most impactful psychological experience a south Indian can achieve. The kind of music, direction and cinematography we can spot in the movie is completely void from the south Indian film industry now. The striking dialogs and incredible acting make the viewer have goosebumps. Its a shame that Malayalam movies have gone a lot down from this kind of quality in direction and acting. Even Mohanlal(Thomas chako) has begun doing pathetic movies like Alexander the great and Kandahar. As for sphadikam, its the most kick-ass movie in Malayalam along with devasuram. Truly a legendary one for the directors.",movie represents obscure relationship between father son most legendary fashion result is one best indian movies,sphadikam belongs class south indian cinema which is almost extinct at present time one most prodigal characters thomas chako aka aadu thoma along his father chako maash kaduva chako make movie most impactful psychological experience south indian can achieve kind music direction cinematography we can spot movie is completely void south indian film industry now striking dialogs incredible acting make viewer have goosebumps its shame that malayalam movies have gone lot down this kind quality direction acting even mohanlal thomas chako has begun doing pathetic movies like alexander great kandahar as sphadikam its most kick ass movie malayalam along with devasuram truly legendary one directors,0.5569444444444445,0.3472222222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.15}"
8,"An out an out Mass Blockbuster with Classy, Heartful Storyline. A stellar face off between two Legends Mohanlal and Thilakan is Unmissable.","Spadikam (1995) : Brief Review -An out an out Mass Blockbuster with Classy, Heartful Storyline. A stellar face off between two Legends Mohanlal and Thilakan is Unmissable. 90s was a decade when South cinema was running riot with gangster and criminal background films and many of them have became iconic films. The list starts from Nayakan then we had Thalapathi and then we had Spadikam which has more soul than those two films. The timing of the other two films helped them to gain much praise and ofcourse the cast and direction too, but as we move forward with the time period we realise how old these films have became and that's why those films are special. However, for Spadikam this timing thing doesn't help much because it wasn't the first instant classic in this crime drama genre like Nayakan was. Spadikam actually has its own legacy, its own identity and its own supremacy. A small-town criminal constantly clashes with his strict school headmaster father at the expense of their family lives. The betterment we see in this crime genre is, Spadikam has a baddie character as protagonist but it provides him a concrete backdrop that makes his character very sensible. Even Nayakan has the same thing to shine bright but Thalapathi lacked it. The exceptional use of emotional quotient makes Spadikam even better. Mohanlal as Aadu Thoma is truly iconic, his attitude, his rowdyism, his reckless and tit fir tat nature everything is Top notch. On the other side, another legend who constantly clashes him is none other than Thilakan and he is freaking amazing in his fantastically written character. Even the supporting cast is highly impressive. Bhadran delivers a sensible mass film in crime genre and believe me this is very rare especially when you don't apply intellectual theories. Overall, A Cult Classic, don't miss.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",out out mass blockbuster with classy heartful storyline stellar face off between two legends mohanlal thilakan is unmissable,spadikam 1995 brief review out out mass blockbuster with classy heartful storyline stellar face off between two legends mohanlal thilakan is unmissable 90s was decade when south cinema was running riot with gangster criminal background films many them have became iconic films list starts nayakan then we had thalapathi then we had spadikam which has more soul than those two films timing other two films helped them gain much praise ofcourse cast direction too but as we move forward with time period we realise how old these films have became thats why those films are special however spadikam this timing thing doesnt help much because it wasnt first instant classic this crime drama genre like nayakan was spadikam actually has its own legacy its own identity its own supremacy small town criminal constantly clashes with his strict school headmaster father at expense their family lives betterment we see this crime genre is spadikam has baddie character as protagonist but it provides him concrete backdrop that makes his character very sensible even nayakan has same thing shine bright but thalapathi lacked it exceptional use emotional quotient makes spadikam even better mohanlal as aadu thoma is truly iconic his attitude his rowdyism his reckless tit fir tat nature everything is top notch other side another legend who constantly clashes him is none other than thilakan he is freaking amazing his fantastically written character even supporting cast is highly impressive bhadran delivers sensible mass film crime genre believe me this is very rare especially when you dont apply intellectual theories overall cult classic dont miss rating 8 10 by,0.5057900432900433,0.22209415584415587,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.2}"
8,Lalettan with his curled mustache,"In Spadikam, Mohanlal dons the role of real-life rowdy Thomas Chacko aka Aadu Thoma. The film follows the account of Thomas and his father who he has grown estranged from in his childhood. Living under the same roof, they are unable to be father and son to each other. Thomas, the classic rowdy and his father the schoolmaster.Mohanlal does an excellent job in the portrayal and this has to be one of his best works. The opening scene where Thomas appears from out of the wilderness and captures a goat is classic and will remain etched in the minds of fans forever. Thilakan is another great actor cast in a typical role. That of the father. His style is exceptional and does an impressive role as that of a harsh schoolmaster with mixed feelings of fondness and hatred for his son and his behaviour. The film does feature comedy and this is the movie with the classic scenes where Mohanlal beats up a police officer and finally removes his 'mundu' and tries to choke him. The fight scenes are typical though and the role of the witty and smart rowdy is done impeccably well by Mohanlal. Overall the film is exemplary of Lal at his violent best. Though not his best piece of work, it doesn't fails to draw applause.

10,Tough one,"Mohanlal dons the role of an extremely tough guy in this movie. Especially the fight scenes are pretty raw... you really see him jumping around on rocks and falling on benches and stuff like that. sometimes it really looks real (which is pretty much for Indian movies)... the father-son relationship is of course the crucial point of the whole movie, thats why i wouldn't decrease mohanlal's character to just a rowdy. even though the characters are build up typically (in a typecasting way, means father is really shown as a ""bad"" man completely disrespecting his son's talents in the childhood, whereas everyone else is appreciating it) and not subtly, its the exceptional dialogues that make this movie unique. they are all full with intelligent sayings... so they come with a certain punch.

But he is still not essentially larger than life. Thoma is a rogue. He doesn't fear anything. He thrashes policemen. But to Bhadran's credit, he still keeps Thoma grounded. Unlike other mass characters Mohanlal portrayed later, Aadu Thoma hasn't traveled to foreign countries after he fled his home as a child. He hasn't learnt music, other skills or achieved great things. In fact the movie doesn't really talk about what he did the 14 years he was away.
