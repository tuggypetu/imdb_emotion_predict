10.0,""" BACK -{ FROM }- THE FUTURE ðŸŒ  ""","A -{ Netflix }- MINI Review ; Film Seen around March 27, 2022. It is -{ Not }- very likely to be released in Cinemas.______________________________________________________Ellie { Young Adam's Mom }: ""This's the third time you've been suspended for fighting"".Young Adam: ""I know. You'd think I'd be better at it by now!!!""______________________________________________________If you're someone who's presently in the mood to take a -Welcome- Break from all the doom and gloom on the news right now and watch a movie that comes ""FULL-CIRCLE"" in the most Enthralling, Engaging, and indeed -{ Heartwarming }- of ways . . . Then I wish to -Wholeheartedly- recommend ""The Adam Project"", ( TAP for short ), to you. The only -Other- cinematic experience I've had where a film came Full-Circle in -Such- beautiful fashion, in -Recent- memory at least, would be the simply Fabulous ""SpiderMan: No Way Home"" ( ""SM-NWH"" ). It is a picture that literally ( And -Very- Cleverly ) ties up loose ends within the -{ Entire }- Spiderman CANON of films, from as far back as 2002. It also just happens to be the -Last- Massive Blockbuster that I reviewed ; before going on an -Entirely- unplanned, ( but -Incredibly- refreshing ) 'Extended 101-day hiatus from reviewing'.Ok, so if you thought that the 13 yr. Old ""Newcomer"" of said film, pint-sized thespian Walker Scobell was a tremendous -Dramatic- actor, well, then you'd only be -Half- right. The fact of the mater is... he's also a terrific -COMEDIC- talent, with seriously ""Impeccable"" timing, especially given that this is, get this ...his -{ First Ever }- movie or TV ( 'Feature' ) appearance. Factor Walker's ""Super-Fun"" performance in alongside a 'full spectrum' of absolute -{ ""POWERHOUSE!"" }- deliveries from the film's unequivocal ensemble principal cast of Protagonists ( Zoe SaldaÃ±a, Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner, ) . . . Then add in some absolutely -Fantastic- ( & truly state of the art ) CGI, a genuinely -Mindblowing- grand finale set piece ...and the kind of fight choreography that you really have to -See- ...to believe . . . & you have a seriously, seriously exciting picture, indeed.Not to mention FUNNY AS HELL!!! I really hadn't laughed so hard in a long time ; -since- ( about the 3rd time ) I watched SM-NWH, to be precise. On the downside, though . . . & if I'm to be 'painfully' honest . . . -Both- the Villain ( ...don't get me wrong, the person who plays the main 'baddie' is a Veteran performer ; I just felt like the Writing there could have been just that ""Little Bit Stronger""... ) -And- her 'ever loyal' henchman are a 'tad weak', as is the very title of the film, itself. Even something as ( relatively ) simple as ""FLASH-BACK-FORWARD"", would have been -{ Far }- catchier than its existing name, ( although I do think I sorta understand -Why- they called it what they did, for what it's worth ). It's for these two reasons -Alone- that I -Didn't- give it my trademark ""25/10"" ; reserved especially for movies That Move Me -{ VERY }- Deeply, as TAP ( ...quite obviously... ) -Did-.Summary: This is a picture that, ( among -several- other things ), pointedly asks the question: If you could -{ Somehow }- go back in time, & talk to your Younger-Self... ""WHAT'D YOU SAY?"" ...and in the most -Intriguing- of ways, at that. Furthermore, having lost my Dearly Beloved Father when I was -Just- 13, in a horrible, brutal car crash, TAP resonated with me PROFOUNDLY. It has some Genuinely ""TENDER"" Moments, & does a -Phenomenal- job of addressing the issue of 'Estranged Father-Son Relationships' the world over, but most especially in the USA ; ( where the film is also -Set- ) ; and where the issue is quite possibly now almost at epidemic levels, what with the country's sky-high divorce rate, separation rate, & just plain old 'Absentee Father-ism', in general. All said & done, the ""EVER-DYNAMIC! Duo"" of Actor Ryan Reynolds & Director Shawn Levy have well & truly ""Done it Again"". Although this -ISN'T- a Marvel movie, It -does- star a ""Handful Of Marvel's Best & Brightest"" and -is- ultimately, "" A ( not so ) little cinematic streaming MARVEL ðŸŒ  "", in its 'Very Own Right'. Sadly, I'm not able to give TAP my 'Absoluuut-High-Score' ( as I explained a bit earlier ), but it -Still- earns a ""Majestic, Rock Solid 13 Marks Out Of 10 Marks"" from me . . .

8.0,A solid family friendly time travel adventure,"In 2050 pilot Adam Reed steals his time-plane. His superiors are in pursuit but he manages to evade them and escape to 2022... four years later than he planned to end up. This means there are now two Adams in 2022; injured time pilot from the future and his twelve year old self. The younger Adam is small and constantly bullied at school; he is also dealing with the recent death of his father. The older Adam must seek out his younger self as not only does his plane need his DNA signature to access it; it also needs him to be healthy. The two Adams are going to go on quite an adventure as the elder explains why they must go back to 2018 together in order to save somebody the older Adam loved and lost and possibly save the world's future... all while being pursued by an enemy from the future and her agents.I thought this was a lot of fun; it reminded me of the sci-fi I enjoyed as a youngster in the eighties. While there is a sense of danger it isn't too intense for younger viewers. There is plenty of fairly bloodless action throughout the film; this is impressively varied with dogfighting planes, fights with futuristic weapons and even a chase through the woods that was clearly inspired by 'Return of the Jedi'. As well as action there are some good laughs; mostly thanks to Adam's propensity to talk a lot... often getting him in trouble. The cast is solid; Ryan Reynolds impresses as the elder Adam and Walker Scobell is likeable as his younger self; others of note include Jennifer Garner, as his mother; Mark Ruffalo as his father; Zoe Saldana, as love interest Laura; and Catherine Keener as the villainess Maya Sorian. As one might expect for a science fiction film there are quite a lot of special effects; thankfully these are pretty impressive. There is some mild swearing but nothing too offensive that means this can be enjoyed by sci-fi fans of just about any age. Overall I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre; just don't try to overthink it too much... it was never meant to be that deep.",solid family friendly time travel adventure,2050 pilot adam reed steals his time plane his superiors are pursuit but he manages evade them escape 2022 four years later than he planned end up this means there are now two adams 2022 injured time pilot future his twelve year old self younger adam is small constantly bullied at school he is also dealing with recent death his father older adam must seek out his younger self as not only does his plane need his dna signature access it it also needs him be healthy two adams are going go quite adventure as elder explains why they must go back 2018 together order save somebody older adam loved lost possibly save worlds future all while being pursued by enemy future her agents i thought this was lot fun it reminded me sci fi i enjoyed as youngster eighties while there is sense danger it isnt too intense younger viewers there is plenty fairly bloodless action throughout film this is impressively varied with dogfighting planes fights with futuristic weapons even chase through woods that was clearly inspired by return jedi as well as action there are some good laughs mostly thanks adams propensity talk lot often getting him trouble cast is solid ryan reynolds impresses as elder adam walker scobell is likeable as his younger self others note include jennifer garner as his mother mark ruffalo as his father zoe saldana as love interest laura catherine keener as villainess maya sorian as one might expect science fiction film there are quite lot special effects thankfully these are pretty impressive there is some mild swearing but nothing too offensive that means this can be enjoyed by sci fi fans just about any age overall id certainly recommend it fans genre just dont try overthink it too much it was never meant be that deep,0.39886489479512727,0.2049557032115171,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.3}"
5.0,Enough with the BS projects driven by Reynolds' charisma alone. Put some damn writing into things!,"This film is bad. There is no way around it. And I know that there are many other films with the same amount of logic holes (and perhaps the same plot!) that are considered at least average, but those are older movies. If you clone a barely average old film now and all you have to add to it is Ryan Reynolds' jokes as an improvement, then you fail.Forget that time travel films are notoriously hard to have making sense: even in that very specific subgenre, this film is at the bottom of anything resembling reason. What you are left with are (very!) cheap video game like special effects, Reynolds' and the kid (he did a good work, BTW) spouting jokes and puns and guest star appearances from Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe Saldana (they all have like a few minutes of screen time each, just to get a paycheck). Even the ""endearing"" part that people talk about is mostly nostalgia for better films from 30 years ago and nothing to do with the script.Bottom line: I like Ryan Reynolds, he is fun, but all of his movies have become the same thing with different backgrounds. They don't even make the effort to make it seem like they tried. With this in mind, I doubt even Deadpool 3 will be any different, which would be a terrible shame. Films like The Adam Project are a disgrace, a show of bad faith and lack of respect to viewers. At least Reynolds should know better.",enough with bs projects driven by reynolds charisma alone put some damn writing into things,this film is bad there is no way around it i know that there are many other films with same amount logic holes perhaps same plot that are considered at least average but those are older movies if you clone barely average old film now all you have add it is ryan reynolds jokes as improvement then you fail forget that time travel films are notoriously hard have making sense even that very specific subgenre this film is at bottom anything resembling reason what you are left with are very cheap video game like special effects reynolds kid he did good work btw spouting jokes puns guest star appearances mark ruffalo jennifer garner zoe saldana they all have like few minutes screen time each just get paycheck even endearing part that people talk about is mostly nostalgia better films 30 years ago nothing do with script bottom line i like ryan reynolds he is fun but all his movies have become same thing with different backgrounds they dont even make effort make it seem like they tried with this mind i doubt even deadpool 3 will be any different which would be terrible shame films like adam project are disgrace show bad faith lack respect viewers at least reynolds should know better,0.42587941628264203,-0.0055760368663594385,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.21}"
,A rousing comedy disguised as sci-fi. From Netflix.,"Netflix has a winner sci-fi comedy with the accomplished sarcastic actor Ryan Reynolds, whose Deadpool set the standard for snarky, sardonic, quipping dialogue not this successful since early film screwball days. Adam (Reynolds) comes back from the future to face his 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell, terrific) and destroy the creation of time travel by his scientist father, Louis Reed (Mark Ruffalo):Adam: ""I spent 30 years trying to get away from the me that was you. And I'll tell you what: you were the best part all along.""Although this amusement is no Back to the Future, it is a swell diversion for a relaxed evening that doesn't require knowledge of physics or even sci-fi (a little Twilight Zone experience is a plus in any imaginative playing with the time-space continuum). The most enjoyable is the first act where the two Adams from different time zones engage in witty repartee grounded in their same personalities from different times in the same life:Young Adam: ""Do you remember this? I mean, if this is happening to me, it already happened to you, right? Unless it works more like a multiverse. Each ripple creates an alternate timeline."" Adam: ""It's not a multiverse! My God, we watched too many movies.""Not only does the humor reference concepts from the Marvel universe, it also reminds us that several of the actors in The Adam Project spent time as Marvel heroes. Good fun that shows us as well how flexible sci-fi can be, especially as comic masters like Reynolds and young actors like Scobell give us enjoyable rides.As The Adam Project continues on to face off the Adams family against their arch enemies, it is less an amusing comedy and more a CGI display moving all combatants to a formulaic ending saved by the personalities of its stellar cast.Louis Reed: Sometimes it pays to be a nerd, guys.",rousing comedy disguised as sci fi netflix,netflix has winner sci fi comedy with accomplished sarcastic actor ryan reynolds whose deadpool set standard snarky sardonic quipping dialogue not this successful since early film screwball days adam reynolds comes back future face his 12 year old self walker scobell terrific destroy creation time travel by his scientist father louis reed mark ruffalo adam i spent 30 years trying get away me that was you ill tell you what you were best part all along although this amusement is no back future it is swell diversion relaxed evening that doesnt require knowledge physics or even sci fi little twilight zone experience is plus any imaginative playing with time space continuum most enjoyable is first act where two adams different time zones engage witty repartee grounded their same personalities different times same life young adam do you remember this i mean if this is happening me it already happened you right unless it works more like multiverse each ripple creates alternate timeline adam its not multiverse my god we watched too many movies not only does humor reference concepts marvel universe it also reminds us that several actors adam project spent time as marvel heroes good fun that shows us as well how flexible sci fi can be especially as comic masters like reynolds young actors like scobell give us enjoyable rides as adam project continues face off adams family against their arch enemies it is less amusing comedy more cgi display moving all combatants formulaic ending saved by personalities its stellar cast louis reed sometimes it pays be nerd guys,0.4278003246753246,0.17884199134199133,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.46}"

6.0,Fun and enjoyable time-travel movie...,"Well, based on the cast ensemble alone then I figured that this 2022 sci-fi action adventure would be a movie worth-while watching. And thus, I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch what writers Jonathan Tropper, T. S. Nowlin, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin had in store with this movie.And honestly, then the movie was every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as anticipated. Which means that director Shawn Levy managed to do a great job at bringing the script and storyline to life on the screen in an enjoyable and entertaining manner.Sure, ""The Adam Project"" is the type of movie where you essentially just lean back, munch on the snacks and watch the movie. Yeah, it wasn't particularly a very cerebral movie, despite of it revolving around something as complex as time travel. But hey, it is a movie meant for entertainment after all, this wasn't exactly an exact science.Visually then ""The Adam Project"" is rather impressive. But of course, with a movie project such as this, the funding is large and very capable of sustaining great visuals. And a movie such as ""The Adam Project"" does need proper CGI effects to fully function as intended on the screen. And trust me, the effects served their purpose.""The Adam Project"" has a good cast ensemble, which funnily enough brought together four members of the Marvel CMU, a funny little detail. Especially since ""The Adam Project"" does poke fun at aforementioned MCU. The movie has the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana and Jennifer Garner on the cast list to carry the movie, which they did quite well.

10.0,How can you not like this? Are you dead?,"Honestly, this movie feels how movies used to be when they were better. Some of these negative reviews on here really make me sad, because obviously the people writing don't want to have fun or are ""too cool"" for a feel good movie. It's a great family movie, drawing inspiration from a handful of classics before it such as Flight of the Navigator and Back to the Future but also keeping it fresh with great special effects and cinematography. It's also a tear jerker... and reminded me of how a lot of movies used to be made to trigger a positive emotional response, something that is missing completely from most modern cinema.A movie hasn't made me feel this way in a long time. I felt like a kid again watching it. I'm not ""too cool"" for this movie. It rocks. Great cinematography, acting, script, comedy and drama. It's a great all ages movie. It's a rare thing to get one like this during ""dark times"".

8.0,Action Filled Humorous Time Travel Movie,"I saw The Adam Project, starring Ryan Reynolds-the Deadpool movies, Green Lantern; Jennifer Garner-Peppermint, 13 Going on 30; Mark Ruffalo-Begin Again, 13 Going 0n 30; Catherine Keener-Get Out, Begin Again; Zoe Saldana-the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, Death at a Funeral and Walker Scobell-this is his first movie.This is an action filled, humorous time travel movie. Jennifer and Mark are a married couple with a son, Walker. Mark dies and both Jennifer and Walker suffer, in their own different ways-Jennifer grieving but trying to stay strong for Walker and then Walker is getting into fights at school and disrespecting Jennifer at home. Ryan is Walker in the future-2050 to be specific-and he comes back to 2020 to right some wrongs involving time travel. He was aiming for 2018 but he was being pursued by bad guys and missed his time period. Catherine plays Marks' business associate and Zoe is Ryans' wife in 2050. There is lots of action with futuristic weaponry and fights and the usual Ryan wit and humor and Walker-this being his first movie-does a great job of mimicking Ryan. The name of the movie, The Adam Project, is the name of the program that made time travel possible. There is some good music, too, if you like classic rock. I remember hearing some Led Zeppelin, Boston and Pete Townsend. FYI: This is a Netflix produced movie so it is also being shown on Netflix if you like to watch movies on a smaller screen-I don't.

7.0,Actually a very good time travel flick featuring familiar faces,"The Adam Project is a 2022 Sci Fi Comedy starring Ryan Reynolds(Deadpool),Mark Ruffalo(Avengers Endgame),Jennifer Garner (who worked with Mark Ruffalo in 13 Going On 30),Zoe Saldana(Avatar),Catherine Keener(Begin Again) and introducing Walker Scobell in his film debut. Directed by Shaun Levy(Free Guy,Night At The Museum) the story follows Adam Reed(Walker Scobell) a 12 year old boy who's living with his mom(Garner) in 2022. Meanwhile in 2050 a pilot also named Adam Reed(Reynolds) accidently finds a worm-hole through time and is sent to 2022 where he meets his younger self.(who you guess it happens to be the same Adam Reed from 2022). Together the unlikely duo travel back in time to 2018 where they meet their father (Ruffalo) who died in a car accident over a year ago as well as stopping Catherine Keener's character.Will they be able to prevent their father's death?. And will Adam reunite with his wife Laura(Saldana). Overall I enjoyed this film. What drew me to this film was seeing both Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo again after 18 years since 13 Going On 30. As well as that I love Ryan Reynolds in nearly every film his in as his such a likeable guy. Sure he plays the same sarcastic deadpan guy over and over again(almost every actor does this) but again like I said his a very good actor.My only downfall to this was parts of it made zero sense especially the ending(which I am not gonna spoil). And I was disappointed that Jennifer and Mark hadn't more screentime together (as mentioned before both starred in 13 Going On 30 together which happens to be my runner up romantic comedy of all time). Then again the real reason why both hadn't much screen time was due to Mark's character being dead for the majority of the film and we don't get to see him until the 2nd act of the movie. Speaking of the director of this film,half the time I kept thinking is this directed by Steven Speilberg as there is alot of references to his movies in here from ET to other films such as The Kid with Bruce Willis, Star Wars and Back To The Future. If your a fan of Steven Speilberg then you will love this film.B- 60%",actually very good time travel flick featuring familiar faces,adam project is 2022 sci fi comedy starring ryan reynolds deadpool mark ruffalo avengers endgame jennifer garner who worked with mark ruffalo 13 going 30 zoe saldana avatar catherine keener begin again introducing walker scobell his film debut directed by shaun levy free guy night at museum story follows adam reed walker scobell 12 year old boy whos living with his mom garner 2022 meanwhile 2050 pilot also named adam reed reynolds accidently finds worm hole through time is sent 2022 where he meets his younger self who you guess it happens be same adam reed 2022 together unlikely duo travel back time 2018 where they meet their father ruffalo who died car accident over year ago as well as stopping catherine keeners character will they be able prevent their fathers death will adam reunite with his wife laura saldana overall i enjoyed this film what drew me this film was seeing both jennifer garner mark ruffalo again after 18 years since 13 going 30 as well as that i love ryan reynolds nearly every film his as his such likeable guy sure he plays same sarcastic deadpan guy over over again almost every actor does this but again like i said his very good actor my only downfall this was parts it made zero sense especially ending which i am not gonna spoil i was disappointed that jennifer mark hadnt more screentime together as mentioned before both starred 13 going 30 together which happens be my runner up romantic comedy all time then again real reason why both hadnt much screen time was due marks character being dead majority film we dont get see him until 2nd act movie speaking director this film half time i kept thinking is this directed by steven speilberg as there is alot references his movies here et other films such as kid with bruce willis star wars back future if your fan steven speilberg then you will love this film b 60,0.45615873015873015,0.11080952380952384,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.5}"

9.0,"So much fun, captures the spirit of an 80s sci-fi family film!","The Adam Project is a must see movie, it's such a delight and so entertaining! I truly loved it, it felt like a modern approach to an 80s sci-fi family film such as ""ET"", ""The Last Starfighter"" and ""Back to the Future"". Shawn Levy captures that spirit so well, and while he doesn't completely reinvent the wheel, he infuses this film with a lot of heart and some great entertainment value. It's a film that would make Spielberg proud, so deep in its veins is the essence of vintage Amblin. I like how while Levy used these comfortable retro elements he also did add in more modern sensibilities and gave it a futuristic feel, he makes it it's own thing while reminding us of movies we love. And oh boy, do I ever love Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds teaming up! First ""Free Guy"" (which I loved) and now this (which I love even more)! Ryan Reynolds is in his best form here, much like in ""Free Guy"" this is his best work outside of ""Deadpool"". What truly surprised me was that we got two Reynolds performances in this - one from Reynolds himself and one from young Walker Scobell who was truly incredible here! He matched Reynolds' personality and comedic style so well, and really held his own against Reynolds like a seasoned comedic actor! Their banter was so much fun, and Scobell's delivery felt exactly like Reynolds. Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe SaldaÃ±a were also excellent and helped bring about some perfect emotional moments. I loved the chemistry between the cast - it couldn't have been better! While this isn't a great ""film"" by technical standards it's just so enjoyable and fun, it's all around good! It's so funny, has some great action, and even has some nice emotional moments that had me tearing up! This film emotionally resonates on a level Hollywood has been trying to return to for years, it's so well handled! It's thoughtful, witty and delightful, just such a wholesome and enjoyable film! I also loved the soundtrack, it had some great 80s songs mixed in! This movie was such a good time, it tells such a heartfelt and sweet story that I had so much fun with! It's truly better than most Netflix movies (it deserves so much more than Netflix... it should be a theatrical one!), and I would highly recommend checking it out! It's super entertaining, charming and has loads of spirit and heart! Trust me, you'll love it!",so much fun captures spirit 80s sci fi family film,adam project is must see movie its such delight so entertaining i truly loved it it felt like modern approach 80s sci fi family film such as et last starfighter back future shawn levy captures that spirit so well while he doesnt completely reinvent wheel he infuses this film with lot heart some great entertainment value its film that would make spielberg proud so deep its veins is essence vintage amblin i like how while levy used these comfortable retro elements he also did add more modern sensibilities gave it futuristic feel he makes it its own thing while reminding us movies we love oh boy do i ever love shawn levy ryan reynolds teaming up first free guy which i loved now this which i love even more ryan reynolds is his best form here much like free guy this is his best work outside deadpool what truly surprised me was that we got two reynolds performances this one reynolds himself one young walker scobell who was truly incredible here he matched reynolds personality comedic style so well really held his own against reynolds like seasoned comedic actor their banter was so much fun scobells delivery felt exactly like reynolds mark ruffalo jennifer garner zoe salda were also excellent helped bring about some perfect emotional moments i loved chemistry between cast it couldnt have been better while this isnt great film by technical standards its just so enjoyable fun its all around good its so funny has some great action even has some nice emotional moments that had me tearing up this film emotionally resonates level hollywood has been trying return years its so well handled its thoughtful witty delightful just such wholesome enjoyable film i also loved soundtrack it had some great 80s songs mixed this movie was such good time it tells such heartfelt sweet story that i had so much fun with its truly better than most netflix movies it deserves so much more than netflix it should be theatrical one i would highly recommend checking it out its super entertaining charming has loads spirit heart trust me youll love it,0.5596271929824562,0.39399122807017545,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.41, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.18}"

The two Adams are helped by his future wife Laura (Zoe Saldana) in their battle against Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener).Ryan Reynolds is being his standard wisecracking self. Saldana is the sexy fighter. Garner is the suffering mom. I like Ryan with his younger self until it runs into a bump in the road. The younger self can't be the zen advisor to the older self.

7.0,"Say what you want, Ryan Reynolds nailed it, yet again!","""Teenage boys are horrible. It's like living with a urinal cake that yells at you""Shawn Levy's ""The Adam Project"" turned out exactly as I had imagined. It's fun, full of energy and has a rather powerful ground of emotions that hit you like a truck. Believe it or not, this specific aspect would have a greater say over everything else. It will depend upon how much you value the 'Humane' stuff; based on that, it will either make or break your experience and could modify the final takeaway as well.Speaking for myself, I'm a sensitive person; and these kinds of stuff make me emotional, and here is no exception. I just loved the dynamic shown here. The father & son alliance hasn't been explored enough in recent times, I'm delighted they did that in here and that too in the most adorable fashion possible. And yeah, the actors did their parts too.Say what you want, Ryan Reynolds has nailed it yet again. I know some part of the audience won't agree with my above statement. ""Ryan Reynolds getting repetitive"", ""He's playing himself"", ""He's doing the same thing over and over again""; now, I won't deem them as lies, as most of these statements do reflect the reality or at least some parts of it. But then again, as long as he's getting the job done, doing well on his part, I see nothing wrong in there.Besides, nobody would argue against the talent this man seems to possess. From his stellar dialogue deliveries to his perfect comic timings, No other actor could do those things in the way he does, he's one of a kind, he's unparalleled in this space. And I truly admire him for that, and you know what? I'm not at all apologetic while acknowledging the same.So, It seems we've finally concluded, this is the part where I'm supposed to tell you whether you should go to the film or not. Look, I loved Levy's previous work i.e. Free Guy; although that doesn't necessarily suggest I had higher expectations this time, on the contrary, I did know this would not be the same sort of experience, because of various reasons. All I can say is that, if you are here for nothing but the sole value of entertainment, congratulations, you have come to the right place.

7.0,"Whooshes Into Realistic Topics - Grieving, Being Bullied, Accepting Who You Are","The Adam Project is a sci-fi movie that takes you on a wild, CGI-filled flight that is out of this world-with futuristic technology that makes you excited but also afraid of what could come, and crazy fight scenes that defy gravity. This film also whooshes you into some very realistic topics, too, like grieving for a loved one, being bullied by classmates and accepting who you are.The year is 2050 and time travel exists; however, it is proving to be too dangerous for humanity's own good. After time-traveler pilot Adam Reed (Ryan Reynolds) misses the destination of his mission, to land in 2018, and instead crash-lands in 2022, he is found by his 13-year-old self (Walker Scobell). Together, they embark on a mission to ""un-do"" time travel so they can fix the past to save the future of the world. But first, the Adams must learn how to get along with each other.The special effects are one of the most notable things about this movie. The wormholes have a mind-boggling appearance, and the ships are straight out of an alien planet. The sci-fi elements look so realistic - as realistic as those can be - that it gives the impression that the cinematographers used time travel themselves to capture these scenes. The overall storyline of the movie is creative, but it does not really have any unique plot twists nor is it fully developed. And as a result, this film comes off a little bland and seems to be missing something. The Adam Project includes some great actors besides Ryan Reynolds, including Jennifer Garner (Adam's mom). In Reynold's performance, you can really feel all his tension and childhood trauma built up, ready to burst. He also manages to make you laugh really hard. Jennifer Garner is the perfect fit for Adam's loving mother who's trying to keep it together as a single mom.This movie has great messages about never giving up and learning to live with your past. There is some profanity, intense fighting scenes, blood, and some adult jokes.I give The Adam Project 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults.
