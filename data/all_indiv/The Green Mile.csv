9.0,""" I knows you think I's a powerful man, but the darkness scares me boss ""","The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****",i knows you think is powerful man but darkness scares me boss,world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner men are housed because these men are said have committed crime places are manifest most men serving there have earned their stay however as history has shown there are innocent men incarcerated as well occasionally one these innocents are not only imprisoned but are further remembered because their life becomes legend this case realization is nothing short incredible as new prisoner is natural empath steven king prolific american horror writer chronicles this unusual story louisanna prison where one joe coffee michael clarke duncan huge nay enormous black man having been convicted murder is sentenced be executed by electrocution tom hanks dabbs greer plays paul edgecomb aging prison guard who recalls his years state prison working death row or green mile mr edgecomb recalls mr coffees arrival strange events during his stay with sympathetic guards like brutus howell david morse dean stanton barry pepper harry terwilliger jeffery demunn one particular sadistic guard called percy wetmore doug hutchison edgecomb recollects his discovery mans unusual healing powers surprising revelations concerning his innocence story is crafted by steven king its application silver screen is perhaps one finest adaptation ever done duncan is magnificent has superb ability allow audience learn his true purpose were it not sadistic behavior hutchison who earned his ultimate reward story would not have carried its genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie its classic status great film must true movie fans,0.6370959595959597,0.2917676767676768,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,One of the most penetrating films of the past several years. **** out of ****,"THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality) By Blake French:	It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. 	Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue. I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999. The message to ""The Green Mile"" is clear and understandable: justice isn't always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you.

10.0,The Least Of us,"I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. I would not have guessed this film would have come from a horror story writer. No monsters from the id or any place else are present in this story set in the American South of the Thirties. But demons do exist in The Green Mile and there is a man named John Coffey who takes them unto himself.The Green Mile refers to the cell block housing the inmates scheduled for Death Row. In that cell block comes Michael Clarke Duncan who is close to seven feet tall and maybe weighing 400 pounds. He's also as docile as a baby lamb and whose only request is that they leave a night light burning because he gets a little afraid of a strange place in the dark.Of course the guards who have the typical white Alabama attitudes of the day don't quite know what to make of them, but Tom Hanks who captains the cell block and most of the rest find out just how special he is. And Hanks cannot believe that someone like Duncan could possibly be guilty of a double rape/murder of a child.This modern day parable of the Jesus story has King telling us that it is very possible that many of his kind have walked the earth with talents for healing. One of them got a religion worked around him, but they can come in all walks of life and certainly no one would expect one to come in the guise of an illiterate black Alabama sharecropper. But one of my favorite Bible verses has Jesus himself saying that what you do unto the least of my brethren you do unto me.Somebody of Michael Clarke Duncan's size and build is not going to get too many really good roles and he certainly hasn't played anything remotely like John Coffey again. Parts like that don't come along and the film seems almost to have been built around him. It's one of the most moving performance that has ever been put on film in history. And it's an incredibly difficult role, he's meek for his size and Uncle Tom like, but as we learn far from it. In fact Coffey is beyond what the ordinary human mind can comprehend. Duncan received one of four Academy Award nominations that The Green Mile got, in his case for Best Supporting Actor. Since the film is built around him, my only question is why was it the Supporting Actor category?The Green Mile was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not come home a winner in any of these. A pity that one of the best films of the Nineties could not get at least one Oscar.Where there's a Christ-like figure you also have some devil spawn villains and we have a pair of them in Sam Rockwell as another death row prisoner and David Hutchison as a rat of a prison guard with both connections and issues. What happens to them is both poetic and diabolical in true Stephen King tradition. Others in the cast of note are Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Hanks, James Cromwell and Patricia Clarkson as the warden and his wife, David Morse and Barry Pepper as two other guards on the block and Michael Jeter as another prisoner with a remarkably trained 'circus' mouse.The Green Mile is a remarkable allegorical picture and might be considered for Easter time viewing if it has a season. It certainly will make folks think.",least us,im glad that number reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was faithful adaption novel by stephen king im not much fiction reader so it is gratifying hear that his vision got screen intact i would not have guessed this film would have come horror story writer no monsters id or any place else are present this story set american south thirties but demons do exist green mile there is man named john coffey who takes them unto himself green mile refers cell block housing inmates scheduled death row that cell block comes michael clarke duncan who is close seven feet tall maybe weighing 400 pounds hes also as docile as baby lamb whose only request is that they leave night light burning because he gets little afraid strange place dark course guards who have typical white alabama attitudes day dont quite know what make them but tom hanks who captains cell block most rest find out just how special he is hanks cannot believe that someone like duncan could possibly be guilty double rape murder child this modern day parable jesus story has king telling us that it is very possible that many his kind have walked earth with talents healing one them got religion worked around him but they can come all walks life certainly no one would expect one come guise illiterate black alabama sharecropper but one my favorite bible verses has jesus himself saying that what you do unto least my brethren you do unto me somebody michael clarke duncans size build is not going get too many really good roles he certainly hasnt played anything remotely like john coffey again parts like that dont come along film seems almost have been built around him its one most moving performance that has ever been put film history its incredibly difficult role hes meek his size uncle tom like but as we learn far it fact coffey is beyond what ordinary human mind can comprehend duncan received one four academy award nominations that green mile got his case best supporting actor since film is built around him my only question is why was it supporting actor category green mile was also nominated best picture best sound best adapted screenplay but did not come home winner any these pity that one best films nineties could not get at least one oscar where theres christ like figure you also have some devil spawn villains we have pair them sam rockwell as another death row prisoner david hutchison as rat prison guard with both connections issues what happens them is both poetic diabolical true stephen king tradition others cast note are bonnie hunt as mrs hanks james cromwell patricia clarkson as warden his wife david morse barry pepper as two other guards block michael jeter as another prisoner with remarkably trained circus mouse green mile is remarkable allegorical picture might be considered easter time viewing if it has season it certainly will make folks think,0.4955096073517127,0.15978487886382625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.4}"

Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were wonderful and the supporting cast was fantastic.Based on a serial novel by Stephen King, the Green Mile is about Paul Edgecomb, a officer in charge of prisoners on death row and everything was the same as usual until the day that John Coffey (Clarke Duncan) was brought to the mile. Coffey is an extraordinary person and Paul Edgecomb never believed in miracles until the day he met one. This movie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel that I have ever seen.

10.0,A rare gem of casting and direction.,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year.

10.0,As wonderful as the book!,"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times. I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen. Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen. He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"". The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway. The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison. His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book. The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that. I can't understand the complaints. The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long. The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.

,"True to the book, which is odd for a movie.","Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the book, which in itself is a great read. I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way detract from either work. As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the book. I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had written it. I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects. But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4 stars. Great story, great cast, great look.",true book which is odd movie,having seen movie green mile read novel same name by stephen king i am glad say that movie stays true book which itself is great read i read book one setting about year ago after seeing movie i didnt see one scene book or one plot point left out there were few minor changes book but which no way detract either work as far as performances i can imagine many people pointing michael duncan as john coffey or tom hanks as paul edgecomb as best performances movie they are good but i would hope that michael jeter would receive recognition portraying eduard delacroix he plays delacroix exactly as i pictured him when i read book i can very well see why king himself said this is his favorite movies adapted his novels it is only one played out as he had written it i wouldnt compare this movie or book rita hayworth shawshank redemption because that would be unfair both they are both great but are both different green mile isnt movie about hope friendship as shawshank redemption was it is movie about miracle man people he affects but like shawshank redemption i give green mile 4 out 4 stars great story great cast great look,0.5451923076923078,0.26666666666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Warning to Teamsters: Bring 5 Hankies,"I went looking for an experience. Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed.I think Paul Edgecomb feels the same way.Tom Hanks has to be the epitome of a Hollywood living legend...and the guy's only in his 40s. He went from scraping his way through sophomoric slap like The 'Burbs, Turner & Hooch, and Bachelor Party to rise up in the 90s as our towering ""everyman."" Anyone who marvels in his ""simple guy in complicated circumstances"" roles such as Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan knows that he can deliver the goods...and an Oscar nomination (or win...or two...in aROW!!!) But Tom does something very interesting in The Green Mile. He lays back.The breakout performance in this film goes to Michael Clark Duncan (right now tied with Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment for my Best Supporting Actor vote). Crippled by his size, Mr. Duncan has a limit of the roles he can play. However, given the role of a child-like behemoth with Christ-like powers of healing, Duncan brings to the screen a performance that will transcend the Denzels and the Poitiers of the world.The Green Mile is Cell Block E in a Louisiana State Prison, death row. Paul Edgecomb run this wing with compassion, a startlingly different approach considering the legendary cruelty of southern prisons. He is surrounded by men in him employ who all share his philosophy that these men ultimately await the most devastating punishment. Why make their stay any more troubling.All save one: Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson), relative of the Governor and always ready to remind anyone who disagrees his HIS methods just who got him his job. Percy hates everything about The Green Mile; the prisoners, other guards, even a tiny, brave mouse who befriends one of the inmates (Michael Jeter). It isn't until another new inmate is processed, a man they call ""Wild Bill"", that Percy will meet his equal.So where is the common thread? What is a messianic character doing on death row? What role will Tom Hanks play in his redemption? And what's this ""curse"" thing I brought up in the beginning of this review?If I could tell you, you wouldn't slap the money down on the box office and find it for yourself. Let me just tell you that the final blessings bestowed by John Coffey (Duncan) could make optimists and pessimists alike find a common ground. How you perceive the final moments will be up to how you impart on yourself...and the world.If John Coffey guilty of his crime? Are the fates of the characters in this film deserved? Half and half. Evil is punished, bu t goodness must bare witness...and that has a price as well. Will Tom Hanks win another Academy Award? He shouldn't. Is this a good film? No. It's an incredible film.I still weep for Paul Edgecomb.",warning teamsters bring 5 hankies,i went looking experience something that would take me limits my own existence remind me that even darkest corner my own life there was hope i was reminded instead that along with triumph there must also be sacrifice part me died that theater but i walked out feeling renewed refreshed little cursed i think paul edgecomb feels same way tom hanks has be epitome hollywood living legend guys only his 40s he went scraping his way through sophomoric slap like burbs turner hooch bachelor party rise up 90s as our towering everyman anyone who marvels his simple guy complicated circumstances roles such as forrest gump saving private ryan knows that he can deliver goods oscar nomination or win or two arow but tom does something very interesting green mile he lays back breakout performance this film goes michael clark duncan right now tied with sixth senses haley joel osment my best supporting actor vote crippled by his size mr duncan has limit roles he can play however given role child like behemoth with christ like powers healing duncan brings screen performance that will transcend denzels poitiers world green mile is cell block e louisiana state prison death row paul edgecomb run this wing with compassion startlingly different approach considering legendary cruelty southern prisons he is surrounded by men him employ who all share his philosophy that these men ultimately await most devastating punishment why make their stay any more troubling all save one percy wetmore doug hutchinson relative governor always ready remind anyone who disagrees his his methods just who got him his job percy hates everything about green mile prisoners other guards even tiny brave mouse who befriends one inmates michael jeter it isnt until another new inmate is processed man they call wild bill that percy will meet his equal so where is common thread what is messianic character doing death row what role will tom hanks play his redemption whats this curse thing i brought up beginning this review if i could tell you you wouldnt slap money down box office find it yourself let me just tell you that final blessings bestowed by john coffey duncan could make optimists pessimists alike find common ground how you perceive final moments will be up how you impart yourself world if john coffey guilty his crime are fates characters this film deserved half half evil is punished bu t goodness must bare witness that has price as well will tom hanks win another academy award he shouldnt is this good film no its incredible film i still weep paul edgecomb,0.5318005280771239,0.0993763624082773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,It will stay with you for a long time.,"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget.

9.0,Supernatural prison drama is a feather in the cap for all involved,"An excellent prison epic which proves to be another splendid adaptation of a Stephen King novel – the bar has certainly been raised in the '90s for such adaptations after all the trash we got in the 1980s (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE anybody? Thought not). THE GREEN MILE is a splendid exploration of man's psychology, interactions with other men, and attitudes towards life and death emphasised by the uncomfortable Death Row setting. The characters in this film are vividly portrayed by many accomplished actors and actresses and the film works best as a slow-burning character drama packed with incident and occasionally fireworks. Of course being a King story there is a supernatural aspect to the tale (a prisoner is able to perform miracles) but this does not detract from the realism that the film offers in its story.The narrative is excellent, the film a visual triumph, the special effects work limited and therefore effective. Tom Hanks is great as Paul Edgecomb, the sweaty guard who comes to believe that one of his captives is an angel sent from heaven, but best of all is big Michael Clarke Duncan in an emotional performance that will have any decent viewer reaching for the handkerchiefs during the course of the movie. Also welcome are excellent supporting turns from David Morse, Michael Jeter, and Barry Pepper as fellow prison guards, James Cromwell as the sympathetic Warden and Harry Dean Stanton being weird as always. But the characters who really stick in the mind are the villains: Sam Rockwell as the sleazy, psychopathic inmate who causes no end of grief, and particularly Doug Hutchison as perverted guard Percy. Hutchison, most familiar from his encore performance as mutant killer Tooms in two X-FILES performances back when the show was good, is fantastic in his part and really loathsome – evil, mean and treacherous, but also cowardly, childish and unthinking - a wondrous turn.The film runs the gamut of emotions from A to Z. Love, fear, wonder, anger, everything in the human condition is explored here at one point or another. There are also a number of shockingly violent moments more powerful than any horror film – this is truly a prison movie for modern times. The worst scene has a prisoner frying on the electric chair but not dying. Ten minutes later he finally dies having emptied the building. A truly gruesome and disturbing moment. THE GREEN MILE is suspenseful, exciting, moving, and often profound – not to mention tear-jerking at key points. Thus it gets two thumbs up from this viewer. Watch out for Mr Jingles, the cutest and cleverest mouse ever seen in a movie (forget MOUSE HUNT for sure).",supernatural prison drama is feather cap all involved,excellent prison epic which proves be another splendid adaptation stephen king novel bar has certainly been raised 90s such adaptations after all trash we got 1980s maximum overdrive anybody thought not green mile is splendid exploration mans psychology interactions with other men attitudes towards life death emphasised by uncomfortable death row setting characters this film are vividly portrayed by many accomplished actors actresses film works best as slow burning character drama packed with incident occasionally fireworks course being king story there is supernatural aspect tale prisoner is able perform miracles but this does not detract realism that film offers its story narrative is excellent film visual triumph special effects work limited therefore effective tom hanks is great as paul edgecomb sweaty guard who comes believe that one his captives is angel sent heaven but best all is big michael clarke duncan emotional performance that will have any decent viewer reaching handkerchiefs during course movie also welcome are excellent supporting turns david morse michael jeter barry pepper as fellow prison guards james cromwell as sympathetic warden harry dean stanton being weird as always but characters who really stick mind are villains sam rockwell as sleazy psychopathic inmate who causes no end grief particularly doug hutchison as perverted guard percy hutchison most familiar his encore performance as mutant killer tooms two x files performances back when show was good is fantastic his part really loathsome evil mean treacherous but also cowardly childish unthinking wondrous turn film runs gamut emotions z love fear wonder anger everything human condition is explored here at one point or another there are also number shockingly violent moments more powerful than any horror film this is truly prison movie modern times worst scene has prisoner frying electric chair but not dying ten minutes later he finally dies having emptied building truly gruesome disturbing moment green mile is suspenseful exciting moving often profound not mention tear jerking at key points thus it gets two thumbs up this viewer watch out mr jingles cutest cleverest mouse ever seen movie forget mouse hunt sure,0.5760672198172196,0.14438131313131314,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.33}"

Well, like other death row movies, this one really touched me; ending with people lives, despite what they've done, is a sad subject for me. It must be the most terrifying feeling to know you're going to be killed in a matter of minutes. Preparing yourself for the electric chair might be even worse. As a thrilling Stephen King's story, ""The Green Mile"" brings an innovation-- this time, a character has a special gift of healing people, like a saint. It is indeed beautiful to see that big and apparently bad guy helping people as he can. Filmmakers are mean in this case-- they make you adore the character, just to kill him in the end and let you down.

10.0,"This movie blew me away, made me laugh, made me cry and me truly understand what the term 'sad' meant","Until I saw 'the Green Mile', I always thought that the 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump' were the two saddest movies that I ever saw, but this movie actually blew me away for good.'The Green Mile' tells the tale of a few prison officers whose life changes when a supposed rapist/murderer gets sent to the prison they are in. During this time, they come to realize that he has a mysterious power that can be used for good and that the man may truly be innocent of all accused crimes.I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'. The acting in the movie was just perfected on all corners. Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances. The actors playing Brutus, Hal, Del, Percy, Wharton all did an unbelievable job at portraying how realistic prison life may truly be.The story is so emotionally moving that it is impossible to not like and connect with. The characters presented in the movie are some of the finest movie characters that I've ever seen. This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life.The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film.The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out.**Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at. This movie made me sympathize with criminals more than any other movie.The last half hour made me truly cry all the way through it. The film doesn't attempt to out do itself and just masters it all. The ending to the movie just continued to make me cry.John Coffey's death is perhaps, the saddest death I've ever seen in movie history. It was such a moving scene that truly made me think twice about life.***Spoilers ended*** 'The Green Mile' is a superbly acted, directed, written movie with fascinating characters and a moving story that is sure to make everyone cry and be totally glad that they saw this movie.

8.0,A real tear-jerker,"Frank Darabont has given us some classic films like The Shawshank Redemption and whilst The Green Mile isn't as great, it's still an emotionally moving experience.The Green Mile shows the lives of several guards of Death Row and how the arrival of a prisoner named John Coffey, who has mysterious powers, affects them.Regarded as an absolute classic, The Green Mile is sure to tug on your heartstrings. Whilst the film may be three hours long, the emotional weight that this film brings is sure to make you cry. Frank Darabont's direction is great. You really feel transported to this place and Darabont conveys the cruel nature of the death penalty as honest as possible. The execution scenes involving the electric chair can be hard to watch especially one which becomes quite unsettling. The film does a great job making the audience care about the characters. Whilst the character of Del has done bad deeds, you still care about him after seeing his relationship with the guards and what eventually happens to him. My main issue with this film stems from its runtime. I think it's way too long and because of how long it was, I lost interest during some parts.The performances were stellar from everybody. Tom Hanks is great as usual and played Paul Edgecomb really well. However, the real star of this film is Michael Clarke Duncan. Despite his large nature, Duncan really manages to make Coffey seem as vulnerable and sympathetic as possible. He truly does a great job and is the trigger for tears streaming down many people's faces. Michael Jeter is terrific as Del and once again makes the audience sympathetic towards him. Both Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell did a great job as their characters and made us feel very hateful towards them.The Green Mile does drag with its three hour runtime but at the same time it's one of the most heartfelt and emotionally gripping films I've seen.

9.0,Frank Darabont's Green Mile goes the extra mile and delivers a great movie.,"I promise you that if you have any humanity in your soul, by the end of watching this movie. You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the ""Christ"" like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall: I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan.

9.0,Right next to Shawshank!!!,Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.,right next shawshank,frank darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by steven king novel sheer brilliance at its finest tom hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as corrections officer paul edgecombe who doesnt believe miracles until he sees one while tom others all shine their roles i think that michael clarke duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal john coffey convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer he is accused killing two little girls sentenced death with time however paul starts wonder if gentle hearted coffey really did commit murder movie has so many emotional moments that its hard not sympathize with characters deep emotional drama some them is mentally pressuring you become connected with these people again expertly accomplished by darabont who perfectly understands source material sticks close it like shawshank before it movie teaches us value human life how strong each one us can be this is achieved here similarly as again there is innocent man put prison but unlike andy john is touched by god he is magical being who calls forth sympathy by end audience is so ttached him that somewhat tragic ending is quite sad as his previous movie mr darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure stay your heart while steven king should be proud,0.63331964969896,0.20769704433497538,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,'what happens on the mile stays on the mile',This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.if you're thinking about viewing this title and you haven't seen it already i suggest you get the tissues ready.,what happens mile stays mile,this is easily one my favourite movies all time do not be put off watching this movie because its run time 3 hours because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting such huge success tom hanks is main character but i think that micheal clarke duncan really does steal spotlight away him stephen kings novel with same title is not as good as movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if youre fan tom hanks or stephen king i have never watched movie that has made me cry but i have say i was very close tears after undeniable ending script is just outstanding acting is spot storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before i dont think anyone will ever try copy it if youre thinking about viewing this title you havent seen it already i suggest you get tissues ready,0.5026041666666667,0.29375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"
