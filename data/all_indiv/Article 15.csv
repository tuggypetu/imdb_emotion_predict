9.0,Ayushmann and Anubhav will hit you hard!,"Anubhav Sinha is back with this crime drama, starring Ayushmann Khurrana in the lead. June is going superb for Hindi Film Indutsry. Kabir Singh is still running houseful. Now, this has come.Ayushmann is an IPS officer. He has been posted in a small village in UP. However, the next day itself, the police get two bodies of minor girls hanging on the tree. They were raped multiple times. The story gets its pace. And this crime drama continues with the subtext of casteism.Anubhav Sinha has tried to cover as many incidents of Dalits and other backward class people as possible which happened in our country in last few years. The motto is just to aware people on how this things work. From whatsapp messages to arrangement of strikes and rallys, this is how we are dividing us into groups. Also, this is 2019, not just 19! Justice should prevail for everyone without considering his/her caste. And there comes the title, Article 15, which gives each Indian basic rights.Ayushmann has given a splendid performances. He is too good for this role. Isha Talwar gives a needful support to him. Sayami Gupta shines in her effective role. Best of her was crying with Kumud Mishra in this film. Kumud Mishra is terrific. He has played this role like no one can. His slap scene is clap worthy. Manoj Pahwa again delivers wonderful performance. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub has a special appearance. The time he comes in the story, the film picks up very high. Fantabulous performance by him.Movie has no songs in it. Just a satire song at the starting. And a rap song at the end credits.Dialogues are absolutely fantastic. 'Power ki alag hi jaat hoti hai!' Hard hitting one liners will blow your mind. Entire speech by Zeeshan Ayyub in the jeep is perfectly written. Audience were clapping on the last line of that dialogue by him. While my most favorite one has been spoken by Ayushmann to his officer, that 'Jab Aag Lagi Hui Ho Aur Aap Neutral Rahen, To Iska Matlab Hai Ki Aap Unn Logon Ke Side Hain Jo Aag Laga Rahe Hain!'This is going to be a hit in Anubhav Sinha's kitty. While in first half, I was not sure whether this one is more good or that Mulk! But I got clear answer in second half. Film picks up very high. There is a greatest twist too. Public were stunned in that scene. Film is superbly written by Sinha and Gaurav Solanki.There is scene of bodies of rape victims hanging on the tree, and a kid passes by. It gave me goosebumps. Another one is a man coming out of the gutter. One at the interval point, nd one at the last line of a long dialogue by Mohd Zeeshan. Also, it is not a serious film. This year's the most comic scene is in this one. Ayushmann discussing castes with his team.Overall, Article 15 a is very much needful film in this time. It may not be linked with metro cities, but India is a nation of villages and small towns. Kudos to Anubhav Sinha and team for choosing this subject. Police were there in the theater for safety purpose. But there is nothing wrong in the film for any community or caste. This film will run with mouth publicity. So go and watch this entertaining crime drama. And ask yourself a question that Kaun Hain Aap! Bahujan, Harijan.. Ke Jan Gan Man me aate sirf Jan. #FarqAayega",ayushmann anubhav will hit you hard,anubhav sinha is back with this crime drama starring ayushmann khurrana lead june is going superb hindi film indutsry kabir singh is still running houseful now this has come ayushmann is ips officer he has been posted small village up however next day itself police get two bodies minor girls hanging tree they were raped multiple times story gets its pace this crime drama continues with subtext casteism anubhav sinha has tried cover as many incidents dalits other backward class people as possible which happened our country last few years motto is just aware people how this things work whatsapp messages arrangement strikes rallys this is how we are dividing us into groups also this is 2019 not just 19 justice should prevail everyone without considering his her caste there comes title article 15 which gives each indian basic rights ayushmann has given splendid performances he is too good this role isha talwar gives needful support him sayami gupta shines her effective role best her was crying with kumud mishra this film kumud mishra is terrific he has played this role like no one can his slap scene is clap worthy manoj pahwa again delivers wonderful performance mohd zeeshan ayyub has special appearance time he comes story film picks up very high fantabulous performance by him movie has no songs it just satire song at starting rap song at end credits dialogues are absolutely fantastic power ki alag hi jaat hoti hai hard hitting one liners will blow your mind entire speech by zeeshan ayyub jeep is perfectly written audience were clapping last line that dialogue by him while my most favorite one has been spoken by ayushmann his officer that jab aag lagi hui ho aur aap neutral rahen iska matlab hai ki aap unn logon ke side hain jo aag laga rahe hain this is going be hit anubhav sinhas kitty while first half i was not sure whether this one is more good or that mulk but i got clear answer second half film picks up very high there is greatest twist too public were stunned that scene film is superbly written by sinha gaurav solanki there is scene bodies rape victims hanging tree kid passes by it gave me goosebumps another one is man coming out gutter one at interval point nd one at last line long dialogue by mohd zeeshan also it is not serious film this years most comic scene is this one ayushmann discussing castes with his team overall article 15 is very much needful film this time it may not be linked with metro cities but india is nation villages small towns kudos anubhav sinha team choosing this subject police were there theater safety purpose but there is nothing wrong film any community or caste this film will run with mouth publicity so go watch this entertaining crime drama ask yourself question that kaun hain aap bahujan harijan ke jan gan man me aate sirf jan,0.49816940836940826,0.21196623376623375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,Must watch movie for Every indian,"Anubhav Sinha's 'Article 15' is designed like a crime thriller. And what works for the film is that it's thought provoking, hard hitting while unflinchingly bringing to light burning social issues.The film is heavy on atmospherics, with the top notch cinematography (Ewan Mulligan) and background score adding to the mood. The feel is grim, gritty and grey often bringing a chill to the bone with palpable tension in the air. The images - some provocative and uncomfortable stand out, like the one where a man goes deep into a drain to unclog it and emerges soaked in the filth or the top shot of a group of policemen conducting a search in a swamp with their torchlights. The dialogues leave an impact. And the director brings out subtle nuances through his characters and setting which add to the essence of the narrative. The film's storyline, interspersed with powerful and poignant moments leaves you with goose-bumps. The narrative definitely keeps you on the edge, but there are times when it feels a tad overstuffed as the layers, political intricacies and a multitude of characters seep in. And at times the pace dips.But certainly, the performances by an ace set of actors is one of the high points of the film. Ayushmann Khurana has you hooked instantly, belting out a riveting performance as the sincere, determined police officer. It's an intense, gripping act as he gets under the skin of his character. Other noteworthy scene stealers include actors Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, in a short but impactful role as Nishad.'Article 15' is not a light watch, but it is definitely relevant, compelling and a film that will spark conversation.",must watch movie every indian,anubhav sinhas article 15 is designed like crime thriller what works film is that its thought provoking hard hitting while unflinchingly bringing light burning social issues film is heavy atmospherics with top notch cinematography ewan mulligan background score adding mood feel is grim gritty grey often bringing chill bone with palpable tension air images some provocative uncomfortable stand out like one where man goes deep into drain unclog it emerges soaked filth or top shot group policemen conducting search swamp with their torchlights dialogues leave impact director brings out subtle nuances through his characters setting which add essence narrative films storyline interspersed with powerful poignant moments leaves you with goose bumps narrative definitely keeps you edge but there are times when it feels tad overstuffed as layers political intricacies multitude characters seep at times pace dips but certainly performances by ace set actors is one high points film ayushmann khurana has you hooked instantly belting out riveting performance as sincere determined police officer its intense gripping act as he gets under skin his character other noteworthy scene stealers include actors manoj pahwa kumud mishra mohammed zeeshan ayub short but impactful role as nishad article 15 is not light watch but it is definitely relevant compelling film that will spark conversation,0.5969458128078817,0.06233169129720855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
7.0,LOUDEST AND BRAVEST CINEMATIC SHOUT BREAKS THE SILENCE ON CAST ISSUES,"ARTICLE 15 REVIEW :-It's been almost 70 years that India accepted the Constitution and all the articles of it but do we really see Right to Equality lense clear? Especially in rural areas? NO. Article 15 was created by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on one of the Most important and sensitive issue of our traditional society, giving everyone the Right to Equality regardless of what cast, state or religion person it is. Rarely any Filmmaker tried to focus on this subject, don't know why, may be because of fear of controversies or some other threats. Just forget it, we can't say it anymore as Article 15 has just become the Pioneer Film on that subject.The Plot of Article 15 is realistic as we see 2 Lower Cast underage girls are raped & hanged for the sake of 3 rupees and the 3rd girl is missing. An honest IPS officer Ayan (Ayushmann Khurana) gets his 1st posting in Lalgaon, exactly a day after the Girls are missing. He tries to find the rapist and murderers but the conflicts doesn't let him catch them that easily. Later on predictable things like Political pressure, resistance in investigation, suspension and ofcourse conspiracy takes over the scenes. It is very important to have diffrent things in screenplay and quality in execution when it comes to a predictable plot where we already know that Protagonist gonna win at the end, and fortunately that something different and Quality is Found here. Anubhav Sinha had tried gutsy script before, he might have missed that quality with Mulk but he improvised himself as a Storyteller this time. Watch out for the Realistic execution, Ayan's intelligent explaination against CBI officer and the Ending scene when the Truck passes and that Frame, that Voice note is used with Excellent direction skill. Without any doubt Mr. Anubhav Sinha, Article 15 is your Best Work till date.Talking about Ayushmann Khurana, this guy is in different league altogether now. The Kind of films he chose in last couple of years has put him in different league and Article 15 adds another good work in his pocket. Manoj Pahwa and Kumud Mishra have shined equally good in the film. Sayani Gupta and Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub were there for little time yet both of them managed to leave an impact. The screenplay has something new to offer and the runtime never make it look boring. Although couple of moments looked unnecessary for this hard-hitting narrative, ot is still okay, those are forgiven for that tight convincing climax. Let's keep minuses aside, because we have majority of plus points such as Strong Script, Brilliant Performance, Engaging Narrative, Excellent Direction and last but not the least, That Socially Important Content.As a whole, Article 15 breaks the silence on Very Sensitive issue in Loudest and Bravest Cinematic Shout. At one moment it looks like Bimal Roy kind of cinema but Bimal Roy was more focused towards connecting Human emotions rather than using Law books. Although Anubhav Sinha made it more regional, more Filmy and used Constitution at his Level Best, the perspective of both of the cinematic minds remains same. Article 15 will go down in Memory lane as One of those Socially Important films which we don't see oftenly whereas it stands as one of the finest made in 2019 so far. If you are that Quality Cinema lover who is always ready to watch Content Driven Film with less or no Entertaining elements then you can't really afford to miss Article 15.RATING- 7/10*",loudest bravest cinematic shout breaks silence cast issues,article 15 review its been almost 70 years that india accepted constitution all articles it but do we really see right equality lense clear especially rural areas no article 15 was created by dr babasaheb ambedkar one most important sensitive issue our traditional society giving everyone right equality regardless what cast state or religion person it is rarely any filmmaker tried focus this subject dont know why may be because fear controversies or some other threats just forget it we cant say it anymore as article 15 has just become pioneer film that subject plot article 15 is realistic as we see 2 lower cast underage girls are raped hanged sake 3 rupees 3rd girl is missing honest ips officer ayan ayushmann khurana gets his 1st posting lalgaon exactly day after girls are missing he tries find rapist murderers but conflicts doesnt let him catch them that easily later predictable things like political pressure resistance investigation suspension ofcourse conspiracy takes over scenes it is very important have diffrent things screenplay quality execution when it comes predictable plot where we already know that protagonist gonna win at end fortunately that something different quality is found here anubhav sinha had tried gutsy script before he might have missed that quality with mulk but he improvised himself as storyteller this time watch out realistic execution ayans intelligent explaination against cbi officer ending scene when truck passes that frame that voice note is used with excellent direction skill without any doubt mr anubhav sinha article 15 is your best work till date talking about ayushmann khurana this guy is different league altogether now kind films he chose last couple years has put him different league article 15 adds another good work his pocket manoj pahwa kumud mishra have shined equally good film sayani gupta mohammad zeeshan ayyub were there little time yet both them managed leave impact screenplay has something new offer runtime never make it look boring although couple moments looked unnecessary this hard hitting narrative ot is still okay those are forgiven that tight convincing climax lets keep minuses aside because we have majority plus points such as strong script brilliant performance engaging narrative excellent direction last but not least that socially important content as whole article 15 breaks silence very sensitive issue loudest bravest cinematic shout at one moment it looks like bimal roy kind cinema but bimal roy was more focused towards connecting human emotions rather than using law books although anubhav sinha made it more regional more filmy used constitution at his level best perspective both cinematic minds remains same article 15 will go down memory lane as one those socially important films which we dont see oftenly whereas it stands as one finest made 2019 so far if you are that quality cinema lover who is always ready watch content driven film with less or no entertaining elements then you cant really afford miss article 15 rating 7 10,0.516332107770464,0.20049541402281126,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"
7.0,Powerful film that raises some important issues related to complex caste system of our Country.,"Ayyushman Khuranna (Ayan)One of the burning issues of the country is the caste system.Despite relevant laws and provisions, one can't deny that the discrimination of various communities is there in our Country.The political class takes advantage of these conflicts and it further creates a divide. Very few films in Bollywood have plots that actually revolves around caste, shockingly.ARTICLE 15 is the story of a good cop trying to solve a caste-related crime.Ayan Ranjan (Ayushmann Khurrana) is an IPS officer from Delhi who has been transferred to a village named Lalgaon in Uttar Pradesh as punishment posting.As soon as he joins duty, he comes to know about a case involving three missing girls from the Dalit community in the village.the missing girls - Shalu and Mamta - is found hanging on a tree. The third girl, Pooja, is missing.it ws clear that Shalu and Mamta had been repeatedly gang raped and then hung on the tree. Ayan attempts to solve the case and find Pooja....What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story is very hard-hitting and deserves to be told. It is loosely inspired by events like the Badaun rape case and Una flogging incident.screenplay is engaging and keeps one hooked from start to finish.1 half is good & In the second hour however, the film gets quite complicated...The climax is quite impressive and the film ends on a fantastic note.ARTICLE 15 is a hard-hitting film that raises some important issues related to complex caste system of our Country.'Article 15' is not a light watch, but it is definitely relevant, powerful.",powerful film that raises some important issues related complex caste system our country,ayyushman khuranna ayan one burning issues country is caste system despite relevant laws provisions one cant deny that discrimination various communities is there our country political class takes advantage these conflicts it further creates divide very few films bollywood have plots that actually revolves around caste shockingly article 15 is story good cop trying solve caste related crime ayan ranjan ayushmann khurrana is ips officer delhi who has been transferred village named lalgaon uttar pradesh as punishment posting as soon as he joins duty he comes know about case involving three missing girls dalit community village missing girls shalu mamta is found hanging tree third girl pooja is missing it ws clear that shalu mamta had been repeatedly gang raped then hung tree ayan attempts solve case find pooja what happens next forms rest film story is very hard hitting deserves be told it is loosely inspired by events like badaun rape case una flogging incident screenplay is engaging keeps one hooked start finish 1 half is good second hour however film gets quite complicated climax is quite impressive film ends fantastic note article 15 is hard hitting film that raises some important issues related complex caste system our country article 15 is not light watch but it is definitely relevant powerful,0.5098589743589742,0.04073076923076923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Don't Miss Article 15 At Any Cost !!! Hats Off To Ayushmann Khurrana And Anubhav Sinha,"Article 15 as formed by the Indian Constitution of India prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Unfortunately, this is not case on the records in the real India.Article 15 tells the story of IPS officer, Ayan Ranjan (played by Ayushmann Khurrana), who has been posted in a small village, Laal Gaon, Uttar Pradesh. The day he takes up duty, he is welcomed with the murder case of three girls which leads to the ""real"" issues of the caste system which is very much prevalent in the ""real"" India.Last year Anubhav Sinha proved that he is more than just making candyfloss film,Tum Bin, or forgettable Cash with Mulk. This year, he goes one step ahead with Article 15 which is based on true life event of the 2014 Badaun gang rape case where two Dalit girls were gang raped continuously for two days, murdered and hung from a tree. There are no songs in this 2 hours 10 minutes film as Anubhav Sinha takes the audience right into the the truth which is harsh but was never elaborated. There are couple of questions raised by Ayushmann Khurrana to his peers relating to the different levels of caste and to his dismay, he gets the answer that there are different levels of caste and even sub-caste below. The scene is funny yet exposes the harsh truth existing in the few parts of rural India. Two scenes stands out - a lower caste worker coming out of a pit full of waste, his face smeared with sludge and goes back again to complete manual removal of untreated human excreta. The second scene is where a factory owner proudly admits to hitting the three girls who demanded a pay-hike of just Rs 3 and the reason he gives for beating these girls ""Unko Aukat Unki Dikhane ke Liye""Article 15 details out the struggles and challenges faced by the cops mentally and physically. The crime-drama boast off some strong technical support. I should start with an outstanding editing work. The background score is haunting and yet mesmerizing. The cinematography is brilliant, portraying a real-life crime with aplomb. Screenplay is fantastic, though it becomes little sluggish towards the second half.Coming to the performances, it is Ayushmann Khurrana who will make you believe with enduring transformation from uninformed IPS officer into a angry man who stands for the righteous act. Ayushmann Khurrana lives and breathes the character of Ayan Ranjan and is complimented by Kumd Mishra, Manoj Pahwa, Sayani Gupta and the dependable Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub (who shines in a small role).Article 15 is not easy watch but it will expose the harsh reality of what happened on that fateful night and it will definitely make you angry. Go for it ...MIND-BLOWING 4/5",dont miss article 15 at any cost hats off ayushmann khurrana anubhav sinha,article 15 as formed by indian constitution india prohibits discrimination grounds religion race caste sex or place birth unfortunately this is not case records real india article 15 tells story ips officer ayan ranjan played by ayushmann khurrana who has been posted small village laal gaon uttar pradesh day he takes up duty he is welcomed with murder case three girls which leads real issues caste system which is very much prevalent real india last year anubhav sinha proved that he is more than just making candyfloss film tum bin or forgettable cash with mulk this year he goes one step ahead with article 15 which is based true life event 2014 badaun gang rape case where two dalit girls were gang raped continuously two days murdered hung tree there are no songs this 2 hours 10 minutes film as anubhav sinha takes audience right into truth which is harsh but was never elaborated there are couple questions raised by ayushmann khurrana his peers relating different levels caste his dismay he gets answer that there are different levels caste even sub caste below scene is funny yet exposes harsh truth existing few parts rural india two scenes stands out lower caste worker coming out pit full waste his face smeared with sludge goes back again complete manual removal untreated human excreta second scene is where factory owner proudly admits hitting three girls who demanded pay hike just rs 3 reason he gives beating these girls unko aukat unki dikhane ke liye article 15 details out struggles challenges faced by cops mentally physically crime drama boast off some strong technical support i should start with outstanding editing work background score is haunting yet mesmerizing cinematography is brilliant portraying real life crime with aplomb screenplay is fantastic though it becomes little sluggish towards second half coming performances it is ayushmann khurrana who will make you believe with enduring transformation uninformed ips officer into angry man who stands righteous act ayushmann khurrana lives breathes character ayan ranjan is complimented by kumd mishra manoj pahwa sayani gupta dependable mohammed zeeshan ayyub who shines small role article 15 is not easy watch but it will expose harsh reality what happened that fateful night it will definitely make you angry go it mind blowing 4 5,0.48603741496598624,0.051386054421768704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9.0,A reality check for India.,"Anubhav Sinha's Article 15 is a much needed film of our time. It faithfully conveys a huge issue in our country in the best way possible.Anubhav Sinha was a director who I didn't consider great after viewing Ra.One. Upon hearing how good Mulk was, it seemed the director was on his resurgence. After watching Article 15, there is no doubt that he's back in full form. Sinha's direction is nothing but outstanding. He had a clear vision on how this film needed to be created. The screenplay written by Anubhav Sinha and Gaurav Solanki has many powerful dialogues all of which bring a sense of urgency to the relevant topic.Ayushmann Khurrana provides his best performance yet and continues his trend of choosing unconventional scripts. His character represents the many people who are oblivious to what's happening and realising how messed up the system actually is. Kumud Mishra and Manoj Pahwa are also excellent in their roles.The cinematography by Ewan Mulligan really stood out to me. The constant use of darkness and dark colours presented such a disturbing and intense atmosphere that felt very fitting to the tone of the movie. The cinematography in this film is one of the best this year. The editing was surprising terrific. At no point did I feel the film was slowing down. The pacing was constant and well structured which aided the overall theme of the film.Article 15 is one of the best films to come out this year. Not just because of how it perfectly presents all the relevant issues relating to the Caste System but also by how well made it is.There are scenes in the movie which can be very difficult to watch but those scenes show how reality is.

10.0,A MUST WATCH,"Article 15, as the name suggests is based on age old caste based discrimination that exists in our society. Ayushman Khuranna is an IPS officer who gets his first posting in the village of Lalgaon,UP. Only a couple of days before the date of joining, a gangrape followed by murder takes place where the two vicitms turn out to be of the lower caste. The film majorly highlights the plight of the lower caste people who live in villages like Lalgaon, where they face a prejudice by not only the upper caste but by the state institutions also.Anubhav Sinha has created a masterpiece, the film gives a feeling of a documentary and it feels nothing like a conventional Bollywood film based out of a small village of UP. Strangely, the film has no song nor does it have any dance sequence( which is a good thing). The film has used good humour which is evident from the fact that the viewers can be seen giggling at caste based jokes which goes on to show that the director has pulled the humour part beautifully without hurting the sentiments of the general public. In my opinion, Ayushman deserves a national award for this film since he has played his part beautifully. Thus, the viewers can expect themselves to be glued to their seats for the most part and can also expect a nail biting end.",must watch,article 15 as name suggests is based age old caste based discrimination that exists our society ayushman khuranna is ips officer who gets his first posting village lalgaon up only couple days before date joining gangrape followed by murder takes place where two vicitms turn out be lower caste film majorly highlights plight lower caste people who live villages like lalgaon where they face prejudice by not only upper caste but by state institutions also anubhav sinha has created masterpiece film gives feeling documentary it feels nothing like conventional bollywood film based out small village up strangely film has no song nor does it have any dance sequence which is good thing film has used good humour which is evident fact that viewers can be seen giggling at caste based jokes which goes show that director has pulled humour part beautifully without hurting sentiments general public my opinion ayushman deserves national award this film since he has played his part beautifully thus viewers can expect themselves be glued their seats most part can also expect nail biting end,0.4714285714285714,0.21084244702665755,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.23}"
