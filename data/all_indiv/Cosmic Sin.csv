3,It was simply awful,"Bruce Willis stopped telegraphing his acting for this film. He just didn't act at all. I mean, it looked like he was between high and mentally disabled. I worry about the dude. Then Frank Grillo, happenstance makes that I have seen three of his films this week, I was just saying how I wish he would get a break. Not for this film! Note that he is billed first, above Willis, and his role is at most 15 minutes from the film anyway.But what makes this film shine like a black hole is the story. It felt more than devoid of passion, like a spreadsheet that sucks one's soul away in the accounting department on a hot day after the air conditioning died. I mean, if a kid would have written it, it at least would have been fun. If someone was incompetent it would have felt like trying to send some kind of message, however badly. But no, it ... just made no sense, like someone hated writing for this film.Bottom line: it is so bad you can't even enjoy it wasted. It's a non-movie. It's like what's on the other side of the event horizon of TV static.",it was simply awful,bruce willis stopped telegraphing his acting this film he just didnt act at all i mean it looked like he was between high mentally disabled i worry about dude then frank grillo happenstance makes that i have seen three his films this week i was just saying how i wish he would get break not this film note that he is billed first above willis his role is at most 15 minutes film anyway but what makes this film shine like black hole is story it felt more than devoid passion like spreadsheet that sucks ones soul away accounting department hot day after air conditioning died i mean if kid would have written it it at least would have been fun if someone was incompetent it would have felt like trying send some kind message however badly but no it just made no sense like someone hated writing this film bottom line it is so bad you cant even enjoy it wasted its non movie its like whats other side event horizon tv static,0.4842666666666666,-0.08826666666666666,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"

2,"Bruce, what are you doing....","First,I adore sci-fi. And am willing to overlook A LOT. But this piece of.... What the heck where they thinking. The writing and scenes/environment are so sooo bad its just too distracting. I still (skipped after a point) to the end but this is one of the worst sci-fi movies I have EVER seen. This is supposed to be happening in 2500s . And sci-fi is usually written by guys/gals who like the genre right? So you'd assume they're not dumb, this is genre for tech/gadget/future visions loving people/thinkers. First of all, its all happening in a city like today. Petrol cars, grunge plaid shirts wearing, beer drinking dudes everywhere and every single piece of the environment they are in is from like 2005. NOTHING is advanced anywhere except a CGI spaceship here and there. Everyone still uses regular guns with bullets propelled by gun powder and use petrol. They still use incandecent lightbulbs. Even we in Europe dont use them anymore, they dont even sell them anymore by law. TODAY.Or landing with a spaceship on a foreign planet and then they pitch up A TENT. A TENT!!! In 2500s and not a fancy,sci-fi redesigned/decorated for the movie to look special, hi-tech tent. Nah-ha. An obviously locally bought, regular, simple tent with old regular folding chairs and tables. They didnt even try to make anything look advanced.Also everything from clothing,storage boxes, various military tools, every piece of housing is from 2000s. You might think (for a milisecond), how about Firefly, combo of Wild West and space. Not even close,that beautiful show was an intelligent combination,smartly done,with foundations explaining everything. Insulting to even be considered in regards to this disaster.The story. Lets not even get there. The (IMO) very interesting plot summary that draws your interest to watch it is 100% misleading. Its so boring and slow it stops drawing your interest after 15 minutes. In then end its just confusing and silly. Never mind again, that so so many things just dont make sense or are ignored. I do not know how such a thing can get approved. It is so bad. And Bruce. What the heck. De Niro at least sold his soul for comedies that work in 50%. But Bruce lately... this movie isnt worth the few cents of material that the medium it is recorded on.

3,"I think they spent all the budget on Bruce Willis and had nothing left for writing, props, actors and more.","I noticed that ""Cosmic Sin"" recently made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list and has a pitiful score of only 2.5! So, not only is it on the list...but it is way up the list at #39!When I first started watching this sci-fi film, I could IMMEDIATELY see why the film is so hated. It's a film set in the 26th century and at this time, there is space travel and life on many planets and moons. So, why do you see folks driving pickup trucks that look like they are from 2021? Why are the clothes pretty much what you'd see today and why are most of the weapons not much more effective or different than today's?! It honestly looks like they must have spend all their budget on securing Bruce Willis' talents and had nothing left to make it look like a futuristic story. Now I don't think you need expensive props to make a good film...but this is ridiculous and really takes you out of the story.The story begins with some form of life being discovered on some new planet. It seems that up until this time, humans have never made first contact with any intelligent species...even with humans inhabiting many new worlds. As you'd expect, this new form of sentient life is not sweet and friendly....as who would want to see a film like that?! And, it turns out that it is so deadly that in the entire galaxy (numbering many, many, many billions) the only guy that can stop the creatures is a war criminal, James Ford (Willis)!I have seen much worse films that never made it to the IMDB list...mostly because they are older, cheaper and more obscure. In other words, the Bottom 100 is very heavily skewed to new films...so although the film is bad, it's not the 39th worst film ever made! I think it's just that a lot of folks get Netflix and had a chance to see it...whereas far less folks have seen the films of Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ray Dennis Steckler and William Grefe...all filmmakers who REALLY knew how to make terrible films...REALLY terrible films!So is there anything good about this movie? Some of the CGI space scenes are very nice and would probably look great on the big screen (though I assume this film, when it came out, only went straight to Netflix and Amazon Prime). Otherwise, the story is not especially interesting, the dialog often pretty bad and the acting not especially good. It is not completely awful...just mostly awful. And, unfortunately not so bad that it's fun to watch in order to make fun of the film.By the way, nearly all the reviews for this are extremely negative. With this and a score of 2.5, I am amazed to find some folks giving it 10s! A few admit that it's bad but are just trolling or love it because it's so bad. A few, however, are VERY short reviews that talk about how brilliant it is...a sure sign normally of fake reviews done by folks connected with the film...which is pretty shameful.",i think they spent all budget bruce willis had nothing left writing props actors more,i noticed that cosmic sin recently made it imdbs infamous bottom 100 list has pitiful score only 2 5 so not only is it list but it is way up list at when i first started watching this sci fi film i could immediately see why film is so hated its film set 26th century at this time there is space travel life many planets moons so why do you see folks driving pickup trucks that look like they are 2021 why are clothes pretty much what youd see today why are most weapons not much more effective or different than todays it honestly looks like they must have spend all their budget securing bruce willis talents had nothing left make it look like futuristic story now i dont think you need expensive props make good film but this is ridiculous really takes you out story story begins with some form life being discovered some new planet it seems that up until this time humans have never made first contact with any intelligent species even with humans inhabiting many new worlds as youd expect this new form sentient life is not sweet friendly as who would want see film like that it turns out that it is so deadly that entire galaxy numbering many many many billions only guy that can stop creatures is war criminal james ford willis i have seen much worse films that never made it imdb list mostly because they are older cheaper more obscure other words bottom 100 is very heavily skewed new films so although film is bad its not 39th worst film ever made i think its just that lot folks get netflix had chance see it whereas far less folks have seen films ed wood al adamson ray dennis steckler william grefe all filmmakers who really knew how make terrible films really terrible films so is there anything good about this movie some cgi space scenes are very nice would probably look great big screen though i assume this film when it came out only went straight netflix amazon prime otherwise story is not especially interesting dialog often pretty bad acting not especially good it is not completely awful just mostly awful unfortunately not so bad that its fun watch order make fun film by way nearly all reviews this are extremely negative with this score 2 5 i am amazed find some folks giving it 10s few admit that its bad but are just trolling or love it because its so bad few however are very short reviews that talk about how brilliant it is sure sign normally fake reviews done by folks connected with film which is pretty shameful,0.5746464646464645,0.04502685078634447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.25}"
3,cinematic sin,"Some 500 years in the future, mankind has spread into the cosmos. On a faraway planet, humans have encountered First Contact. An alien presence infects people and turns them into marauding zombies. James Ford (Bruce Willis) is a disgraced military leader arguing for the doomsday Q-bomb. Engineer Fiona Ardene (Adelaide Kane) is called in to prep the device. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) leads the soldiers while Dr. Lea Goss (Perrey Reeves) is awed by the aliens.First thing first, this movie opens with an info-dump in text form. It's a lot of gobbledygook. Someone should try to read it again. Then there is the awkward mix of present-day technology with the future tech. There is no logical reason for it. It's an obviously sign of bad budgeting and unimaginative set design. When that happens, they are better off putting the movie in a smaller space and as much future tech onto the screen. At least, put some effort in giving the characters some future-cars. Its greater sin is that it's boring. I think I must have spaced out. One moment, they're fighting zombies in the warehouse and the next, they're space-diving to another planet. It's a forgettable muddle.",cinematic sin,some 500 years future mankind has spread into cosmos faraway planet humans have encountered first contact alien presence infects people turns them into marauding zombies james ford bruce willis is disgraced military leader arguing doomsday q bomb engineer fiona ardene adelaide kane is called prep device general ryle frank grillo leads soldiers while dr lea goss perrey reeves is awed by aliens first thing first this movie opens with info dump text form its lot gobbledygook someone should try read it again then there is awkward mix present day technology with future tech there is no logical reason it its obviously sign bad budgeting unimaginative set design when that happens they are better off putting movie smaller space as much future tech onto screen at least put some effort giving characters some future cars its greater sin is that its boring i think i must have spaced out one moment theyre fighting zombies warehouse next theyre space diving another planet its forgettable muddle,0.3855072463768116,-0.07717391304347826,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.44}"

3,What a disappointment this was...,"Granted, I have to admit that I was lured in to watching the 2021 movie ""Cosmic Sin"" given the movie's cover/poster and the fact that the movie was starring Bruce Willis, Frank Grillo and Costas Mandylor.And let me just come right out and say that writers Edward Drake and Corey Large failed to deliver a wholesome movie here with ""Cosmic Sin"". While I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, then I must say that all throughout the course of the entire movie I was sitting with an overwhelming sense of pointlessness. I just couldn't find anything worthwhile in the storyline, and everything seemed just bland and without a cause.It was so difficult to indulge myself into the storyline because it was so linear and anything but interesting and exciting. So the end result that is ""Cosmic Sin"" from director Edward Drake was just a very forgettable and rather mundane movie. The storyline was just so amazingly generic and linear that you could have left the movie for a longer period of time, and returned only to be right up to speed with the storyline.Now, I am sure that die-hard fans - pardon the pun - of Bruce Willis or Frank Grillo might actually find some kind of odd enjoyment here in the movie. I, however, didn't. So this movie was a swing and a miss.I must admit that it felt that Bruce Willis wasn't really committed to this movie project, and his performance felt half-hearted, as if he was running on auto-pilot. And Frank Grillo just wasn't given enough on-screen time to manage to do much of anything to salvage the movie.The characters in the movie were every bit as bland and pointless as the storyline. So you don't really connect with any of them, nor do you form any kind of attachments to any of them. So whether they live or die, it hardly matters.Now, what did work for ""Cosmic Sin"" was the visuals. They had some nice enough suits for the soldiers of the Alliance. And the weapon effects were quite good. The aliens, however, they just felt like something out of a B movie. So that was disappointing to say the least.All in all, ""Cosmic Sin"" was exactly what the movie title says; a cosmic sin. This movie came and went without leaving much of any blast mark or memorable impression. My rating of ""Cosmic Sin"" lands on a mere three out of ten stars.",what disappointment this was,granted i have admit that i was lured watching 2021 movie cosmic sin given movies cover poster fact that movie was starring bruce willis frank grillo costas mandylor let me just come right out say that writers edward drake corey large failed deliver wholesome movie here with cosmic sin while i managed sit through entire ordeal then i must say that all throughout course entire movie i was sitting with overwhelming sense pointlessness i just couldnt find anything worthwhile storyline everything seemed just bland without cause it was so difficult indulge myself into storyline because it was so linear anything but interesting exciting so end result that is cosmic sin director edward drake was just very forgettable rather mundane movie storyline was just so amazingly generic linear that you could have left movie longer period time returned only be right up speed with storyline now i am sure that die hard fans pardon pun bruce willis or frank grillo might actually find some kind odd enjoyment here movie i however didnt so this movie was swing miss i must admit that it felt that bruce willis wasnt really committed this movie project his performance felt half hearted as if he was running auto pilot frank grillo just wasnt given enough screen time manage do much anything salvage movie characters movie were every bit as bland pointless as storyline so you dont really connect with any them nor do you form any kind attachments any them so whether they live or die it hardly matters now what did work cosmic sin was visuals they had some nice enough suits soldiers alliance weapon effects were quite good aliens however they just felt like something out b movie so that was disappointing say least all all cosmic sin was exactly what movie title says cosmic sin this movie came went without leaving much any blast mark or memorable impression my rating cosmic sin lands mere three out ten stars,0.5179586563307492,0.04547468035840129,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.44}"

3,Low ratings are in this case completely justified.,"Bruce Willis is becoming the new Nicholas Cage. It looks like he's just accepting any role without reading the script, something Nicholas Cage seems to do as well. Not that I think Bruce Willis is a great actor, he just played in some good movies, but he's not a great actor, and lately he's been actually really bad. It's going downhill for Bruce Willis.

1,Cosmic waste of time.,"Bruce Willis stopped caring ages ago, he's here to collect a cheque while doing the least amount of work possible. He's acting like he doesn't care, and it shows, from his very first scene he looks bored and that never changes. The problem with Bruce's approach of not caring is this; if he doesn't care, why should we?Frank Grillo's always going to be a B-grade actor because he takes what he gets. I can imagine he turns down proper dumpster fire scripts on occasion, but for the most part I'd say he's in it for the cash. Although, he's hardly in this film.With those two being the main characters, I immediately knew it wasn't going to be a good movie. The story line is boring & nonsensical, the actors are bad to middling at best. The writer can't even properly weave exposition into natural conversations or set pieces. Here's an example:The scene opens with 'Guy 1' walking by someone smoking.Guy 1: No smoking behind the wire, specialist!Guy2: Yes, sir.Guy 1: I don't give a damn if your uncle is our boss or not.LMAO! The writer couldn't even be bothered to come up with a decent way to let us know this character (in my example 'Guy 2') was the nephew of their boss. Who wrote this dialogue?! This happens numerous times, why is it so bad?! Worst of all, Guy 2 later confronts his uncle to ask if he can join the war, he even goes on to say, ""you would send them off to war, but you wouldn't send your own family?"" lol why the heck didn't you leave it there? There was no need for the initial exposition if you were going to drop it in a scene later. OMG!Okay, there are plenty of instances of that happening, so I won't harp on it. Let's get back to Bruce. So, at the (roughly) 25-minute mark there's a scene between the main-ish characters - Willis, Grillo and a third person are all there. Each one is playing a high ranking official, but Bruce Willis is clearly not in that scene, he doesn't look like he's responding to them, he nods in their general direction as if he's in the room with them, but you can clearly see he's not there with them, they do no wide-angle shots... until they do! And when they do, it's a stand-in for Bruce LMAO it's clearly not him. It's so obvious! Their heads look very different! This happens several times throughout the movie, imagine paying an actor to act and they just go, ""Nope! But he looks like me, so...."" LMAO!Ladies & gents I could go on for a day and a half but let me stop here and say this... This movie sucks! any chance it had at being a movie (not even a good one, just 'a movie') was killed when Bruce Willis was brought on. I recommend you avoid. Don't waste your time. End of story.",cosmic waste time,bruce willis stopped caring ages ago hes here collect cheque while doing least amount work possible hes acting like he doesnt care it shows his very first scene he looks bored that never changes problem with bruces approach not caring is this if he doesnt care why should we frank grillos always going be b grade actor because he takes what he gets i can imagine he turns down proper dumpster fire scripts occasion but most part id say hes it cash although hes hardly this film with those two being main characters i immediately knew it wasnt going be good movie story line is boring nonsensical actors are bad middling at best writer cant even properly weave exposition into natural conversations or set pieces heres example scene opens with guy 1 walking by someone smoking guy 1 no smoking behind wire specialist guy2 yes sir guy 1 i dont give damn if your uncle is our boss or not lmao writer couldnt even be bothered come up with decent way let us know this character my example guy 2 was nephew their boss who wrote this dialogue this happens numerous times why is it so bad worst all guy 2 later confronts his uncle ask if he can join war he even goes say you would send them off war but you wouldnt send your own family lol why heck didnt you leave it there there was no need initial exposition if you were going drop it scene later omg okay there are plenty instances that happening so i wont harp it lets get back bruce so at roughly 25 minute mark theres scene between main ish characters willis grillo third person are all there each one is playing high ranking official but bruce willis is clearly not that scene he doesnt look like hes responding them he nods their general direction as if hes room with them but you can clearly see hes not there with them they do no wide angle shots until they do when they do its stand bruce lmao its clearly not him its so obvious their heads look very different this happens several times throughout movie imagine paying actor act they just go nope but he looks like me so lmao ladies gents i could go day half but let me stop here say this this movie sucks any chance it had at being movie not even good one just movie was killed when bruce willis was brought i recommend you avoid dont waste your time end story,0.4503514739229025,0.013696145124716565,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.42}"

For a grade, or something.Clearly, there was no excess money to burn - almost entire scenography is some kind of paintball course. And some forest. And all the crops are close-ups of people doing stuff, mostly shooting off into something offscreen, presumably into the distance.The movie is set in the 26th century, with the space and time bending human species spanning three planets (only indication of this is an introductory text) and the weirdest thing we can see in the galaxy is a girl with semi-yellow hair? Everything else, technology, weapons, fashion, everything looks exactly as today. Alright, excepting a few seconds long filler scenes of spaceships.I'm writing this because one question baffles me without cease. It's - Why did you have to make this? What was the motivation behind this work? I don't see you making any money, however inadequate the investment was. What's the point?

1,Worse than you can possibly imagine,"Can anyone remember when you could give more than 3 out of 10 to a Bruce Willis movie.

1,I think less of myself for having watched this.,"The Blood General? That is totally made up by a twelve year old boy.What an idiot firing so many rounds into darkness.2500 something and people are still driving the same cars?!There were two people on the whole planet abs now you have several more than that survivors?! Is counting a lost skill in 2500 something?!They weren't tipped off my their face and eyes?!2500 something has no laser or pulse guns?They may be in hibernation.Aliens with hoods is an easy way to cut costs, and disappoint the audience.What the hell was that scene?! It made no science?! Bruce walks into a cage having hallucinations and surrounded by aliens, then the specialist appears and they walk through the woods?! F-n terrible.This is another example of what 1.25 speed was made for... maybe 1.5 speed.That general sidekick side conversation was pointless... as was his conversation with the little girl. Trying to inject some humanity in a dump truck of garbage.They ran out of ""armor"" so they told a guy on set with a flannel shirt to grab a toy gun.This can't end quick enough.All the kids shots hit the armor... why is he dead?This was a complete waste of money.Grillo got the best deal out of this, he had the least screen time.There is not even a single good line in this film.What kind of armor leaves the midsection wide open?Why is there a flashing open sign inside!!!",i think less myself having watched this,blood general that is totally made up by twelve year old boy what idiot firing so many rounds into darkness 2500 something people are still driving same cars there were two people whole planet abs now you have several more than that survivors is counting lost skill 2500 something they werent tipped off my their face eyes 2500 something has no laser or pulse guns they may be hibernation aliens with hoods is easy way cut costs disappoint audience what hell was that scene it made no science bruce walks into cage having hallucinations surrounded by aliens then specialist appears they walk through woods f n terrible this is another example what 1 25 speed was made maybe 1 5 speed that general sidekick side conversation was pointless as was his conversation with little girl trying inject some humanity dump truck garbage they ran out armor so they told guy set with flannel shirt grab toy gun this cant end quick enough all kids shots hit armor why is he dead this was complete waste money grillo got best deal out this he had least screen time there is not even single good line this film what kind armor leaves midsection wide open why is there flashing open sign inside,0.4567602040816327,0.046109693877551004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.41}"
2,Very cheaply made and made little sense,"The story happens in 500 years later future, but people wear exactly the same clothes as now and same buildings, same cars. The robot bartender can't even pour a drink without spilling.The alien enemies are supposed to be way more advanced than us humans, but they fight us with axes and swords, we hit them from a distance with guns.If a human is possessed by an alien, then they won't be able to speak human language. Yet one alien had a 10 mins monologue while in the female scientist's body.The film is just over an hour, rather short for an action-sci-fi. But they still managed to have so many pointless filler scenes, like the chitchat scene with the little girl about sunglasses.",very cheaply made made little sense,story happens 500 years later future but people wear exactly same clothes as now same buildings same cars robot bartender cant even pour drink without spilling alien enemies are supposed be way more advanced than us humans but they fight us with axes swords we hit them distance with guns if human is possessed by alien then they wont be able speak human language yet one alien had 10 mins monologue while female scientists body film is just over hour rather short action sci fi but they still managed have so many pointless filler scenes like chitchat scene with little girl about sunglasses,0.38416666666666666,0.04295454545454546,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.59}"
2,The Reviews here ain't lying,If you're a scifi fan like me you probably read the premise and be quite interested. Bruce Willis wasn't anything positive or negative for me but I thought it would be a sign of a high quality movie. Well... I watched the first 30 Minutes of this and... it's bad. Like really bad. It's not like this one thing in it is bad like for example the plot is a bit weak. But when you're at the point where even I critique the cinematography and color grading you have to be at a very low point to the degree of college-first-indie-movie-attempts-bad. This is usually stuff I can overlook quite easily because I don't notice.This film basically has everything bad a film can have. From every category. Take your pick what you think is the worst.,reviews here aint lying,if youre scifi fan like me you probably read premise be quite interested bruce willis wasnt anything positive or negative me but i thought it would be sign high quality movie well i watched first 30 minutes this its bad like really bad its not like this one thing it is bad like example plot is bit weak but when youre at point where even i critique cinematography color grading you have be at very low point degree college first indie movie attempts bad this is usually stuff i can overlook quite easily because i dont notice this film basically has everything bad film can have every category take your pick what you think is worst,0.5343404634581104,-0.22672905525846695,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2,Mostly space junk.,"We have here a confusing space war movie taking place in 2524, where aliens attack a remote mining outpost part of Alliance protection. A rescue crew containing a retired soldier deemed too violent for war, James Ford (Bruce Willis), leaves Earth before determining if the aliens are even hostile. This rescue unit is led by General Ryle (Frank Grillo), hauling a weapon known as the Q-Bomb.Battle scenes look as if they belong in a video game. Dialogue seems rushed and phony. Visual effects are crowded and clumsy. I think Willis' paycheck may have been too much to afford putting more into this project. Also in the cast: C. J.
