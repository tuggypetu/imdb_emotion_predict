10.0,My Personal Favourite Movie of All Time,"It's been quite a few years since I first saw V for Vendetta. I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.It blew me away in many ways, and I credit the film as being part of the reason I became less homophobic and bigoted in many ways. It was the first time I saw homosexuality in a direct and positive light in the media, and it helped me immensely in establishing my more left-leaning views in the Christian world I was raised in.It's for this reason I have a very deep and personal relationship with this film, but I love the film at a more enjoyable level as well. This film oozes with style. Everything from the cinematography and sound design, to the ways characters speak and act. The rather sparse use of fight scenes (in comparison to other action films of its ilk), opting rather to use political thriller tropes and character development, surprised me the first time I watched it, but even though the film wasn't as action packed as films like The Matrix or Equilibrium (both of which have massive third act spectacles) the action I feel is much more effective and emotional than either of those films (ironic, since Equilibrium is about emotion). While short, the final fight scene between V and Creedy's men is an incredible burst of ecstatic visceral action that makes the entire film worth it.You can say there are three main characters in this film. There's V, the titular anarchist vigilante, Evey, the young woman who is kidnapped, and slowly falls for V in a more violent twist of Beauty and the Beast, and there's Detective Finch, a government employee tasked to finding and unmasking V, and during this task discovering that his beloved government isn't as noble as it may seem. Each of these characters is given a fair and due amount of screen time, and they each have a full and satisfactory character arc. I find how well written and edited this film is to be incredibly impressive, and writing this I want to watch the film all over again just to appreciate it more.There is something to be said, however, about the differences between the film and the original graphic novel written by Alan Moore. I haven't read the original comic, but judging by Alan Moore's distaste of films inspired by his work, and the fact that he refused to watch the film after reading the script, maybe this film isn't for fans of the original work. There's a great comparison video by CineFix on Youtube comparing the film to the novel, and they are very very different from each other. One notable difference is that the portrayal of V vs the dictator Sutler is much more nuanced and less Black and white in the novel than in the film, and that is a very well deserved critique of the film. I do not claim that V for Vendetta is the best film ever made. I haven't even scraped the surface of world cinema and cinema history to ever make that claim. However I can definitely say that V for Vendetta is, at least for the time being, the most personally meaningful movie, and the most enjoyable movie, I have ever seen. Mad Max Fury Road did get close though.",my personal favourite movie all time,its been quite few years since i first saw v vendetta i didnt see it at release because i was far under age demographic at that time but i managed catch up film at around 2011 2012 not sure exact year but i was teenager at time i loved matrix still do heard that v vendetta was written by wachowskis so i thought id give it shot it blew me away many ways i credit film as being part reason i became less homophobic bigoted many ways it was first time i saw homosexuality direct positive light media it helped me immensely establishing my more left leaning views christian world i was raised its this reason i have very deep personal relationship with this film but i love film at more enjoyable level as well this film oozes with style everything cinematography sound design ways characters speak act rather sparse use fight scenes comparison other action films its ilk opting rather use political thriller tropes character development surprised me first time i watched it but even though film wasnt as action packed as films like matrix or equilibrium both which have massive third act spectacles action i feel is much more effective emotional than either those films ironic since equilibrium is about emotion while short final fight scene between v creedys men is incredible burst ecstatic visceral action that makes entire film worth it you can say there are three main characters this film theres v titular anarchist vigilante evey young woman who is kidnapped slowly falls v more violent twist beauty beast theres detective finch government employee tasked finding unmasking v during this task discovering that his beloved government isnt as noble as it may seem each these characters is given fair due amount screen time they each have full satisfactory character arc i find how well written edited this film is be incredibly impressive writing this i want watch film all over again just appreciate it more there is something be said however about differences between film original graphic novel written by alan moore i havent read original comic but judging by alan moores distaste films inspired by his work fact that he refused watch film after reading script maybe this film isnt fans original work theres great comparison video by cinefix youtube comparing film novel they are very very different each other one notable difference is that portrayal v vs dictator sutler is much more nuanced less black white novel than film that is very well deserved critique film i do not claim that v vendetta is best film ever made i havent even scraped surface world cinema cinema history ever make that claim however i can definitely say that v vendetta is at least time being most personally meaningful movie most enjoyable movie i have ever seen mad max fury road did get close though,0.4979030814473851,0.20846758726505557,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,A Bloody Masterpiece!,"I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic.10/10",bloody masterpiece,i am speechless i just came back theatre where i watched v vendetta there are three main elements movie it excels all three them first off dialogues script intense witty honest but not patronising intelligent but not pretentious thats first level at which movie surprises you you dont except such high level script action movie but it is slowly revealed audience that v vendetta is not just action movie story is filled with current events has definite strong political sense secondly hugo weavings performance it is definitely what grabs you start he delivers some hardest lines with incredible charisma his performance shines throughout movie honestly he sounds as good as any best actors out there he should be nominated academy award finally visual part incredible yet no matrix effects used everything looks beautiful dark yet vibrant cinematography is top notch final battle scene brought tears my eyes do not miss v vendetta its one best movies all time eternal classic 10 10,0.5278095238095238,0.2755238095238095,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Utterly Spectacular!,"I was a fan of the ""V for Vendetta"" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Closer"". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""The Matrix"". Unlike ""The Matrix"", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another ""Matrix""-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in ""V"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. ""V for Vendetta"" is a must-see.10/10",utterly spectacular,i was fan v vendetta graphic novel alan moore disinheriting film was bit discouraging but hes always been little crazy film version is everything i could have possibly hoped gripping chilling intense exciting heartbreaking it gets moores music if not his exact words elements are slightly different subplots removed but idea as v himself would be so proud say remains same plot is surprisingly complex nuanced i dont want give anything more away than previews already have suffice it say that masked anarchist voiced by hugo weaving must save young woman natalie portman during his attempt expose corruption government weaving is perfectly cast using his formidable physicality imposing voice give gravitas insanity character portman has gone child teen star is finally emerging as talented adult actress following her oscar nominated turn closer here she gives her best performance date as orphan evey john hurt is characteristically impressive as enigmatic government leader stephen rea gives wonderful supporting turn as police inspector charged with finding v before its too late wachowski brothers former prot g james mctiegue takes directing duties here helms enormously impressive first feature using every trick book manner reminiscent his mentors breakout hit matrix unlike matrix mctiegue allows story be more focus than action as result film is tense emotional thriller with outbursts spectacularly filmed choreographed action showing more maturity restraint than wachowskis mctiegue doesnt show off his trickery isnt self conscious when slow motion overtakes late action sequence it seems as natural as breathing late cinematographer adrian biddle film is dedicated his memory does outstanding job oscar nominated dario marianellis score is fantastic accompaniment piece visual effects are astonishing terrifying deeply moving especially climatic moments trafalgar square with solid acting great action fantastic technical wizardry it sounds just like another matrix style ripoff but biggest difference v is that it is story real ideas not fantastic science fiction creation but genuine examination human condition power fear takes center stage here fear war disease famine fear is basic human nature has been exploited as weapon method control centuries those who would use it masked man waits shadows carry out your sentence verdict vengeance v vendetta is must see 10 10,0.5332051282051283,0.16352564102564096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,Very powerful even if it makes Thatcherism look heavenly!,"'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up.",very powerful even if it makes thatcherism look heavenly,v vendetta will no doubt be remembered as being one most well produced films this decade its powerful script strong character depictions sheer excellence terms quality loosely based dc comic film is set totalitarian britain where bnp like government who run country with iron fist that they make thatchers tories look positively warm trustworthy then emerges vigilante form v man deformed by fire governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength who is determined free uk dictatorship by blowing up houses parliament evey is young woman who is unwittingly embroiled his plot soon understands what just it is that motivates v so acting v vendetta was top notch along with well written script apt soundtrack gave film essence engage audience make them feel better or worse these characters although her accent was wobbly places natalie portman delivered strong performance as evey depicting characters growing love v realisation that time her fight has arrived stephen rea also deserves mention as detective who begins grasp just how corrupt government he has supported really is as does stephen fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters his performance as deitrich protester who hasnt quite grasped just how far government will go shut their opponents up john hurts chancellor sutler was very terrifying as dictator who couldnt give toss about his people so long as he remained total power however above all it was hugo weavings absolutely brilliant depiction lead character v who dominates without ever seeing his facial expression he exudes pragmatism charisma intelligence character with twist revenge driven madness entertainment wise film doesnt fail with its apt soundtrack well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based comic book yet v vendetta maintains ability leave audience shaken chilled at thought how easily western country can be ensnared by tyranny when corrupt government is allowed too much power goes too far elements dealt with are all more disturbing with state world today i imagine it will touch deeper cord with britons like myself it would have been interesting see more how scotland wales northern ireland had fared this new world though as it is so rare that hollywood film is set uk its always simpler pretend these things could never happen here so it is sharp shock see such dark future located familiar surroundings home i highly recommend this film all as it will leave you both entertained pondering matters raised storyline long after credits have rolled up,0.5756212834784261,0.1627776984919842,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9.0,Among the best stuff you'll see from DC Comics.,"DC Comics has a rather poor reputation lately. Despite having some great superheroes, the films based on their characters often have sucked. However, one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...""V for Vendetta"".The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future, the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And, the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos, the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero, V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.By the way, if you like this film, try the 1960s Italian film ""Danger: Diabolik"". Both have very, very similar themes and both are wonderful movies.",among best stuff youll see dc comics,dc comics has rather poor reputation lately despite having some great superheroes films based their characters often have sucked however one best most worthwhile films based their comics is well worth seeing v vendetta story is placed dystopian future according this future united states has been torn apart by civil war disasters united kingdom has gone constitutional monarchy repressive fascist dictatorship but government is far more evil than just repressing free speech it seems that much chaos that led this government was actually created by man who now is charge create climate fear chaos government has created fake terrorists used deaths 10s thousands brits as excuse control country with iron fist only hope britain has is weird nehilistic superhero v v hugo weaving is determined bring down government give country back people but how what part does evey natalie portman play all this see film this is very exciting intelligent film it definitely kept my interest much it because whole thing aside near indestructable anti hero seemed possible well worth seeing exceptionally well made by way if you like this film try 1960s italian film danger diabolik both have very very similar themes both are wonderful movies,0.5252614379084967,0.17797385620915035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,This is one of the best films I have ever seen...,"...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right.""

9.0,a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time,"V for Vendetta rating: 3.5 out of 4V for Vendetta is a swift and smugly entertaining portrait of revolution. Albeit, this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution, meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society. But this is more than The Matrix with a Victorian flare. V for Vendetta offers up a convincing vision of the near-future paired with an operatic comic book tale of love, mystery, and a Guy-Fawkes-masked rebellion. Our hero is V (Hugo Weaving), a masked terrorist with a mind for the subversive, a taste for the eloquent, and a hand for knife-wielding acrobatics. His accidental apprentice (or maybe hostage) is Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman V saved from the fondling grasps of corrupt Fingermen (kind of the CIA for the V for Vendetta world) as she hurried across town past curfew. Our oppressor in this world is High Chancellor Stutler (John Hurt), whose persona is shown primarily through a five-story tall projection of his ever-angry head. The exposition for this near-future lies mostly in the implosion of America after the middle-eastern war expanded into a world war that reached its tendrils even through Western Europe. America folded into civil strife while Britain became the final bastion of modern civilization after a biological attack isolated the island into a zone of quarantine. Stutler rose to power in the chaos and now rules Britain with the mantra ""England Prevails!"" Rest assured, however, this is not a reality governed by rolling robots and giant overhead blimps; it's a world that's, instead, very similar to ours. The technological innovations are hidden subtly into the film's environment, refusing to take precedent over the historically opulent flavors of England's architecture. V for Vendetta has a flare for the theatric and operatic, after all. There's no room for bleeping robots and bounding technology. On the eve of November 5th, when Britain traditionally celebrated freedom and truth, V launches a subversive plot to topple High Chancellor Stutler and his surrounding administration. Hijacking the British Television Network, he broadcasts a speech that sets the date one year from November 5th as the date of the revolution. Our story takes place in the interim year leading up to the supposed revolution, with the evolution of Evey's politics, the ongoing vendetta V has set against the players of a mysterious government plot, and the deepening hole V digs for Stutler and his boys to stumble into once that fateful date arrives. ""Remember, remember the fifth of November."" What separates V's rebellion from the teeming hordes of other cinematic coupe d'etats made over the years is that V for Vendetta approaches the topic with one eye held straight at the politics of the present. Hot button headline topics continually rear their heads here. Bush is paralleled to Stutler, the news media is heavily clouded, our hero is paired with images of suicide bombers and subway attacks; not to mention the undeniable fact that we are asked to sympathize with an outright terrorist. Is terrorism justified when paired against a strict oppressor? In the political climate of today--where the title of terrorism is threatening to mirror the clout McCarthy granted the title of Communism--V for Vendetta's answer to that question is a sure-handed yes. But V for Vendetta is no heavy-handed political allegory. At its heart, V for Vendetta is entertainment. And as any entertainment with a hand in Victorian elegance, V for Vendetta must have romance. But before you conjure images of the Fawkes mask flying in a sweaty bald-headed scene of lust, realize first that there also is a master-grasshopper dynamic between Evey and V. The romance is formed as an understatement and rarely addressed, let to simmer below the surface and lend more chemistry to scenes that would otherwise ring hollow.Natalie Portman may have stolen the tabloid exposure with her shiny shaved head, but Hugo Weaving is the masked performance that steals the show. Much of the role's success lies in the writing, for V is made not to be simply a mask. There's a theme throughout the film asking whether behind masks of revolution, there lie fighting men and women, or only their ideals. V answers this question with charisma. Contradicting the common mantra that masked figures must be laconic, V, in fact, probably has the most lines of all. The character is full and rich with quirks and personality, but still exists with that essential air of mystery. Weaving achieves the same level of iconic performance that he did with Agent Smith in The Matrix. It really is that good.There's been debate over the quality of adaptation the Wachowski Brothers offered to Alan Moore's original graphic novel. Moore has publicly separated himself from the film, quoting in the New York Times last week that ""the screenplay's rubbish."" Well, before we all walk away from the ticket line, remember primly that Alan Moore will be the first to tell you himself that he is a selfish, pretentious prick. He knows it, and we know it. Let's move on. The screenplay's fine. In fact, it's a near-masterpiece. What the Wachowski Brothers have done is find the right balance between the theatrics of the graphic novel, and the solemnity to the richly Victorian narrative. They form a dynamic that plays to both sides, allowing for a story that sparks both political debate and giddy entertainment. We'll first shake our heads at the sentimental, soft-focus flashbacks and silly sub-plot for ""nuclear human experimentation""; but when mulled over, we realize it's just the comic book mentality showing its spots. After all, V wouldn't start all his sentences with v-words had this film shunned its comic roots.

10.0,Ideas Are Bulletproof and One Man Can Make the Difference,"In a near future, a totalitarian state is ruling England. On November, 5th, a man self-calling V (Hugo Weaving) explodes a symbolic monument and starts fighting for freedom using terrorist technique. He also rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the claws of the abusive secret police and later she becomes her allied. The man in charge of the investigation, Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea), discloses the truth about his leaders while chasing V.""V for Vendetta"" is in my opinion the best action movie of the year. The story, about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win the elections and dominate the population, inclusive forging terrorist attacks, is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story, but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests, but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom. This is a movie that deserves to be watched many times as a lesson of freedom and citizenship. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""V de Vingança"" (""V for Vendetta"")",ideas are bulletproof one man can make difference,near future totalitarian state is ruling england november 5th man self calling v hugo weaving explodes symbolic monument starts fighting freedom using terrorist technique he also rescues evey hammond natalie portman claws abusive secret police later she becomes her allied man charge investigation inspector eric finch stephen rea discloses truth about his leaders while chasing v v vendetta is my opinion best action movie year story about totalitarian state that uses fear terror win elections dominate population inclusive forging terrorist attacks is much updated there are many excellent lines this orwellian story but i would like highlight following ones people should not be afraid their governments governments should be afraid their people ideas are bulletproof awesome pyotr ilyich tchaikovskys 1812 overture fits amazingly perfect both scenes explosion v vendetta is not only brilliant tale revenge as name suggests but mostly magnificent message hymn freedom this is movie that deserves be watched many times as lesson freedom citizenship my vote is ten title brazil v de vingan v vendetta,0.55625,0.325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"
8.0,Riveting and Exciting.,"This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You'll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.A finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by""V."" Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives. Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you.",riveting exciting,this marks fantastic return wachowski brothers those who were disappointed with their

I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie.

10.0,One of Those Rare Films to Really Earn a 10,"In the future, England is controlled by a fascist, 1984-esque government. One man, who calls himself V, has taken on the guise of Guy Fawkes and has made it his personal mission to destroy Parliament and get England to rise up. He befriends Evey (Natalie Portman), who sometimes sees his side and sometimes doesn't.I've given out a handful of 10s. I think out of the nearly 500 reviews I've done, I've given out maybe 7 or 8 of them. I'm not quick to throw a 10 on something because of some whim, you really have to earn it. This film earns it in spades.Natalie Portman is the perfect actress: obviously beautiful, but also a real actress. Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving, although never seen on the screen (at least not his face), made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film, because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"", this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell"", even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes, the alliteration. I love the anti-government, pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that, this film offers it all.There's romance (and I mean actual romance, not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action, fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times, especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking, but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.If you like Portman, like good dramas and action films, and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see.

9.0,"""Then you have no fear anymore, you are completely free.""","Is terrorism enacted against a terrorist government acceptable? That is the central haunting question presented in ""V For Vendetta"", a stylish thriller nominally adapted from the comic book of the same name. That the film comes out now is not surprising, what is though is that the source material was originally published in 1988/89, pre-dating by a decade a global world in which terrorism has become a household word.Comparisons drawn to Nazi Germany are probably apt, as the film's reining government and it's leader Sutler (John Hurt) have succeeded in convincing the masses what to sleep, eat and think. The revelation of Sutler's inhuman plot to save his country's citizens from a self induced plague that killed eighty thousand people seems utterly unbelievable, yet a real life Hitler found it prudent to kill nearly eight times as many to insure racial hegemony. It's interesting to note that the level of V's violence was tempered to each victim's own arrogance and complicity. Dr. Surridge (Sinead Cusack) as an example was already dead before she even knew it, dispassionate in the knowledge of her guilt and almost welcoming it.In a field of outstanding portrayals, Natalie Portman excels as the tormented accomplice Evey Hammond. Her performance arcs over an entire spectrum of characterizations and emotions, and not once did I feel her reactions were forced or unnatural. She grows Evey from an ambivalent, unthinking member of the hive to a leader, with more courage and determination than allowing herself credit for. It will be interesting to see if she's given credit for her performance a year from now in the next Academy Award go round.The film prompts me to seek out the trade paperback of the original story as scripted by Alan Moore in a ten issue run. My curiosity is also piqued as to Moore's public disavowal of the movie, for that I'll have to learn more. Also while still on the subject, the movie's opening credits Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics, which was not involved in the original publication.With a movie of such complexity, another viewing is probably a worthwhile endeavor to pick up the threads that might have been overlooked the first time around. However if all you're interested in is an action movie, this is one you probably want to stay away from.
