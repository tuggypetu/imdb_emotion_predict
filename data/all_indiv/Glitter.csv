1.0,"As bad as they say, and then some","In my perverse desire to see every film in the bottom 100, I thought I could not go far wrong with a rental of this classic POS. Mariah Carey's first and so far only feature film is an example of how the combined MPAA and RIAA attempts to shovel garbage at us are starting to backfire. Sales of Mariah's recordings, once one of the highlights of an otherwise dreary RIAA mainstream catalogue, have slumped. It's all because of this film. Don't let the blind Mariah fans fool you - it is just as bad as critics say, and deserving of its bottom 100 status.Where to begin when pulling apart this cinematic abortion? For me, the first major problem was the cinematography. If the viewer is not clued in on the fact that Vondie Curtis-Hall has only directed television before this film as it starts, the flat, Days-Of-Our-Lives-style shots will soon make it clear enough. Directors who put one or two actors, three tops, in a 2.35:1 frame are a dime a dozen. On the other hand, directors who cannot even differentiate these actors' spacing from the camera truly stand out, and not in a good way.The story has been described as being syrupy enough to kill anyone who suffers from diabetes (or doesn't), and I am not going to contest that. It's a variation upon the classic rags to riches theme, specifically tailored towards Mariah. Mariah essentially plays herself in the guise of a young vocalist who starts singing backup for a considerably less talented vocalist. As she crosses the paths of more people, eventually said people twig to the fact that she can vocalise with the best of them. One DJ eventually picks her up, manages her through a record deal, and promises her that one day she *will* play in Madison Square Garden, or something along those lines.This kind of story has been done before, with such real-life examples as the Jacksons providing source material for one excellent miniseries of the theme. The problem here is that we've heard this story a million times before. Another significant problem is that while Mariah has a voice many would kill for, there is absolutely nothing that stands out, even slightly about her material. As an old girlfriend of mine once said, the longer it takes the RIAA to twig to the fact that being female doesn't mandate wanting to hear this formulaic ballad crap, the more business they are going to lose to independents who support bands like Opera IX. I think the fact that Mariah's last album disappeared without trace in spite of having millions of dollars spent on its promotion proves her right.Mariah's story is also incredibly bland, to say the least. So her junkie mother gave her up when she was young. Oh boo hoo. It happens, and you're probably better off for it, get over it already. The previously-mentioned Jacksons could run rings around the likes of Mariah Carey for sob stories, and their reluctance to deal with the media at large is a telling thing. So in the end, we are simply left with another example of the mainstream trying to seem alternative, and failing.I gave Glitter a one out of ten. I don't think I am being too harsh. I think it is so amazingly bad that it becomes comedic, at least on the first viewing. I suspect that repeated viewings will simply become boring.",as bad as they say then some,my perverse desire see every film bottom 100 i thought i could not go far wrong with rental this classic pos mariah careys first so far only feature film is example how combined mpaa riaa attempts shovel garbage at us are starting backfire sales mariahs recordings once one highlights otherwise dreary riaa mainstream catalogue have slumped its all because this film dont let blind mariah fans fool you it is just as bad as critics say deserving its bottom 100 status where begin when pulling apart this cinematic abortion me first major problem was cinematography if viewer is not clued fact that vondie curtis hall has only directed television before this film as it starts flat days our lives style shots will soon make it clear enough directors who put one or two actors three tops 2 35 1 frame are dime dozen other hand directors who cannot even differentiate these actors spacing camera truly stand out not good way story has been described as being syrupy enough kill anyone who suffers diabetes or doesnt i am not going contest that its variation upon classic rags riches theme specifically tailored towards mariah mariah essentially plays herself guise young vocalist who starts singing backup considerably less talented vocalist as she crosses paths more people eventually said people twig fact that she can vocalise with best them one dj eventually picks her up manages her through record deal promises her that one day she will play madison square garden or something along those lines this kind story has been done before with such real life examples as jacksons providing source material one excellent miniseries theme problem here is that weve heard this story million times before another significant problem is that while mariah has voice many would kill there is absolutely nothing that stands out even slightly about her material as old girlfriend mine once said longer it takes riaa twig fact that being female doesnt mandate wanting hear this formulaic ballad crap more business they are going lose independents who support bands like opera ix i think fact that mariahs last album disappeared without trace spite having millions dollars spent its promotion proves her right mariahs story is also incredibly bland say least so her junkie mother gave her up when she was young oh boo hoo it happens youre probably better off it get over it already previously mentioned jacksons could run rings around likes mariah carey sob stories their reluctance deal with media at large is telling thing so end we are simply left with another example mainstream trying seem alternative failing i gave glitter one out ten i dont think i am being too harsh i think it is so amazingly bad that it becomes comedic at least first viewing i suspect that repeated viewings will simply become boring,0.4807738095238094,0.02756944444444447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
4.0,"De-fanged ""A Star is Born""","""Glitter"" might have been a camp classic if the story wasn't so dull and downbeat. It's yet another rewrite of ""A Star Is Born"", here turned into a vehicle for pop star Mariah Carey and apparently patterned after her own rise to the top (audiences weren't fooled, however, by the updated, late-night-movie clichés). Carey's funky/erotic music is driving (and her performance as blazing new talent Billie Frank is adequate), but the script for ""Glitter"" seems left over from the 1950s. Didn't the writers realize that times have changed and that Billie didn't have to be such a diva-doormat? Actresses of a lot higher caliber than Mariah Carey have fallen into this trap--they just don't want to see themselves on the screen acting bitchy and tough, so they end up playing the simp. ""Glitter"" features some rich cinematography (nice shots of the Big Apple), but it is too soft to make an impression--even as an unintended comedy. *1/2 from ****",de fanged star is born,glitter might have been camp classic if story wasnt so dull downbeat its yet another rewrite star is born here turned into vehicle pop star mariah carey apparently patterned after her own rise top audiences werent fooled however by updated late night movie clich s careys funky erotic music is driving her performance as blazing new talent billie frank is adequate but script glitter seems left over 1950s didnt writers realize that times have changed that billie didnt have be such diva doormat actresses lot higher caliber than mariah carey have fallen into this trap they just dont want see themselves screen acting bitchy tough so they end up playing simp glitter features some rich cinematography nice shots big apple but it is too soft make impression even as unintended comedy 1 2,0.49099326599326587,0.15726711560044893,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.29}"
5.0,A 40 Million Dollar High School Play,"So bad it's fabulous. This movie bombed big-time when it opened, I saw it in the theater with an audience of 5 other people and have watched it several times since. So much bad press at the time! There was a rumor that it was originally supposed to be set in the 80's, but that part was cut out, only the wacky costumes remained. That would explain the presence of Ann Magnusona as a press agent for the record company. Mariah is sincerely likable and sings beautifully. The same cannot be said for poor Padma Lakshima. Sort of an R&B version of ""A Star Is Born"", you will find yourself laughing in all the wrong places. Every cliché in the book and then some. There is a fashion photo shoot with silver body paint, and an evening dress that goes from stage to farm in one day. A classic rags to riches tale that seems to have been written by a teenager.CC",40 million dollar high school play,so bad its fabulous this movie bombed big time when it opened i saw it theater with audience 5 other people have watched it several times since so much bad press at time there was rumor that it was originally supposed be set 80s but that part was cut out only wacky costumes remained that would explain presence ann magnusona as press agent record company mariah is sincerely likable sings beautifully same cannot be said poor padma lakshima sort r b version star is born you will find yourself laughing all wrong places every clich book then some there is fashion photo shoot with silver body paint evening dress that goes stage farm one day classic rags riches tale that seems have been written by teenager cc,0.5593333333333332,-0.021555555555555536,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.57}"
2.0,Scary star vehicle,"Even fans of bad movies will have a tough time with ""Glitter"", which commits a number of gross sins while it is on your screen. Unlike the similarly-panned ""Showgirls"", ""Glitter"" doesn't go far enough over the top to be of any interest, and it takes itself way too seriously. ""Showgirls"" made me feel giddy while I was watching it. ""Glitter"" made me feel as if I had been poisoned.What an unfortunate mis-step for star Mariah Carey, who gets sucked up into the vacuum of this movie like a dust bunny under the Hoover. It's not that Mariah is terrible, exactly. She doesn't seem like much of an actress, and she definitely doesn't have much screen presence. But the real problem is that she doesn't really do much except smile, sing, and look pretty. She simply exists. Perhaps since ""Glitter"" is touted as a semi-autobiographical film like ""Purple Rain"", the producers thought being Mariah Carey would be enough to carry the film. Her role is shallow and one-dimensional, despite the fact that the script tries to give her some depth by piling on the age-old ""wayward childhood"" cliché. The problem is we've seen all of this so often that it's very silly.It only gets worse as the movie progresses. After Mariah's character, Billie, grows up, she meets an obnoxious club DJ who, much to our horror, turns out to be the movie's other main character. Carey and her costar, Max Beesley, have next to zero screen chemistry, but for some reasons she falls in love with him.The director throws in a bunch of gimmicky techniques, like speeding up the film, as well as a hilariously awful cut that goes from Mariah's face to fireworks exploding. There is also a laugh-out-loud moment where the actress who plays the young Billie Frank joins her mother onstage and when she opens her mouth to sing, it is Mariah Carey's voice that comes out of her--pitched up until she sounds a little like Minnie Mouse. No wonder Mariah collapsed after this was released.There are some absurd and awful moments in the film that have nothing to do with Mariah, most notably her two obnoxious friends who are directed as complete caricatures and seem to be intended for some sort of comic relief (there's plenty of that in other places, all of it unintentional).Beesley is supposed to be a big-time club DJ, yet he plays more like a kid at a high-school dance. The role is all wrong for him. For some inexplicable reason, the film is set in the early 80s, yet more often than not it looks suspiciously like the early 00's (especially the furniture). The dialog is unmemorable and nobody has any real acting to do in this film, except for one or two ""emotional"" moments. The drama is uninvolving, and it doesn't really spiral out of control until the conclusion of the movie, where it soars so far into the absurd that we finally get some good ""bad movie"" stuff (a big fight, a beating, a murder, a campy moment of triumph onstage). It's too little, too late though.The one thing that ""Glitter"" manages to carry off is a cliché but somewhat engaging scene where Billie finally meets up her long-lost mother. Unfortunately, it is the final scene of the movie, and the camera sails right up into the sky just when we get to the one moment in the film that works.",scary star vehicle,even fans bad movies will have tough time with glitter which commits number gross sins while it is your screen unlike similarly panned showgirls glitter doesnt go far enough over top be any interest it takes itself way too seriously showgirls made me feel giddy while i was watching it glitter made me feel as if i had been poisoned what unfortunate mis step star mariah carey who gets sucked up into vacuum this movie like dust bunny under hoover its not that mariah is terrible exactly she doesnt seem like much actress she definitely doesnt have much screen presence but real problem is that she doesnt really do much except smile sing look pretty she simply exists perhaps since glitter is touted as semi autobiographical film like purple rain producers thought being mariah carey would be enough carry film her role is shallow one dimensional despite fact that script tries give her some depth by piling age old wayward childhood clich problem is weve seen all this so often that its very silly it only gets worse as movie progresses after mariahs character billie grows up she meets obnoxious club dj who much our horror turns out be movies other main character carey her costar max beesley have next zero screen chemistry but some reasons she falls love with him director throws bunch gimmicky techniques like speeding up film as well as hilariously awful cut that goes mariahs face fireworks exploding there is also laugh out loud moment where actress who plays young billie frank joins her mother onstage when she opens her mouth sing it is mariah careys voice that comes out her pitched up until she sounds little like minnie mouse no wonder mariah collapsed after this was released there are some absurd awful moments film that have nothing do with mariah most notably her two obnoxious friends who are directed as complete caricatures seem be intended some sort comic relief theres plenty that other places all it unintentional beesley is supposed be big time club dj yet he plays more like kid at high school dance role is all wrong him some inexplicable reason film is set early 80s yet more often than not it looks suspiciously like early 00s especially furniture dialog is unmemorable nobody has any real acting do this film except one or two emotional moments drama is uninvolving it doesnt really spiral out control until conclusion movie where it soars so far into absurd that we finally get some good bad movie stuff big fight beating murder campy moment triumph onstage its too little too late though one thing that glitter manages carry off is clich but somewhat engaging scene where billie finally meets up her long lost mother unfortunately it is final scene movie camera sails right up into sky just when we get one moment film that works,0.5409656084656085,-0.039257054673721314,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.45}"
1.0,so bad it goes past good and comes back to bad again,"I rented Glitter because I'd read it was destined to become a 'so bad it's good' classic, but I was disappointed. This is no Showgirls. What makes Glitter a bad movie is that it's a bland, soulless procession of clichés, exactly like Mariah Carey's songs. And that just makes it boring-bad instead of spectacularly bad. And though Mariah is plenty vacuous in the starring role, she doesn't reach the heights of strenuously bad acting that Elizabeth Berkeley does in Showgirls. The only element of this movie that satisfies my so-bad-it's-good criteria is the character of Mariah's boyfriend. Here you have the whitest man on Earth, saying 'hip' things like ""I'm a'ight"" and ""when you got no food in yo crib"".

6.0,"flawed....but let's be honest, there are MUCH WORSE FILMS","Okay, so it's been 6 1/2 years since this film has come out and it has still been considered one of the worst films of all time, but lets be honest, it is not terrible. Not great but not terrible. I think the greatest flaw in the film that there has not been that was not enough time dedicated to explaining certain aspects of Billie's emotions. There should have been more about her father and how that reflected her relationship with Dice. But when it comes to plot, it is fairly predictable, but there is a reason why there are so many films that share this plot line about fame: A Star Is Born, Dreamgirls etc., it is a part of fame. The main problem is the script, without a good script, the true potential for acting is limited. Now when it comes to the acting, I'll admit it is not great but no means it is terrible. Terrible acting is Jessica Simpson in ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" and ""Blonde Ambition."" I think it is time for people to stop treating this film as if it is the worst film to grace the screen, there are far worse films and this film, while not the greatest, should get the benefit of a doubt.",flawed but lets be honest there are much worse films,okay so its been 6 1 2 years since this film has come out it has still been considered one worst films all time but lets be honest it is not terrible not great but not terrible i think greatest flaw film that there has not been that was not enough time dedicated explaining certain aspects billies emotions there should have been more about her father how that reflected her relationship with dice but when it comes plot it is fairly predictable but there is reason why there are so many films that share this plot line about fame star is born dreamgirls etc it is part fame main problem is script without good script true potential acting is limited now when it comes acting ill admit it is not great but no means it is terrible terrible acting is jessica simpson dukes hazzard blonde ambition i think it is time people stop treating this film as if it is worst film grace screen there are far worse films this film while not greatest should get benefit doubt,0.6499255952380953,-0.035639880952380985,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.36}"

2.0,Wow.,"Mariah Carey went into this movie as probably the biggest diva on the planet, having emancipated herself from her first marriage to Tommy Mottola and her contract with Columbia Records to become exactly who she wanted to be.She also pretty much lost her mind.As she started the publicity tour for this movie, she'd leave long and rambling voicemails to her fans - her lambs, as she called them - on her website. And then there were the TV appearances. On BET's 106 & Park, she hid behind pillows and claimed that she was living ""one day that was continuous."" There was also the infamous TRL appearance on MTV, where she emerged in a nightshirt giving away ice cream to the audience before discussing therapy and stripping on stage, ending with her yelling, ""Mariah Carey has lost her mind!""See - I told you.By the end of the month, Carey was hospitalized for extreme exhaustion and had both a physical and emotional breakdown. The movie and soundtrack were delayed for a few weeks, then the attacks on September 11, 2001 happened. And no one wanted to think about music or fun or Mariah Carey going bonkers for a while.I'm lying. I was ready for this trainwreck the whole time.Carey herself said, ""Here's the thing that a lot of people don't know, that movie was released on September 11, 2001 - could there be a worse day for that movie to come out? ... I don't even know that many people even saw the movie."" She's since referred to the movie as the biggest mistake of her life.Mariah is Billie Frank, the daughter of a 1970's nightclub singer who once set their house on fire. She grew up in an orphanage with her two best friends, Louise and Roxanne (Da Brat and Tia Texada), but now all three girls are the backup singers to the host of Top Chef (Padma Lakshmi, the only person in this movie to probably has read The Satanic Diaries, much less be married at one point to its author).Billie falls for Dice, a DJ who gets her out of her contract with Timothy (Terence Howard) for $100,000, an action that ends up costing him his life just as Billie is about to finally play Madison Square Garden. Man, I fast-forwarded the plot, but that's pretty much it. Think A Star Is Born without all the crying in bathtubs.As amazing a singer as Carey is, her five-octave voice does not translate to her ability to emote or carry the lead role. No one else is ready, willing or able to carry her. And look, I may be writing this in my sweatpants, but even I know that some of the fashions in this movie do anything but glitter.Director Vondie Curtis-Hall - he's also an actor, you may have seen him on Chicago Hope as Dr. Dennis Hancock - has mostly moved into TV movies about celebrities. Here's hoping he goes meta and makes a Mariah film.This movie has left me with so many questions. How old is Billie's cat? It has to be at least twenty years old or longer. How did she and Dice learn how to telepathically write songs together? Why is no one interesting in this movie? Why did Ann Magnuson sign up for this? Why has the two-and-a-half hour length original cut never surfaced? Could Dice's pants be any tighter? Are they perhaps his skin? And what's up with that bicycle outfit that Mariah wears?Glitter made $5.3 million on a $22 million dollar budget and the soundtrack album ended up being the worst selling record Carey released up until that point, so she was dropped from her Virgin contract, losing around $100 million dollars.

2.0,It's no wonder that even Carey herself considers 'Glitter' her biggest regret,"Seeing 'Glitter' with an open mind, despite its notoriously awful reputation, it is not quite as horrendous to be down there with the worst films of all time, but the problems 'Glitter' has are plentiful and are significant enough to consider it a very bad film still.The good news is that Mariah Carey does sound absolutely incredible, always have loved her voice with its beautiful tone, emotional connection and uniquely wide range. Also Terrence Howard is quite good and steals scenes.However, Carey's enviable skills as a singer does not translate in her skills as an actress, it was really strange that an artist with such a huge vocal range (five octaves!) is the complete antithesis in her very one-note and often expressionless acting here, which is devoid of any joy, surprise, sincerity or emotion. The ability to connect emotionally with her songs also doesn't translate in the acting, she looks stiff and bored throughout here.Unfortunately, the songs here do nothing for her vocal talents either. She sings them very well indeed, but there are far more memorable and emotionally powerful songs from her out there that also display her unique vocal gifts much more. They're not awful, just bland. The rest of the acting is also poor, with Max Beesley being equally lousy and not sounding sure what accent to pull off, while with the characters Carey's is shallow, one-dimensional and very difficult to relate to (which is a huge dividend considering the type of story it is) and the rest are annoying caricatures, a couple even irrelevant to the story.Even for a film set in the 80s, 'Glitter' does much less than glitter and looks firmly stuck in the 80s. It looks gaudy and too much of the camera work is too gimmicky and amateurish. The structurally wafer-thin script, with clumsy attempts at being hip, embarrassingly unfunny humour and ""poignant"" moments that come over as emotionally manipulative, sounds even older than that and like an awkwardly written soap-opera rejected at first draft (and should have stayed there).'Glitter' has very little story, it's very thin and aimless, and padded by the bland and uninspiredly choreographed songs shot like a series of out of date music videos and subplots that come out of nowhere and go very little further than that (i.e. the reappearance of the cat or the reunion with her mother). It starts tedious and loses even more drive as it plods on, and throughout like Carey's performance there's no joy, no emotion and no substance. The direction is decidedly inept.Overall, not that horrendous but it is no wonder that Carey herself regrets being involved in this. 2/10 Bethany Cox",its no wonder that even carey herself considers glitter her biggest regret,seeing glitter with open mind despite its notoriously awful reputation it is not quite as horrendous be down there with worst films all time but problems glitter has are plentiful are significant enough consider it very bad film still good news is that mariah carey does sound absolutely incredible always have loved her voice with its beautiful tone emotional connection uniquely wide range also terrence howard is quite good steals scenes however careys enviable skills as singer does not translate her skills as actress it was really strange that artist with such huge vocal range five octaves is complete antithesis her very one note often expressionless acting here which is devoid any joy surprise sincerity or emotion ability connect emotionally with her songs also doesnt translate acting she looks stiff bored throughout here unfortunately songs here do nothing her vocal talents either she sings them very well indeed but there are far more memorable emotionally powerful songs her out there that also display her unique vocal gifts much more theyre not awful just bland rest acting is also poor with max beesley being equally lousy not sounding sure what accent pull off while with characters careys is shallow one dimensional very difficult relate which is huge dividend considering type story it is rest are annoying caricatures couple even irrelevant story even film set 80s glitter does much less than glitter looks firmly stuck 80s it looks gaudy too much camera work is too gimmicky amateurish structurally wafer thin script with clumsy attempts at being hip embarrassingly unfunny humour poignant moments that come over as emotionally manipulative sounds even older than that like awkwardly written soap opera rejected at first draft should have stayed there glitter has very little story its very thin aimless padded by bland uninspiredly choreographed songs shot like series out date music videos subplots that come out nowhere go very little further than that i e reappearance cat or reunion with her mother it starts tedious loses even more drive as it plods throughout like careys performance theres no joy no emotion no substance direction is decidedly inept overall not that horrendous but it is no wonder that carey herself regrets being involved this 2 10 bethany cox,0.6038492063492065,-0.02862868480725625,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.27}"
2.0,"Not so bad it's good, just bad.","Some bad movies, such as Showgirls or Mommie Dearest, become camp classics over time as people come to forgive their shortcomings, and just groove on their excesses. That a movie as famously bad as Glitter has not entered this realm of camp, even after fifteen years, is telling. It tells us that Glitter commits a higher sin than being bad. It is boring. And derivative. And staggeringly incompetent. It was assembled by c-list writers and a TV director, none of whom had much idea how to gain a viewer's attention, and less idea how to hold it. Scene composition is flat and dull, evoking memories of bad holiday TV movies, while failing to establish intimacy with the characters or goings on, even in close up. Early scenes feature a hazy or gauzy look, no doubt to recall Hollywood's golden age, but that simply succeeds in making the movie look trite and derivative, rather than classic. It also makes it look as if the set decorator forgot to dust. The club scenes feature a color palette straight out of Blade Runner, just not as cheery. Every creative element in Glitter has the look of something borrowed from another (better) movie. And the less said about the bizarre, almost random editing choices the better. Every scene transition is another wtf moment. Story and script construction are uniformly terrible. Scenes begin, stuff happens, scenes end... and NOTHING carries over. There is no continuing thread here of any kind - no overall character arc, no central theme, no ongoing visual motifs outside of the movie's hilariously inaccurate 80's fashion sense. Everything that happens seems utterly pointless, just a string of clichés recycled from old movies in which the chorus girl gets her big break. Glitter's brain-dead script gives none of its performers, not even once by accident, anything original or clever to say, nor any awareness of the storyline's utter inanity, making it increasingly difficult for the viewer to connect with the drama. And then we come to the Razzie-winning central 'performance'. La Carey could have been replaced by a Miss Piggy doll and the central role would have had more animation. Mariah's singular expression of vague incomprehension never changes, not even when gangster Terrence Howard grabs her face! To be fair she is not Glitter's only zombie marionette. Outside of Ann Magnusson's over-the-top pr woman, no actor in Glitter's 100 minute running time seems committed to being in any way memorable. A cynical person might suggest that they did this so that they could keep Glitter off their resumes without fear of contradiction. The result is a movie that defies any viewer to keep paying attention to it. You find yourself wanting to make a salad or do your taxes while the movie is playing, anything so that the time spent watching it is not a total waste. This brings us to the music. Hollywood seems to have forgotten that the most important element in any musical is music, despite the fact that the word is right there in the name of the genre. Grease turns into a pretty bad movie whenever the singing stops and The Bodyguard is only marginally better. Both were huge hits however, and the fact that their soundtracks went multi-platinum was not a coincidence. Purple Rain features some downright cringe inducing 'acting' by Prince and Appolonia, but redeems itself time and time again with great musical performances. Viewers will put up with so-so filler in a musical as long as the songs entertain and remain in the mind after the credits roll. Glitter, unfortunately, features Mariah's worst ever (and worst selling) album at its core. Not only are the musical sequences not entertaining on their own, but they also make it hard for the viewer to swallow the idea that fictional Mariah would become a superstar on the strength of them, since actual established star Mariah could not manage to peddle them in real life. Thus, the fictional Mariah fails to engage as a performer, the actual Mariah fails to cross over into Hollywood despite having great singing talent and only having to play a person with singing talent, and even the spectacle of these failures fails to entertain on the basic level of a train wreck. Glitter simply cannot provide an adequate reason to exist. Mariah's musical ability has already been showcased in a long succession of music videos, to better effect, and so we don't need Glitter for that. Rags to riches musical biographies have been done to death, so we hardly need another. The Girl in the Gold Boots told substantially the same story to drive-in goers fifty years ago! Heck, 42nd Street wore out this clichéd genre in 1933. If Glitter's only purpose was to act as a 100 minute commercial for its own soundtrack, as the Pokemon cartoons are simply ads for Pokemon toys, it fails there too, since it makes these crummy songs even less palatable in context than they would be standing on their own. So why does Glitter still exist? Was it financed by someone with a grudge against Mariah Carey, and she never caught on that she was being pranked until after its release? As a practical joke played on a gullible and vain pop diva, Glitter is pure malevolent genius. If, however, we were meant to have taken it seriously, then it's just a really, thoroughly worthless movie.Poll question: Which pop diva embarrassed herself worst? JLo in Gigli, Jessica in The Dukes of Hazzard, Britney in Crossroads, Clarkson in From Justin to Kelly or Mariah in this piece of drek?

10.0,"In music she found her dream, her love, herself...","It's incredibly hard to view 'Glitter' objectively given the facts that it was a huge Box Office bomb and that also the leading lady who was supposed to prove she was not only a singer but a an actor too, despite being mentally ill at it's release. Now I'm not saying that this review is completely un-biased, after all, I'd been brought up on a healthy diet of Mariah Carey, but I did rent this movie a few weeks ago (it being not released to cinema) due to pure curiosity.The multi-octave song-bird's film vehicle (originally titled 'All That Glitters... a much better name I think) opens with in the early 1960's, in an all-black bar with a woman (Valarie Pettiford) singing a jazz/blues number before introducing her young daughter, Billie Frank (Isobel Gomes), to the semi-interested audience and the two launch into a duet which wows the crowd. Cut to the next few shots where Billie's mother tries to get money from Billie's father, before giving her up to an adoption agency.Fast-foward to the bright and bouncy 1980's where all-grown-up Billie (the aforementioned Carey) is dancing in a club with her two best friends Louise and Roxy (Da Brat and Tia Texada), who are soon offered as back-up singing gig for no-talent, good-looking up-and-comer Sylk. Needing the money, the 3 take the job, and the producer finds Mariah's... er... Billie's voice completely spellbinding - and chooses to use her voice instead of the God-awful voice that the main singer is belting out.A recording of a song entitled ""All My Life"" is handed to a Club DJ - DJ Dice to be exact (British actor Max Beesley who puts on a 'wigga' accent - sometimes really good, other times really bad) who plays it and instantly falls in love with the vocals. Upon discovering that the vocal used is in fact Billie's he instantly wants to be her producer (of course her beautiful looks have nothing to do with it!). So, makes a deal with her old producer Timothy (Terrence Howard) to take the gorgeous Billie and her back-up singing, loud-mouthed friends and take them under his wing - for the reasonable (!) price of ONLY $100,000! So the Dice & Billie end up becoming good friends and record a song, ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"", and it is played for music executives, and before you can change the butt groove in your seat, Billie is signed to a major record label.Of course, the road to musical superstardom is not an easy one and Billie has several troubles - the video director for her first single ""Loverboy"" wants her to parade around in nothing but a piece of string (Billie minds, Mariah wouldn't) and there's also the little problem of her undeniable attraction to Dice. The two become an item and she even moves into Dice's modern, typically New York apartment. Billie's first single unsurprisingly tops the U.S. chart - for ten weeks, at which point the record company are eager to release her first album which they want full control over - p***ing off both Billie and Dice.Our star-crossed 80's lovers start fighting as her career begins to blossom. She's invited to all the right parties and invited to guest on all the right talk shows - a dream she's had for many years, but amist all of the amazing goings-on, her two best friends are seeing less and less of her and Dice is becoming a drag - she even has to bail him out of jail before an appearance on a show. The two have a massive fight, leading Billie to move out (and Girl Power-ly slap his face). Her attempts at tracking down her addicted biological mother fail as the adoption agency have lost contact with her. Also during this time, she records a single with pop singer Rafael (Halle Berry's musician hubby Eric Benét). The duet, titled ""Want You"" is another number one for Billie, and her biggest dream is about to come true - she's about to play at Madison Square Garden.The day of the concert arrives and Billie returns to Dice's apartment to find him not there. Unfortunately Billie's day won't exactly go as planned - it seems, achieving your dreams sometimes means that you'll lose the ones you love. And with that, I won't go into the final minutes' in detail, but I'll just say that is very emotional.So that's the story, but were the performances any good? Well yes and no. Mariah Carey (although despite what you've no doubt heard) is a promising actress. Her acting isn't brilliant (yet) - there are times when you feel she goes overboard (especially in the emotional bits). I've found that her most convincing scenes (and therefore best ones) are where she gets angry. Her stereotypical best friends are good too and add a needed comical element. Beesley as DJ Dice is good, although he sometimes seems very fake. Anyone else worth noticing is probably OK.The soundtrack is brilliant. Carey's 9th studio album is a pop/r&b LP with great recordings. From the pumping 80's tracks (Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, Didn't Mean To Turn You On, All My Life) to the gorgeous Mariah-like ballads (Lead The Way, Reflections and especially Never Too Far) plus the Eric duet 'Want You' and the Ja Rule infected 'If We' - it's just as good as her previous efforts.Overall, 'Glitter' IS a film that the troubled songbird should be proud of. It is a drama, though - and watch that, don't think it'll be laugh-a-minute. It's emotional, passionate and with Carey in the lead - it's one rollercoaster ride you'll like at the time and will leave you wanting more. Recommended definetely...

3.0,Piling on...,"There is an American Football term called ""Piling on"". It's a penalty where the opposing team stops the runner and after the play is blown dead, opposing players keep jumping on the guy with ball--a definite no-no. Well, to me, this film conjures up this term, as when the film came out, reviewers seemed to come out of the woodwork to say how terrible the film was. In fact, they took great delight in talking about how bad the film was--shortly after release it was already legendary--perhaps made more so by Mariah Carey's nervous breakdown. Many speculated that this film led to this. Well, while I'd never say this is a good film, it certainly wasn't as bad as they said and it seemed that people were just piling on poor Mariah. Now I am NOT a fan of her music--up until this film, I barely ever heard any of it, but I felt bad for her because of all the hubbub.As I said, the film isn't good but it isn't terrible. The biggest problems were with the script--which was essentially A STAR IS BORN. The film had already been made too many times by the time Barbra Streisand did it a few decades ago--now, the story is so old and has been done so many times that it just seemed like a giant cliché. In many ways, also, Mariah's character seemed a bit like a battered woman and it felt frustrating that she kept holding on to a guy who was an obvious jerk--making her character seem a bit pathetic. Additionally, the film suffered, at least for me, with a severe case of ""music video-itis"". In other words, there were so many musical numbers, at times it seemed more like a bunch of music videos strung together with a bare plot--not a real film. Of course, there have been much worse examples of this type of film--such as Paul McCartney's GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET--which had significantly less plot than GLITTER (yes, it is possible).But, on the positive side, Ms. Carey sure can sing and was absolutely beautiful--in fact, stunning. Also, her acting (which took a lot of abuse) wasn't that bad, either. In fact, had this film gone over a bit better, I could have seen her going on to other acting projects and improving her craft. Now, however, I don't think there's a chance in a billion! So, my overall verdict is that this is an okay film at best. However, it did not deserve all the attention the Razzies gave it--it's not really a movie that is enjoyably bad...just a bit dull and very predictable. However, if you adore her music, you could do a lot worse than see this film.Poor Mariah. After this film tanked, all she had was her immense fortune and jet-set life.",piling,there is american football term called piling its penalty where opposing team stops runner after play is blown dead opposing players keep jumping guy with ball definite no no well me this film conjures up this term as when film came out reviewers seemed come out woodwork say how terrible film was fact they took great delight talking about how bad film was shortly after release it was already legendary perhaps made more so by mariah careys nervous breakdown many speculated that this film led this well while id never say this is good film it certainly wasnt as bad as they said it seemed that people were just piling poor mariah now i am not fan her music up until this film i barely ever heard any it but i felt bad her because all hubbub as i said film isnt good but it isnt terrible biggest problems were with script which was essentially star is born film had already been made too many times by time barbra streisand did it few decades ago now story is so old has been done so many times that it just seemed like giant clich many ways also mariahs character seemed bit like battered woman it felt frustrating that she kept holding guy who was obvious jerk making her character seem bit pathetic additionally film suffered at least me with severe case music video itis other words there were so many musical numbers at times it seemed more like bunch music videos strung together with bare plot not real film course there have been much worse examples this type film such as paul mccartneys give my regards broad street which had significantly less plot than glitter yes it is possible but positive side ms carey sure can sing was absolutely beautiful fact stunning also her acting which took lot abuse wasnt that bad either fact had this film gone over bit better i could have seen her going other acting projects improving her craft now however i dont think theres chance billion so my overall verdict is that this is okay film at best however it did not deserve all attention razzies gave it its not really movie that is enjoyably bad just bit dull very predictable however if you adore her music you could do lot worse than see this film poor mariah after this film tanked all she had was her immense fortune jet set life,0.5181063051825765,0.01501228996991711,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.29}"
4.0,A Typical Film to Promote Mariah Carey as an Actress,"A simple girl Billie Frank (Mariah Carey), abandoned by her alcoholic mother, meets a DJ, falls in love with him and becomes a star. Certainly there will be a superficial turning plot and a happy end. Actually it is a shallow and ridiculous plot, only to promote Mariah Carey as an actress. Her performance is something that deserves to be commented. In the past, Mariah Carey had a beautiful face. Get the VHS 'The First Vision', and you will see a gorgeous woman with brunet curled hair, natural eyebrows, nose and cheeks. Now, this female version of Michael Jackson is pathetic, with blond straight hair, thin nose and eyebrows and cheeks with silicone. Her acting is ridiculous, blinking all the time. When she is happy, she blinks. When she is sad, she blinks. When she is in love, she blinks. The number of times she blinks along this flick could be a reason for a funny game: 'Guess how many times she will blink in such a period of the movie?'

Even if a movie is BAD, I can still often get a kick out of it.

That said, I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon some show on MTV about celebrities' homes during a segment about Pariah Careless herself. Let's just say that I used to think she was the Devil. Now I know that there are worse, more pretentious, and just all-around truly more terrible and terrifying things than the Devil. She's straight out of H P Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos.

,"This is what an ""Average"" bad movie looks like","It took me two tries to get through this movie. Although it did have redeeming qualities, it was kind of boring. If you're a big Mariah Carey fan, I suppose this would be about a 5 but other than that, in my humble opinion, it falls into that ""average-bad"" category. I can explain what I mean. I've seen a lot of bad movies, for proof you can read some of my other reviews on this site, which are mostly of Bottom 100 movies. When you have seen as many b-movies as I have, some stand out as being alright, while some are just unbelievably terrible and you can't understand how they were ever made. Glitter is between those two categories. It's got some decent music in it, and things do go on (Unlike Gigli or Ishtar). However, it is kind of underwhelming and boring. What really took this movie down a couple of points for me was a unique volume problem. Mariah Carey's acting is okay, but she speaks her lines very softly. This makes me crank up the volume to hear what she is saying. However, leaving it up came back to haunt me later in the movie as there are scenes that are pretty loud and will blast your ears. In conclusion, this is a dime-a-dozen bad movie. It's not super-painful but it's also not quite good enough to be one of those underrated low-budget movies.",this is what average bad movie looks like,it took me two tries get through this movie although it did have redeeming qualities it was kind boring if youre big mariah carey fan i suppose this would be about 5 but other than that my humble opinion it falls into that average bad category i can explain what i mean ive seen lot bad movies proof you can read some my other reviews this site which are mostly bottom 100 movies when you have seen as many b movies as i have some stand out as being alright while some are just unbelievably terrible you cant understand how they were ever made glitter is between those two categories its got some decent music it things do go unlike gigli or ishtar however it is kind underwhelming boring what really took this movie down couple points me was unique volume problem mariah careys acting is okay but she speaks her lines very softly this makes me crank up volume hear what she is saying however leaving it up came back haunt me later movie as there are scenes that are pretty loud will blast your ears conclusion this is dime dozen bad movie its not super painful but its also not quite good enough be one those underrated low budget movies,0.5550385802469138,-0.07952932098765426,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.27}"
2.0,"""Glitter"" : All These Years Later","First, let me start by confessing something I freely admit. I am 100% a fan of Mariah Carey....as a singer. It's almost like what the girls in the '60s probably had when they looked at the Beatles. Whenever she's on TV or I listen to her music,I just naturally feel good.However, when it comes to ""Glitter"", yes I, like most,was really let down. I wont even go into the plot since it's a moot point at this time. Not even 100 years will change or make this film any better. Even though I'm a fan, I'm not so one sided in thought that I'd just accept it.This film was a mistake from the beginning. Although the soundtrack is good and it's 2 singles ""Never Too Far"" & ""Loverboy"" were great choices. Whe a movie fails, so goes it's soundtrack.I heard about this film going into production back in 1998.Now, when a film this simple, takes nearly 4 years to make, that's the very first warning sign that it's not going to work. Not to mention some publicized production problems I read about.To clear up one muisconception by the way, the film's release date was Septemeber 21st, 2001...not 9/11. Althogh some feel that would have been fitting.Mariah herself stated on Oprah that she just wasn't good at saying ""no"" during the dizzying pace of her career in the 90's. I'm sure this was just something she contractually said ""yes"" too and moved on.Then,as happens with all ""super-stars"" (I hate that term) the low came after 11 years of riding high. There wasn't anything wrong with her music, she'd just been working too hard, too long and that's what led to this embarrassing moment and the one in 2002 on Total Request Live aka TRL.She has of course rebounded from all this,her song,""We Belong Together"" spent 14 weeks at #1 in 2005 and given her 2 otrher hit singles. The CD ""Emancipation of Mimi"", sold millions. She now does what ""she"" wants at her own pace and certainly has the market cornered on Christmas,As far as I'm concerned you at least deservea review that isn't filled with venom. Loved you in ""Tennessee"" and ""Precious"" though.But ... Keep on singing.

10.0,A Tour-de-Force!!!,"Move over, Meryl Streep and Dame Judy Densch...the next wave of young thespian geniuses is storming the screen, and the path is being blazed by stunning Mariah Carey. Given nothing but a bare-boned outline of a plot to work with, Ms. Carey explodes across the screen with a depth and complexity of character unseen since Vivian Leigh's multi-faceted Scarlet O'Hara in ""Gone with the Wind"" back in 1939. Every colour of the rainbow, and some even out of the range of the known colour scheme, are clearly and sharply delineated by Mariah in every frame of this masterpiece; every subtle shade and nuance of Billie Frank is drawn with precision sharpness and crystal clarity. It is said that the ultimate sign of true artistry in film is when one can look at any single frame of a motion picture and instantly know what is going on just from the facial expressions and body language of the actors within. ""Glitter"" certainly exemplifies this theory. At any given moment, one can look at Mariah's Billie Frank and instantly see every idiosyncrasy of the woman inside. The relationships she has with, and her feelings towards, every character she interacts with in the film is beautifully fleshed-out and drawn with a broad brush. Each and every word Mariah speaks in ""Glitter"" was meticulously delivered by her, and obviously carefully studied during perusal of the script.   Mariah delivers infinitely more than the one-dimensional Billie other reviews have led us to expect. Her transitions from despondency, to loneliness, to anger, to triumph...all brought forth with a crispness and clarity unknown to this age of the cinematic experience. And the ease with which she presents all these ranges of emotion draws you into the character of Billie, to the point where you hang breathlessly on Mariah's next word. She has such a natural talent, such an incredible comfort in front of the camera, that you instantly forget you are watching an actress playing Billie; you believe she really is Billie.  This can only be the smallest taste of what is to come from this future screen legend. Mariah has made her mark on the film industry, and now can, and must, move on to deeper, more complex roles...she must rightfully stake her claim as one of the greatest screen presences in cinema history. How marvelous it would be to see her take on some of the great female characters of literary classics, so in vogue today. A ""Jane Eyre"", for example, or Lizzy in ""Pride and Prejudice"". Many of Shakespeare's greatest works have remained uncommitted to celluloid; what greater compliment to the works of the master himself than to have them graced by Mariah Carey?   Please, do yourself a favour; you must see this movie, and see it with an open mind. Those who scoff are simply those who had already decided that Mariah would be a failure in the cross-over from music to film. They cannot admit they were wrong; for, unlike Barbra Streisand and Madonna before her, embarrassments both, Mariah Carey is a fabulous, fantastic, brilliant actress. Again, look at everything she was able to do with this meagre script!!!    Mariah Carey is the most stunningly beautiful, breathtaking, sexy, sensuous, heart-stopping woman ever to appear on the stage or screen. So many times during this movie, I realized that I was so captivated by her beauty that I wasn't even breathing; my heart was pounding so fiercely at the sight of her, I though it would burst.

,Really is that bad...,"Simple rule, if you are going to make a movie vehicle for a non-actor, surround them with some good actors, so if they turn out to have all the acting ability of a tin of tuna, you still have some hope of making the movie just bad, rather than bowel clenchingly awful.

Mom doesn't want her, dad doesn't want her. She wants to be a star, black and white guys fight over her. Lots of tradgedy. Lots of singing, lots of walking around in tight dresses. Everything ends up OK.I can think of nothing that would recomend this. If you are a fan of Mariah, she isn't photographed that well, there are no big stand out tunes.

,"Good movie, great music, Mariah not a terrible actress","The start of the movie, mostly black and white with a minimum of color, could have been the start of an Oscar or Golden Globe contender. That's if the quality of the acting and writing had remained the same. The musical quality, on the other hand, never went down--except of course for the fact that the music early on was more sophisticated and much of what came later was mindless but fun dance pop. If you like the kind of music Mariah Carey is known for, ""Glitter"" delivers. Most of the time I would consider a lot of that music to be garbage. But Mariah is one of the few singers of her style I can stand to listen to, and given that this style of music would be dominant in this movie, I actually found myself enjoying it. All the musicians were talented--except, of course, Sylk--who was secretly replaced by the phenomenal Billie as lead singer and didn't seem to know it as her mike was turned down and Billie's was turned up.I didn't think this movie was so bad overall. Sure, it's depressing, but plenty of good movies are. This wasn't outstanding, but it appeared to be telling a good story. Most of the actors were doing a good job. Toward the end, though, I realized this movie wasn't going to finish what it started, because it was only supposed to run for two hours including commercials. So the finish seemed kind of abrupt, and shocking. Nevertheless, the ending turned out to be satisfying.Of course, everyone seemed to point to one weakness in this movie. Yes, it was obvious Mariah had little acting experience. But in some scenes, I felt she did just fine. In others, where she had no challenge, she seemed capable of only three facial expressions, and one in particular. Wow, if she had really been that happy, this would have been a fun movie. Mariah probably was enjoying herself. Billie, maybe. But with a little imagination, I could pretend that really was Billie and experience the movie as if she was real.It wasn't as bad as everyone seems to think.",good movie great music mariah not terrible actress,start movie mostly black white with minimum color could have been start oscar or golden globe contender thats if quality acting writing had remained same musical quality other hand never went down except course fact that music early was more sophisticated much what came later was mindless but fun dance pop if you like kind music mariah carey is known glitter delivers most time i would consider lot that music be garbage but mariah is one few singers her style i can stand listen given that this style music would be dominant this movie i actually found myself enjoying it all musicians were talented except course sylk who was secretly replaced by phenomenal billie as lead singer didnt seem know it as her mike was turned down billies was turned up i didnt think this movie was so bad overall sure its depressing but plenty good movies are this wasnt outstanding but it appeared be telling good story most actors were doing good job toward end though i realized this movie wasnt going finish what it started because it was only supposed run two hours including commercials so finish seemed kind abrupt shocking nevertheless ending turned out be satisfying course everyone seemed point one weakness this movie yes it was obvious mariah had little acting experience but some scenes i felt she did just fine others where she had no challenge she seemed capable only three facial expressions one particular wow if she had really been that happy this would have been fun movie mariah probably was enjoying herself billie maybe but with little imagination i could pretend that really was billie experience movie as if she was real it wasnt as bad as everyone seems think,0.5205459770114943,0.16518199233716474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
3.0,Not As Bad As All That,"Essentially a bizarre makeover of ""A Star Is Born,"" this star vehicle for vocally gifted Mariah Carey is one most panned films of the 21st century. For 13 years I avoided it for that reason, but when I finally watched it, I was surprised to find myself in the very small camp that found the movie entertaining, although certainly not wonderful. The script is rather dull, and it keeps interfering with the songs. I found myself saying out loud to the director, ""Will you let her finish a song before you cut to more insipid dialog!"" There is some really nice music going on during the movie--not just Carey, but Stevie Wonder and Luther Vandross and others thrown in for good measure.
