10.0,One of my favorite movies of all time!,"Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said ""Krissy, stop it!"" and I just said ""But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!"", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.In the Pride Lands, Rafiki, a wise old monkey, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Taking advantage of the cub's naive nature, Simba's scheming uncle Scar, who is very angry because Simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend, Nala, but they go to the graveyard instead. There, the cubs are met by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, 3 hyenas who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. But Scar doesn't give up there, he lures Simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the Pride Lands to avoid punishment. In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar, through his irresponsibility, has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, and face Scar once and for all.I know that still that Beauty and the Beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination, but I don't understand why The Lion King didn't get the same treatment. I adore this film with such a passion, I will always defend it to the high end. I still watch this movie, ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, I still sing, dance, and rehears the lines back and forth. How could you not at least with Hakuna Matata? Timon is my idol, he's so care free, funny, and awesome during his drag hula scene ""Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here, 'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine, on this tasty swine, all you gotta is get in line, are you achin',? For some bacon? He's a big pig. You can be a big pig, too. Oy! Ahhhh!"", best scene ever in film history! OK, not in history, but one of my favorites, it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. If you seriously haven't seen this movie, see it! Who said that animated movies can't be true art? The Lion King is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.10/10",one my favorite movies all time,seriously i know that sounds stupid as this is animated movie but why cant we have favorite movie thats animated if you ask me this is disneys best animated film all time why do you ask animation is just beautiful story is powerful moving characters are terrific villain is one disneys most monstrous songs are out this world incredible not only is it my favorite animated movie this is one my favorite soundtracks with strong power elton john lion king is absolutely beautiful pleasure watch still this day i have say also that this story is just so beautiful its still one movies that will always bring tear my eye when i was 17 years old i begged my dad take me re release lion king him i being only adults besides parents who took their children see movie simbas father dies i started balling my dad looks around said krissy stop it i just said but its so saaaaad simbas daddy yes im sap i cant help it this is powerful movie pride lands rafiki wise old monkey anoints simba newborn cub king mufasa queen sarabi presents him gathering animals at pride rock taking advantage cubs naive nature simbas scheming uncle scar who is very angry because simbas birth means that hes no longer next line throne tells him about elephant graveyard place where mufasa has forbidden simba go simba asks his mother if he can go water hole with his best friend nala but they go graveyard instead there cubs are met by shenzi banzai ed 3 hyenas who try kill them but they are rescued by mufasa but scar doesnt give up there he lures simba into gorge surprise his father while hyenas create wildebeest stampede alerted by scar mufasa races rescue simba stampede he saves his son but is left clinging edge steep cliff scar flings his brother into stampede below simba sees his father fall rushes down cliff after him only find him dead scar convinces simba that he was responsible his fathers death recommends that he runs away pride lands avoid punishment distant desert simba is found unconscious by timon pumbaa duo who adopt raise cub under their worry free philosophy hakuna matata when simba has grown into adult he is discovered by nala who tells him that scar through his irresponsibility has turned pride lands into barren wasteland she asks simba return take his place as king but simba refuses still believing he caused his fathers death rafiki arrives persuades simba return pride lands face scar once all i know that still that beauty beast is only animated film get best picture nomination but i dont understand why lion king didnt get same treatment i adore this film with such passion i will always defend it high end i still watch this movie ever since its theatrical release 1994 i still sing dance rehears lines back forth how could you not at least with hakuna matata timon is my idol hes so care free funny awesome during his drag hula scene luau if youre hungry hunk fat juicy meat eat my buddy pumbaa here cause hes tasty treat come down dine this tasty swine all you gotta is get line are you achin some bacon hes big pig you can be big pig too oy ahhhh best scene ever film history ok not history but one my favorites it always has me floor laughing till my stomach hurts if you seriously havent seen this movie see it who said that animated movies cant be true art lion king is fantastic film deserves all its praise more 10 10,0.6023686868686868,0.23028282828282826,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,The Lion King: 9/10,"Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.My rating: 9/10Rated G for intense thematic elements.",lion king 9 10,released christmas day 2002 imax large format screens lion king makes triumphant return screen after eight years its every bit as majestic great as it has been before lion king mufasa james earl jones just had baby cub named simba all animals come ceremony except mufasas brother scar jeremy irons scar desperately wants be king but cant as long as mufasa simba are there soon simba is able walk talk is voiced by jonathon taylor thomas after hearing about elephant graveyard scar he his friend nala niketa calame visit it they meet three bumbling hyenas banzai cheech marin shenzi whoopi goldberg ed jim cummings but they manage leave unhurt scar is upset that hyenas didnt do job so he orders stampede wipe out both them but it only takes care mufasa scar convinces simba that he killed mufasa not scar so simba flees into exile lion king really benefits larger screen its lavish landscapes will be able capture you more you can really savor animation disney didnt need any humans so they could spend all time great story lush landscapes fact its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part pride lions music boomed really created atmosphere although i had seen this picture before i still was tense because way music played out most time i would just roll my eyes at attempt make me nervous but hans zimmers music really bowled me over made my heart do calisthenics unlike such new disney pics like lilo stitch songs actually did some good they took you out somewhat dreary mood put smile your face made your feet want tap along there were only few but they were very entertaining circle life song at beginning was beautiful with its perfect pictures perfect sound i really like james earl jones hes pretty diverse this time was no exception he seemed act like he didnt want do this role but he couldnt contain his excitement wanting do voice overs again he had done some work simpsons before matthew broderick redeemed himself me after atrocious ferris buellers day off by showing strong voicing as adult simba cheech marin whoopi goldberg jim cummings really had good chemistry together even though they didnt have much screen time irons was really good creepy as scar one those who you cant help but hate if that is him really singing brava be warned lion king isnt really youngsters it had intense thematic elements that should have warranted pg instead those that dont deserve it lilo stitch again mood that music script brought out could damper your day so be warned this is one movie where you can feel characters you dont say haha hes dead you say gasp im so sad if it werent gifted scriptwriters this movie would be kaput nothing not best disney movie ever made lion king is majestic movie not without humor that is almost all see my rating 9 10rated g intense thematic elements,0.5127632116311361,0.1934084783141386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"

It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is ""Can you feel the Love Tonight?"" but the others go without fault, ""Circle of Life"" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.

10.0,"A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making","Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than ""The Lion King."" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.""The Lion King"" gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, ""The Circle of Life,"" is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.When viewing the film, it is obvious that ""The Lion King"" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in ""The Lion King."" Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. ""The Lion King"" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts (""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, ""The Circle of Life"" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important.""The Lion King"" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to ""The Silence of the Lambs""), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why ""The Lion King"" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.If you haven't already, see ""The Lion King.""

9.0,Wonderful Music and Rhythms,"This is an outstanding work of animation. I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story.

Simba escapes, but Mufasa dies; Scar tells Simba that he is guilty for Mufasa's death,and the terrified Simba runs away, too sad of what happened.

10.0,A Timeless Film,"Ah...""The Lion King."" There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is ""The Lion King"" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. ""The Lion King"" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though ""The Morning Report"" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. ""The Lion King"" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. ""The Lion King"" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! ""The Lion King"" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.A timeless film!",timeless film,ah lion king theres so much i can say about this movie but all my comments always come down one thing this movie is beautiful pure genius timeless story i might be little biased my beliefs seeing as first movie i remember seeing theatres is lion king i still watch it regular basis know all words but im sure there are plenty people out there who agree with what i have say lion king is beautiful hands down it is best disney film ever created story is something that everyone can relate whether they are lion or not simba is destined become king one day just cant wait rule throne everyone can relate wanting grow up become adult do whatever they want not have worry about anything his father tries teach him that despite fact that he will one day be grown king his life will not be easy simba has learn his lesson hard way when his uncle scar who too wants throne kills his father convinces simba that it was his fault suddenly growing up doesnt seem so great anymore i can really relate that so simba flees his home comes across timon pumbaa two other outcasts they teach simba hakuna matata lifestyle something that idealizes life free stress worry responsibility now dont we all wish we could live this way no worries rest our days but when simbas childhood friend nala returns he realizes that he cant live hakuna matata forever he does have responsibility his pride his homeland simba understands that he must grow up as we all do does whats right songs are catchy fit movie well original songs course though morning report isnt too bad score is haunting beautiful along with art work music captures heart africa with types shows that children watch these days boy doesnt that make me sound old its wonder theyll learn virtues values at all lion king is great teacher when it comes learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime lion king teaches children that its all right be kid but you must understand accept responsibility things you can cannot control everyone has place circle life we must find it film also teaches that we will encounter bad even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them move these are important meaningful lessons heck i even used them my sat essay lion king is film every generation is powerful film that all children should see im past my childhood now i still watch it whenever i get chance i look forward sharing it with my children timeless film,0.5482022363601311,0.19214466089466092,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.2}"
9.0,You Are More Than What You Have Become,"So...I'm going to try not to be too biased here...I'm going to compose myself the best I can...But, I'm not going to lie, that's going to be really hard seeing as though I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! I know a lot of people say this film is overrated and all that jazz, but LOOK AT THIS FILM and tell me you don't love it too!ANIMATION: Spectacular! This movie looks great! Of course it has an epic, grand quality about it, and the animation really takes it to another level! The stampede scene has got to be one of the biggest scenes ever put to traditional animation!SONGS/MUSIC: This movie brings us the Tim Rice/Elton John team. Even though there's no Alan Menken or Howard Ashman, these songs are still great! They fit the movie's tone, they're not out of place, and they are ALL memorable! This Disney movie has the best soundtrack - there is no Number One hit song from this film - ALL the songs are Number One! I don't just love the songs, but I am in mad love with Hans Zimmer's score! It's beautiful! It tells the story and fits the mood perfectly! The main theme, ""Lea Halalela,"" is fan-frickin-tastic! Gosh, if that theme were a woman, I'd marry her! But the music is what takes us to Africa (which country are we in? I don't know...), and if it weren't for Lebo M's contributions, NO music in this movie would be great!ROMANCE: For as much as I love this movie, I have to admit that this is one of the weak aspects of the film. I love the ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" number; I love the song, and I love looking at the animation. But...why is the song here? Why is this scene here? First of all, it doesn't match the story at all. It feels like the scene takes place because...Disney movies have romance scenes! Secondly, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love. Look at how other Disney films show love: characters are smiling, singing, happy, and would do anything to be with their romantic interest. Here, Simba and Nala are arguing and yelling at each other after the scene. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Nala as she's laying on her back during the song number, look at how she looks at Simba. That says, ""I want you, lion man.""CHARACTERS: I am in love with these characters! Much like the ""Beauty and the Beast"" gang, there's not a person...or animal...in this movie I don't dislike! My two favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: ""Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become."" OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like ""It means you are a baboon, and I am not!"" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki!STORY: I think the story is excellent. I love watching it, I love watching Simba's arc, I think it is brilliant...Though, there's one other problem the movie has that lies in the story. After Mufasa dies and Simba cries over his body, Scar comes and tells him to run away. Question: if they're all alone, why doesn't Scar just kill Simba himself? At first I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be right. First of all, he has Mufasa's blood on his hands. Second of all, he has a violent fight with Simba at the end of the movie. If Scar wants the throne so badly that he puts together an attack against two children, a Nazi team of hyenas, and a wildebeest stampede, I don't think he was above killing a child. The movie could have been over just like that; why didn't he kill Simba? The only reason I can come up with is ""If he killed him, there'd be no movie."" Well, that's weak. If that's the case, then the movie didn't need to happen. We should have gotten a better reason for the following events that took place.CONCLUSION: Despite the two problems I have with the movie, I still adore it! It's epic, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's musical! It is large! It has one of the saddest moments ever in Disney. It is one of the studio's biggest movies for a reason! Find out for yourself in the big Circle of Life!

10.0,A Disney classic,"In the African savannah King Mufasa, a lion, rules over the Pride Lands. He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.This film is definitely one of Disney's classics; it has a fine story, some great characters and catchy songs. Simba is a decent protagonist even if the plot demands that he isn't too strong early on and Scar is a great villain; as are his trio of hyena acolytes. Given the film's 'U' certificate I was surprised at how dark it is in places; some scenes might disturb younger viewers as characters are often in real danger. The voice cast is very impressive; notably Jeremy Irons, as Scar, James Earl Jones, as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson, as Zazu the hornbill who is Mufasa's majordomo. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all really good.

9.0,An impressive animated movie.,"""The Lion King"" is and will always will be regarded as one of the better Disney movies. And it deserves that!First of all the movie looks visually splendid! The African land scape's are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself.What makes ""The Lion King"" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has. The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments. The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling, unlike earlier made Disney's that mainly focused on only young children. Still there also is plenty to enjoy for the young ones, especially the characters Timon and Pumbaa shall be loved by them.The story is filled with symbolism and reference to mainly the communist regime.The voice cast is good, mainly of course thanks to James Earl Jones who has an amazing good deep voice. Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching.There are some typical Disney songs that are good. Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it. His first and only one but hopefully not his last. Also Tim Rice and Elton John received an Oscar for the song "" Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and were nominated for two other songs from this movie.A must see animated movie with some scene's and songs that you'll not easily forget.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",impressive animated movie,lion king is will always will be regarded as one better disney movies it deserves that first all movie looks visually splendid african land scapes are beautiful so are animations animals itself what makes lion king such special movie is emotional dept story has story plays significant role movie it has some good adult moments entire movie has more adult feeling unlike earlier made disneys that mainly focused only young children still there also is plenty enjoy young ones especially characters timon pumbaa shall be loved by them story is filled with symbolism reference mainly communist regime voice cast is good mainly course thanks james earl jones who has amazing good deep voice also three hyenas are voiced perfectly by whoopi goldberg cheech marin jim cummings jeremy irons who voices main villain scar really brings his character live makes movie even more worth watching there are some typical disney songs that are good also surprising good is musical score itself composed by hans zimmer who also received oscar it his first only one but hopefully not his last also tim rice elton john received oscar song can you feel love tonight were nominated two other songs this movie must see animated movie with some scenes songs that youll not easily forget 9 10,0.5415922619047621,0.3043786075036074,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Its a 10,"""The best movie I ever watched in any form or any in language"".No, I am not exaggerating! It is the best movie ever, whether in human form or in animated. I can't find a single flaw in The Lion King (1994). Someone could argue that the story is not original, Disney just twisted it. Someone could also argue that i didn't watch that much of movies to judge ""The Best Ever"" but as I said, this the best movie I ever saw. The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat.

8.0,Why the lion king is a near perfect viewing experience,"While the lion king isn't quite up there with some other movies, like the Incredibles and cars, the lion king is still great and so emotional. Mostly the scene of mufasa's death scene. Every single character is impactful. Simba is an amazing protagonist with a PERFECT arc, scar is PURE GENIUS as a antagonist. Timon and pumbaa are the single best comedic relief duo in Disney history, I'll talk about it more in reviews of movies that will require me to talk about them more. And every other character on the movie, the story and plot are like no other in any movie before or after this masterpiece. I could go on more, but I shouldn't because you know it's great, you all love it, it's the lion king.",why lion king is near perfect viewing experience,while lion king isnt quite up there with some other movies like incredibles cars lion king is still great so emotional mostly scene mufasas death scene every single character is impactful simba is amazing protagonist with perfect arc scar is pure genius as antagonist timon pumbaa are single best comedic relief duo disney history ill talk about it more reviews movies that will require me talk about them more every other character movie story plot are like no other any movie before or after this masterpiece i could go more but i shouldnt because you know its great you all love it its lion king,0.5701785714285714,0.3591964285714285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
