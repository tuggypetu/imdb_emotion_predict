9.0,An Engrossing Film!,"Neeraj Pandey's 'Baby' is a another winner from the Writer-Director. An Engrossing Film, that serves as an impressive espionage action thriller. Its well-paced & also well-acted! 2015...has clearly got its first winner! 'Baby' Synopsis: A group of Indian Patriots, track down Muslim Terrorists, who are planning a series of bomb blasts. 'Baby' has a decent first-hour, where the drama & the brutal action-sequences leave a mark. But, its the second-hour, which is a complete knock-out. The final 40-minutes especially, when our heroes capture the kingpin & plan to get him back home, offer nail-biting moments. Despite a long running-time of over 158-minutes, 'Baby' makes very good use of its length! Pandey's Screenplay is strong all through. The first-hour isn't without its moments, but the Second-Hour takes the narrative to an all time high. Pandey's Direction is equally competent. Cinematography is lavish, it captures the exotic locales of Istanbul, Nepal, Dubai & India, admirably. Editing is a bit loose at times, but is otherwise crisp. Action-Sequences are raw, but effective. Background Score is superb. Performance-Wise: Akshay Kumar is in top-form. Its so nice to see the talented actor donning a serious role, after a hiatus. He's tough throughout. Anupam Kher, who enters the scene pretty late, is remarkable. His scenes with Akshay provide genuine humor. Danny Denzongpa is superb. Rana Daggubati & Taapsee Pannu are decent in brief roles. Kay Kay Menon, Sushant Singh & Rasheed Naz are menacing as the conniving villains.On the whole, 'Baby' works big time.

10.0,One of the Best!! Well... at least the Second Half is!,"I'm a movie buff and watch almost every movie. Last time, I was so excited about a movie was when I saw Ugly! Talking about Neeraj Pandey, I'm among those very people who didn't find the climax of Special Chabbees exciting. In fact, I was able to guess the finale long before it started. And so for me, the finale was the weakest link in Special Chhabees. For A Wednesday, it was a great thriller from start till end.Now coming to the Baby! The first half started with bang and I was really looking forward to the movie. However, right about the interval, I was thinking that it wasn't all that great! And that's where I was wrong. With the entry of Taapsee Pannu, started a race against time. And here's where Neeraj Pandey really really blew my mind. That's how a thriller is made. Stupid movies like Race 2 ought to learn from this movie. The second half kept me at the edge of my seat that seldom any Hindi movie does.Kudos to the Baby team for contributing such a gem to Indian Cinema. Thrillers like A Wednesday, Ugly, and Baby are a rare treat to movie goers like me, who just can't leave their brains at home. The critics can find all the fault they want in this movie, but for me it's one of Neeraj's best.Akshay did a very good job. He is a versatile actor who should do more sensible movies instead of movies like Once Upon A Time In Mumbai - 2. But I'm all praise for Tapsee Pannu. Unlike every Telugu movie, where the heroine is a Bimbo, Tapsee showed her acting prowess with this movie. Anupam Kher was excellent as always. Not much can be said about Rana Daggubati as his role wasn't meaty enough! All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Will definitely see again on Silver Screen, too! Urge you all to watch this movie if you really want a fast paced Indian thriller.",one best well at least second half is,im movie buff watch almost every movie last time i was so excited about movie was when i saw ugly talking about neeraj pandey im among those very people who didnt find climax special chabbees exciting fact i was able guess finale long before it started so me finale was weakest link special chhabees wednesday it was great thriller start till end now coming baby first half started with bang i was really looking forward movie however right about interval i was thinking that it wasnt all that great thats where i was wrong with entry taapsee pannu started race against time heres where neeraj pandey really really blew my mind thats how thriller is made stupid movies like race 2 ought learn this movie second half kept me at edge my seat that seldom any hindi movie does kudos baby team contributing such gem indian cinema thrillers like wednesday ugly baby are rare treat movie goers like me who just cant leave their brains at home critics can find all fault they want this movie but me its one neerajs best akshay did very good job he is versatile actor who should do more sensible movies instead movies like once upon time mumbai 2 but im all praise tapsee pannu unlike every telugu movie where heroine is bimbo tapsee showed her acting prowess with this movie anupam kher was excellent as always not much can be said about rana daggubati as his role wasnt meaty enough all all i really enjoyed this movie will definitely see again silver screen too urge you all watch this movie if you really want fast paced indian thriller,0.4903571428571429,0.17328947368421058,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.17}"

10.0,"Simply put Akshay's best performance,Neeraj's best film, one of India's best thrillers = A MASTERPIECE... A film made on international standards","Ajay Singh Rajput (akshay) is a commando who works in anti-terrorist unit and he works in a team called Baby which is led by the patriotic Firoze Ali Khan (danny). At one point, Firoze tells the ministry that something has to be done to win the confidence of the minorities in India and this would prevent Pakistan from taking advantage. And then there is a hardcore terrorist Bilal Khan (kay kay menon) planning his evil methods to cause fear. How things take shape forms the rest.The director has come up with a realistic storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was taut and attention grabbing. The dialogues were well written. The script was thrilling, out of the box and the screenplay made the film very tight and racy. The background score was intense and there are no songs which is quite relieving. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was majestic. Akshay Kumar has given career best performance, somebody please give him a national award. MINDBLOWN.A true bollywood superstar.Danny Denzongpa was dazzling. Rana Daggubati was good. Taapsee Pannu was top notch, watch out for her fantastic action scene.The best among the lot was Anupam Kher, he was superb. Kay Kay Menon was apt. Madhurima Tuli was neat. Sushant Singh was entertaining.Any film that deals with patriotism is inspiring but when you start looking at a world which is hardly known to you, it gets intriguing. This is the attempt from this team and it sure was amazing, almost pathbreaking one. The first half goes around with the layering of the plot and it is filled with its share of action, drama and powerful dialogues. The interval bang was great and the second half continues the same momentum in connecting the dots, the last 40 min is heart pounding stuff its cinema at its best.This is a film which is not only good in its packaging but will leave you with a sense of respect for the brave officers.Overall Baby is India's best edge of seat thriller, its taut,gripping,fast paced,has amazing action and mindblowing performances.A MASTERPIECE in a true sense. Neeraj Pandey who is one of India's finest directors we saw his brilliance with A Wednesday, and Special 26 .But Baby is his best.Take a bow sir. The way he shot the film so beautiful at international standards, and the action is so real, simply amazing.Baby finally evokes patriotism.You will be proud to be Indian. Left me speechless.Watch one of India's finest thrillers. Its your loss if you don't...

9.0,Masterpiece for Indian Cinema,"Its rare, in its extremity, for Bollywood to make a masterpiece. But once in a while they do and this year Neeraj Pandey and Akshya Kumar gave a classic like ""BABY"". Every scene, background score,cinematography and almost everything is done to perfection. And that second half will glue you to your seat! Such a thrill, such a tension,the effort put by director is so brilliant that you will feel like cheering up. None of the characters are wasted.

7.0,And Bollywood delivers a rare gem!!!,"If you are a Ek tha tiger, Dhoom 3, HNY, Bang Bang fanboy/girl, do not watch this movie and do not read this review either, it's just not for you. Akshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.MOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7. It focuses on modern warfare--an indirect one--proxy war, which is much spoken about in reference to India in recent times 8. Kick ass background score 9. Cool Spy v/s bad guys 10. funny Akshay Anupam Kher duoOn negatives: Yes even i think the movie was a bit lengthy, if the director had trimmed it 10-15 minutes it would had been great. Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies.

10.0,A thriller that India will always be proud of !,"Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.I have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5.",thriller that india will always be proud,though i dont categorize movies basis their region or country i had mentioned this title regarding india being proud this movie this is because i have heard people yelling social media public about low standards indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied hollywood i agree them o most occasions but this one i would strongly recommend people who complain about lack good movies bollywood go watch it or else stop complaining these craps coming movie it describes biggest agenda world is facing right now i e terrorism best way it could story comprises many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel smooth flow script we are lost hustle going front us are keen know what is coming next first half makes plot movie second half unleashes execution each every scenes complements its predecessor we are biting our nails without even noticing it last hour is full thrilling actions grueling proceedings talking about acting i must say akshay kumar has delivered role his life very convincingly he lives his character puts that extra amount thrill via his superb action danny plays his role quite brilliantly anupam tapsee kay kay other supporting casts act life their characters make this movie combo power packed performances director neeraj pandey has already made wednesday sp 26 past thats why there was very little scope improvement him but i would be lying if i dont say that this is notch higher that his earlier masterpieces editing is quite crisp screenplay is soul this movie while bm is equally engaging cinematography is grand deserve applause dialogues are apt support movie lot music is average rightly so choreography is nil while action is breathtaking it has few flaws here there few scenes but those are hardly noticed due fast paced drama screenplay overall standing ovation neeraj akshay give us indians movie feel proud it can easily go into books as one best hindi movies movie hollywood standard execution who knows akshay might get shot at his dream wining national award i wont be surprised if he gets one along with neeraj pandey it also has potential be indias official oscar entry next year i have rated this movie comparing it other indian movies otherwise i would universally give it 9 or 9 5,0.460940065681445,0.22301416256157636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"

Here 'BABY' refers to a mission started by some agents including Akshay kumar in order to grasp some powerful terrorists and one among them was Bilal Khan (Kay Kay Menon).I would recommend this film to each and everyone as it is one of the best movies of Indian Cinema which are made against terrorists.

10.0,Excellent,"Really well directed and excellent movie. Different approach and most important is the gripping story line and narration. A ""MUST WATCH"" movie in theater. The cinematography is good and is a delight to watch and synchronizes well with the movie. And needless to say, one of plus points of the movie is Akshay Kumar's acting as an authentic security officer. Taapsee is a delight to watch. Rana Daggubati's acting is also very good and has done a very good job as another security officer. The storyline and the plot are new and refreshing which highly complements the movie. The songs are good and matches well with the movie without boring or torturing the audience. If you liked the songs in Neeraj Pandey's previous movie ""Special 26"", then you are sure to like this too, actually the songs are even more good in Baby.

9.0,Perhaps the best spy action thriller in Bollywood,"Baby is Bollywood's answer to Argo!!!!!!!!! The entire plot has been amazingly crafted. The performance of the entire cast was amazing. Bollywood rarely produces movies nowadays that are watchable, and in between comes this gem of a movie. The first half of the movie is good. However the real plot comes into play in the second half. The last 45-50 minutes of the the movie were so engaging that I could not remove my eyes from the theater screen. And the biggest merit of the film is the fact that there are no songs in the movie, only background music is there.Akshay Kumar has played a superb role. Its time that he should realize the fact that he looks really amazing doing films like holiday, baby and Special 26, and that he should stop doing mindless commercial movies. Danny and Anupam Kher are great at their roles. The action scenes are amazing, and cinematography is good. The best part of the movie is its direction. Neeraj Pandey has made two awesome movies earlier, and with this film he sets the standards even higher. Why cant Bollywood have more of Neeraj Pandeys and Hiranis and Anurag Kashyaps?

8.0,BABY is a daring attempt which should be lauded and appreciated,"Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine -Neeraj Pandey's BABY will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitementAn elite covert operation group BABY learns about bomb implanted in various cities in India. They must investigate and unravel the terrorist plan before time flies killing thousand of innocent citizen.Directed by Neeraj Panday, whose previous work included A Wednesday and Special Chabbis, BABY will consume you right from the opening as Akshay Kumar gets involved into the investigation and the cat-mouse begins. From here onward there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. The scene where Akshay interrogates a suspect by stuffing him in a plastic bag is one of the best scene I have seen in recent time. The scene where Akshay Kumar's partner officer fights with another suspect before he comes for the rescue is simply mindblowing. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. Other actors do justice to their roleOverall , BABY is nail-biting , reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps.

9.0,Edge of the seat action thriller,"Baby is a superb espionage thriller with good storytelling, engaging script and patriotism with ample dose. Barring rana(he is a great actor but was not given much to perform), all the actors have given terrific performances. Akshay Kumar is perfect as Ajay, Danny denzongpa was classy and standard, taapsee was badass in her action scene, kk Menon shines in his typical style. But the show stealer is Anupam kher who despite coming in the last 30 minutes takes the limelight. Only drawback is the length and it gets dragged towards end. The walking scenes could have been edited.
