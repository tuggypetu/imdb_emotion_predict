1.0,I can't vote lower than 1?,"I will admit I didn't see this until a couple of days ago, and I was really hesitant of seeing it, after reading a lot of negative reviews on the film, and after seeing the excrement that is Disaster Movie. And let me tell you, after seeing this travesty for myself, I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie, Epic Movie(more like Epic Dud) is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude, vulgar, over-familiar and even contrived, and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur, Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie, and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia, it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad, the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful, and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now, that I don't like any of the recent Friedberg-Seltzer movies, merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films, but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie, I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in, that's how painful I found it. All in all, probably not quite the worst movie ever, but along with movies like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered, it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions, and one to avoid, even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh, I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox",i cant vote lower than 1,i will admit i didnt see this until couple days ago i was really hesitant seeing it after reading lot negative reviews film after seeing excrement that is disaster movie let me tell you after seeing this travesty myself i cant agree more with negativity while not quite as monstrous as disaster movie epic movie more like epic dud is truly terrible movie there are absolutely no redeeming qualities here humour just isnt funny it is crude vulgar over familiar even contrived constant flashing breasts was way overdone acting was really amateur jennifer coolidge carmen electra get my vote as worst actresses movie believe me that is not saying much willy wonka spoof was just as tired as movie itself as parody films like pirates caribbean chronicles narnia it falls well short terms sophistication writing is unbelievably bad characters are annoying plot just isnt there music was awful pirate rap was torturously bad i will say right now that i dont like any recent friedberg seltzer movies merely because not only do i feel that there is complete lack comedic talent their films but also their films come across as complete waste time just like disaster movie i seriously was considering turning film off 20 minutes thats how painful i found it all all probably not quite worst movie ever but along with movies like home alone 4 neverending story 3 freddy got fingered it is close complete disaster epic proportions one avoid even if youre thinking renting im not trying sound harsh i am just trying explain as much as i can what i feel about movie 1 10 bethany cox,0.5479761904761902,-0.19556547619047618,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.5, 'Fear': 0.2}"
1.0,This thing won't let me vote below a 1....,"After watching this movie, I just couldn't stop talking about it. Mind you, not in the sense that someone can't stop talking about a great book or show, but more along the line of how someone can't stop talking about their colonoscopy during a diner conversation. In other words, after seeing this you can't help but try and remove the stain it left on your very soul by vomiting out the experience onto others.This movie entered with the tag line of being ""written by two of the six writers of 'Scary Movie'!"" What they forgot to mention is that the two who wrote it were only responsible for writing the credits and all the jokes deleted for the sake of not causing mass suicide. Put more delicately, this movie almost makes Pootie Tang look Oscar worthy, which ironically enough was made fun of in the last Scary Movie for being horrid. Coincidence? Yeah, not even some sort of Karma dealing fiend would wish this movie upon the world.""So,"" you ask, ""What makes it so bad?"" I bet your thinking that all of the funny stuff was in the previews, right? No, actually there was no funny content in the previews at all, it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie. Much the same way ""Hogan's Heroes"" was funny to people who weren't in Auschwitz during the Holocaust, the previews are funny to those who haven't seen the movie. When you actually see the movie, you start to ask, ""Why was that funny in the preview?"" The answer: You can see pretty flowers if you ignore the fact that they are growing from the corpse of a man who died during a freak green house accident.Do yourself a favor, rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer.

1.0,Just awful,"In the past 10 years, I've probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark.It's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie, because there isn't much to say about it. I didn't find any of the gags clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think some of the set designs looked okay. The casting directors also found someone who looked surprisingly like Jack Black, although sadly the script didn't give him anything funny to do.Just avoid this. It's not even worth a rental.",just awful,past 10 years ive probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters this is first movie that ive ever walked out 45 minutes i couldnt handle torture anymore this is most unfunny piece garbage ive ever seen although i did get good chuckle when about 50 audience had left before halfway mark its hard meet minimum post length requirement this movie because there isnt much say about it i didnt find any gags clever nor did i find them funny i did think some set designs looked okay casting directors also found someone who looked surprisingly like jack black although sadly script didnt give him anything funny do just avoid this its not even worth rental,0.5465686274509803,0.12401960784313723,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.53, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.24}"

1.0,Epic failure,"It's a shame to see films that promise to parody the formulaic and over-constructed nature of ""epic"" films, but fail, and subsequently conform to what is now the ""spoof"" genre. In parodying said films, they merely reconstruct the setting (poorly) i.e. Willy Wonka's chocolate river becomes poo. The references to pop culture are 1: over used 2: Poorly used 3: Irrelevant and not funny. It appears that the budget was spent on midgets and a dance choreographer (apparently it is funny when medieval knights, pirates, dwarfs and oompa loompas dance). The narrative is infantile and not remotely funny, no imagination could possibly enjoy the pure nonsense of the characterization. Parody films are meant to parody and this one fails to come even close to funny, it irreverence is pathetic, not hilarious and the writers...well, where to start with them.If you like watching pictures move and people talk, this film is probably for you. If you like films that are intelligent in their parody and genuinely funny, then stick to the Scary Movie catalogue. Even Date Movie was better than thisand that's saying something.This film trades on the pretension that it will be funnyit is not, someone should report it to a fair trading body.

1.0,why do studios accept to make movies like this?!?,"There is nothing original here whatsoever-same old big breast jokes, oral sex jokes; sloppy tongue-kissing, spoofing of movies not necessarily worth spoofing, and using the same old actors (i.e. Adam Campbell) from other horrible spoofing movies. It is disappointing to see that actors who have received some acclaim from both critics and the public alike have starred in this-the worst movie ever made-worse than Grease 2. And only a few minutes longer than a regular TV show except without interesting commercials, it is highway robbery to make anyone pay to see this half-baked movie where writers, producers, actors and directors have only put half an effort to do something that at least would be satisfactory. And half is giving them too much credit. Unfortunately for Kal Penn, Jennifer Coolidge, Faune A. Chambers and Crispin Glover (you waited for this movie to return to the big screen? where were you last couple of years? in detox?), I won't be running to the theatre any time soon to see one of their movies any time soon.Studio decision-makers have to take a stand against these movies-and so does the industry.

1.0,An awful festering boil on celluloid that will make you lose your faith in humanity,"Epic Movie makes the otherwise dreadful Date Movie look like it has all the wit of a Marx brothers film. I choose to watch this, I will NOT dignify it by calling it a film as I don't want to sully the word, this thing out of morbid curiosity at just how bad a bottom 100 rated thing on IMDb could possibly be. I was not ready for this inept 'spoof' film that is cringe-worthily unfunny The lame pansy ass shots at movies actually spells out what the spoof they're doing is from!!! So it's not only vastly unfunny, it also treats the audience like some severely mentally retarded sloths (which, I'll concede, is in likelihood the coveted demographic they're going after). EVERYone involved in this soul-sucking piece of rancid dog feces should not only be deeply deeply ashamed of themselves, but should actually be sentenced to do community service of some kind. I think it's current standing of 43rd worst thing of all time is actually way to optimistic, as it's not one of, but THE worst supposed comedy I've EVER seen in my life.

But in all sincerity this thing is as painful an experience as having a gravel enema, while your eyes are held open by rusty priors forced to see grandma provide fellatio to a sickly dog who gets so exited his bowels go and he defecates in a baby sister's mouth which she gulps down with delight. No wait, this is worse MUCH MUCH worse. Now i'm not a movie snob in the least. my tastes range from Shawshank redemption to Polyester. From Die Hard to The Toxic Avenger. I love spoof films like Airplane, Naked Gun, Kentucky Fried Movie and Scary Movie (the first one).But I sincerely do NOT want to meet anyone who even chuckled once at this abomination. It's utterly and supremely horrid in every single conceivable way, from the wanna-be Anna Farris, Jayma Mays to the proof that Kal Penn in Harold and Kumar was his highest achievement in life to the brain numbingly so called 'spoofs'. David Carridine, do you need the money THIS badly? Carmen Elektra, what in the hell were they holding over your head?? must have been supremely embarrassing indeed as you were married to Rodman. Fred Willard, where the hell did your career go??? Poor poor Kevin ""Kids in the Hall"" McDonald how could you slum this badly??

,Tirelessly unfunny and will barely appeal to those with the most base requirements,"Normally I open my reviews with a plot summary to set the scene but also get me focused on the film I have just seen. However with Epic Movie I can honestly see no point because the ""story"" is a lazy aping of popular films and television shows in an untidy and unsatisfying mix. The film is of course described as ""spoofing"" these films but this is not the case because it doesn't spoof them so much as just ""do"" scenes from them. If it were funny then I wouldn't mind so much but almost without exception it is unfunny and crude. The target audience of teenage boys is clear with the inclusion of nudity and excrement but I do still think even for them it is poor.OK so teenagers and males have more basic senses of humour but surely not this basic? There is nothing approaching wit or intelligence about the comedy and it is no more developed than the gags you hear the annoying teenagers passing among themselves at the back of the cinema. I think I let out a very slight chuckle about twice and for the rest of the film the best I could hope for was that it wouldn't offend or annoy me. The excrement stuff was quite repulsive but what really got to me was the sheer stupidity and laziness of it all. It really is as poor as others have said and I suspect very few viewers will enjoy it.The cast can do nothing to lift it but in fairness they deserve what they get for being involved in this  I know everyone needs to work but surely they have some ethics like the rest of us, after all they are not starving. The usual rubbish faces are in the lead and I expected nothing and got nothing from them. The bigger disappointment is seeing people like Coolidge, Glover, Electra, Carradine, Willard and others  OK so they lowered themselves to this but couldn't they have asked to be removed from the credits. In particular Willard and Coolidge should be above this.Epic Movie is just what you expect it to do  nothing.

1.0,This movie is an epic failure. It wasn't really that funny.,"Blockbuster Movies are what make Hollywood into a successful business. These movies are so big they need the italic title 'epic' to describe them. So you would think, parody movies about them, would be, worth the big bucks and worth seeing. However, most of them, the most recent ones are pretty lousy and way low-budget. Probably one of the worst, is the film series, movie 'movie'-cash-in, created by director/writer duo, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. These movies from them, ranging from 2000's Scary Movie, 2006's Date Movie, to 2008's Disaster Movie, doesn't have the cleverness or smarts to take something serious existing, and make something new with their comedy. These men, are no Mel Brooks, Monty Python, or even Zucker Brothers. I think, the reason, why these two writers are not that funny, is because they create comedic movies that parody and reference recent pop culture without concern for the overarching plot or characterization. There is no bigger example of bigger mishap of that, then 2007's Epic Movie; which goes all over the place, ranging from parodies of music videos, viral memes, commercials & television shows that has nothing to do, with epic movies. It's a reference overdosed. Even, when the movie focus on movie parodies, they pick some of the worst choices to parody about. Honestly, ask yourself this, how do you, make a parody of already establishing comedy. The jokes are not new, nor fresh. Like really, what was the point of having 2006's Nacho Libre & Borat in this type of a film. What does they, have to do with epic movies!? The reason, why I ask this, is because, when most people think of epic movies; most of them, think classic historical fantasy setting, or extreme science fiction settings. In my view, I see those two examples as nowhere near that. One of the main criticisms of their work is that the pop culture jokes that they rely on become outdated within just a few years, with the things that they're parodying having fallen out of the collective consciousness. A few of their gags had fallen out of memory before the respective movie came out. Their tendency to base brief parodies on the trailers to movies that wouldn't be released until well into their own production probably has something to do with it, is jarring. Since this movie has little to no continuity, there is no stalks in caring for the story or the characters. Don't get me wrong, all the main actors and supporting characters were mostly fine, is this film, but when sub-plots, like a group of adult orphans, Edward (Kal Penn) & Peter (Adam Campbell), Susan (Faune A. Chambers) & Lucy (Jayma Mays), being force to be turn into food at the factory, are quickly replace, by a Narnia parody that overtakes the rest of the film. It's become really off-centered. Themes like that, and the out of nowhere, horrible deux ex machina ending made this film, really confusing. After all, there is little to care about their plot conflict. The movie treat death, as if a cartoon. These people get seriously hurt, and are perfectly alright in a few moments later. It doesn't allow enough time for these slapstick jokes to sink in. I get that most of the time, they trying to go the low-brow cartoon-like violence route, but most slapsticks comedies, work best, when you can really sense the pain and misery. The movie has no stalks. Then, there is the somewhat offensive, vulgar humor that movies like this, have. Other films work best with this type of humor, because it allow the scenes to have context. In here, it's mostly use as a throwaway gag like the pointless nudity, this film has. Even the low-brow toilet humor felt kinda forced. Yes, some of the gags in this movie kinda works, but most of it, really fall flat. The ""uncut"" version of this film, apparently decides that the best way to improve its below average comedy, is to add more same running jokes scenes as the original version. In my opinion, it does add anything, worth-while. You could argue that the spoof genre would have died out in the late 2000s regardless, as audience tastes moved to ""bro-comedy"" films, ensemble pieces and more intellectual comedies, not to mention the rise in popularity of quickly-produced, and, therefore, more topical web-based movie parody comedy like College Humor, or Funny or Die, but Seltzer and Friedberg helped completely drive the genre into the ground, with Epic Movie being one that officially signified its own death. These days, most spoof movies are relegated to Direct-To-Video. Due to the nature of their films largely being simplistic parodies of whatever is popular at the time, a number of other parody films in the same style have been wrongly attributed to them. This includes 2001's Not Another Teen Movie, 2008's Superhero Movie and 2009's Dance Flick. While, I wouldn't say, all of the recent parodies are super-awful. I do have to say, overall: Epic Movie is one of those, that is.",this movie is epic failure it wasnt really that funny,blockbuster movies are what make hollywood into successful business these movies are so big they need italic title epic describe them so you would think parody movies about them would be worth big bucks worth seeing however most them most recent ones are pretty lousy way low budget probably one worst is film series movie movie cash created by director writer duo aaron seltzer jason friedberg these movies them ranging 2000s scary movie 2006s date movie 2008s disaster movie doesnt have cleverness or smarts take something serious existing make something new with their comedy these men are no mel brooks monty python or even zucker brothers i think reason why these two writers are not that funny is because they create comedic movies that parody reference recent pop culture without concern overarching plot or characterization there is no bigger example bigger mishap that then 2007s epic movie which goes all over place ranging parodies music videos viral memes commercials television shows that has nothing do with epic movies its reference overdosed even when movie focus movie parodies they pick some worst choices parody about honestly ask yourself this how do you make parody already establishing comedy jokes are not new nor fresh like really what was point having 2006s nacho libre borat this type film what does they have do with epic movies reason why i ask this is because when most people think epic movies most them think classic historical fantasy setting or extreme science fiction settings my view i see those two examples as nowhere near that one main criticisms their work is that pop culture jokes that they rely become outdated within just few years with things that theyre parodying having fallen out collective consciousness few their gags had fallen out memory before respective movie came out their tendency base brief parodies trailers movies that wouldnt be released until well into their own production probably has something do with it is jarring since this movie has little no continuity there is no stalks caring story or characters dont get me wrong all main actors supporting characters were mostly fine is this film but when sub plots like group adult orphans edward kal penn peter adam campbell susan faune chambers lucy jayma mays being force be turn into food at factory are quickly replace by narnia parody that overtakes rest film its become really off centered themes like that out nowhere horrible deux ex machina ending made this film really confusing after all there is little care about their plot conflict movie treat death as if cartoon these people get seriously hurt are perfectly alright few moments later it doesnt allow enough time these slapstick jokes sink i get that most time they trying go low brow cartoon like violence route but most slapsticks comedies work best when you can really sense pain misery movie has no stalks then there is somewhat offensive vulgar humor that movies like this have other films work best with this type humor because it allow scenes have context here its mostly use as throwaway gag like pointless nudity this film has even low brow toilet humor felt kinda forced yes some gags this movie kinda works but most it really fall flat uncut version this film apparently decides that best way improve its below average comedy is add more same running jokes scenes as original version my opinion it does add anything worth while you could argue that spoof genre would have died out late 2000s regardless as audience tastes moved bro comedy films ensemble pieces more intellectual comedies not mention rise popularity quickly produced therefore more topical web based movie parody comedy like college humor or funny or die but seltzer friedberg helped completely drive genre into ground with epic movie being one that officially signified its own death these days most spoof movies are relegated direct video due nature their films largely being simplistic parodies whatever is popular at time number other parody films same style have been wrongly attributed them this includes 2001s not another teen movie 2008s superhero movie 2009s dance flick while i wouldnt say all recent parodies are super awful i do have say overall epic movie is one those that is,0.45647072226019586,0.06848655730234678,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.42}"
