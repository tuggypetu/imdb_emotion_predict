10.0,One of the best Malayalam classics,"I write this just a few minutes after I watched Kireedam for the first time. I am blown away by this film. After seeing films like Manichithrathazhu (1993), Manasinakkare (2003), and Kireedam, I have a totally new respect for Malayalam cinema. Because most Malayalam films are basically about super-hero men who walk around giving melodramatic speeches, I spent my whole life thinking that those silly Bollywood blockbusters were India's best films. But now I know better. While the Hindi film industry has offered some fine films (e.g., Dil Chahta Hai and Sholay), the majority of the best Indian movies I've seen are Malayalam films.I became a Mohanlal fanatic after watching his performance in Mani Ratnam's criminally under-appreciated Iruvar (1997). For me, seeing Kireedam cements Mohanlal's position as one of India's top 2 or 3 greatest actors, if not the greatest.What makes Kireedam so special is that it is completely plot-driven. As we all know, a completely plot-driven film is a rarity in Indian cinema, North or South. Also, this movie is an intense character study both of a young man whose bright future deteriorates before his very eyes and of a father (Thilakan) who is forced to watch helplessly as it happens. Before seeing Kireedam, I never realized how brilliant an actor Thilakan can be.Kireedam is one of Indian cinema's best films, and it is a cultural treasure for every Malayalee. I actually think that I understand my parents' native Kerala much better now that I have seen this film.",one best malayalam classics,i write this just few minutes after i watched kireedam first time i am blown away by this film after seeing films like manichithrathazhu 1993 manasinakkare 2003 kireedam i have totally new respect malayalam cinema because most malayalam films are basically about super hero men who walk around giving melodramatic speeches i spent my whole life thinking that those silly bollywood blockbusters were indias best films but now i know better while hindi film industry has offered some fine films e g dil chahta hai sholay majority best indian movies ive seen are malayalam films i became mohanlal fanatic after watching his performance mani ratnams criminally under appreciated iruvar 1997 me seeing kireedam cements mohanlals position as one indias top 2 or 3 greatest actors if not greatest what makes kireedam so special is that it is completely plot driven as we all know completely plot driven film is rarity indian cinema north or south also this movie is intense character study both young man whose bright future deteriorates before his very eyes father thilakan who is forced watch helplessly as it happens before seeing kireedam i never realized how brilliant actor thilakan can be kireedam is one indian cinemas best films it is cultural treasure every malayalee i actually think that i understand my parents native kerala much better now that i have seen this film,0.4689689098780008,0.272530499803227,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Heart wrenching poignant tale!,"The film which made me die-hard fan of Mohanlal. Plot written by A.k.Lohithdas & directed by Sibi malayil talks about a young aspiring lad who's life became a hell (his dream seems tumbling off) when circumstance were against him & ended as a noted criminal. A.K Lohithdas scrutiny developed script given each character depth subtly without any unnecessary scene. Mohanlal as a stoic protagonist just mesmerize me with his natural acting, he is natural at his best. To my reckon, this probably may be one among those movie to unleash Mohanlal as a omnipotent actor. Its pity that Mohanlal just got special jury instead of giving best actor. Thilkan as his father was equally superb. Climax scene showing the duo chemistry was arguably best acted ever. In climax Mohanlal makes myriad of emotion and his crumbling emotion will surely evoke oodle of tears. Others supporting actors given ample support which is demanded by them. Songs by Johnson was masterpiece especially Kaneer poovinte, never a keralite can forget this song. Director Sibi easily tow all the actors performance & remain as his laborious work.

10.0,Young man's dreams getting shattered,"This is not just one of the actor Mohanlal's best but also one of the best movies ever made as far as characterisation goes.The lead character Sethumadhavan played by Mohanlal, the honest cop cum father role by Thilakan, the local bigmouth goonda played by Haneefa, the short but sweet role of Sethumatdhavan's sweetheart played by Parvathi, the villain role of Keerikdan Jose are still etched in the memory of all who saw the film. Even now people will have a lump in their throat thinking about how Sethumadhavan's dreams and aspirations get crushed one by one. Might be people were able to see themselves in Sethumadhavn's shoes and realising that their dreams are being cut halfway through, left them with a sense of helplessness and pitiness, which in turn got translated into love for the character and the movie on the whole. The film was such a huge success as well as critically acclaimed that two more sequels were made with the same cast. Mohanlal got a National special jury award for his sensitive portrayal of Sethumadhavan, a character which will remain in the memory of many a cinemagoer for years.",young mans dreams getting shattered,this is not just one actor mohanlals best but also one best movies ever made as far as characterisation goes lead character sethumadhavan played by mohanlal honest cop cum father role by thilakan local bigmouth goonda played by haneefa short but sweet role sethumatdhavans sweetheart played by parvathi villain role keerikdan jose are still etched memory all who saw film even now people will have lump their throat thinking about how sethumadhavans dreams aspirations get crushed one by one might be people were able see themselves sethumadhavns shoes realising that their dreams are being cut halfway through left them with sense helplessness pitiness which turn got translated into love character movie whole film was such huge success as well as critically acclaimed that two more sequels were made with same cast mohanlal got national special jury award his sensitive portrayal sethumadhavan character which will remain memory many cinemagoer years,0.47142857142857136,0.29123376623376623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,"A complete classic appealing to both the heart and the mind, For the brain-driven cinema fan","I am a Keralite,currently living in London, where I am surrounded by university friends studying theatre and visual media. All of them have one view of Indian cinema-Song&Dance filled unrealistic visuals. So,when I indulge in debates with them,I constantly tried to open their ignorance to the reality of Malayalam films. Fed up of my constant arguments they asked me to select 5 Malayalam movies which I thought would change their opinion, confident that it wouldn't be good enough. The movies I chose-Devasuram,Kireedom,Manichithrathaazhu,Sphadikam and Dasaratham. While they were watching Kireedom with English subtitles that I had edited myself,I noticed once again the amazing celluloid exhibition that has never ceased to amaze me since I first saw Kireedom as a 7year old when it released in 1989. In tune with the strong Indian cultural construct of family bonding, Kireedom(Crown in English) is the story of a family, particularly a father-son relationship. It is a story of how the most powerful of filial bonds is tried,tested and then tragically torn apart. Sethumadhavan(Mohanlal) is the oldest son and 2nd of 4 children of brutally honest and immensely egoistic Achuthan(Thilakan) who is on the verge of retirement from the Indian Police Force. As a Head Constable, he is leading a very simple life centred around the potential futures of his children.Primary among Achuthan's goals in life is to help make his elder son Sethu(Mohanlal) a Sub-Inspector.(He says his one goal before retiring his uniform, is to officially salute his son on duty) Everything is consolidated in the family's life and it is smooth sailing until Achuthan is transferred to a social hell as a punishment for trying to uphold the law against the scion of a political bureaucrat. This social hell is ruled by the notoriously vicious criminal Kireekaadan Jose,whose name and legacy emanates fear throughout this suburb. Achuthan's family moves to this hell as Achuthan takes up his duty as an honest cop. Meanwhile Sethu is on the verge of donning the uniform as he has cleared all the necessary exams and interviews. Then the catastrophic incident occurs that changes their lives forever. Achuthan is arresting a local goon and is about to take him to the police station from the market center when he encounters Kireekadan Jose, the feared underworld kingpin of the place. Achuthan is being beaten by Jose when Sethu sees this and tries to save his father. He fights with Jose against his own domicile nature. Surprisingly Sethu manages to strike Jose down-the key is that Sethu does this in a fit of rage without even knowing that the person he has beaten is the notorious Kireekadan Jose! Sethu's and Achuthan's lives change forever and they are driven by fate and circumstances.The movie then shows how the best of people lose everything in life even when they are trying to do good. This happens because of selfish human beings and a useless system in society. Jose who barely survives comes back with a vengeance and forces Sethu to a climactic fight to the death, thereby further ruining Sethu's already devastated life. 1989 saw the release of both Kireedom and Dasaratham, 2 all time great movies that cemented Mohanlal as the greatest actor in India. Kireedom's Sethumadhavan is a character whose scripting gave Mohanlal the freedom to unleash his entire arsenal of acting-It is a rare role where Mohanlal's potential is used to the max.Histrionics, body language and emotional moments combine to provide the viewer with a display of the very best acting seen on screen anywhere. Nowhere is this more evident than in the climax of Kireedom, a 5minute scene where Mohanlal shuffles between fear,panic,anger,despair,psychosis,primal aggression,sadness and a depressive breakdown. Thilakan playing the father supports Mohanlal to the core with an almost equally powerful performance which makes Kireedom one of the best movies in the whole of India, not just Malayalam cinema. My British friends were awestruck and speechless at the end of the movie and after discussing with me their views and clarifying their doubts because of the cultural differences, they sat down to watch the movie again. In the end, Kireedom and the other 4 movies I showed them were displayed in their lecture classes at the University where it was showcased as a textbook of champion quality acting! Truly a small tribute to the often acknowledged colossus of celluloid-Mohanlal. Hats off to you Sir! Thank you for Kireedom & everything else.

8.0,Malayalam Cinema's Classic Human Transformation Film Noir that hasn't been matched despite several remakes.,"Kireedam (1989) : Brief Review -Malayalam Cinema's Classic Human Transformation Film Noir that hasn't been matched despite several remakes. If any film is being remade we people say it must be a good film and that's why it is being remade but do we actually see the real proportions drew by orginal or do we even see how much credit goes to the original source? Kireedam has been remade 6 times in India but not a single film managed to match or even touch the closer mark of this orginal. Malayalam Cinema in 80s breached the code of human transformation and film noir with this Action flick. All the positivity at once tries too much but turns negative and it's so heart wrenching to see because it comes from a common man's life not any intellectual brain. The film is about a young dynamic guy who wants to fulfill his Father's dream by getting into Police Services but his life takes U turn after he encounters a local good to save his lovable father. Mohanlal in the lead role nails it in every aspect from action to emotions. The supporting cast does fantastic work as we could not point out a single weak performance. From Cinematography to Editing to Music Kireedam never lose the essence of it's storyline and the writer convinces everyone with brilliant writing and engaging screenplay. Sibi Malayil did a great job at director's chair and he really thought about every aspect while executing the scenes on screen. From cinematic nuances to commons theories he moulded everything in one solid shape and made Kireedam a perfect 80s Action Drama scoring high on Noir aspects. Kireedam is an influential film for mainstream action flicks (i have seen many films copying many things from it) trying to bring something amazing stuff apart from action, revenge, emotions and family values.

,take it a bit forward,"I completely agree to your opinion on the movie. But to my limited knowledge, not many superb films have a comparable sequel to them. In this case, I would like you to watch Chenkol, the continuation of Kireedam. As a matter of fact, many viewers have rated Chenkol lower to Kireedam. Even I did, immediately after seeing the move. But after ruminating over it, I came to the conclusion that the movie could even be rated over kireedam. Just because it is next to impossible to be brutally honest to the theme,carry forward the script and portray it. So, to those who have not seem the film, I recommend Chenkol. You may, just may, have a disturbing time after watching it. But its worth it.",take it bit forward,i completely agree your opinion movie but my limited knowledge not many superb films have comparable sequel them this case i would like you watch chenkol continuation kireedam as matter fact many viewers have rated chenkol lower kireedam even i did immediately after seeing move but after ruminating over it i came conclusion that movie could even be rated over kireedam just because it is next impossible be brutally honest theme carry forward script portray it so those who have not seem film i recommend chenkol you may just may have disturbing time after watching it but its worth it,0.5342857142857143,0.10119047619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,one of malayalam 's & mohanlal's finest,"Just recently watched the pathetic lucifer & wrote a review. It was then, I spotted this magnificent classic was listed in related section. It made me laugh & cry (just like sethumadhavan in the poster!) at the same time. How come lucifer have better ratings & reviews than kireedam. It tells you social media, marketing, box office & more importantly the idiotic fanboys decides the greatness of a movie. Sad really!!Anyways regarding this movie, it really doesnt need much of a review. Kireedam was everything, lucifer wasn't.

9.0,Heart wrenching poignant tale!,"The film which made me die-hard fan of Mohanlal. Plot written by A.k.Lohithdas & directed by Sibi malayil talks about a young aspiring lad who's life became a hell (his dream seems tumbling off) when circumstance were against him & ended as a noted criminal. A.K Lohithdas scrutiny developed script given each character depth subtly without any unnecessary scene. Mohanlal as a stoic protagonist just mesmerize me with his natural acting, he is natural at his best. To my reckon, this probably may be one among those movie to unleash Mohanlal as a omnipotent actor. Its pity that Mohanlal just got special jury instead of giving best actor. Thilkan as his father was equally superb. Climax scene showing the duo chemistry was arguably best acted ever. In climax Mohanlal makes myriad of emotion and his crumbling emotion will surely evoke oodle of tears. Others supporting actors given ample support which is demanded by them. Songs by Johnson was masterpiece & never ever a keralite can forget 'Kaneer poovinte' this song is enough to make anyone yell. Director Sibi malayil easily tow off all the actors performance deftly. This remain as one of his laborious work. Movie is juxtaposed in 140 min.
