,Don't compare it to God Father please!!!,"Asokan, Thevar Magan is no way similar to Godfather... Nayakan is. It was unnecessary to force the comparison because Thevar Magan is a very original story... and brings out the psyche of the Thevar community, their heroism, violence and honor. Your review otherwise reflected my opinion on the movie. It's one of the few films where every character has been well-conceived. And what a brilliant performance from all!!! Unfortunately, the director of this classic, Bharatan is no more. (He like many of his peers went unsung, largely due to the step-motherly attitude of the POP media (read Hindi dominated media) to regional movie makers. Thevar Magan is a great movie that deserves a hall of fame in the annals of Indian Films.N Sharma",dont compare it god father please,asokan thevar magan is no way similar godfather nayakan is it was unnecessary force comparison because thevar magan is very original story brings out psyche thevar community their heroism violence honor your review otherwise reflected my opinion movie its one few films where every character has been well conceived what brilliant performance all unfortunately director this classic bharatan is no more he like many his peers went unsung largely due step motherly attitude pop media read hindi dominated media regional movie makers thevar magan is great movie that deserves hall fame annals indian films n sharma,0.6060606060606061,0.1253787878787879,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,The Mother of all caste-based movies,"One of the most successful movies of Kamal Hassan's Rajkamal International production company. A cult classic that got both critical acclaim and huge box office collections. About a dozen movies were released along with it, on Diwali '94 but all these were reduced to box-office disasters(including the Rajinikant starrer 'Pandian'). Such was the impact of Thevar Magan. The thespian Sivaji Ganesan was aptly cast in the role of Kamal's father, the village chief. Nasser, Revathi and Gouthami reveled in their roles and Revathi won the National award for 'Best Supporting actress'.But more than everything, this is the movie which spawned a deluge of flicks based on the caste-feuds happening in villages, none of which could match the original in terms of grandeur, story or performances. Thevar Magan, upon its release, was literally worshipped by the 'Thevars', a warring caste in Tamil Nadu's rural areas. Some political organizations still argue that the movie itself is the reason for the violence happening in these villages.The telugu dubbed version 'Kshatriya Putrudu' was an equally big hit. Later the movie was remade in Hindi as 'Virasat', starring Anil Kapoor, Tabu, Amrish Puri and Pooja Batra. The Hindi version too was a success.",mother all caste based movies,one most successful movies kamal hassans rajkamal international production company cult classic that got both critical acclaim huge box office collections about dozen movies were released along with it diwali 94 but all these were reduced box office disasters including rajinikant starrer pandian such was impact thevar magan thespian sivaji ganesan was aptly cast role kamals father village chief nasser revathi gouthami reveled their roles revathi won national award best supporting actress but more than everything this is movie which spawned deluge flicks based caste feuds happening villages none which could match original terms grandeur story or performances thevar magan upon its release was literally worshipped by thevars warring caste tamil nadus rural areas some political organizations still argue that movie itself is reason violence happening these villages telugu dubbed version kshatriya putrudu was equally big hit later movie was remade hindi as virasat starring anil kapoor tabu amrish puri pooja batra hindi version too was success,0.40098039215686265,0.28480392156862744,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.06, 'Sad': 0.5, 'Fear': 0.06}"

9.0,my best Indian movie...,"What a 3hr show by the crew. Kamal Hassan and Bharathan has done their home work very well. The script is flawless. As many has said, this movie is like a village based Godfather. Outline may resemble like that. But the story plot is different in many aspects. Important things to be noted in the movie are the locations, BGM, dialogues with the peculiar language slang etc., I would call this to be the perfect acting by the veteran Shivaji Ganesan. This is different from his usual films which lacks reality in acting and more like a stage drama acting. Kamal hassan has done the best as always he does. Another couple of people to be mentioned for the acting are 'Kaakkaa' Radhakrishnan and Nassar. I still remember the acting of this man in the crew filled with masters. I think Nassar played an equal amount of natural acting just like Shivaji Ganesan. If I am awarded as a jury to pick an actor in the movie for his performance, I would go with Nassar. Again, this film is a tank circuit of Kamal Hassan and the maestro Ilayaraja. I really don't know from were the later gets his music specially for Kamal Hassan. Anyone can watch the film with the eyes closed. BGM will narrate the entire plot. This film's BGM can be considered as an example for the upcoming youngsters. PC Sriram, once again proved he is the best in business. Also the lyricist were equally good. You would never feel the songs as a disturbance in the movie. And the special song features the Tamilan's special martial arts ""Silambattam"" is too good. I would really select this movie to be one of the all time favorite of Indian and International film.

10.0,Class unmatchable !,"Shivaji and Kamal are two great legends of Indian cinema and if there was a movie that could get them together it had to be a movie as strong as ""Thevar magan"". Yes it has shades of Godfather but not completely. This story couldn't have asked for better screenplay.Role of Shivaji could be performed only by him. Kamal is often criticized for suppressing other characters in his movies but this is an exception , it has great characterization for everybody in the movie right from Shivaji to vadivelu. PC Sriram is amazing with his camera work and gives us pleasant visuals throughout the movie.The biggest asset of the movie is Illayaraja, his back ground music is heavenly, he brings out the intensity in the scene superbly with his BGM score. The story is already discussed by others but the highlights of the movie are - The Scene were Kamal argues with Shivaji on his decision to leave the village, The Panchayat scene were Nasser shows disrespect to Shivaji and the aftermath, Kamal's entry with the Devar getup(he looks majestic in it), The marriage scene,The Hospital scene were Vadivelu excels as a faithful servant to Kamal,Kamal's acting when he fails to convince Gautami, The climax scene after he kills Nasser.
