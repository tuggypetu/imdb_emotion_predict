1.0,"About what you expect from this sort of 'comedy'....in other words, hardly a laugh in the entire film.","There is only one reason I watched ""The Hungover Games""....it just appeared on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List today. This is a list of the 100 lowest rated major release films....and I am a major glutton for punishment, as I've seen 95 of the 100 movies on the list.It's not at all surprising that ""The Hungover Games"" is on the Bottom 100. After all, MANY similar brainless spoofs are on the list, such as ""Disaster Movie"", ""Epic Movie"", ""Date Movie"" and ""The Starving Games""--and they are more or less the same. This is NOT a compliment. Each tends to have a lot of very crude and juvenile humor and they are anything but subtle or intellectual...or entertaining. And, like these other films, the mashups simply make no sense...such as merging ""The Hangover"" with ""The Hunger Games"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Avatar"" and ""Snowpiercer"". The film abounds with sex toys, crude humor that falls flat and...well,...that's about it.The biggest problem with this film and other similar stupid parodies is that they are way too broad. First, they are very broadly written--with little subtlety and with an emphasis on crude instear of being funny. Second, they are too broad in their focus and would be MUCH better sticking with ONE film or one style of film instead of parodying EVERYTHING...which is often illogical and frequently mindless.So is this one any better than the rest of these Bottom 100 parodies? Well, there is a lot of gratuitous nudity. This isn't necessarily good....but at least it distracts from the 'humor'. In fact ANYTHING that tries to distract from the dopey jokes is a major plus. Heck, having Pauley Shore come out and juggle or read from the Yellow Pages would be a welcome distraction from the 'humor'! In fact, as I watched ""The Hungover Games"", I cannot recall laughing even once and it's no funnier than the other unfunny parodies on the Bottom 100. A worthless film in pretty much every way that was probably written by chipmunks...really, really DUMB chipmunks.",about what you expect this sort comedy other words hardly laugh entire film,there is only one reason i watched hungover games it just appeared imdbs infamous bottom 100 list today this is list 100 lowest rated major release films i am major glutton punishment as ive seen 95 100 movies list its not at all surprising that hungover games is bottom 100 after all many similar brainless spoofs are list such as disaster movie epic movie date movie starving games they are more or less same this is not compliment each tends have lot very crude juvenile humor they are anything but subtle or intellectual or entertaining like these other films mashups simply make no sense such as merging hangover with hunger games lord rings avatar snowpiercer film abounds with sex toys crude humor that falls flat well thats about it biggest problem with this film other similar stupid parodies is that they are way too broad first they are very broadly written with little subtlety with emphasis crude instear being funny second they are too broad their focus would be much better sticking with one film or one style film instead parodying everything which is often illogical frequently mindless so is this one any better than rest these bottom 100 parodies well there is lot gratuitous nudity this isnt necessarily good but at least it distracts humor fact anything that tries distract dopey jokes is major plus heck having pauley shore come out juggle or read yellow pages would be welcome distraction humor fact as i watched hungover games i cannot recall laughing even once its no funnier than other unfunny parodies bottom 100 worthless film pretty much every way that was probably written by chipmunks really really dumb chipmunks,0.5185632586367879,-0.011838235294117639,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.33}"

2.0,The Hangover: Frat Bros Edition,"This movie is dumb. Just look at the name. Yeah, I know it's not supposed to be smart but it is supposed to be funny, and unfortunately this is not. I will say that it is better than abominations like The Starving Games, Vampires Suck, Scary Movie 5 and Disaster Movie, but that's like saying dog p*ss is better than cat sh*t. They're both awful and both leave a bad taste in your mouth. This movie gets an extra point for potential. It's refreshing to see a spoof movie that isn't by the two that shall not be named, and some ideas in the movie do work. There's a plot this time: We follow the three Hangover guys (who bare a striking resemblance to their respective actors) on their Hunger Games adventure. I also like how the spoofs are limited to a certain character or group participating in ""The Hungover Games"", such as The Real House Wives, Ted, Thor, and a group of every Johnny Depp character of the past few years. Some of them are funny - I really wanted more of the Johnny Depps - but some just don't work. A team for gratuitous sex? I know it's making fun of the fact that a lot of movies have gratuitous sex for the sake of it but that's exactly what it's doing here, so it's like a spoof that's spoofing itself... and it's not nearly as deep as it sounds. I smiled a few times in this movie. The main cast was fine (the supporting cast had some horrendous actors though), and I like how the movie actually has a story and an attempt at coherency. But the number one thing I look for in a comedy are laughs, and The Hungover Games did not provide any. If you're smashed and with your friends and want to see a really dumb movie for some cheap laughs for an hour and a half then yeah you might enjoy The Hungover Games, but for anyone else, I implore you, don't watch this movie.",hangover frat bros edition,this movie is dumb just look at name yeah i know its not supposed be smart but it is supposed be funny unfortunately this is not i will say that it is better than abominations like starving games vampires suck scary movie 5 disaster movie but thats like saying dog p ss is better than cat sh t theyre both awful both leave bad taste your mouth this movie gets extra point potential its refreshing see spoof movie that isnt by two that shall not be named some ideas movie do work theres plot this time we follow three hangover guys who bare striking resemblance their respective actors their hunger games adventure i also like how spoofs are limited certain character or group participating hungover games such as real house wives ted thor group every johnny depp character past few years some them are funny i really wanted more johnny depps but some just dont work team gratuitous sex i know its making fun fact that lot movies have gratuitous sex sake it but thats exactly what its doing here so its like spoof thats spoofing itself its not nearly as deep as it sounds i smiled few times this movie main cast was fine supporting cast had some horrendous actors though i like how movie actually has story attempt at coherency but number one thing i look comedy are laughs hungover games did not provide any if youre smashed with your friends want see really dumb movie some cheap laughs hour half then yeah you might enjoy hungover games but anyone else i implore you dont watch this movie,0.48635307781649234,0.027409988385598154,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.25}"

4.0,Not even when hungover would this be a great movie...,"""The Hungover Games"" is one of those type of spoofs that mean well and tries really hard, but ultimately fail to deliver. Now, I am not saying that the movie is bad, it just really wasn't as funny as it was supposed to be. I can honestly say that I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie.For a movie of this type, then ""The Hungover Games"" takes on a variety of other movies, such as ""Ted"", ""The Hunger Games"" (obviously), ""Pirates of the Caribean"", ""Avatar"", ""The Hangover"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""The Human Centipede"", ""The Lone Ranger"", and so forth. It is meant well, I am sure of it, but the comedy just slipped through every crack possible.The acting in the movie was adequate, and people were doing fair jobs with their given roles, they just didn't have too much of a script to work with.I used to love spoofs, such as ""Hot Shots"", ""Scary Movie"" and the like.

While this film was still a letdown, I will say this; It wasn't insultingly unfunny like, say Epic Movie or Disaster Movie.

,Much better than its rating would suggest.,"I've been watching movies of all genres since the 1940's. So what is so wrong with this movie that it warrants such a low rating and so many negative comments? In my humble opinion absolutely nothing's 'wrong' with it, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed viewing it. The plot doesn't offend (it is what it has to be as a parody - KISS simple), the scriptwriting is excellent, the camera work/lighting is professionally done and the actors all do their part well. There was a synergism between the principal actors and they worked together really well. I can understand that the movie will not be to everyone's taste: the humor certainly is a little raspy-raw toilet humor at times but that certainly did not define the humorous content of the movie as a whole and there's an unashamed borrowing of ideas and more from other movies: but it works and works amazingly well! After reading other reviewers comments I didn't expect much from this movie but kept an open mind and I'm glad I did otherwise I'd have missed out on a very enjoyable movie experience.If I had to pick the most notable actor in this movie it would have to be the guy with the beard for his extraordinary portrayal of 'the other' guy with the beard in 'the other' movie. I also have to admit that I'm a fan of the beautifully sexy Rita Volk and she didn't disappoint. In summary then, nicely controlled tongue in cheek performances from the entire cast make for a very good laugh out loud piece of film entertainment.

2.0,Entering The Hunger Games Would Be More Enjoyable,"Spoof films are extremely hard to pull off. The key is to be subtle, yet not so much so otherwise the audience will not understand the joke. It is imperative though to not make the gags brash and obvious. This is where the alleged comedy 'The Hungover Games' fails.This parody stars lookalikes of The Hangover series and is supposed to be a follow on from 'The Hangover Part II'. The creators of The Hangover series had no part in this spoof and if they did, there would at the very least be something to laugh about. All you can find funny here is the incompetence of the Director and writers.In the film the Wolf Pack or the lookalikes of them get drunk again the night before Doug's wedding. Unfortunately for themselves they are entered into the Hungover Games and must fight to the death against other celebrities and film characters to survive.The only positive for 'The Hungover Games' is that in the opening text it informs us that this deathly tradition came about because of ""Hollywood's lack of creativity"". Now that I can agree with. Yet why mock the lack of creativity when the film you have possesses the same quality? It makes no logical sense but perhaps that is the point. As the film has no logic to call its own.The many negatives for 'The Hungover Games' can be collated into a list, thus outlined below. Pop culture references are only funny if done in a tasteful manner or with some notable skill. I know it's exceedingly odd to compare this film to a Disney one and yet Hercules knew how to handle pop culture references and still achieve the key for a comedy – laughs.Other jokes are either scatological, racist, homophobic, sexist or all of the above. 'The Hungover Games' never knows when to stop in terms of the excessive nature of the gags and its relatively short run time still manages to feel far too stretched for its own good.It's especially bothersome to watch when this comedy has less jokes than 2012's 'The Hunger Games'. I'm not sure how this was managed but its an impressive achievement none the less.Even the shots in the film are sickening to look at, filmed poorly and cheaply. People who took issue with the presence of shaky camera in the first Hunger Games film had better close their eyes promptly as well as covering their ears.I could go on and on about this films problems but I really do not wish to. In fact I would rather go and watch a comedy that makes me laugh to my heart's content. With every film I see, I feel that every single one deserves a chance.

9.0,This parody of movies movie is really worth your time.,"There has not been a good parody movie in quite a few years, the scary movies are about all we have left, and they have just gotten strange. So here we have the second The Hunger Games parody, in less than 6 months, and you could only be wondering one thing. Yes it is funny. Not rolling around on your back, or tears streaking your cheeks funny, but this is a good parody. There are a lot of exceptional cameos, and the main cast of Hangover guys are all better than you would expect. I liked the touch of having the character names in this movie be the names of the actors, it added that extra layer of unreality. There are terrible jokes in here, and lots of terrible acting to go along with those jokes, but and I'm no fan of Jamie Kennedy he was one hard working producer in this. I really did Enjoy this movie, and was totally surprised that I did. From the start though you can feel that this is a bit better than most of the crap they have been doling out for the past few years, and only barely, but because of that I do recommend this to most people. There is a whole district dedicated to gratuitous nudity, so you can expect some of that, and lots of very simulated violence, but the language is really quite tame. If you love it, or hate it though, stay to the end, the party snaps in the credits are beyond explanation, and after the credits is the biggest laugh of the movie, don't miss it.",this parody movies movie is really worth your time,there has not been good parody movie quite few years scary movies are about all we have left they have just gotten strange so here we have second hunger games parody less than 6 months you could only be wondering one thing yes it is funny not rolling around your back or tears streaking your cheeks funny but this is good parody there are lot exceptional cameos main cast hangover guys are all better than you would expect i liked touch having character names this movie be names actors it added that extra layer unreality there are terrible jokes here lots terrible acting go along with those jokes but im no fan jamie kennedy he was one hard working producer this i really did enjoy this movie was totally surprised that i did start though you can feel that this is bit better than most crap they have been doling out past few years only barely but because that i do recommend this most people there is whole district dedicated gratuitous nudity so you can expect some that lots very simulated violence but language is really quite tame if you love it or hate it though stay end party snaps credits are beyond explanation after credits is biggest laugh movie dont miss it,0.4827235772357723,0.044105691056910555,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2.0,No Hangover Cure,"The Hungover Games is the latest sluggish addition to the ""Let's parody anything that might be remotely funny"" category of film, lampooning The Hunger Games (duh), Ted, The Hangover series, Carrie, Django Unchained and others.This film steals so much from its peers, while at the same time lacking so many of its own original ideas that our main characters are actually taken directly from The Hangover. And for the most part, the storyline, or at least the first fifthteen minutes is also exactly the same as the 2009 Vegas Comedy. Just like in those movies, the fourth friend of the group is misplaced, leaving the first three to try and remember all the terrible things that they did the night before, in an attempt to rediscover him. I know this is a parody, but really? Word-for-word lines from The Hangover have been pilfered as their own. It's astonishing the true lack of any creativity that The Hungover Games possesses, whereas other awful spoof movies such as, say, Scary/Epic Movie seem to have some (very few) of their own ideas, here, ""writers"" Kyle Barnett Anderson et al, make it feel like they've photocopied Todd Philips' screenplay badly and then taken it for themselves. But it turns out our three buddies have been transported to Hunger Games Land where they have to fight to the death with all the other favourable movies of the last seven years or so. This takes all those films you may have possibly enjoyed over the past few years and throws them in to one terrible mush: watch as the Ted bear has a penis, Katniss Everdeen has had her name changed to ""Katnip"" (HA!), and Willy Wonka is a homosexual. Add to that pops at race, some Human Centipede ""jokes"", underage sex gags and just a little bit of necrophilia and you experience an hour and a half of pure film diabolica. And for the people who defend the jokes for being jokes, perhaps if they were funny, fine, but otherwise it just comes off as offensive and downright lazy. The brow for this movie is so low that it's scraping along the ground.I'll end on the only two positives: The people who play the Hangover team are very convincing, and the film itself is shot quite nicely. Otherwise, please, do not go and see this movie. I would rather have been dispatched by a Hunger Games arrow to the face then to have seen this film. Run – sprint, even – away if someone suggests watching this piece of garbage. @JonnyJonJon1",no hangover cure,hungover games is latest sluggish addition lets parody anything that might be remotely funny category film lampooning hunger games duh ted hangover series carrie django unchained others this film steals so much its peers while at same time lacking so many its own original ideas that our main characters are actually taken directly hangover most part storyline or at least first fifthteen minutes is also exactly same as 2009 vegas comedy just like those movies fourth friend group is misplaced leaving first three try remember all terrible things that they did night before attempt rediscover him i know this is parody but really word word lines hangover have been pilfered as their own its astonishing true lack any creativity that hungover games possesses whereas other awful spoof movies such as say scary epic movie seem have some very few their own ideas here writers kyle barnett anderson et al make it feel like theyve photocopied todd philips screenplay badly then taken it themselves but it turns out our three buddies have been transported hunger games land where they have fight death with all other favourable movies last seven years or so this takes all those films you may have possibly enjoyed over past few years throws them one terrible mush watch as ted bear has penis katniss everdeen has had her name changed katnip ha willy wonka is homosexual add that pops at race some human centipede jokes underage sex gags just little bit necrophilia you experience hour half pure film diabolica people who defend jokes being jokes perhaps if they were funny fine but otherwise it just comes off as offensive downright lazy brow this movie is so low that its scraping along ground ill end only two positives people who play hangover team are very convincing film itself is shot quite nicely otherwise please do not go see this movie i would rather have been dispatched by hunger games arrow face then have seen this film run sprint even away if someone suggests watching this piece garbage,0.5496000000000002,0.03016904761904763,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
