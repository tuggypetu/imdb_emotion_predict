8.0,A heavily commercialized version !,"In order to make the film presentable to the masses, the makers have opted for a very commercialized version of Major Sandeep's biopic. The creative liberties come into picture during the main part of the film, that is, the 26/11 part and it is understandable because as i said, masses will enjoy it.The first 30-40 mins i would recommend you skip. It was boring and the school sequences between Sandeep and his gf was kinda boring to watch. In fact, the love angle is the most bollywoodish thing in this film , a typical cliche love story. Hence it did not click for me.Now coming to the main part, the last 1 hr 20 mins of this film is a treat for commercialized action lovers. They have maintained a balance between realistic and rather commercialized unrealistic sequences. This last 1 hr or so held on to my attention right till the last second of this film. It was that interesting and gripping!The last part made me really emotional. His parents , unsure about what Sandeep's condition is, suddenly finding their son on tv being shown martyred was really painful and emotional for me to watch. Don't miss these parts.Other than that, there are certain fictionalized sequences that are far from realistic like some of Sandeep's acrobatics (mind you , as i said, it is done to make the film presentable to masses) or the terrorists being shown arriving at daytime while actually they arrived in the evening in dark time. Of course, by now we have seen so many 26/11 based films and sequences and all present that day in their own way.The media angle is presented in a sarcastic way here with little fiction. We all know how terrorists were using the idiotic media to track commandos but here Watch out for a fictional sequence where Sandeep would turn the tables and use the media to wreck the terrorists instead. That was like an ""ooooooooo"" moment. In fact there is one hilarious sarcastic sequence where a media guy covering Nariman Point would see the commandos getting killed and says on live news ""I can't understand how the terrorists are able to figure out that commandos are coming "" as he keeps covering them live. It was sarcastic.Songs , not one to remember. Performance by Adivi Shesh is terrific. He looks just young enough to represent Major Sandeep. He excels in the last 1 hr. Saiee Manj is average as she carries her one expression throughout the film. Prakash Raj too does a good job .Overall, must watch! Full on entertainment guaranteed . If you miss the first 30 mins also due to some delay to reach theatre, then nothing to worry you haven't missed anything .",heavily commercialized version,order make film presentable masses makers have opted very commercialized version major sandeeps biopic creative liberties come into picture during main part film that is 26 11 part it is understandable because as i said masses will enjoy it first 30 40 mins i would recommend you skip it was boring school sequences between sandeep his gf was kinda boring watch fact love angle is most bollywoodish thing this film typical cliche love story hence it did not click me now coming main part last 1 hr 20 mins this film is treat commercialized action lovers they have maintained balance between realistic rather commercialized unrealistic sequences this last 1 hr or so held my attention right till last second this film it was that interesting gripping last part made me really emotional his parents unsure about what sandeeps condition is suddenly finding their son tv being shown martyred was really painful emotional me watch dont miss these parts other than that there are certain fictionalized sequences that are far realistic like some sandeeps acrobatics mind you as i said it is done make film presentable masses or terrorists being shown arriving at daytime while actually they arrived evening dark time course by now we have seen so many 26 11 based films sequences all present that day their own way media angle is presented sarcastic way here with little fiction we all know how terrorists were using idiotic media track commandos but here watch out fictional sequence where sandeep would turn tables use media wreck terrorists instead that was like ooooooooo moment fact there is one hilarious sarcastic sequence where media guy covering nariman point would see commandos getting killed says live news i cant understand how terrorists are able figure out that commandos are coming as he keeps covering them live it was sarcastic songs not one remember performance by adivi shesh is terrific he looks just young enough represent major sandeep he excels last 1 hr saiee manj is average as she carries her one expression throughout film prakash raj too does good job overall must watch full entertainment guaranteed if you miss first 30 mins also due some delay reach theatre then nothing worry you havent missed anything,0.500813492063492,0.0707260101010101,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8.0,Recommended üëçüèº by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,"Major is a perfect tribute to Sandeep Unnikrishnan and his story is worth watching & deserves to be told. The movie delivers what it promises, the first half is decent and the second half is gripping with its outstanding climax that will leave you teary-eyed.Adivi Sesh has delivered his career-best performance. He perfectly portrays the patriotism and emotional side of the army officer's life. Prakash Raj and Revathi were impressive. Revathi brings a lot of emotional depth to the film and Prakash Raj's climax speech was impactful & leaves everyone with moist eyes. Murali Sharma is effective and dependable as always. Sobhita Dhulipala was good in her limited role and Saiee M Manjrekar's performance was just fine. Anish Kuruvilla and other supporting actors including the actors who played the terrorist role have delivered convincing performances.Sashi Kiran Tikka's direction is excellent. The film starts on a low note which is more focused on the romantic side of Major but it ends on a very emotional note with some engrossing action sequences. The music is average, the background music is good, and the cinematography is splendid. There are several wow moments for the viewers during the operation scenes.

8.0,"Major - You may take me , but not my Country","Major is a 2022 biopic of one of the heroes of '26/11' attacks, ""Sandeep Unnikrishnan"" . Diving in his life, all you'll find is patriotism. Which we all knew, but what about his love life ? To present his personal life is the main motto of the movie as well as the makers. So 'Major' is not about how he died, it's about how he lived his life. Talking about the performances, I felt casting crew which includes , Adivi Sesh , Saiee Manjarekar, Prakash Raj , Revathi , Murali Sharma they were very well selected as they did not just perform it they lived in it. Sesh just nailed the role, When released the first look of the Major, everyone felt Adivi Sesh is the lookalike of the Major. This factor made the movie more relatable. Saiee's acting seemed mature enough as compared to her previous works. No need to tell about the other leads (Prakash Raj, Revathi etc). Their style of acting/versatility is impeccable.Story and execution Sandeep Unnikrishnan a guy who took birth in Kerala,was enthusiastic and dedicated to his deeds. He always wanted to serve the Nation ,hence joins the Indian Army after Completing the training later he becomes the NSG Commandos trainer. When got the news about the 26/11 attacks he gets himself and his troops ready to save the hostages and to finish the darkness spread over the city. How he saves the hostages and plans made by him to kill the terrorists is to be watched.When , making a biopic the makers focus more on attracting the audience, which often misleads in showing up the reality . But in this case, Sesh just showed his skills as he didn't just meet the family of Sandeep he adopted the nature of him. And this needs appreciation.The execution was quite decent.Story and screenplay by Sesh was very engaging.Direction by Sashi Kiran Tikka was too good.Music by Sricharan Pakala was rocking.The bgms and sound effects were awesome.Editing by the duo Vinay and Pawan didn't let audience feel flat.Production values were of top class Few shots esp, in the second half gives you thrilling vibes.Few scenes were abrupt and over the top emotions. But when watching with the same emotion it doesn't matter to the audience.Hence, the team is successful in bringing people to watch Major by free screening, promotions etc.Verdict 'Major' shouldn't be missed and is a perfect tribute to the legend 'Sandeep'. 'Don't come up I'll handle them' this one line is enough to describe his life and to get your tickets booked.",major you may take me but not my country,major is 2022 biopic one heroes 26 11 attacks sandeep unnikrishnan diving his life all youll find is patriotism which we all knew but what about his love life present his personal life is main motto movie as well as makers so major is not about how he died its about how he lived his life talking about performances i felt casting crew which includes adivi sesh saiee manjarekar prakash raj revathi murali sharma they were very well selected as they did not just perform it they lived it sesh just nailed role when released first look major everyone felt adivi sesh is lookalike major this factor made movie more relatable saiees acting seemed mature enough as compared her previous works no need tell about other leads prakash raj revathi etc their style acting versatility is impeccable story execution sandeep unnikrishnan guy who took birth kerala was enthusiastic dedicated his deeds he always wanted serve nation hence joins indian army after completing training later he becomes nsg commandos trainer when got news about 26 11 attacks he gets himself his troops ready save hostages finish darkness spread over city how he saves hostages plans made by him kill terrorists is be watched when making biopic makers focus more attracting audience which often misleads showing up reality but this case sesh just showed his skills as he didnt just meet family sandeep he adopted nature him this needs appreciation execution was quite decent story screenplay by sesh was very engaging direction by sashi kiran tikka was too good music by sricharan pakala was rocking bgms sound effects were awesome editing by duo vinay pawan didnt let audience feel flat production values were top class few shots esp second half gives you thrilling vibes few scenes were abrupt over top emotions but when watching with same emotion it doesnt matter audience hence team is successful bringing people watch major by free screening promotions etc verdict major shouldnt be missed is perfect tribute legend sandeep dont come up ill handle them this one line is enough describe his life get your tickets booked,0.4689259259259259,0.1973888888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
