1.0,"So bad, it's incredible...","If there ever were proof of the law of diminishing returns, the fourth entry in the Jaws series is it. The original was a taut thriller that launched the career of one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors. By comparison, Michael Caine often looks as if he is incredibly upset to be missing his award ceremony in order to appear in this piece. Lance Guest and Mario Van Peebles frequently appear to be wishing to have better things to do, while Lorraine Gary frequently looks stoned in moments when she is supposed to look frightening.Clearly, the budget spent on this film didn't go into the research, script, or mechanical shark. Exactly why Michael Brody and his pals are putting what are apparently tracking devices on conch shells is never explained. Perhaps any explanation they thought of was so incredibly stupid that they thought it best to give up. An alternate explanation of why Michael is working in the water was never thought of, either. The true Ed Wood moment of the film comes towards the end of the piece, when the shark rises out of the water, and roars at Elaine. This is the first time I've heard of sharks having vocal cords. Given the box office draw this stinker had, I suspect it will be the last.The shark takes a real beating here, too. The reason the shark wasn't seen often in the original was because Spielberg noticed that if one put it in front of the camera for long enough, the audience would notice that it doesn't move like a real shark. In this edition of the Jaws story, not only do they keep the camera focused upon the shark for more than enough time for the audience to notice the model's flaws, in so doing they make it crystal clear that this shark was made on the cheap. There are some shots in which the support structure of the shark is visible under the outer layer. There is even what appears to be a seam in the back of the shark's main fin.To its credit, Jaws: The Revenge is well-photographed. While the 2.35:1 frame is often sparsely populated, depth of field is used with great effect in several shots. The fact that even frames with one character in them won't make sense when cropped to fit analogue television is a credit to the director and cinematographer. If only this kind of workmanship could have been seen in other aspects of the film.Another area where Jaws: The Revenge deserves due credit is the score music. While the score is very much inspired by that which John Williams provided for the original, it distinguishes itself and genuinely works in its own right. In fact, one could almost say that the score music is more than the rest of the film deserves. The music is literally able to inject dramatic tension into scenes that, by all rights granted under the accepted rules of film-making, really shouldn't have any.When all is said and done, I gave Jaws: The Revenge a one out of ten. It works as a comedy in the sense that it is a stinking pile of crap, but there are precious few moments when the people making it seem privy to the fact. As a result, the film winds up in a class all of its own. It's not just so bad its good, it is so utterly bad it is incredible.",so bad its incredible,if there ever were proof law diminishing returns fourth entry jaws series is it original was taut thriller that launched career one hollywoods most celebrated directors by comparison michael caine often looks as if he is incredibly upset be missing his award ceremony order appear this piece lance guest mario van peebles frequently appear be wishing have better things do while lorraine gary frequently looks stoned moments when she is supposed look frightening clearly budget spent this film didnt go into research script or mechanical shark exactly why michael brody his pals are putting what are apparently tracking devices conch shells is never explained perhaps any explanation they thought was so incredibly stupid that they thought it best give up alternate explanation why michael is working water was never thought either true ed wood moment film comes towards end piece when shark rises out water roars at elaine this is first time ive heard sharks having vocal cords given box office draw this stinker had i suspect it will be last shark takes real beating here too reason shark wasnt seen often original was because spielberg noticed that if one put it front camera long enough audience would notice that it doesnt move like real shark this edition jaws story not only do they keep camera focused upon shark more than enough time audience notice models flaws so doing they make it crystal clear that this shark was made cheap there are some shots which support structure shark is visible under outer layer there is even what appears be seam back sharks main fin its credit jaws revenge is well photographed while 2 35 1 frame is often sparsely populated depth field is used with great effect several shots fact that even frames with one character them wont make sense when cropped fit analogue television is credit director cinematographer if only this kind workmanship could have been seen other aspects film another area where jaws revenge deserves due credit is score music while score is very much inspired by that which john williams provided original it distinguishes itself genuinely works its own right fact one could almost say that score music is more than rest film deserves music is literally able inject dramatic tension into scenes that by all rights granted under accepted rules film making really shouldnt have any when all is said done i gave jaws revenge one out ten it works as comedy sense that it is stinking pile crap but there are precious few moments when people making it seem privy fact as result film winds up class all its own its not just so bad its good it is so utterly bad it is incredible,0.5136785714285714,0.15590079365079365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1.0,An embarrassing film.,"Jaws: The Revenge is the final entry into the Jaws series, and thank God for that. Ellen Brody is now living in the Bahamas after her youngest son Sean, who has followed in the footsteps of his father and become Chief of the Amity police, is killed by another Great White Shark. In what is the most ridiculous plots of all time, we find out that one specific shark is holding a grudge against the Brody family, and after it kills Sean, it swims against the Gulf Stream down to the Bahamas so it can kill Ellen and Michael as well. Jaws: The Revenge is an embarrassment to anyone who knows anything about sharks, and is the worst of the series.The plot is completely wrong in this movie. The whole plot is built off of bs. I can't even allow suspension of disbelief to let me ignore that the shark is hunting the Brody family. It's ridiculous! Aside from that is that the film contains any number of factual errors about sharks ranging from having the shark swim backwards, roar like a lion, stand on its tail, and devour a helicopter. The shark in the first film did unusual things, but nothing that would make a shark lover cry.The acting in this movie is so bad that...You know what? I don't even want to discuss it. It's bad. Terrible. Loathsome. Repugnant. What else is there? Lorraine Gray played Ellen just fine in the first film, but for some reason in this film she let all of her acting skill slip away. Even Michael Caine, who is a vastly talented actor, shows absolutely no skill at all.Every copy of Jaws: The Revenge should be swallowed by the shark from the first film.1/10",embarrassing film,jaws revenge is final entry into jaws series thank god that ellen brody is now living bahamas after her youngest son sean who has followed footsteps his father become chief amity police is killed by another great white shark what is most ridiculous plots all time we find out that one specific shark is holding grudge against brody family after it kills sean it swims against gulf stream down bahamas so it can kill ellen michael as well jaws revenge is embarrassment anyone who knows anything about sharks is worst series plot is completely wrong this movie whole plot is built off bs i cant even allow suspension disbelief let me ignore that shark is hunting brody family its ridiculous aside that is that film contains any number factual errors about sharks ranging having shark swim backwards roar like lion stand its tail devour helicopter shark first film did unusual things but nothing that would make shark lover cry acting this movie is so bad that you know what i dont even want discuss it its bad terrible loathsome repugnant what else is there lorraine gray played ellen just fine first film but some reason this film she let all her acting skill slip away even michael caine who is vastly talented actor shows absolutely no skill at all every copy jaws revenge should be swallowed by shark first film 1 10,0.5665509259259259,-0.060648148148148125,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
2.0,Apparently sharks do take things personally.,"In Jaws 2 a person told sheriff Brody that sharks don't take things personally...in this one they apparently not only do, but they also will hunt you down to the ends of the earth. This focuses on the most mediocre character of the first two Jaws, Ellen Brody. It starts with one of her sons being out on a boat and being killed by a shark. Why he is out on the water is anyone's guess seeing as he was afraid of water in 3, which I do believe this one completely ignores. This attack is probably the only real good scene in the flick cause we are off to the Caribbean where Ellen goes to visit with her other son who just doesn't seem all to upset by his brother's death. What is waiting for her here, but the exact same shark that killed her other son. Michael Caine is in this and this somehow makes me wonder why couldn't they have just forgotten about the Brody's and maybe have it be about Caine in Australia or something as a shark hunter...why do we have to have the same family, you have a better chance of being struck by lightening than you do of being attacked by a shark yet this family is constantly being attacked by sharks. Maybe they all bath in fish blood before swimming? Anyway this film is quite bad and was a pretty bad way to end the franchise.",apparently sharks do take things personally,jaws 2 person told sheriff brody that sharks dont take things personally this one they apparently not only do but they also will hunt you down ends earth this focuses most mediocre character first two jaws ellen brody it starts with one her sons being out boat being killed by shark why he is out water is anyones guess seeing as he was afraid water 3 which i do believe this one completely ignores this attack is probably only real good scene flick cause we are off caribbean where ellen goes visit with her other son who just doesnt seem all upset by his brothers death what is waiting her here but exact same shark that killed her other son michael caine is this this somehow makes me wonder why couldnt they have just forgotten about brodys maybe have it be about caine australia or something as shark hunter why do we have have same family you have better chance being struck by lightening than you do being attacked by shark yet this family is constantly being attacked by sharks maybe they all bath fish blood before swimming anyway this film is quite bad was pretty bad way end franchise,0.487037037037037,-0.016898148148148134,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.23}"
2.0,Dumb Dumb... Dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb!,"On the island Amity during the Christmas break, Mrs. Ellen Brody's younger son Deputy Sean is taken by a great white shark one night after being called out to move a piece of wood tangled up with a buoy. After this happens Michael who lives in the Bahamas with his wife and daughter studying sea snails, visits his mother and asks her to come down there with him and the family. Ellen wants Michael to not go near the water, but he convinces her that it's all fine, since great whites don't like the warm water. But hold on as the shark that killed Sean is now stalking the family and has only one thing on mind - to wipe out the Brody family.Leave those Brody's alone! Err, what crud yeah reading the outline above you'll be just rolling your eyes at how ridiculous this film does get. The last sequel ""Jaws 3"" was a bad film, but I actually enjoyed it to some degree, but here the personal agenda format was just rubbish and the special connection between the Brody's and the shark was just plain risible. I just found this clunker quite lacklustre with it's melodramatic, soap opera of a story and it's lack of thrills and suspense. It was quite a drag and it did have that cheap TV feel about it, despite it's more than capable cast. The only thing that I thought was decent was the terrifyingly, bloody and macabre opening death. Although, few of the performances ( mainly Lance Guest in the key role of Michael Brody and Michael Caine's happy- go-lucky pilot character Hoagie ) made sure that the film didn't sink too fast. While, the rest were simply one-note and Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent was just so dodgy. But what was in need of a life-jacket was the dire script that threw out many awful lines of dialogues. ""I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy."" What?! The repetitively, diluted story is full of crock with many implausible situations and it doesn't leave too much up to the imagination. Was the writer and the director drinking sea water on this project? Maybe so, because Michael's wife's supposed piece of art resembled what? I just don't see it. Well, the sprawling beach lines and crystal blue waters were a nice sight. Too bad that the mechanical, but crooked plastic shark slowly got in the way. The ramshackle design looked dreadful, but the makers didn't seem to notice because they constantly kept showing the abomination in it's full glory. I even got the feeling that the shark just couldn't stop grinning. The (few) shark attacks are rather furious and quite graphic, but I found the latter ones to be laughable because of the execution. Really, it goes all out to outdo itself, but this puddle turns out to be simply inept in mostly every single department. Overall, a fatally disastrous novel production that never should have seen open waters and you won't be laughing too much, but you'll be a daze of bemusement to how this franchise fell apart.It's definitely as bad as its reputation.

,Majorly flawed but entertaining.,"A great white shark stalks a woman to the Bahamas to kill the remaining members of her family...I'm fond of Jaws the Revenge, there I admit it. Although it may be a bad movie, also an incompetent one, to its credit it ignores Jaws 3- D and stars Lorraine Gary of Jaws and Jaws 2. Yes, Ellen Brody returns, the wife of chief Martin Brody. Director Joseph Sargent opening is probably the strongest segment of the film. We return to an atmospheric Martha's Vineyard but this time it's Christmas time where Ellen's youngest son has his dad's old job and after a call is eaten by a shark while a choir drowns out his screams. There's some good to come out of this event as we get some cameos at the funeral by the actors of the original. Grief stricken Ellen flees the Bahamas to stay with her eldest son Michael played by Lance Guest (of fricking Starfighter) - but, get this, the shark has somehow followed her, it wants to eat her entire family possibly as revenge for its parent sharks being killed by Brody in part one and two, who knows?! Yes it's a paper thin plot with a series of shark attacks but if you can look beyond that and the shoddy shark models there's something quite endearing about 1987's Jaws: The Revenge.At the time criticized for its jumping shark (no Henry Winkler pun intended) it has since been established that sharks in fact do propel themselves out of the water (although in the critic's defence I'm sure the filmmaker had no idea of their over 15 feet leaps at the time). That said, to date no shark has been heard roaring like Bruce 4 does in this film. Guest's performance is excellent, he really is likable (honestly) as the marine biologist and over protective son. Mario Van Peebles' Jake with a terrible accent and an unlikable attitude makes you secretly glad he gets eaten, depending on which version you watched, you still feel sorry for his wife.There's a handful of imaginative scenes which makes this instalment worthwhile. At one point Jake attaches a device to the shark so that he can track it through its heartbeat. These heart beat noises build up some tension akin to the barrels in the 1975 Jaws. Interestingly, there's set up where Michael is chased through a wreck and escapes using his air tank - James Bond style! In addition there's also banana boat scene where Jaws (Bruce 4) tries to chow down on Ellen's granddaughter. Another positive is that Gary really shines as the credible paranoid grandmother and mother. It's refreshing to see (albeit cringe worthy) the older lady falling in love with a local pilot Hoagie (Michael 'Get Carter' Caine). Oddly writer Michael de Guzman injects an overbearing amount of sexual dialogue. With every adult character in the film acting at times like a frisky teenager under Sargent's supervision.For tradition and impact Sargent wisely uses John Williams classic theme and unsurprisingly Michael Small fills in the rest delivering a near on perfect score. In the closing Caine's Hoagie is so Dirty Rotten Scoundrels cool he crash-lands his aeroplane in to the sea and when he emerges onto the boat he's completely dry, ""Blood 'ell, the breath on that thing"". So long as you're watching the version where Jake dies and shark gets stabbed, sinking breaking the boat up and not the one where Jaws inexplicably explodes (recycling footage from the original Jaws) it's a more fitting closure. Either way both versions are choppily edited and you can't help feel that with more care or a different director even with the preposterous, yet, novel premise it could have been better.Overall, hugely flawed but somewhat entertaining.",majorly flawed but entertaining,great white shark stalks woman bahamas kill remaining members her family im fond jaws revenge there i admit it although it may be bad movie also incompetent one its credit it ignores jaws 3 d stars lorraine gary jaws jaws 2 yes ellen brody returns wife chief martin brody director joseph sargent opening is probably strongest segment film we return atmospheric marthas vineyard but this time its christmas time where ellens youngest son has his dads old job after call is eaten by shark while choir drowns out his screams theres some good come out this event as we get some cameos at funeral by actors original grief stricken ellen flees bahamas stay with her eldest son michael played by lance guest fricking starfighter but get this shark has somehow followed her it wants eat her entire family possibly as revenge its parent sharks being killed by brody part one two who knows yes its paper thin plot with series shark attacks but if you can look beyond that shoddy shark models theres something quite endearing about 1987s jaws revenge at time criticized its jumping shark no henry winkler pun intended it has since been established that sharks fact do propel themselves out water although critics defence im sure filmmaker had no idea their over 15 feet leaps at time that said date no shark has been heard roaring like bruce 4 does this film guests performance is excellent he really is likable honestly as marine biologist over protective son mario van peebles jake with terrible accent unlikable attitude makes you secretly glad he gets eaten depending which version you watched you still feel sorry his wife theres handful imaginative scenes which makes this instalment worthwhile at one point jake attaches device shark so that he can track it through its heartbeat these heart beat noises build up some tension akin barrels 1975 jaws interestingly theres set up where michael is chased through wreck escapes using his air tank james bond style addition theres also banana boat scene where jaws bruce 4 tries chow down ellens granddaughter another positive is that gary really shines as credible paranoid grandmother mother its refreshing see albeit cringe worthy older lady falling love with local pilot hoagie michael get carter caine oddly writer michael de guzman injects overbearing amount sexual dialogue with every adult character film acting at times like frisky teenager under sargents supervision tradition impact sargent wisely uses john williams classic theme unsurprisingly michael small fills rest delivering near perfect score closing caines hoagie is so dirty rotten scoundrels cool he crash lands his aeroplane sea when he emerges onto boat hes completely dry blood ell breath that thing so long as youre watching version where jake dies shark gets stabbed sinking breaking boat up not one where jaws inexplicably explodes recycling footage original jaws its more fitting closure either way both versions are choppily edited you cant help feel that with more care or different director even with preposterous yet novel premise it could have been better overall hugely flawed but somewhat entertaining,0.5437886933854675,0.13798468556533075,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
6.0,I love this movie and do not care,"So many people use Jaws: The Revenge as an instantly recognizable reference point for bad movies. If you watch any of those top ten worst films lists on YouTube, inevitably it's right there on the top of every one of them. But can it really be that bad of a movie?It's certainly made by people with talent. Producer/director Joseph Sargent won four Emmys throughout his storied career, as well as helming such well-thought of movies like The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The Night That Panicked America, Nightmares, MacArthur and Colossus: The Forbin Project. He even won his the Directors Guild of America Award for The Marcus-Nelson Murders, the TV movie pilot for Kojak. In fact, he still leads all DGA members for most nominations for the TV movie category.Sir Michael Caine is certainly a talented actor. He's been nominated for an Academy Award in every decade from the 1960s to 2000s, winning two for Hannah and Her Sisters and The Cider House Rules, with his performance in Educating Rita earning him the BAFTA and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.So what happened? How can a movie - that one assumes was made with good intentions - turn out to be the touchstone for what constitutes a bomb?In interviews before the film was even released, Sargent referred to it as ""a ticking bomb waiting to go off"" and noting that MCA Inc. President - and husband of star Lorraine Gary - Sid Sheinberg ""expects a miracle."" There was no script when Sargent was asked to direct. Years later, he'd say that the movie was made out of desperation and that he tried a mystical take in an attempt to give audiences ""something interesting enough to sit through.""Even though this film was to center on Gray's Ellen Brody character, Roy Scheider was offered a cameo where his Martin Brody character, rather than Sean Brody, would have been killed by the shark in the beginning. This was a wise choice to avoid this opening - murdering the center of the first two films would have put such a bad taste in audiences' mouths that they may have hated this movie even more than they already did. To his credit, Scheider said, """"Satan himself could not get me to do Jaws Part 4.""Lee Fierro also returned as Mrs. Kintner, the mother of Alex in Jaws, along with Amity Town Council member Mrs. Taft, who is again played by Fritzi Jane Courtney. Amity Selectman Mr. Posner (Cyprian R. Dube) is now the mayor, probably because the actor who played Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton) is dead.Otherwise, forget all you knew about Jaws and the previous sequels. Mike no longer works for SeaWorld and he's no longer played by Dennis Quaid. Instead, Halloween 2 hunk Lance Guest fills in. Following the heart attack death of her husband and great white murder of her son Sean - to the strains of holiday carols no less - Ellen Brody forgets all that she knew as well and leaves for the Bahamas.There, she falls for Hoagie (Caine), who is a degenerate gambler by night and a pilot by day, but we all know that he runs cocaine. It's just never said, but we can read between the lines that he's done some shady things. In fact, scenes involving him being a smuggler were shot, then deleted during post-production, because it took away from the shark scenes.Right now, Hoagie is having a September September romance with Ellen, trying to get her to forget the past - keep in my her husband died a few months ago and her son a few days hence - with some airplane riding, slow dancing and carnival attending.Some moments of the film definitely make me understand why people dislike it so - the sepia toned callbacks to the first film, Mario Van Peebles' forced accent, a shark that is somehow able to swim from an island in New York to the Bahamas in three days, which means he'd had to swim at nearly its full speed of 25 mph non-stop to make it. I mean, sharks never sleep, but that's ridiculous.Also, when you watch the ending, you may notice that the shark roars. Underwater, no less. The sound effects guy thought that this was so stupid that he used a sound effect from a Tom and Jerry cartoon.Speaking of the ending, the one that gets aired on TV and home video isn't the original. When the film was first released, it ended with JJakebeing devoured, Ellen ramming the shark with Mike's boat and the shark's death throes nearly killing everyone. Audiences hated that, so the ending with her stabbing the shark with the bow of the ship was added. Because they didn't have much budget left, the film ends with the footage of the dying shark from the original.These reshoots kept Caine from accepting his Oscar. Imagine that.It could have been much worse. Or better, if you're someone like me that loves movies packed with inanity and insanity in equal measure.That's because in the novelization of the film by Hank Searls, Hoagie is a government agent transporting laundered money. Jake is killed by the shark. And the reason for all this mayhem is because a voodoo witch doctor has a score to settle with the Brody family - which also explains, I guess, why Ellen and the shark have a psychic connection.While the movie ignores the third film, the book combines all the movies with the Peter Benchley novel, making a reference to Ellen's affair with Matt Hooper that is eliminated from the Spielberg-directed original film.In truth, I like this movie. It's an interesting take on how years of dealing with shark-related mayhem takes its toll on the various characters' lives. And I really enjoyed how Michael and Carla's marriage is depicted; she initiates lovemaking as much as him and it just seems honest and real.Let's face it. I've seen plenty of worse movies than this one. If there's any tragedy to this movie, it's that the actress who played Thea - Judith Barsi - died not long after it was released, as she and her mother were the victims of a murder/suicide at the hands of her father. Lance Guest served as a pallbearer at her funeral.Perhaps the best review of the film comes from Sir Michael Caine himself, who said, ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific. Won an Oscar, built a house, and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie.""",i love this movie do not care,so many people use jaws revenge as instantly recognizable reference point bad movies if you watch any those top ten worst films lists youtube inevitably its right there top every one them but can it really be that bad movie its certainly made by people with talent producer director joseph sargent won four emmys throughout his storied career

,More Like Montezuma's Revenge,"SPOILERSDo you want to know how they kill the shark in this one? Do you want to know how stupid the producers of this Bahaman hunk of crap think you are? SHE SAILS THE BOAT INTO THE SHARK AND IMPALES IT WITH THE BOW. No, you read it correctly. The last Starfighter is standing on the deck, flashing some strobe at the shark. The strobe reacts to the electronic gizmo that Mario Van Peebles dropped in its mouth (naturally), the shark stands straight up in the water and roars--I said ROARS!!!--just at the moment Ellen Brody sails the boat into it. Smile you son-of-a-career-ruining-sequel!This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The shark eats the Last Starfighter's younger brother in New England, then IT FOLLOWS ELLEN BRODY TO THE BAHAMAS. Apparently, even sharks need a Caribbean getaway now and again. The story is impossible for anyone with even a single connected synapse to believe. I half expected the shark to somehow regurgitate Robert Shaw up onto the deck to help with the navigating of the boat directly into the heart of the beast. About half way through the movie, my right hand jerked up involuntarily and smacked my face. Minutes later, my left hand did the same thing. That's right; this movie was so bad, that my body tried to stop me from watching it. Loss of bowel/bladder control followed quickly thereafter.They should play this in hospitals to snap catatonics back to reality and wake coma patients who will jump out of bed and run screaming down the hall to get away from its sheer nightmarish stupidity. This isn't just bad-it's an atrocity.I know in the director's cut, Mario Van Peebles--even though he was chewed up by the shark--doesn't die. He limply paddles back in after the great impaling, smiling and joking--it's alright, everybody, Mario Van Peebles made it! Had I seen that, my head would've exploded, ruining my couch and un-scotch guarded carpet.Oh, Michael Kane. Why? You're an Oscar-caliber actor.

6.0,Not Half as Bad as Most People Make it Out to Be,"The shark (or sharks, assuming the original shark is quite dead) has it in for the Brody family of Amity. But Ellen (Lorraine Gary, the only original cast member) is determined to stop that son of a gun. But she just might lose a few family members along the way...It's really great that Lorraine Gary came back to keep the continuity strong, even as we reach the fourth installment. There is also a large, prominent photo of Roy Scheider in the police station, so he made an appearance here, as well (sort of). After that, it becomes a bit of a stretch.The ""script is lamentable,"" according to Howard Maxford. Apparently he hasn't watch a lot of horror sequels -- this one is something like Shakespeare in comparison. But he is right if he is implying that it makes no sense. What's with the extremely unlikely attacks on the Brody family... what the? Sharks that have picked them out and even (through some magical power) tracked them to the Bahamas?There are some respectable guest stars, including the gambling-addicted Michael Caine, and Mario Van Peebles. Caine alone makes this film a lot more tolerable. His voice soothes me in a way that not even warm milk and a shoulder rub can match.I'm not going to lie to you and say this is on par with ""Jaws"", but I will say this: it's not as bad as other sequels (like ""Leprechaun in da Hood""), and not even as bad as other shark movies (""Megalodon"").

1.0,Michael Caine's worst hour.,"Having read Michael Caine's biography I was intrigued to read of his views on this film, I had to watch it. I managed to get to the end, but found myself asking what could I have done with those ninety minutes? I'll never get them back. Throughout my Jaws reviews I've likened each one to a Shark, Jaws 1 is a Great white, proud, majestic with a huge bite. Jaws 2 is a Blue Shark, a lesser beast but still a meanie, 3 was a Basking shark, toothless, Jaws the Revenge is Bile, it's not even a shark, it is simply bile. The effects here make Jaws 3D look like a stellar 21st century blockbuster, the shark looks like a rubber monster from a Pound Shop, the acting is atrocious, Caine himself is shocking.By now I think all behavioural aspects of a shark have vanished, this thing in the sea is not of any known life form. A shark with a vendetta is quite funny I guess, the stylish terror of the first has vanished. Simply put this should not be watched under any circumstances, and yet it was a relative box office hit.

1.0,Pant-wettingly hilarious,"There's no new bad things I can say about this film as they are all pretty much common knowledge (like how can someone have flashbacks of events they never witnessed?). But I will say that no collection is complete without this movie. It is so wretchedly bad it's funny.First of all, hardly anybody gets eaten. After Jaws gobbles up the youngest Brody son Mom goes on a holiday to get away from Amity Island and it's history...to the Bahamas! Total change of scenery huh? Jaws follows. How? Don't ask me. And he gets there in a day when it would take any ordinary shark about a week minimum.Her elder son works as a marine biologist (surely being attacked by sharks in the first two movies would put him off going in the ocean) and is studying sea snails (presumably he got fired from Sea World after Jaws 3). By pure coincidence (or contrivance), Jaws shows up and pokes his nose into the sea snail research.The shark looks sooooooooooooo fake. It's very obviously nothing but foam rubber with plastic teeth. And it's incredibly stupid. The shark in the first film (and in the surprisingly good second) seemed to be kind of smart and cunning. But now it's just a big lumbering idiot.Why on earth Michael Caine agreed to be in this is beyond me. He even couldn't get to the Oscars to accept his award for Hannah and her Sisters because he was too busy filming this turkey. And the story with him dating Mom Brody takes up a tremendous amount of the film's running time and ends up turning it into a soap opera.The worst thing tho, isn't the elder Brody son's beard or Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent. It's the ending. Let me explain what happens...Jaws stands on his tail! On the Water!! Roars like a Lion!!! Is stabbed by the broken mast of a ship... ...and explodes!!!!Of course!Where on earth the idea for that ending came from is probably best kept a mystery. The fact that it recycles footage from the first film into this ending is a mockery of the original's genius.

1.0,Arguably the worst film ever made,"I would like anyone to present to me, a greater scale of difference between the greatest film ever made in Jaws, and the worst film ever made in ...the revenge. This film within the opening minutes, commits the ultimate sequel sin-it kills off the youngest Brody boy, Sean- as seen as the the little boy in the first 2films. If Jaws fanatics don't get up and leave at this point- it gets worse- our hero Chief Brody is now deceased!! Apparently by heart-attack. So what a start, this leaves us with two members of the Brody clan remaining- Widow Lorraine Gary, and her son Michael, now a marine biologist in the Bahamas. This event of Sean's death forces her to flee the shores of Amity Island and head for her son 2000 miles away in the Bahamas. The despicable opening to the movie suddenly now takes a bizarre and utterly ludicrous twist. Sharky, revenging the death of it's fellow Sharks by Mr.Brody- wants to eat all Brody's and intends to stop at nothing to do so. This shark obviously catches wind of Ellen's intentions to flee the area, and the Shark sets off to follow her. I mean it. A STALKER SHARK! (He would have been just as well getting out of the water, and knocking on her door.)So as she heads off in the plane, our Shark follows the plane all the way from New England to the Bahamas. The viewer has now realised all common sense behind the movie has been thrown out the window and we are left with a super-shark with powers to follow a plane at maybe 500miles an hour and travels 2000 miles following this plane. How? no idea ask the script writer and the producers. The utterly bizarre becomes a comedy from here on in. Michael Brody, a well meaning kid in the first 2, has turned into an utter idiot. He discovers the shark is in the Bahamas but for some twist of reasoning decides not to let anybody know-putting everyone in his family in jeopardy. He is married but seemingly cares nothing about the wife, as he spends his occupation money and time putting his efforts watching sea snails. His wife announces to her mother-in-law she plans on having an active sex life with him, why does she do that? no idea...ask the writer. Meanwhile we are introduced to Michael Cane whom is furiously trying to woo Ellen Brody.Every so often the episode of Family Affairs, is interrupted by a rubber 'fish'and the attack scenes are minimal, Lorraine Gary gets attacked, but get this-it was all a dream!!So what little of the shark we do see is in fact a dream- uh-huh great...The director really has little interest in the shark, every so often it rears it's rubber head but if you look closely we can actually see at times the railing that follows it along. All this clearly gets too much for Lorraine Gary, as she clearly can't take any more of the film thus she rushes onto a boat to find the shark herself. Cue, the most bizarre and worst ending in cinema history. En route she is intercepted by her incredibly inept son, who plans on sending electric impulses on the shark to electrocute it. Sure mate, whatever just do it so we can end it OK?! Ellen's over 50's love interest Michael Caine gets his plane capsized and attacked underwater by our shark. But good news, he emerges from the water unscathed with a newly pressed shirt, perfectly dry emerging form the water declaring ""that thing had bad breathe"" or something to that effect. Yes, that is the depths this film has reached. We see the shark proceed to bite the boat and the poor Bahamas guy, the only half decent guy in the movie-but he serves a purpose to put the electric thing in its mouth. The next few minutes sees the shark have seizures and leap high in the air balancing on its fins- think 'free Willy' on Ecstasy.Ellen Brody then proceeds to have flash backs of scenes she didn't witness-such as the ""Smile u son of a B..."" scene at the end of the original- At this point the shark leaps up perfectly straight for an extended period (U know for a shark thats meant to to have superpowers, it seems pretty dumb)but regardless it lets out a dinosaur roar-i'm not kidding- and balances on the water like a trapeze artist, long enough to get lampooned by the boat. Inexplicably it um....blows up! Yep, it blows up and Mike's mate the Bahamas guy comes out alive and well. And that my friends is the tale of the most bizarre movie i have ever witnessed. Joseph Sargeant the director clearly took what Spielberg said in an interview about the demise of the shark in the original the wrong way- Spielberg said ""if you can carry the audience for 2hours; 2minutes of the sharks ending won't make a difference."" Sargeant decided that if he can carry the audience for 2minutes he can throw-the craziest most bizarre things for 2 hours! like a roaring shark who balances on its fins and stalks a family while having psychic connections with the woman. Not only that the shark can blow up when it gets stabbed!

5.0,A perfect example of so bad it's good entertainment,"Although widely regarded as the worst of the series, I found this to be at least as good as JAWS 3, if not possibly better. For a ""bad"" movie, JAWS: THE REVENGE is pretty easy viewing, with crystal-clear photography and a good soundtrack (basically an upbeat riff on the classic John Williams music). The most criminal thing about this film is the first fifty minutes, where we hardly see any ""shark"" at all. Instead, the time consists of people and their relationships, with lots of bonding, moody characters, fights, and the occasional shark attack to keep the plot moving. The film is ""bad"", ie. cheesy, at the opening and close, but ironically these are the most enjoyable parts of the movie; the worst part is the boring middle.Things kick off promisingly with an attack on the younger son of Brody. After much thrashing and screaming the boy resides in his boat...MISSING AN ARM! He proceeds to clutch at the bleeding stump and scream repeatedly, only for his cries to be drowned out by carol singers! After this the shark makes short work of the rest of his body. Well, an opening which contained poor acting and some surprisingly explicit gore bodes well for the rest of the movie, but unfortunately they then forgot about the shark and things become a human drama instead.This time around, Lorraine Gary returns from JAWS and JAWS 2. She's a little wiser and a little older, and basically has developed Scheider's fear of the water. Gary must have needed the money to appear in this, as she had bowed out of the previous instalment. Her surviving son is now played by the bland and bearded Lance Guest. Guest is absolutely boring and his character a ridiculous snob who despises Michael Caine for being a pilot. What a jerk!The further down the cast you go, the more interesting actors you find. One I did like was Mario Van Peebles as Guest's Jamaican partner, who helps him do undersea research. Peebles makes the best of his clichéd character and is the funniest, most likable person in the movie. Eagle-eyed viewers may well spot Peebles' dad, Melvin, appearing in a cameo. So, the rest of the cast are all no-names, right? Yes, they're all much of a muchness but WAIT! Who's this?Michael Caine? Surely it can't be THE Michael Caine, can it? But yes, Caine is in this film as a hilarious bumbling pilot called Hoagie. Well, much has been surmised of Caine's decision to appear in this movie, the general consensus being that he must have had financial difficulties at the time. All I can say is that I love his performance, no matter how bad it is, and regard him as one of the film's highlights!After much talk and too much sentimentalising, the ending is suddenly upon us and retreads the old ""survivors on a boat vs. the shark"" routine. However, this is so-bad-it's-hilarious stuff, with the shark STANDING in the water at one point on its tail! This is so a pole jutting from the prow of the boat can impale it, thus causing the shark to bleed profusely and fall to bits. The shark is shown in the open far too often in this movie, and looks much more fake than it did previously with a real lack of movement. Due to technical incompetence, it's also possible to spot the machinery controlling the model for much of the film. However, these are all plus points!

3.0,Jaw dropping,"There is Montezuma's revenge and then there is Jaws: The Revenge, in either case diarrhea is produced. This is really a terrible film, as if a shark would go out and take revenge on the family that ""murdered"" his cousins. Nonsense!

Poor Lorraine Gary, went into retirement and then only to come out of retirement to do this turkey, and to think she felt obliged to as well, hardly a fitting finale to the end of a career.

1.0,So there is a category beneath 'so bad it's good'...,"There seems little point in writing a review for such a film as Jaws: The Revenge, as those who have made it past the tagline and still given it an iota of consideration have likely already made up their minds as to whether or not they can stomach such an overwhelming inundation of garbage. With that in mind, as no reader could feasibly read with the intent of deciding whether the film is bad or good, this review will focus on a more comprehensive breakdown of the film's countless flaws. And rest assured that no matter how many innumerable detractions the movie has garnered, its atrocities becoming almost over-hyped, the film still manages to astound by the numerous fronts in which it completely fails to register any vestige of quality whatsoever. Even those seeking the film as an entertainingly terrible comedy will find themselves disappointed, as the film somehow manages to avoid the pitfall of usual B movie melodramatic hysteria, emerging as simply dull and all the more terrible as consequence. The film's complete lack of quality becomes instantly clear from the chaotically choppy cinematography and editing, betraying the film's seemingly near non-existent budget. Similarly, the creative black hole of a script somehow bests its own storyline absurdities by shamelessly stealing elements from Spielberg's classic original through clunky, senseless flashbacks (Ellen Brody recalls her husband killing the shark, despite not having been there to witness it) and in certain cases blatant plundering and rehashing of scenes (the charming interplay between Roy Scheider and his son from the first Jaws is leeringly plagiarized, devoid of any redeeming values whatsoever). All of which goes without mentioning the most glaring absurdities of the very premise: a shark seeking vengeance against family members of one who once killed a completely unrelated shark, enough so to track them to the Bahamas shows such a staggering lack of logic that one wonders how the film could possibly have been greenlit in the first place. But in this twisted reality, such qualms are easily explained away, as is the shark's outracing planes, standing on its tail, roaring and spontaneously combusting - it is difficult to imagine anything sealing the film's utter absence of quality any further. While Spielberg masked the clunky falsities of his mechanical shark by mostly obscuring it with subjective point of view camera work, director Joseph Sargent appears to positively revel in his antagonist's foibles, keeping his obviously fake shark in plain view to a comical extent. Similarly, viewers are even denied a high body count of entertainingly poor shark attacks, as the film's near non-existent carnage is devoid of any campy gruesomeness, resorting to extreme close-ups of the absurdly unconvincing attacks, generating less menace than watching a snail crawl. As a secondary character, the relatively poor acting of Lorraine Gary's Ellen Brody was for the most part easy to miss, but thrust into a lead role and her complete lack of a performance is unmistakable. Embarrassingly melodramatic or completely devoid of emotion depending on the scene, the banality of Gary's imbalanced attempted character is one of the film's weaker points, which is saying a lot. As her allegedly heroic son, Lance Guest's height of emotional intensity appears to be a slightly bewildered stare, proving comical at best, but little more. The hilariously ill-advised Michael Caine (the only cast member to escape with his career intact, and must have collected a considerable paycheque) usually appears to be reading his lines from a teleprompter offscreen with the same lack of emotion one would expect, and the absurdity of his sporadic romance with the far older Ellen Brody only furthers the stupidity. Finally, Mario Van Peebles is simply inexcusable; his atrociously bad Jamaican accent is a constant tarnish on the film's already consistently sullied quality, and once again, he fails to be over the top bad enough to prove enjoyable, simply resulting as noisy and pathetic.Astoundingly horrible only scratches the surface of what can be considered no less than a masterpiece of lapsed logic and catastrophic film-making, even failing on the front of being overblown enough to make a suitable unintentional comedy. While the film's atrocious quality is hardly a surprise, it still boggles the mind simply how bad an outcome it was possible to achieve. In fact, the film's laughably ludicrous tagline ""This time it's personal"" could well apply to the audiences watching the film: this time the franchise is not only resoundingly poor, but a personal insult to every last viewer unfortunate enough to find themselves watching it.-1/10",so there is category beneath so bad its good,there seems little point writing review such film as jaws revenge as those who have made it past tagline still given it iota consideration have likely already made up their minds as whether or not they can stomach such overwhelming inundation garbage with that mind as no reader could feasibly read with intent deciding whether film is bad or good this review will focus more comprehensive breakdown films countless flaws rest assured that no matter how many innumerable detractions movie has garnered its atrocities becoming almost over hyped film still manages astound by numerous fronts which it completely fails register any vestige quality whatsoever even those seeking film as entertainingly terrible comedy will find themselves disappointed as film somehow manages avoid pitfall usual b movie melodramatic hysteria emerging as simply dull all more terrible as consequence films complete lack quality becomes instantly clear chaotically choppy cinematography editing betraying films seemingly near non existent budget similarly creative black hole script somehow bests its own storyline absurdities by shamelessly stealing elements spielbergs classic original through clunky senseless flashbacks ellen brody recalls her husband killing shark despite not having been there witness it certain cases blatant plundering rehashing scenes charming interplay between roy scheider his son first jaws is leeringly plagiarized devoid any redeeming values whatsoever all which goes without mentioning most glaring absurdities very premise shark seeking vengeance against family members one who once killed completely unrelated shark enough so track them bahamas shows such staggering lack logic that one wonders how film could possibly have been greenlit first place but this twisted reality such qualms are easily explained away as is sharks outracing planes standing its tail roaring spontaneously combusting it is difficult imagine anything sealing films utter absence quality any further while spielberg masked clunky falsities his mechanical shark by mostly obscuring it with subjective point view camera work director joseph sargent appears positively revel his antagonists foibles keeping his obviously fake shark plain view comical extent similarly viewers are even denied high body count entertainingly poor shark attacks as films near non existent carnage is devoid any campy gruesomeness resorting extreme close ups absurdly unconvincing attacks generating less menace than watching snail crawl as secondary character relatively poor acting lorraine garys ellen brody was most part easy miss but thrust into lead role her complete lack performance is unmistakable embarrassingly melodramatic or completely devoid emotion depending scene banality garys imbalanced attempted character is one films weaker points which is saying lot as her allegedly heroic son lance guests height emotional intensity appears be slightly bewildered stare proving comical at best but little more hilariously ill advised michael caine only cast member escape with his career intact must have collected considerable paycheque usually appears be reading his lines teleprompter offscreen with same lack emotion one would expect absurdity his sporadic romance with far older ellen brody only furthers stupidity finally mario van peebles is simply inexcusable his atrociously bad jamaican accent is constant tarnish films already consistently sullied quality once again he fails be over top bad enough prove enjoyable simply resulting as noisy pathetic astoundingly horrible only scratches surface what can be considered no less than masterpiece lapsed logic catastrophic film making even failing front being overblown enough make suitable unintentional comedy while films atrocious quality is hardly surprise it still boggles mind simply how bad outcome it was possible achieve fact films laughably ludicrous tagline this time its personal could well apply audiences watching film this time franchise is not only resoundingly poor but personal insult every last viewer unfortunate enough find themselves watching it 1 10,0.5826508785332313,-0.019329640947287997,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"
3.0,The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel,"This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley's novel packs eerie scenes, suspense and embarrassing direction.The film is developed at the Bahamas in a shore community .There ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the local beach.
