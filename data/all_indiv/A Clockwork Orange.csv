10.0,One of those films you have to watch multiple times,"It's hard to judge a film such as this. Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. It can be average, yet it can be visionary. Exploitive? Satirical? Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today. The younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control, junk culture is becoming commonplace, violence is desensitizing the masses, and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality. Kubrick took a huge leap with this film, challenging society to take a hard look at itself. Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever.",one those films you have watch multiple times,its hard judge film such as this its cold hard yet can be exhilarating sarcastic it can be average yet it can be visionary exploitive satirical too many questions consider when one watches this film even after 34 years this film still speaks volumes about our current culture which many ideals are ringing true today younger generations are out control due lack parental control junk culture is becoming commonplace violence is desensitizing masses we all seem be enjoying ride way down its very difficult find movies which can make such startling commentary yet hold such accusations extended period time nowadays films are focused grouped death conformity is more powerful than artistry money is far more important than quality kubrick took huge leap with this film challenging society take hard look at itself unfortunately society wasnt ready this film which is why it is revered now more than ever,0.6184027777777779,0.0920138888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,One of Kubrick's best,"To say that the Alex character from Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is unlikable is like saying the Manson family was sort of bad. He's not just unlikable; he's despicable, terrifying, sick, twisted, and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. But Alex does not see himself as a sick person. The key to this is in his voice-over narrative.Alex does not see himself as a pervert, just as we do not see our own flaws and Ramond Babbitt did not see his own autism. To us, we are all normal, which is a scary thought.""A Clockwork Orange,"" which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating (that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture), had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years. Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious.But for those of us lucky enough to enjoy (or squirm through) ""A Clockwork Orange"" in its entire odd splendor, it is an experience you are likely to never forget. Its characters, its style, its subject matter, its explicit material--all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling.Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is indeed as offbeat as its title.All tales of redemption involve characters that we gradually come to appreciate, or like, or--at the very least--learn to tolerate. Not ""A Clockwork Orange."" Our narrator remains the same throughout the movie, always an incarnation of everything wrong in today's modern world. He goes through no cleansing process and by the end of the film we like him less than we did at the beginning. That's daring.",one kubricks best,say that alex character stanley kubricks clockwork orange is unlikable is like saying manson family was sort bad hes not just unlikable hes despicable terrifying sick twisted ultimately haunting embodiment all our greatest realistic fears worries but alex does not see himself as sick person key this is his voice over narrative alex does not see himself as pervert just as we do not see our own flaws ramond babbitt did not see his own autism us we are all normal which is scary thought clockwork orange which was originally released 1973 after appeal r rating that was granted after originally being tagged as x rated motion picture had been banned britain close thirty years most film fans europe will tell you that they had seen movie grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young curious but those us lucky enough enjoy or squirm through clockwork orange its entire odd splendor it is experience you are likely never forget its characters its style its subject matter its explicit material all it combines create marvelous whole that will stay with you long after credits stop rolling essentially tale focused alexs journeys jail his process being re submitted world after inhumane treatments cure evil out him clockwork orange is indeed as offbeat as its title all tales redemption involve characters that we gradually come appreciate or like or at very least learn tolerate not clockwork orange our narrator remains same throughout movie always incarnation everything wrong todays modern world he goes through no cleansing process by end film we like him less than we did at beginning thats daring,0.6604404761904761,-0.03921428571428572,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,My brief review of the film,"A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick has created the ultimate study of mind manipulation in this film. It is a protest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice, and the message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in all eternity is inescapable, evident to a large extent in the sardonic nature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like it is, this being because the message of the film is overwhelmingly powerful and capable of applying to any age. The film has a number of possible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only by Kubrick's former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaning behind the film, there are still the marks of a masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadows and angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, done in a flashy, brainwashing style at times to have relevance to the film. The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film achieves the most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by watching the film itself.",my brief review film,disturbing but yet very beautiful piece film making kubrick has created ultimate study mind manipulation this film it is protest against reform programs that take away freedom choice message film terms paying ones sins all eternity is inescapable evident large extent sardonic nature tale although set future it hardly feels like it is this being because message film is overwhelmingly powerful capable applying any age film has number possible hidden meanings it feat equaled scale only by kubricks former film 2001 space odyssey besides meaning behind film there are still marks masterpiece kubricks direction is superb alongside good photography capturing shadows angles needed establish tone editing is excellent too done flashy brainwashing style at times have relevance film choice cast is again inspirational however film achieves most terms music kubrick manages use one earliest forms art classical music give it unforgettable style importance film it is truly difficult task explain what is so great about film such as clockwork orange it is maybe best explained by watching film itself,0.6319223985890652,0.2187389770723104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Kubrick and the Art of Violence.,"Stanley Kubrick has a way of telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them, or going into exaggeration. In DR STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE THE BOMB violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song ""We'll Meet Again"" lovingly played in the background. In 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.Alex DeLarge is the leader of a band of 'droogs' who move from location to location terrorizing their victims, putting them under outrageous acts of violence. When two of his 'droogs' refuse to follow Alex's path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them, until an act of reversal turns against Alex and he is brought down by the medical industry who decides to ""reform"" his heretofore sociopathic tendencies. One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness. Karma is a bitch.Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has a look and feel completely out of its time, closer to sometime in the future, and its torture sequence in which Alex is regenerated also looks straight out of a science fiction movie. However, this is not a science fiction film. It's actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it's something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted. It's this approach that makes the work the product of a master of direction -- it can be seen multiple times and every time a different perspective arises, and all one can be left with is with the notion that this is pure, ultra-modern cinema.",kubrick art violence,stanley kubrick has way telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them or going into exaggeration dr strangelove or how i stopped worrying learned love bomb violence as war was discussed overheard never truly seen until final reel when flurry atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as song well meet again lovingly played background 2001 space odyssey hal 9000 terminates entire crew most chilling way all we see is computer screen indicating termination life now clockwork orange kubrick actually brings story about violence even then it is art directed within inch its life alex delarge is leader band droogs who move location location terrorizing their victims putting them under outrageous acts violence when two his droogs refuse follow alexs path destruction he turns them beats them until act reversal turns against alex he is brought down by medical industry who decides reform his heretofore sociopathic tendencies one he is cured interesting chain humiliating events that bring alex even farther down ensue he is example now attacked by his very ex mates now policemen his ex victims sometimes cure is far worse than illness karma is bitch kubrick has particular way visualizing his films clockwork orange has look feel completely out its time closer sometime future its torture sequence which alex is regenerated also looks straight out science fiction movie however this is not science fiction film its actually quite difficult categorize clockwork because its something social satire something drama has comedic moments deconstructs musical horrifying rape sequence however its approach material gives it feel hybrid out time out place but visually arresting impossible take granted its this approach that makes work product master direction it can be seen multiple times every time different perspective arises all one can be left with is with notion that this is pure ultra modern cinema,0.465993265993266,-0.007984607984607968,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9.0,We Are Seeing Our Future,"Having read Anthony Burgess's novel years ago and working my way through the amazingly creative, futuristic dialogue, I really looked forward to seeing the movie. It was not a disappointment. In the hands of Stanley Kubrick, it comes to life. It is the product of the desensitized world that we see unfolding before us in the beginning of the 21st century. There will be a lot of Alexes in the future; there already are. We are slowly moving away from conventional morality and playing with forms of nihilism. Our politics are beginning to diminish the individual rights and safety of our citizens. Our young people are beginning to band together in little covens, the cell phone and the computer creating little worlds where anonymity can lead to diminution of what is good. Pardon my diatribe, but what Alex and his droogs are doing isn't all that out of the ordinary these days. The manipulative, controlling, anything for ""me"" society is just being formed. Kubrick and Burgess had a a vision. Sometimes this movie is called science fiction. The only science fiction thing about it is that it takes place in the future. The violence we see is the violence of those who no longer care what that word means. This whole world is more frightening than the terrorists we see behind every rock. This enemy is us; or the us yet to be.",we are seeing our future,having read anthony burgesss novel years ago working my way through amazingly creative futuristic dialogue i really looked forward seeing movie it was not disappointment hands stanley kubrick it comes life it is product desensitized world that we see unfolding before us beginning 21st century there will be lot alexes future there already are we are slowly moving away conventional morality playing with forms nihilism our politics are beginning diminish individual rights safety our citizens our young people are beginning band together little covens cell phone computer creating little worlds where anonymity can lead diminution what is good pardon my diatribe but what alex his droogs are doing isnt all that out ordinary these days manipulative controlling anything me society is just being formed kubrick burgess had vision sometimes this movie is called science fiction only science fiction thing about it is that it takes place future violence we see is violence those who no longer care what that word means this whole world is more frightening than terrorists we see behind every rock this enemy is us or us yet be,0.46160714285714277,0.026607142857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.52}"
9.0,"Brilliant, stunning and disturbingly entertaining","Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent ""reformation"" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied. Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies. A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think.

10.0,A second viewing does the trick,"A Clockwork Orange is directed by Stanley Kubrick, my favorite director of all time and this is my second favorite movie of all time including one of my favorite villain performances of all time! A Clockwork Orange is every genre, it's Sci-Fi mixed with crime, drama, psychological thriller, satire, horror elements and most importantly romance (nah, I'm kidding).At the time of release it was considered purposefully disturbing, boring and overall just not a great movie, however years later, when critics gave it a second viewing, they retracted their reviews and it is now considered one of the best movies of all time! Same kind of thing with two other Kubrick movies- 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining- when these movies were released critics hated on them, same complaints with all three of these films, yet a second viewing (once again) proved that it was misunderstood and genius.A Clockwork Orange has one of the greatest opening scenes in cinematic history, we have Alex looking directly at the camera, while his droogs are passed out and looking elsewhere. His intense stare and narration create a weird and already disturbing atmosphere. On this first viewing, I strongly disliked the movie, and I couldn't make it through that first r**e scene, I was completely and utterly disturbed. A year later I decided to rewatch it, after watching other mature movies I think I was ready for A Clockwork Orange, and I was right, this movie is beautifully filmed, perfectly scripted and the fact that Kubrick did most camera work, wrote the film, directed it and produced it is beyond me. He is a perfectionist and you can tell that with each shot - even the minimal ones - he put in the most amount of effort that he could and it truly made me appreciate cinema more.Some scenes are deeply disturbing, when I went back and watched it for a third and fourth time, I always shut my eyes during the ""Singin' in the Rain"" scene. Alex DeLarge is a monstrous human being, yet he is our protagonist, he commits these heinous crimes and he gets jail time he deserves. He runs into all of these people who he has beaten earlier in the film, even runs into his two droogs, they all punish him and we feel slight sympathy for his character, he is locked in a room by Mr Alexander (the husband of the woman who died from injuries sustained during the Singin' in the Rain scene) and forced to listened to Beethoven - this music reminds him of the crimes he commited and it tortures him to the point of near-suicide. He jumps out of the window and Mr Alexander goes to jail.The Ludovico techique is seen as wrong and is being pushed to be stopped, Alex is now seen as a hero in the newspapers and the ending is left to interpretation, I think that Alex definitely wasn't cured, he is going to continue this endless cycle of r**e and violence, unlike the book's ending which has Alex become a normal human being. Overall, this is the most unique and intriguing movie I have ever seen.",second viewing does trick,clockwork orange is directed by stanley kubrick my favorite director all time this is my second favorite movie all time including one my favorite villain performances all time clockwork orange is every genre its sci fi mixed with crime drama psychological thriller satire horror elements most importantly romance nah im kidding at time release it was considered purposefully disturbing boring overall just not great movie however years later when critics gave it second viewing they retracted their reviews it is now considered one best movies all time same kind thing with two other kubrick movies 2001 space odyssey shining when these movies were released critics hated them same complaints with all three these films yet second viewing once again proved that it was misunderstood genius clockwork orange has one greatest opening scenes cinematic history we have alex looking directly at camera while his droogs are passed out looking elsewhere his intense stare narration create weird already disturbing atmosphere this first viewing i strongly disliked movie i couldnt make it through that first r e scene i was completely utterly disturbed year later i decided rewatch it after watching other mature movies i think i was ready clockwork orange i was right this movie is beautifully filmed perfectly scripted fact that kubrick did most camera work wrote film directed it produced it is beyond me he is perfectionist you can tell that with each shot even minimal ones he put most amount effort that he could it truly made me appreciate cinema more some scenes are deeply disturbing when i went back watched it third fourth time i always shut my eyes during singin rain scene alex delarge is monstrous human being yet he is our protagonist he commits these heinous crimes he gets jail time he deserves he runs into all these people who he has beaten earlier film even runs into his two droogs they all punish him we feel slight sympathy his character he is locked room by mr alexander husband woman who died injuries sustained during singin rain scene forced listened beethoven this music reminds him crimes he commited it tortures him point near suicide he jumps out window mr alexander goes jail ludovico techique is seen as wrong is being pushed be stopped alex is now seen as hero newspapers ending is left interpretation i think that alex definitely wasnt cured he is going continue this endless cycle r e violence unlike books ending which has alex become normal human being overall this is most unique intriguing movie i have ever seen,0.4557663690476191,0.07842261904761906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,The number one film of all time. **** out of ****,"A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971) ****Starring: Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Michael Bates, Warren Clarke, and Adrienne Corri Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick  137 minutes  Rated R (for strong explicit sexual content and rape, perverse nudity, brutal violence, and some language)By Blake French:	Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" holds the recent record of being the number one film of all time on my charts. The film is everything that you'll never want to watch. The scenes are disturbing, gut wrenching, mind twisting, and way over the top. In result, ""A Clockwork Orange"" has the most powerful and overwhelming dramatic impact that I have ever experienced in a mainstream film. 	""A Clockwork Orange"" is the story of a young man named Alex DeLarge, who is, by day, a regular student who lives with his parents at home, but, by night, a homicidal rapist/killer with his accomplices who dress up like demented clowns at a bleak freak show. He and his buddies weasel their way into the happy homes housing innocent people by chanting the same deceiving phrase every night: they scream that their friend has been critically wounded in an accident near by--and plead to use their telephone to call for help.For a few unfortunate souls, this devious trick proves to be successful in nature. One night, however, a woman known as ""The Cat Lady,"" refuses their plead, and calls the police in suspicion. Alex, being both smart and sneaky, somehow manages to break into this perverted woman's home, while his accomplices wait outside. Once indoors, a fight begins. A struggle featuring a sex toy owned by ""Cat Lady,"" one that not only causes panicked arousal, but also is featured as the weapon of her graphic and disturbing murder. Alex quickly flees the scene once the police sirens reach his shaky ears, but when he gets back to his pal's waiting outside, they return their experiences with him by bashing him over the head with a hard object, allowing their jumbled escape, but his certain demise. After the process of being sent to prison, Alex grows to learn to tell offices and guards what they like to hear. He reads the bible, is never involved with any major fights or complications, and almost volunteers for a new kind of experiment. An experiment so probationary it is still being tested and held under wraps. What it does, though a series of ""sessions,"" is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.The scenes involving the ""cure"" of Alex's disturbances are truly emotionally troublesome. They are so explicit and detailed that I myself felt tempted to look away from the screen at points. This is not a film for those who are prone to walk out of movies, those who are easily offended, or especially for those with week stomachs. This is the most grizzly enumerated film I have even screened, but it happens to be one of the most perfect and precise in message. I definitely don't recommend the production to everyone, though. The soundtrack to ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most inspirational and spirited ones I have ever heard; right up there with the turns to ""The Graduate"" (1967). Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.Here, a young Malcolm McDowell explores the character of a lifetime with vivid imagination and tremendous description. His character fits him very well as an actor. Even though the character is meant to be despised, I couldn't help but to be very convinced and interested in his sick, demented, psychotic mind. Most of this is because of the flawless point of view the film contains, one that both provokes empathy and involvement. It investigates the mind of a killer, rapist, and a confused, somewhat harmless, adolescent--all existing in the same character. This is no doubt the character, and the performance, that inspired a generation.As well as being a movie of violent and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction to ""A Clockwork Orange"" also forces us to investigate deep down in ourselves and chew on the idea of us being in the character's shoes. There is a scene in this movie that forces two parents to make a decision of a lifetime. After receiving the treatments he volunteered for, Alex returns to his household only to discover that the only mom and dad he's even known have rented his old room out to some strange college kid, who is said to have been there for them during many hard times--like a real son. His parents must make a choice: to throw their only son, who has suffered for years in turn for making others suffer, out of the house for good, or allow him to return with open arms trusting that he is ""cured.""

10.0,One of the greatest films ever made,"I haven't read the novel that this film is based upon, and I didn't know that much about it before I sat down to see it. I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it. I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful. From the very first frame to the very last... amazing. Kubrick's style is magnificent, his storytelling is among the best ever seen in cinema. With this film he truly captures the raw and pure qualities of violence. I don't think(well, I certainly don't hope) that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as an ode or a tribute to violence... this is not, in any way, shape, or form glorifying violence or violent behavior. Quite the contrary, you might say. The film proves, once and for all, that violence spawns violence. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The angles, pans, tracking shots... fantastic work. The ideas presented in the film are more than enough to disturb and freak out any normal person... which is(at least part of) the point. If I mention the words 'eyes opened forcefully' you probably already know what I'm talking about, right? That famous sequence has been referenced, spoofed and talked about more times than just about any other visual impression in the history of cinema. The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing. I found a surprise at every change in scenery or even in immediate situation, especially in the latter part of the movie. The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity. We are beasts, we are what is commonly referred to as 'inhumane'... and Kubrick tells us this in a truly astonishing manner. The plot is very good. It deals with the main character of Alex, beautifully played by Malcolm McDowell, who loves 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies. The pacing is... well, hard to describe, really... it feels slow, the movie seems to move slowly... but it hardly drags at all. It's exhausting, not to mention hard to sit through, both due to the extreme content and the slowly moving plot, but it's all worth it. The point is pure genius. Pure Kubrick. The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly. Every single actor performs perfectly. The characters are perfectly written, credible in every scene and interesting. The cinematography is pure beauty... pure excellence. I've come to love Kubrick's visual style. His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing. His use of music is astounding... the use of classical music is great and really adds to the ironic tone and the atmosphere, the mood of the film. This is truly a work of art, and an exhausting but truly worthwhile film. I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or intelligent theater. If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film. Be prepared, though, it does contain quite a lot of disturbing themes and ideas, and is not in any way for the faint of heart. 10/10",one greatest films ever made,i havent read novel that this film is based upon i didnt know that much about it before i sat down see it i decided see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise film fact only negative comments ive ever heard about it is that it deviates too much original novel which is something kubrick was famous because i immensely enjoyed shining kubricks directorial style as seen it i must say its been quite while since i saw something so full spectacular exhausting powerful very first frame very last amazing kubricks style is magnificent his storytelling is among best ever seen cinema with this film he truly captures raw pure qualities violence i dont think well i certainly dont hope that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as ode or tribute violence this is not any way shape or form glorifying violence or violent behavior quite contrary you might say film proves once all that violence spawns violence visually film is absolutely stunning angles pans tracking shots fantastic work ideas presented film are more than enough disturb freak out any normal person which is at least part point if i mention words eyes opened forcefully you probably already know what im talking about right that famous sequence has been referenced spoofed talked about more times than just about any other visual impression history cinema way everyone everything turns at alex after hes apparently cured truly disturbing i found surprise at every change scenery or even immediate situation especially latter part movie way society turns against alex after he rejoins it apparently better man one most true real cinematic truths ever told humanity we are beasts we are what is commonly referred as inhumane kubrick tells us this truly astonishing manner plot is very good it deals with main character alex beautifully played by malcolm mcdowell who loves bit old ultra violence he is incarcerated offered chance be re entered society after being cured his psychotic tendencies pacing is well hard describe really it feels slow movie seems move slowly but it hardly drags at all its exhausting not mention hard sit through both due extreme content slowly moving plot but its all worth it point is pure genius pure kubrick acting is flawless believe me that is not term i use lightly every single actor performs perfectly characters are perfectly written credible every scene interesting cinematography is pure beauty pure excellence ive come love kubricks visual style his cuts varying speed intensity his long takes when dealing with dialog truly amazing his use music is astounding use classical music is great really adds ironic tone atmosphere mood film this is truly work art exhausting but truly worthwhile film i havent seen anything quite like it while fact maybe i never have i recommend this any fan kubrick or intelligent theater if you believe yourself be perceptive intelligent enough understand film most or all its levels i dont claim not at all or even most basic levels such as theme morale which is what i understood it then you should nay then you need see this film be prepared though it does contain quite lot disturbing themes ideas is not any way faint heart 10 10,0.5692041410126516,0.19032278596108382,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8.0,A controversial and offensive masterpiece.,"Anyone looking to watch A Clockwork Orange might be wanting to revisit some of Stanley Kubrik's work and might be interested in studying this film. Those who have already seen this film tend to already have strong opinions regarding this dark sci-fi movie but for me, I approached this film recently to obtain an opinion for myself and study one of the great masters of cinema. The fact that this film was regarded as one of the most controversial films ever made (rightfully so) sparked genuine curiosity to give this flick a full viewing and while I have large issues with the film, the experience as a whole was both satisfying and a learning experience. This story centers on ""Alex"" our main protagonist and his gang of hoodlums set in a not so distant, dystopian Great Britain. The beginning portion unfolds Alex's dark and twisted soul as we watch him and his gang fight, rape, and kill. When he's eventually caught, he undergoes controversial ""treatment"" to be cured of his dark soul.I first appreciated the inmate concepts of this story and the type of questions the story attempted to raise to the audience. Furthermore, much of the psychological ideologies surrounding freedom, choice, good vs evil, and selfishness were extremely thought-provoking. It had a way of making me feel self-exploratory despite the character's complete inability to relate with (hopefully) any viewer. Performances were top notch; especially from the lead: Malcom McDowell. His performance felt so authentic there's never a single moment that feels fake or forced with his dark character. As always, Stanley Kubrick directs the hell out of this. His commanding and authoritative shooting style is apparent in every frame of the picture and he does a wonderful job at sucking the viewer into this terrible world to the point of enthrallment. While all these positives make for a great movie-going experience and when Kubrick is at the director's helm not much can go wrong, the film's biggest downfall is indeed its controversy. Disturbing subject matter in this piece is indeed vital to the essence of the story but taking off the gloves when it comes to fighting, rape, and killing (especially the rape) make this so incredibly disturbing that it's difficult to muscle through. I found that A Clockwork Orange was not only offense because of its disturbing content, it was personally offensive in so many ways. Frankly, these extremely rare and offensive movie experiences are not quite the reason I enjoy films in the first place; stories can still be thought-provoking while not morally offend and damage the viewer internally. In addition, a viewer looking to study the work of Stanley Kubrick can still experience some of cinema's greatest and transcendent experiences without feeling like their conscience has blackened.It's understandable that not everyone feels this way; just as stated before, opinions about this film are all across the board. As time has passed however, A Clockwork Orange has stood out has one of Kubrick's finest and has been adored by die-hard fans so much its fan base has grown over the years. The best advice to give is to see it for yourself. Much like all other Kubrick films, relying on anyone's opinion won't help one bit. Seeing it and deciding for yourself is the best course of action. That being said, despite it's strong artistic merit, I wouldn't recommend seeing it simply because of the morally offensive and sickening content that most don't appreciate. Overall, it's been the hardest one to review in a long time because it's not a simple: see it or don't see it. There's much more to this picture than that. If you do decide to see it though, be warned and well prepared. If not, that's probably just fine too.",controversial offensive masterpiece,anyone looking watch clockwork orange might be wanting revisit some stanley kubriks work might be interested studying this film those who have already seen this film tend already have strong opinions regarding this dark sci fi movie but me i approached this film recently obtain opinion myself study one great masters cinema fact that this film was regarded as one most controversial films ever made rightfully so sparked genuine curiosity give this flick full viewing while i have large issues with film experience as whole was both satisfying learning experience this story centers alex our main protagonist his gang hoodlums set not so distant dystopian great britain beginning portion unfolds alexs dark twisted soul as we watch him his gang fight rape kill when hes eventually caught he undergoes controversial treatment be cured his dark soul i first appreciated inmate concepts this story type questions story attempted raise audience furthermore much psychological ideologies surrounding freedom choice good vs evil selfishness were extremely thought provoking it had way making me feel self exploratory despite characters complete inability relate with hopefully any viewer performances were top notch especially lead malcom mcdowell his performance felt so authentic theres never single moment that feels fake or forced with his dark character as always stanley kubrick directs hell out this his commanding authoritative shooting style is apparent every frame picture he does wonderful job at sucking viewer into this terrible world point enthrallment while all these positives make great movie going experience when kubrick is at directors helm not much can go wrong films biggest downfall is indeed its controversy disturbing subject matter this piece is indeed vital essence story but taking off gloves when it comes fighting rape killing especially rape make this so incredibly disturbing that its difficult muscle through i found that clockwork orange was not only offense because its disturbing content it was personally offensive so many ways frankly these extremely rare offensive movie experiences are not quite reason i enjoy films first place stories can still be thought provoking while not morally offend damage viewer internally addition viewer looking study work stanley kubrick can still experience some cinemas greatest transcendent experiences without feeling like their conscience has blackened its understandable that not everyone feels this way just as stated before opinions about this film are all across board as time has passed however clockwork orange has stood out has one kubricks finest has been adored by die hard fans so much its fan base has grown over years best advice give is see it yourself much like all other kubrick films relying anyones opinion wont help one bit seeing it deciding yourself is best course action that being said despite its strong artistic merit i wouldnt recommend seeing it simply because morally offensive sickening content that most dont appreciate overall its been hardest one review long time because its not simple see it or dont see it theres much more this picture than that if you do decide see it though be warned well prepared if not thats probably just fine too,0.5700501253132831,0.11677631578947366,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Best movie ever made,"A Clockwork Orange is the finest film that has ever been made, in my view. Stanley Kubrick has made so many masterpieces, and is by far the best director that ever graced our world. A Clockwork Orange is simply his finest hour!The film grabs you and glues you to your seat from start to finish. Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!). It contains horrifying violence, extreme emotions, perversity and weirdness at it's very worst. It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it. I know I didn't. Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all. After the third time, I was lost for words.After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them. I'm sure you'll agree, if you give it the chance it deserves, although it may require for you to see it more than once.",best movie ever made,clockwork orange is finest film that has ever been made my view stanley kubrick has made so many masterpieces is by far best director that ever graced our world clockwork orange is simply his finest hour film grabs you glues you your seat start finish malcolm mcdowell gives us shining example superior acting movie is as perverted as any kubricks masterpieces then some it contains horrifying violence extreme emotions perversity weirdness at its very worst it all boils down serve you plethora thoughts you take with you contemplate after film ends however with all perversity bursting out this film you will probably not like this film first time you see it i know i didnt fortunately i gave it second chance thought hey it was actually not bad at all after third time i was lost words after fourth time there was little doubt my mind that this was finest film ever made regardless how many great masterpieces i see clockwork orange still towers above them im sure youll agree if you give it chance it deserves although it may require you see it more than once,0.5036922015182885,0.1839975845410628,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Incredible Vision of Future Ultra-Violence,"Clockwork Orange, A (1971) **** (out of 4) Set at some point in the future, British teen Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) spends most of his time hanging with his goon friends, raping women and causing other violent harm but after he's caught he volunteers for an experimental therapy that doesn't quite work as planned. Sick, shocking, crude, violent, nauseating and vulgar are just a few of the words that many will use when describing this film but I'd call it a true piece of art that rightfully deserves its high reputation. Many people have said that a Kubrick film would never be a Kubrick film if it wasn't an ego-maniac you took his sweet time to make sure what made it to the screen was his vision and only his vision. There's something beautiful about a painter taking his time to make sure his painting has all the right colors and vibes yet if a filmmaker does this he's often criticized for it. There's no doubt in my mind that Kubrick was a mad genius and that's never more evident in this adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel. To me the greatest thing about this movie is its sick and twisted sense of humor but also the visual look of the film. It's amazing what Kubrick can do in the matter of seconds but the masterful and now legendary opening sequence only lasts a few seconds yet it pulls you into this bizarre world of sex and murder. These two objects are never a funny thing yet Kubrick pulls us into this world where we can laugh at them and follow our ""hero"" Alex as he rapes one person after another, murders and fights only for us to eventually come to see him as the good guy and a victim. I'm sure one could make this film a very political one and many arguments have been raged about the meaning of the ending but everyone who watches the film will draw something different from it and I'm sure ones own opinion on what's done to our hero will have you seeing the ending in different ways. For me personally, the film has always been an incredibly dark comedy that works simply because the world we're watching might be set in the future but you could call it ahead of its time just like METROPOLIS was. It takes place in the future with the bizarre sets and weird culture yet at the same time the subject matter is so today that you can't help but feel you're in the middle of some nightmare. McDowell's performance is a truly great one as he perfectly plays both the psychotic Alex but also the victim. I thought some of McDowell's greatest work here comes once he's cured and can no longer tolerate violence. What's even better is the narration, which is downright superb and wonderfully used by the director with the actor perfectly delivering the lines and helping one get into the story. You'll also never hear ""Singin' in the Rain"" the same way again. Some people call the film overindulgent, which is probably is but I see this as a good thing. This just helps create this strange world and in the end it's really unlike any movie ever made and there's just something so unique in its vision that you can't help but feel this is something from the future. Kubrick's vision has never been questioned and fans could debate on which of his features has the greatest look but for my money it's this film. That's not to say this is the director's greatest film but I do think it has the great look and feel. It's certainly a very violent movie but the director gives the violence such a pleasant nature that it just seems normal and rather light. The strange music selection, crazy camera shots and overall strange tone makes it a one of a kind and that's why A CLOCKWORK ORANGE will always be a timeless work of art.",incredible vision future ultra violence,clockwork orange 1971 out 4 set at some point future british teen alex delarge malcolm mcdowell spends most his time hanging with his goon friends raping women causing other violent harm but after hes caught he volunteers experimental therapy that doesnt quite work as planned sick shocking crude violent nauseating vulgar are just few words that many will use when describing this film but id call it true piece art that rightfully deserves its high reputation many people have said that kubrick film would never be kubrick film if it wasnt ego maniac you took his sweet time make sure what made it screen was his vision only his vision theres something beautiful about painter taking his time make sure his painting has all right colors vibes yet if filmmaker does this hes often criticized it theres no doubt my mind that kubrick was mad genius thats never more evident this adaptation anthony burgess novel me greatest thing about this movie is its sick twisted sense humor but also visual look film its amazing what kubrick can do matter seconds but masterful now legendary opening sequence only lasts few seconds yet it pulls you into this bizarre world sex murder these two objects are never funny thing yet kubrick pulls us into this world where we can laugh at them follow our hero alex as he rapes one person after another murders fights only us eventually come see him as good guy victim im sure one could make this film very political one many arguments have been raged about meaning ending but everyone who watches film will draw something different it im sure ones own opinion whats done our hero will have you seeing ending different ways me personally film has always been incredibly dark comedy that works simply because world were watching might be set future but you could call it ahead its time just like metropolis was it takes place future with bizarre sets weird culture yet at same time subject matter is so today that you cant help but feel youre middle some nightmare mcdowells performance is truly great one as he perfectly plays both psychotic alex but also victim i thought some mcdowells greatest work here comes once hes cured can no longer tolerate violence whats even better is narration which is downright superb wonderfully used by director with actor perfectly delivering lines helping one get into story youll also never hear singin rain same way again some people call film overindulgent which is probably is but i see this as good thing this just helps create this strange world end its really unlike any movie ever made theres just something so unique its vision that you cant help but feel this is something future kubricks vision has never been questioned fans could debate which his features has greatest look but my money its this film thats not say this is directors greatest film but i do think it has great look feel its certainly very violent movie but director gives violence such pleasant nature that it just seems normal rather light strange music selection crazy camera shots overall strange tone makes it one kind thats why clockwork orange will always be timeless work art,0.6071897546897548,0.16856601731601725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,Daring and provocative,"This classic controversial film from Stanley Kubrick is a love-it-or-hate-it movie which tends to divide audiences like the rest of the director's filmography. It's certainly a unique movie, perfectly made up to Kubrick's impeccable standards and with important messages for us all. Take for example the core ""corrupt oppressive society"" vibe that runs from 1984 to BRAZIL and you have the basis for A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which tells of mind control being used on thugs and irredeemably evil prisoners. As well as this, Kubrick's movie looks at violence and its effects on both the purveyors and victims and proves to be a rewarding character study of an angry young man, as played by Malcolm McDowell (CALIGULA) in what can be called one of the defining performances of his career.Classical music has never been put to such good use as this in a film (aside from, perhaps, Kubrick's own 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) and it fully complements the on screen action. Brutal street battles are played out in slow-motion as soothing tunes blast out on the soundtrack and the result is an effective depiction of the beauty of violence, if it can be called as such. Scenes showing Alex and his droogs going about their daily business of raping innocent women and beating innocent men are thoroughly horrific and very violent for the time, although of course the impact has been dulled by what has come since. However, the best parts of the film come during Alex's therapy, as he is forced to watch violent film after violent film in a dark cinema and gradually becomes sickened to the sight of violence and, indeed, sex. The aftermath keeps you guessing as to the eventual outcome, making for some very tense scenes when Alex finds himself in the home of a man he had previously crippled.The acting is of a high calibre, with many strong supporting performances to complement Malcolm McDowell's own shining example. Of particular note are Warren Clarke and the others playing Alex's scarily sadistic droogs; Patrick Magee (DEMENTIA 13) who has a field day as the mentally unstable victim; Adrienne Corri as a rape victim of the gang and the actors playing the various doctors and scientists. Sharp eyes may spot future Darth Vader Dave Prowse playing Magee's strongman bodyguard. My only complaint with the movie is that it has now become inevitably dated. The use of obscure language for the most simple of terms just seems a bit pretentious and unnecessary and defeats the air of realism the movie is trying to put across. However, seen with a fresh eye, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is daring and intelligent cinema and a well-made film to boot, not exactly entertaining but certainly though-provoking and challenging.",daring provocative,this classic controversial film stanley kubrick is love it or hate it movie which tends divide audiences like rest directors filmography its certainly unique movie perfectly made up kubricks impeccable standards with important messages us all take example core corrupt oppressive society vibe that runs 1984 brazil you have basis clockwork orange which tells mind control being used thugs irredeemably evil prisoners as well as this kubricks movie looks at violence its effects both purveyors victims proves be rewarding character study angry young man as played by malcolm mcdowell caligula what can be called one defining performances his career classical music has never been put such good use as this film aside perhaps kubricks own 2001 space odyssey it fully complements screen action brutal street battles are played out slow motion as soothing tunes blast out soundtrack result is effective depiction beauty violence if it can be called as such scenes showing alex his droogs going about their daily business raping innocent women beating innocent men are thoroughly horrific very violent time although course impact has been dulled by what has come since however best parts film come during alexs therapy as he is forced watch violent film after violent film dark cinema gradually becomes sickened sight violence indeed sex aftermath keeps you guessing as eventual outcome making some very tense scenes when alex finds himself home man he had previously crippled acting is high calibre with many strong supporting performances complement malcolm mcdowells own shining example particular note are warren clarke others playing alexs scarily sadistic droogs patrick magee dementia 13 who has field day as mentally unstable victim adrienne corri as rape victim gang actors playing various doctors scientists sharp eyes may spot future darth vader dave prowse playing magees strongman bodyguard my only complaint with movie is that it has now become inevitably dated use obscure language most simple terms just seems bit pretentious unnecessary defeats air realism movie is trying put across however seen with fresh eye clockwork orange is daring intelligent cinema well made film boot not exactly entertaining but certainly though provoking challenging,0.6089110070257611,0.0379664324746292,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.41}"
7.0,The milky bar kid,"A Clockwork Orange was always a film I wanted to watch but it was one of these films that I was too young to watch when it was initially released in British cinemas and then banned by Director Stanley Kubrick from being available in Britain. The ban remained until he died.The film became infamous for its depiction of violence and sex. It overlooked the fact that despite its initial scenes of brutality and rape, in its heart it is a dark comedy set in a futuristic Dystopian Britain.An adaptation of Anthony Burgess novel, Malcolm McDowell might be a shade too old to play the teenage delinquent Alex getting high on milk-plus which is infused with drugs and then partakes in an orgy of ultra-violence which includes beating up a vagrant, fighting with a rival gang and then speeding through the country roads where they burst into the house of a writer who gets beaten up and watches his wife get raped as Alex sings Singin in the rain.We know Alex is still at school as he lives in his parents flat and is visited the next morning by his probation officer who is concerned about his absence from school.However Alex's luck runs out. He falls out with his fellow gang members and when he breaks into another house, he kills a woman with a phallic sculpture, betrayed by his gang and caught by the police, he is sentenced to 14 years in jail.The opening part of the film would had been deemed shocking in early 1970s Britain. I doubt that level of sex and savagery would had ever been seen before in a mainstream British film.However the film becomes more of a surreal prison film once Alex ends up in jail where he joins a church group and tries to fend off advances from fellow inmates. A visiting government minister offers him a chance to take part in an experiment. Once he undertakes an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks the film becomes a black revenge comedy.Once freed from prison and rehabilitated Alex finds there is no room for him in his parents home, he gets set upon by a gang of vagrants as the tramp who he beat up in the beginning recognises Alex. His old gang members are now in the police and they torture him. Worse still he stumbles into the house of the writer who he attacked and he gets his vengeance as well. Poor Alex now cannot listen to his favourite piece of Beethoven without doing harm to himself.There is an underlying political satire of a government wanting to tackle violence in society by being draconian themselves until public opinion turns against them.The film contains a lot of slang derived from east European languages and although I mentioned he looked rather old to play the teenage Alex, Malcolm McDowell delivers an amazing performance providing a narrative with his Yorkshire tones.The film might put off some of its audience with its disturbing opening but settles in well after that.",milky bar kid,clockwork orange was always film i wanted watch but it was one these films that i was too young watch when it was initially released british cinemas then banned by director stanley kubrick being available britain ban remained until he died film became infamous its depiction violence sex it overlooked fact that despite its initial scenes brutality rape its heart it is dark comedy set futuristic dystopian britain adaptation anthony burgess novel malcolm mcdowell might be shade too old play teenage delinquent alex getting high milk plus which is infused with drugs then partakes orgy ultra violence which includes beating up vagrant fighting with rival gang then speeding through country roads where they burst into house writer who gets beaten up watches his wife get raped as alex sings singin rain we know alex is still at school as he lives his parents flat is visited next morning by his probation officer who is concerned about his absence school however alexs luck runs out he falls out with his fellow gang members when he breaks into another house he kills woman with phallic sculpture betrayed by his gang caught by police he is sentenced 14 years jail opening part film would had been deemed shocking early 1970s britain i doubt that level sex savagery would had ever been seen before mainstream british film however film becomes more surreal prison film once alex ends up jail where he joins church group tries fend off advances fellow inmates visiting government minister offers him chance take part experiment once he undertakes experimental aversion therapy rehabilitating criminals within two weeks film becomes black revenge comedy once freed prison rehabilitated alex finds there is no room him his parents home he gets set upon by gang vagrants as tramp who he beat up beginning recognises alex his old gang members are now police they torture him worse still he stumbles into house writer who he attacked he gets his vengeance as well poor alex now cannot listen his favourite piece beethoven without doing harm himself there is underlying political satire government wanting tackle violence society by being draconian themselves until public opinion turns against them film contains lot slang derived east european languages although i mentioned he looked rather old play teenage alex malcolm mcdowell delivers amazing performance providing narrative with his yorkshire tones film might put off some its audience with its disturbing opening but settles well after that,0.3107352941176471,-0.024828431372549024,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Controversial yet very fascinating,"I like and respect Stanley Kubrick, and feel that along with 2001, Dr Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon, A Clockwork Orange is one of his best films. It is probably Kubrick's most controversial film, but it is also one of his most fascinating at the same time. It is the sort of movie that you need to see more than once though, I didn't think much of it first time I love it and appreciate it much more now for what it set out to do.A Clockwork Orange is a shocking film I give you that, particularly with the rape and sadistic ultra-violence in the first half, and the scenes where Alex is being brainwashed do bring forth ambiguous messages. Still, like with the rest of Kubrick's work it is very well made, has a haunting soundtrack that fits wonderfully with the tone of the film(especially loved the use of the Beethoven), superb writing and direction from Kubrick and a compelling story that evokes thought afterword complete with a purposefully unrepentent ending. Also Malcolm McDowell is absolutely superb in what I consider the performance of his career.In conclusion, very fascinating film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",controversial yet very fascinating,i like respect stanley kubrick feel that along with 2001 dr strangelove full metal jacket barry lyndon clockwork orange is one his best films it is probably kubricks most controversial film but it is also one his most fascinating at same time it is sort movie that you need see more than once though i didnt think much it first time i love it appreciate it much more now what it set out do clockwork orange is shocking film i give you that particularly with rape sadistic ultra violence first half scenes where alex is being brainwashed do bring forth ambiguous messages still like with rest kubricks work it is very well made has haunting soundtrack that fits wonderfully with tone film especially loved use beethoven superb writing direction kubrick compelling story that evokes thought afterword complete with purposefully unrepentent ending also malcolm mcdowell is absolutely superb what i consider performance his career conclusion very fascinating film 10 10 bethany cox,0.6316666666666666,0.4628000000000001,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Kubrick's best,"Stanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love. The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt. I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame. It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time. But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to. It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wicked person ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does. And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth. It's sick, but at the same time brilliant. And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it. It just is what it is. It's real. No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows. And no one does anything about it. In essence, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the ultimate satire, and one of the ultimate film experiences.

8.0,Realistic,"A dystopian vision of the future based on two elements: knowledge of human character and fabulous set designs.The man is a bad boy and does not care for anyone or anything.

9.0,"A film described as the sociological masterpiece of the decade and, often as dangerously vicious","""A Clockwork Orange"" starts out with Alex and his gang of ""droogs"" sitting in the Kerova milk bar drinking the milk plus... Then the camera starts slowly to move back and we see naked female statues and drink machines which purl out the milk through their breasts...McDowell is splendid as the star-child Alex... He is simply a vicious and amazing sadist monster, lethal in his sincerity, taking delight in rape and violence... Never such a vile character has been so charismatic and attractive... His life is perplexing, questionable and terrifying... He doesn't show the slightest regard for other's rights or morality... He doesn't even regard his victims as human beings...His paradoxical character is in nearly every scene... McDowell captures Alex's human and inhuman side with equal skill... Alex is a victim at the mercy of an uncaring society, condemned to the physically unbearable ""dislike therapy"" and preyed upon by his former targets...Set in England in the near future a future which vaguely reflects our own, but it seems that society has started to crumble and at night the streets are driven with teenage gangs who run free of parental control...""A Clockwork Orange"" is too strong for some people to accept and is still too powerful today... It is an extremely disturbing meditation on the violent nature of man... Kubrick emphasizes the human element by paradoxically dehumanizing the characters...Viewers see images they may not have wanted to see, but will never be able to forget... He presents violence in a confusing and increasing fashion that makes it alarmingly attractive... He invites us to join Alex in raping and pillaging into London urban jungle to show that violence and power are invariably attractive... He makes good use of the camera, showing, in strange ways, the furious underworld of Alex... Kubrick is the driving force behind ""A Clockwork Orange."" The film is without exception his picture... He took the novel of Anthony Burgess re-shaping it to fit his own vision... Images and sound pull in different directions, stimulating conflicting emotions... In a bizarre juxtaposition of often classical music with violence, we see ourselves manipulated into cheering for Alex, despite his brutal and amoral nature... We are forced to really think about the implications of the events with no answer...The film serves as a battleground for philosophical arguments making comments without forcing an opinion instead preferring that we ourselves decide what to make of the satire... Exposing themes to think about, significant prediction, liberalism of society, sexual acts gaining acceptance, violent films in higher degree, alcohol-currently legal, accounts for many acts of violence, crime out of control, violence in schools, television, illustrating the inconstant nature of public opinion, raising questions, themes and ideas that many people would prefer not to confront...Style has always been one of Kubrick's strong points... He maintained a reputation for an obsessive attention to detail... He was known for getting the most out of his actors... Distinct images often play a significant part in his films...With its dynamic bizarre sets and pulsating classical music score, and with a word of warning on how bad violence is and should be watched very closely, Kubrick's motion picture is unsurpassed with intellectual content... It is a film described often as the sociological masterpiece of the decade and, often as dangerously vicious a film with more violent sex and dangerous thugs than any other I can remember, a film which daringly brought to larger-than-life those areas of the unconscious mind which some people felt were best left hiddenIt is also highly dramatic, extremely graphic, compelling and provoking... It is frightening and intriguing masterpiece with a powerful message about the reality of human nature...",film described as sociological masterpiece decade often as dangerously vicious,clockwork orange starts out with alex his gang droogs sitting kerova milk bar drinking milk plus then camera starts slowly move back we see naked female statues drink machines which purl out milk through their breasts mcdowell is splendid as star child alex he is simply vicious amazing sadist monster lethal his sincerity taking delight rape violence never such vile character has been so charismatic attractive his life is perplexing questionable terrifying he doesnt show slightest regard others rights or morality he doesnt even regard his victims as human beings his paradoxical character is nearly every scene mcdowell captures alexs human inhuman side with equal skill alex is victim at mercy uncaring society condemned physically unbearable dislike therapy preyed upon by his former targets set england near future future which vaguely reflects our own but it seems that society has started crumble at night streets are driven with teenage gangs who run free parental control clockwork orange is too strong some people accept is still too powerful today it is extremely disturbing meditation violent nature man kubrick emphasizes human element by paradoxically dehumanizing characters viewers see images they may not have wanted see but will never be able forget he presents violence confusing increasing fashion that makes it alarmingly attractive he invites us join alex raping pillaging into london urban jungle show that violence power are invariably attractive he makes good use camera showing strange ways furious underworld alex kubrick is driving force behind clockwork orange film is without exception his picture he took novel anthony burgess re shaping it fit his own vision images sound pull different directions stimulating conflicting emotions bizarre juxtaposition often classical music with violence we see ourselves manipulated into cheering alex despite his brutal amoral nature we are forced really think about implications events with no answer film serves as battleground philosophical arguments making comments without forcing opinion instead preferring that we ourselves decide what make satire exposing themes think about significant prediction liberalism society sexual acts gaining acceptance violent films higher degree alcohol currently legal accounts many acts violence crime out control violence schools television illustrating inconstant nature public opinion raising questions themes ideas that many people would prefer not confront style has always been one kubricks strong points he maintained reputation obsessive attention detail he was known getting most out his actors distinct images often play significant part his films with its dynamic bizarre sets pulsating classical music score with word warning how bad violence is should be watched very closely kubricks motion picture is unsurpassed with intellectual content it is film described often as sociological masterpiece decade often as dangerously vicious film with more violent sex dangerous thugs than any other i can remember film which daringly brought larger than life those areas unconscious mind which some people felt were best left hidden it is also highly dramatic extremely graphic compelling provoking it is frightening intriguing masterpiece with powerful message about reality human nature,0.522534013605442,0.047321428571428556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,"Sick and Disturbing, But Ultimately Brilliant","Stanley Kubrick directed and co-wrote this wild and crazy film which deals with a murdering, stealing, and raping Malcolm McDowell and his small gang of thugs in a not-too-distant future. They are in London and by night they terrorize anyone and everyone who they want. When McDowell is betrayed by his fellow mates, he is put into prison and is subjected to an experimental therapy which works wonders for the youth. Now the thought or sight of violence is sickening to him. He also grows sick of Beethoven's music, which he once loved, because of its use in the experiment. When he is freed, he runs into all those who he crossed in his past and they all have revenge in mind for McDowell. McDowell ultimately tries suicide to escape his life, he fails, and is then given a formal apology from the state and is reverted back to the way he was in the beginning. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is ultimately sick and disturbing, but conveys some real strong messages in unconventional ways. Kubrick shows that there are some solutions to various problems, but many times those solutions cause new problems that are just as nasty, if not more so, than the first set. McDowell shines in his role. His character is basically the only three-dimensional person in the movie and it is meant to be that way. The other characters are meant to be somewhat flat and under-developed to show just how alone McDowell is in his twisted world. Overall a great film and easily one of Kubrick's best. 5 stars out of 5.",sick disturbing but ultimately brilliant,stanley kubrick directed co wrote this wild crazy film which deals with murdering stealing raping malcolm mcdowell his small gang thugs not too distant future they are london by night they terrorize anyone everyone who they want when mcdowell is betrayed by his fellow mates he is put into prison is subjected experimental therapy which works wonders youth now thought or sight violence is sickening him he also grows sick beethovens music which he once loved because its use experiment when he is freed he runs into all those who he crossed his past they all have revenge mind mcdowell mcdowell ultimately tries suicide escape his life he fails is then given formal apology state is reverted back way he was beginning clockwork orange is ultimately sick disturbing but conveys some real strong messages unconventional ways kubrick shows that there are some solutions various problems but many times those solutions cause new problems that are just as nasty if not more so than first set mcdowell shines his role his character is basically only three dimensional person movie it is meant be that way other characters are meant be somewhat flat under developed show just how alone mcdowell is his twisted world overall great film easily one kubricks best 5 stars out 5,0.5725776674306087,-0.060975299210593324,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,"A great, but hard watch","I've struggled a bit with this film more than any other Kubrick. The problem is that I think I get it too easily, or I don't get it at all. I'm never quite sure.One thing's for sure, it's a hard watch at times. Kubrick, taking Anthony Burgess' novella and running with it, creates a main character so loathsome and charming all at once that it can create a certain dissonance in an audience (Roger Ebert's review of the original release is a fantastic example of a reviewer who simply could not see past Alex de Large as anything other than a celebration of antisocial behavior). The film jumps off the deep end from the very beginning, showing the audience Alex at his most primal and pure, an advocate of the good ultra-violence in charge of three droogs out to cause mayhem and pursue their own pleasures. So unburdened by any existing power structures at any level that Alex can simply get high, beat up other gangs, steal cars, break into houses, rob said houses, and rape women and just crawl back into the bed in his parents' apartment without so much as a serious question from an authority figure. He's not getting caught by the police, so he doesn't care and neither do his parents, so it seems.The introduction of Alex's violence is interesting in its structure. The first incident involves the beating of an old drunk man. It's filmed in shadow to help hide the particulars of the violent act, but it shouldn't endear Alex to the audience. The second, I believe, has an unexpected and subtle effect on its audience. Seemingly just bored, Alex seeks out a rival gang. When he finds them, the other gang is in the process of trying to rape a woman, and in comes Alex whose presence allows the woman to escape. No matter what Alex's intention, one of the direct results of his actions is that a woman is saved from rape. I think there's an unconscious acknowledgement by much of the audience at that which pushes many of them to side with Alex. That is undercut, though, by the next sequence where Alex breaks into the country home, beats an old man (crippling him), and cutting off his wife's clothes (while singing ""Singin' in the Rain"" of course) and, implicitly, raping her. Alex is a monster, but in the middle of our long introduction to him where he intentionally does nothing good, he accidentally does something good. I suspect it has an effect on some people they don't really realize.Anyway, Alex, dealing with some internal strife from his gang led by Georgie, ends up killing a woman and turned on by his mates. He's thrown in prison where, two years later, he is the chaplain's devout assistant. In fact, our introduction to Alex's settled life in prison doesn't really focus on him. The scene is focusing on the chaplain giving a sermon and some rowdy prisoners. Alex is off to the side, manning the projector for when they are to sing. Alex, though, hasn't changed at all. He's modified his external appearance, dressing well in his uniform and studying the Bible, but he only really likes the bits about blood and sex. In his mind, he's still the same depraved monster he was at the beginning.He jumps at the idea of an experimental treatment that promises to get him out of prison early. The treatment is that famous bit where Alex is tied into a chair, his eyes pried open, and he watches horrible things on a cinema screen. Combined with an experimental drug, Alex grows sick at the ideas of three things: violence, sex, and Beethoven's 9th symphony. He's not happy with any of the three, but it's the loss of his beloved Beethoven that hits him the hardest. The very sound of the 9th makes Alex ill and unable to function. It's around these experimental treatments that the chaplain makes explicit (shockingly so in a Kubrick film) that what I consider to be the central idea, ""Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""Alex can no longer chose to be bad. To a certain extent, he ceases to be human, and his return home after the successful demonstration of the treatment's effects help solidify this. His family want nothing to do with him. They've rented out his room and can't, for the sake of their boarder, let Alex move back in. Alex finds his former Droogs as police officers after the old man from the beginning of the film attacks Alex while he's incapacitated. The former Droogs nearly drown Alex as he's unable to fight. He's become so dehumanized that he can't even stand up for himself in any way. He ends up required to rely on the kindness of a stranger, the man whom he crippled and whose wife he raped. This man uses Alex's inability to take Beethoven's 9th symphony and drives him to a suicide attempt, casting himself out of the window.Recovering in a hospital, we discover that Alex has been cured of his cure. He's right back to being the antisocial loathsome creature he started the film. The fantasy sequence that ends the film, showing Alex romping with a naked woman to a cheering, Victorian dressed, audience solidifies that.So, is Kubrick saying that Alex's victory is being violent and psychopathic, as Ebert asserted nearly 50 years ago? No, I think Ebert missed the point. The point isn't that curing people of violence isn't a worthy goal, but that the cure needs to originate from within the person. Alex had to want to be changed, and he never wanted to change. He was always looking for ways out of his predicaments in order to get right on with the good ultra-violence. Forcing the change on him dehumanizes him. Better to do what the Chief Guard obviously thought best for Alex, locking him up forever, was probably a better fix.So, that's a thousand words on the film's thematic exploration. After having written it, I feel like I have a greater grasp on the ideas of the film than before, so that's quite nice. I still think that A Clockwork Orange is a second tier Kubrick film, though. I've read the film as a black comedy for a while, and it can be quite funny through that lens. The performances require a certain special mention. I don't think anyone in the film is doing a straight performance. Everything is mannered to such odd degrees, and I love them all. Patrick Magee as Mr. Alexander, in particular, tickles me. It's so off-kilter and perfect for the world yet still so utterly bizarre as to be eminently watchable.It's smart, but I don't think it looks as good as many of his other films. I feel like having the chaplain explicate the movie's central theme twice makes the ideas less interestingly presented. These are relatively minor complaints, but when comparing this to such films as 2001, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, or Eyes Wide Shut, I have to just say that A Clockwork Orange isn't as successful. Perhaps it will grow on me more with time, but I cannot imagine ever quite loving this movie as much as the listed others with a first act that makes me cringe so much. Yes, it's intentional and successful, but still...that's a hard watch.",great but hard watch,ive struggled bit with this film more than any other kubrick problem is that i think i get it too easily or i dont get it at all im never quite sure one things sure its hard watch at times kubrick taking anthony burgess novella running with it creates main character so loathsome charming all at once that it

,The Eye and the Genital,"Spoiler herein.Kubrick's films are misunderstood. Reading the professional reviews and comments here, one would think the reason for this film to exist is for Kubrick to make a strong satire. What bunk. What a small view.This movie is about the tyranny of movies (and similar performances). The fact that so few people see it as something else is a testament to the self-protective nature of films in our soul.The Droogs engage in performances. Their speech is theatrical. Their rival gang is discovered on the stage. There is a focus on the eye. They wear costumes. The sex with the teeniboppers is cast as a performance (and photographed that way). The accosted writer is (selfreferentially) the writer of the film, who incidentally drives the character to suicide by exposing him to a performance. During that attack, the Droogs act out another film.The therapy is forcing `us' to watch movies precisely like the one we are watching. Kubrick follows the Film-within-the-film rule of having the distance of abstraction from the film with to the film be the same as from `real' life to the film. The entire film can be seen as (pick one): one of the punishment films; a subsequent vision in the hospital; a musical drama played out in some kid's head; a simple hallucination in the milk bar; a simple invention of the gay writer (who pretends he had a wife).All of Kubrick's work starting with Lolita is an exploration into the plasticity of narrative, in the context of obsession (`Lolita'), war (Metal'), power , space (meaning the environment as in `Lyndon'), and invented reality (`2001') and adulterous fantasies (`Eyes'). Here we work with violent adolescent sex: cockworks. It is what Phil Dick had in mind.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4: Worth watching.",eye genital,spoiler herein kubricks films are misunderstood reading professional reviews comments here one would think reason this film exist is kubrick make strong satire what bunk what small view this movie is about tyranny movies similar performances fact that so few people see it as something else is testament self protective nature films our soul droogs engage performances their speech is theatrical their rival gang is discovered stage there is focus eye they wear costumes sex with teeniboppers is cast as performance photographed that way accosted writer is selfreferentially writer film who incidentally drives character suicide by exposing him performance during that attack droogs act out another film therapy is forcing us watch movies precisely like one we are watching kubrick follows film within film rule having distance abstraction film with film be same as real life film entire film can be seen as pick one one punishment films subsequent vision hospital musical drama played out some kids head simple hallucination milk bar simple invention gay writer who pretends he had wife all kubricks work starting with lolita is exploration into plasticity narrative context obsession lolita war metal power space meaning environment as lyndon invented reality 2001 adulterous fantasies eyes here we work with violent adolescent sex cockworks it is what phil dick had mind teds evaluation 3 4 worth watching,0.3406084656084655,0.03333333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.54}"
10.0,The art of violence.,"""A Clockwork Orange"" is a one of a kind masterpiece. It's odd, intelligent, funny and sickening. Kubrick at his best!The opening sequence in the milk bar might very well be the best and most well known opening in cinema history. The movie manages to stay strong throughout the whole movie after the opening and only gets better and never weakens for a bit. Every minute is a pleasure to watch because the movie never gets predictable in anyway and the oddness level of the movie makes it so that it will be always a surprise what will happen next and how it will happen.Every scene is pure cinema brilliance. The cinematography, sets, costumes and music all contribute to this, they make the movie a true piece of art. But the true artist is Stanley Kubrick who deserves the most credit. There are countless memorable moments, in other words, watching this movie is an experience that you'll not easily forget.The violent sequences are sickening, twisted, odd but also funny at the same time. The way they are filmed are unique and very artistic. It's violence in its purest form, it's violence at its best. It gives us a view in the the extreme violent twisted mind of the main character and how he struggles against society and how society struggles against him. The story sounds more complicated then it truly is. The movie itself is easy to follow but it are the layers and deeper meanings that makes this movie not easy if not impossible to explain.In my experience it is always very hard to comment on a Kubrick movie mainly because his movies always have so many layers and deeper meanings than a single few hundred words comment can describe. It is best to just watch this movie and experience the brilliance of it that is not easy to describe or explain.In my opinion the best movie ever made.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",art violence,clockwork orange is one kind masterpiece its odd intelligent funny sickening kubrick at his best opening sequence milk bar might very well be best most well known opening cinema history movie manages stay strong throughout whole movie after opening only gets better never weakens bit every minute is pleasure watch because movie never gets predictable anyway oddness level movie makes it so that it will be always surprise what will happen next how it will happen every scene is pure cinema brilliance cinematography sets costumes music all contribute this they make movie true piece art but true artist is stanley kubrick who deserves most credit there are countless memorable moments other words watching this movie is experience that youll not easily forget violent sequences are sickening twisted odd but also funny at same time way they are filmed are unique very artistic its violence its purest form its violence at its best it gives us view extreme violent twisted mind main character how he struggles against society how society struggles against him story sounds more complicated then it truly is movie itself is easy follow but it are layers deeper meanings that makes this movie not easy if not impossible explain my experience it is always very hard comment kubrick movie mainly because his movies always have so many layers deeper meanings than single few hundred words comment can describe it is best just watch this movie experience brilliance it that is not easy describe or explain my opinion best movie ever made 10 10,0.6337099125364432,0.13412293488824098,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.34}"
