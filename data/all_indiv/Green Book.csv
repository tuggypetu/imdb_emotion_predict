10,I Was Captivated,"I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them.

10,"""Green Book"" is Gold","We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!",green book is gold,we loved green book along with sold out crowd who applauded loudly at end based true story piano virtuoso don shirleys road trip through south during 60s film pays tribute his genius courage as black man who tries hard soar above ugliness times elegant trappings his home his success as concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold lonely but his life begins change when he hires tony as his road trip driver with history as nightclub bouncer with mafia connections new york tony is antithesis dons perfection their evolving relationship road makes movie soar above ordinary become magical viggo ali main roles are remarkable its funny endearing watch them discard stereotypes discover their mutual humanity what we liked best is movie teaches without preaching it all unfolds through myriad natural moments between two great actors strong supporting cast top all this off with really good soundtrack excellent direction production values audience that laughed out loud vigorously applauded at end this one is true 10,0.5601827094474153,0.252295008912656,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.23}"

Shirley has a specific reason for touring in the deep south.It's one hell of a journey (I know it's a term that's easily bandied about in films, but it's appropriate here,) physically and emotionally, it's a battle of wills, ideas, concepts, each man learns something from the other. You see the true horror of what Shirley faced in day to day life, from buying a suit, to eating dinner.The acting, is simply outstanding, you couldn't put a pin between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the pair are unbelievable in this film, it's no wonder awards came flooding in.It looks sensational, they brought 1962 to life, and the music throughout is spot on.I laughed, I sobbed, I connected, a cinematic triumph, Green Book is an incredible film. 10/10.",captivating watch with sensational acting,not often these days so i give ten stars film with green book however i had no other choice this film had me totally captivated its fascinating story i had no idea that it was based true events temporarily losing his job at club tony lip vallelonga gets job driving doctor don shirley shirley has specific reason touring deep south its one hell journey i know its term thats easily bandied about films but its appropriate here physically emotionally its battle wills ideas concepts each man learns something other you see true horror what shirley faced day day life buying suit eating dinner acting is simply outstanding you couldnt put pin between viggo mortensen mahershala ali pair are unbelievable this film its no wonder awards came flooding it looks sensational they brought 1962 life music throughout is spot i laughed i sobbed i connected cinematic triumph green book is incredible film 10 10,0.5111111111111111,0.23142361111111112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8,A perfect example of Yin & Yang - and black and white has nothing to do with it.,"Outstanding true story film showing that color doesn't define us, but how we act ourselves and towards others, does.Great performances from the entire cast, especially Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali who were perfectly cast and convincing in their roles. It was also great to see comedian Sebastian Maniscalco in this film as well.Writer, director and producer Peter Farrelly nailed every aspect of this biography.The score, cinematography, sets and visuals were all on point.I'm not a fan of slow paced long films, but this was was close to an exception. I feel if the pace was picked up a bit and/or the 130 min run-time edited down to around 110 mins, this would have been a perfect 10 from me.Excellent drama and comedy perfectly positioned throughout the film.A well deserved 8/10 from me.",perfect example yin yang black white has nothing do with it,outstanding true story film showing that color doesnt define us but how we act ourselves towards others does great performances entire cast especially viggo mortensen mahershala ali who were perfectly cast convincing their roles it was also great see comedian sebastian maniscalco this film as well writer director producer peter farrelly nailed every aspect this biography score cinematography sets visuals were all point im not fan slow paced long films but this was was close exception i feel if pace was picked up bit or 130 min run time edited down around 110 mins this would have been perfect 10 me excellent drama comedy perfectly positioned throughout film well deserved 8 10 me,0.716013071895425,0.42810457516339867,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7,Not to say it isn't a decent movie...,"... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.Mostly, I think this is a movie that's desperately afraid of 'offending' anyone. For instance: if there's a scene with racist cops, there will also be a scene with a good cop down the road, just to make clear that the movie is not stating or suggesting that 'all cops are/were racist'. It's also funny that the good-cop scene happens in the snow, to let us know the characters are back in a blue state, where supposedly life wasn't so bad for a black man after all! This is one of the many simplistic moves that indicate to me that the filmmakers were willing to sacrifice the complexities of their themes for a feel-good entertainment.The script wants both characters to 'learn' from each other and eventually change and grow, but to make this happen, it turns them into unrealistic caricatures. It's a bit frightening how Shirley is portrayed as a complete ignorant of black culture, but it had to be this way so Tony can be the one to 'introduce' him to it. Tony's transformation comes simply from witnessing racism first hand, as if he never experienced such a thing in his life before - maybe another consequence of this being a blue state-red state movie??So besides the performances, that speak for themselves, I think it's a very uninspired effort. At one point the characters leave the car for no reason other than to have a dramatic confrontation in the rain, as if rainy night equals 'dramatic weight'. I saw it in a packed movie theater and people seemed to enjoy it. You can't blame them. The movie has a 'now everything's fine' conclusion that can leave audiences in a good state of mind - but it also shows how simplistic it really is.",not say it isnt decent movie,just that its so inoffensive safe cliche that i feel like ive seen it million times before mortensen ali are terrific actors i am thankful them without their charisma viggos willingness shove insane amounts food down his throat i fear green book would be dead arrival mostly i think this is movie thats desperately afraid offending anyone instance if theres scene with racist cops there will also be scene with good cop down road just make clear that movie is not stating or suggesting that all cops are were racist its also funny that good cop scene happens snow let us know characters are back blue state where supposedly life wasnt so bad black man after all this is one many simplistic moves that indicate me that filmmakers were willing sacrifice complexities their themes feel good entertainment script wants both characters learn each other eventually change grow but make this happen it turns them into unrealistic caricatures its bit frightening how shirley is portrayed as complete ignorant black culture but it had be this way so tony can be one introduce him it tonys transformation comes simply witnessing racism first hand as if he never experienced such thing his life before maybe another consequence this being blue state red state movie so besides performances that speak themselves i think its very uninspired effort at one point characters leave car no reason other than have dramatic confrontation rain as if rainy night equals dramatic weight i saw it packed movie theater people seemed enjoy it you cant blame them movie has now everythings fine conclusion that can leave audiences good state mind but it also shows how simplistic it really is,0.5198043558508676,-0.020413436692506455,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.28}"
7,A review as a respons to other (negative) reviews.,"I understand why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).There are thousands - if not millions - of films about racism towards black people and their culture, and Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them - by not focusing on the racism but on how the racism changed a man who wasn't a target of it. But that's obviously a big no-no according to these critics.To me Green Book is about a white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that he'd been conditioned to abide to his whole life.",review as respons other negative reviews,i understand why lot critics dont like this film but at same time i feel like theyre making up their minds about what they think movie is or should be about they who disagree with film will say that it diminishes horrors that black community faced america during 50s because that they think its bad film but i thought it was good film my opinion its not movie about shirley his struggles facing ruthless racism its about tony lips psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through witnessing shirleys experiences its that central story line critics are disagreeing with eschews whole film premiss that it shouldve been about something else shirley journey not tonys there are thousands if not millions films about racism towards black people their culture green book had different perspective than rest them by not focusing racism but how racism changed man who wasnt target it but thats obviously big no no according these critics me green book is about white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that hed been conditioned abide his whole life,0.38508771929824565,-0.09078947368421053,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,Critic-proof festival hit should be big holiday winner,"Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.But I couldn't help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it's based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There's definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who's streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That's not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.The two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen's ""b.s. artist"" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen's performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what's called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he's Danish.I'm allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I'd say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.The music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there's always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn't get any better than it gets here - Ali's piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie's ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he's filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali's hands, which should clinch it.)Top everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.So congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can't deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does.",critic proof festival hit should be big holiday winner,some my movie friends were stunned when i mentioned thread that this was my peoples choice award vote tiff 2018 it won btw i generally go weightier fare so my being won over by pg 13 road film with familiar they couldnt have been more different premise directed by auteur co responsible such recent classics as dumb dumber three stooges elicited virtual double take but i couldnt help it it really was best film i saw out 17 far away most entertaining i think this is largely because its based real life story about beginning lifelong friendship story that has writing participation by son one real life characters theres definitely air authenticity events as they unfold that could never occur with purely contrived plot consider college educated concert pianist jamaican descent hires temporarily unemployed italian american nightclub bouncer whos streetwise but academically dim drive him venues deep south back 1962 thats not setup that hollywood script written scratch would ever have come up with two lead actors really click mahershala ali makes nice oscar follow up playing aloof pianist passenger viggo mortensens b s artist driver ali is certain get another nomination mortensens performance may be little too broad garner one but he delivers exactly whats called he makes believable italian american which is impressive considering that hes danish im allergic preaching heavy handedness movies no matter what message with exception one borderline scene id say that movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often socially conscious films music fx are excellent when actor plays piano player theres always challenge making playing look believable it doesnt get any better than it gets here alis piano playing is every bit as convincing as margot robbies ice skating i tonya you never see disconnect between hands body as hes filmed against variety backgrounds if i could bet oscar win right now it would be kris bowers best original score he also supplies alis hands which should clinch it top everything off with capra esque christmas eve finale closing line that sends everyone home smiling it all adds up monster hit its commercial payoff could be huge movie practically begs tv series spinoff real life characters remained friends until they both died 2013 so congratulations peter farrelly his graduation co directing lowbrow fare solo directing middlebrow i e mass appeal fare you cant deny talent craftsmanship it takes make mainstream movie that works as well as this one does,0.46074929971988793,0.24243697478991597,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8,A re-awakening journey,"My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.It could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.Credit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.Viggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.The script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.Summing up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10",re awakening journey,my main reason watching green book was due me wanting see as many 2018 films as possible that it had won best picture oscar so naturally wanted see too that it was that good like viggo mortensen as actor films concept was appealing it looked appetising word mouth including very trusted friends online real life was very positive so there were plenty other reasons too green book turned out be when watching very good film nearly great one with many fantastic things wouldnt go as far say that it is my favourite film 2018 as far as other best picture nominees go there was preference roma favourite but if put it group either best solid middle worst films year green book would be closest being best category those three groups it is very very well done film its good intentions are evident throughout noble it could have done with more grit places really do appreciate that it was trying not be heavy handed or trying offend with quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it given little more depth what there was not saying it wasnt there quite contrary just wish there was more credit is due laudable successful efforts making story accessible it is one that easy like get into but actually it could have afforded do little more risk taking have little more complexity viggo mortensen though brings lot charm entertainment value his role mahershala ali is dignified very moving contrast their chemistry is wholly natural beautifully irresistible never feeling contrived or rushed which provides lot green books heart while their characters are more than just characters instead feel very human this is very different territory director peter farrelly it is surprisingly restrained direction him it suits material very well its lovely looking film too affectionately photographed while music is beautifully chosen fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here script is thoughtful charming also moving regardless anybody feeling that it is little too accessible could have done with more grit story kept me riveted left me moved inspired like my heart had been warmed ymca scene is powerful one character development turning point handled beautifully summing up one those very good nearly great films 8 10,0.5409007887090078,0.28665006226650064,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.23}"

Given the lead actors, I knew it would be something special, and it is.  Entertaining, funny in parts, hard to accept in others - as a white american who wasn't around in the 1960's, the racism was mind boggling and I couldn't help but feel shame.  Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken. Whatever your views, race, or age - this film is not 'preachy', but you should appreciate an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history.

9,America in the Early 60´s,"In 1962, the Italian-American Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is as family man happily married with children with his beloved wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini). When the night-club Copacabana where he works as a bouncer closes for two months to be refurbished, Tony needs to find a two-month job to support his family. He accepts to become the driver of the classical Afro-American pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in a tour with two other Caucasian musicians through the racist South of America. He receives a Green Book, a travel guide with references of safe locations to black people and along their journey, they develop friendship and respect for each other.The Oscar winner ""Green Book"" is a great film that discloses the racial segregation in the early 60´s in America.

7,heart's in the right place,"It's 1962 New York City. ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is a nightclub bouncer and a tough guy ingratiating himself with gangsters. When his workplace gets shut down for a two month renovation, he gets a job driving peculiar classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) to his concerts in the deep south.There are issues but the movie has its heart in the right place. I don't mind the racist Tony Lip finding redemption and friendship in Shirley. Viggo is doing it pretty broadly but the main problem is Shirley. There are scenes where Farrelly is desperate for humor but it only heightens my disbelief. First is the cringeworthy KFC. It's crazy that a man has never had fried chicken despite coming from the south. The point should have been that he prefers not to eat fried chicken (and watermelon and collard greens and grits). It's not that he doesn't like it. He avoids it to avoid his roots. The same goes for the music. He's a musician for heaven's sake. Maybe he's not up to date but he had probably studied aspects of modern music and he's probably met a few of those artists. It's all wrong. His broadly played homosexuality is also a little awkward. I was really scared where Farrelly was taking that until it was saved by Tony who as a nightclub bouncer claims to have seen it all. It's a nice surprising twist to his character and in keeping with his transactional nature. Even the letter writing could be improved if some forethought had occurred. There is no reason why Dolores would go gaga over the letters when she suspects that it's Shirley's writing. She should hold back on the affection with the other girls going gaga. Only when she gets the house letter does she goes head over heels. It would show that she knows him best. These little nagging issues keep the movie from being great although I still enjoyed it.",hearts right place,its 1962 new york city tony lip vallelonga viggo mortensen is nightclub bouncer tough guy ingratiating himself with gangsters when his workplace gets shut down two month renovation he gets job driving peculiar classical pianist dr don shirley mahershala ali his concerts deep south there are issues but movie has its heart right place i dont mind racist tony lip finding redemption friendship shirley viggo is doing it pretty broadly but main problem is shirley there are scenes where farrelly is desperate humor but it only heightens my disbelief first is cringeworthy kfc its crazy that man has never had fried chicken despite coming south point should have been that he prefers not eat fried chicken watermelon collard greens grits its not that he doesnt like it he avoids it avoid his roots same goes music hes musician heavens sake maybe hes not up date but he had probably studied aspects modern music hes probably met few those artists its all wrong his broadly played homosexuality is also little awkward i was really scared where farrelly was taking that until it was saved by tony who as nightclub bouncer claims have seen it all its nice surprising twist his character keeping with his transactional nature even letter writing could be improved if some forethought had occurred there is no reason why dolores would go gaga over letters when she suspects that its shirleys writing she should hold back affection with other girls going gaga only when she gets house letter does she goes head over heels it would show that she knows him best these little nagging issues keep movie being great although i still enjoyed it,0.5572685731776641,0.022879225151952436,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9,A delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors,"Green Book is a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Peter Farrelly (Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, it is a delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors.In 1962, New York bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for extra money after the nightclub he works at closes for renovations. Thanks to one of his friends, Tony lands a job as a chauffeur for ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a talented African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour of the American Deep South. Due to the strong animosity against African-Americans in the Deep South, Tony is required to take on extra work along the way as he is also required to use his skills as a bouncer to protect Doc and ensure he has a safe journey with his band.Heartfelt and funny, Green Book takes what could have been another generic road trip movie and turns it into one of the most interesting depictions of an otherwise unlikely friendship. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have superb chemistry with each other and the film's witty screenplay frequently had me looking forward to every moment of dialogue between both of them, especially during the driving scenes. The film also does a fantastic job of establishing the prejudiced atmosphere of the American Deep South in the 1960s without making its citizens seem too much like caricatures of typical white supremacists. Director Peter Farrelly near-flawlessly balances the film's comedy and drama, which is surprising as he is primarily known for his work only in the former genre. He has certainly shown he is more than capable of handling films like this and I am hopeful he can keep this up in any future projects he may end up involved in.I rate it a solid 9/10",delightful road movie with terrific performances both its actors,green book is comedy drama film directed co written by peter farrelly dumb dumber theres something about mary starring viggo mortensen mahershala ali it is delightful road movie with terrific performances both its actors 1962 new york bouncer frank tony lip vallelonga viggo mortensen is looking extra money after nightclub he works at closes renovations thanks one his friends tony lands job as chauffeur doc don shirley mahershala ali talented african american pianist embarking concert tour american deep south due strong animosity against african americans deep south tony is required take extra work along way as he is also required use his skills as bouncer protect doc ensure he has safe journey with his band heartfelt funny green book takes what could have been another generic road trip movie turns it into one most interesting depictions otherwise unlikely friendship viggo mortensen mahershala ali have superb chemistry with each other films witty screenplay frequently had me looking forward every moment dialogue between both them especially during driving scenes film also does fantastic job establishing prejudiced atmosphere american deep south 1960s without making its citizens seem too much like caricatures typical white supremacists director peter farrelly near flawlessly balances films comedy drama which is surprising as he is primarily known his work only former genre he has certainly shown he is more than capable handling films like this i am hopeful he can keep this up any future projects he may end up involved i rate it solid 9 10,0.4802919869246399,0.18045542892481664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.51}"
9,Easy to digest and heartwarming feelgood movie,"While you could argue if the topic raised in the movie is really suited for a feelgood movie such as this, when the credits rolled, I could wholeheartedly say yes.For once it's not dark, gloomy and preachy drama about America's 1960's racism. No, this is an uplifting and hopeful tale of two men, getting closer together and evolve beyond the beliefs they have been brought up with or the semi-hardcoded (mis)conceptions of things that simply are a certain way for them, mostly because of groupthink and indirect group pressure to behave a certain way.The acting is strong and I especially liked Viggo Mortensen's portayal of Tony Lip, even if he came across as a bit of a caricature at times. The same issue I had with a couple of supporting characters.Mahershala Ali gives an equally strong performance, even though his character has some small flaws when it comes to believability.I found myself being able to easily ignore any flaws because I just really liked the movie as a whole.The story is easy to digest and despite the topic, not very deep, but that is fine. We know what it is about, and that is more than enough in this case. It also knows when it's a tearjerker and it's not ashamed of it.You can top it all off with beautiful classical and sixties era music.All in all, a very entertaining and loveable movie. 9/10, well deserved.",easy digest heartwarming feelgood movie,while you could argue if topic raised movie is really suited feelgood movie such as this when credits rolled i could wholeheartedly say yes once its not dark gloomy preachy drama about americas 1960s racism no this is uplifting hopeful tale two men getting closer together evolve beyond beliefs they have been brought up with or semi hardcoded mis conceptions things that simply are certain way them mostly because groupthink indirect group pressure behave certain way acting is strong i especially liked viggo mortensens portayal tony lip even if he came across as bit caricature at times same issue i had with couple supporting characters mahershala ali gives equally strong performance even though his character has some small flaws when it comes believability i found myself being able easily ignore any flaws because i just really liked movie as whole story is easy digest despite topic not very deep but that is fine we know what it is about that is more than enough this case it also knows when its tearjerker its not ashamed it you can top it all off with beautiful classical sixties era music all all very entertaining loveable movie 9 10 well deserved,0.5235985853227234,0.2892036124794745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8,a witty comedy drama of 1960s US race relations,"One of the most cliché-filled movies of 2018 is also one of the most endearing. Loaded with road film tropes and framed as a 'journey of two unmatched souls', Green Book (2018)is a male-centric essay on 1960s American racism that resonates today.Rough-neck Italian bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) is out of work at the same time that Black-American virtuoso pianist Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) wants to hire a driver for a deep South tour. Tony's reputation precedes him, and Dr Shirley knows that the trip will encounter the sort of problems that a man like Tony can handle. Their first meeting is a parody of cultural difference: the haughty high-brow coloured man in a flowing African robe seated on a throne, meets an uncouth, uneducated, and racist Italian whose belligerence promises safety.On-screen text provides city and state milestones for the trip, and the deeper south they drive, the more racial hostility they find. Along the way, Tony's lack of culture slowly responds to the sensitive aesthetic of the acclaimed pianist, while Dr Shirley's arrogance is softened by Tony's connection with what matters to ordinary people (like fried chicken and the music of Little Richard). The Green Book in the film's title actually existed and listed safe accommodation for Black American travellers. They are modest rooms compared with those the Carnegie Hall performer wants, but they are sanctuaries from racial vilification. At other times, the predictable scenarios of humiliation include being honoured for his playing while not being allowed to eat with white people or use their toilets. The narrative arc is tied to the tour and remains low on dramatic tension or plot twists. This is not an action-rich film, rather it's a two-hander character study that unfolds incrementally through the insightful banter between polar opposite personalities. Tony's regular letters to his wife become a recurring motif of mutual support; they start out with monosyllabic banalities and progress into lyrical prose, coached by the literate musician. They begin to care for each other and, when the tour is over, both are unsurprisingly better people for the experience.The entire weight of this film rests on an intelligently humorous script and sensitive delivery by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. With authenticity and emotional nuance, they have synergy that is rare between males from opposites worlds. The meta-message in Green Booklies in the sad necessity that films like this still need to be made to highlight America's tensions with coloured and culturally different people. The echoes are deafening, with films like BlacKkKlansman(2018)and If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) joining the chorus.

9,A good old-fashioned feel-good movie,"If ""Green Book"" does win the Oscar for Best Picture, as some people think it might, then I for one won't complain. There are, of course, better pictures, (""Roma"" and ""The Favourite"" to name two), but this extremely well-made, nicely directed, intelligently scripted, (if at times a little too obvious in its heart-tugging sentimentality), and very well acted movie ticks all the boxes. It's a feelgood film of the old-fashioned kind that can look back at the bad old days of segregation rather smugly from its 21st Century perspective without feeling particularly smug.It's a movie about how two mismatched people, (a chain-smoking, rough speaking Italian-American and an African-American you might even call 'uppity'), who, on a long road trip in the Deep South in the early sixties, bestow on each other the gifts of friendship and humanity. Even if you knew nothing of the 'true' story of the musician Don Shirley and his driver you can predict the outcome from the get-go. Of course, it also helps that it's also very funny despite the seriousness of the material and that leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are so damn good, (Ali's second Oscar in three years looks like it's already in the bag). It is, then, something of a treat and might even convince you to seek out the music of Don Shirley.",good old fashioned feel good movie,if green book does win oscar best picture as some people think it might then i one wont complain there are course better pictures roma favourite name two but this extremely well made nicely directed intelligently scripted if at times little too obvious its heart tugging sentimentality very well acted movie ticks all boxes its feelgood film old fashioned kind that can look back at bad old days segregation rather smugly its 21st century perspective without feeling particularly smug its movie about how two mismatched people chain smoking rough speaking italian american african american you might even call uppity who long road trip deep south early sixties bestow each other gifts friendship humanity even if you knew nothing true story musician don shirley his driver you can predict outcome get go course it also helps that its also very funny despite seriousness material that leads viggo mortensen mahershala ali are so damn good alis second oscar three years looks like its already bag it is then something treat might even convince you seek out music don shirley,0.4098484848484849,0.19255050505050503,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.17}"

9,"""It takes courage to change people's hearts.""","In an awards season that offered five Best Picture nominations based on real life stories, that might have been a record in itself. Having seen them all, I think the Academy probably got it right this year in celebrating ""Green Book"" as it's big winner. It does tend to be formulaic in it's treatment of a white racist working for a black professional musician, who by their association come to understand a little bit about each other and form a bond that survives their two month road trip. But the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is never sugar coated. The dialog between the two men is unusually grating most of the time to be funny, though there are moments of humor that break through. It's hard to imagine how this association came to be in the first place, as the two men are so diametrically opposed in temperament, style and erudition. But underlying Tony's acceptance of a job offer came a profound sense of honor and loyalty to his employer, one that couldn't be shaken by mob acquaintances, dirty cops, or genteel elite who profess surface politeness while refusing service to a member of the black race. What particularly struck me was how the only time Dr. Shirley looked really happy was when he played at the Orange Bird saloon in the Deep South, casting aside his refined demeanor to really play his heart out for an audience that responded so enthusiastically. What the two men learn about each is directly at the heart of the story, one which transcends race, religion and background in an effort to understand what makes people similar rather than the differences that keep them apart.",it takes courage change peoples hearts,awards season that offered five best picture nominations based real life stories that might have been record itself having seen them all i think academy probably got it right this year celebrating green book as its big winner it does tend be formulaic its treatment white racist working black professional musician who by their association come understand little bit about each other form bond that survives their two month road trip but relationship between dr don shirley mahershala ali tony lip vallelonga viggo mortensen is never sugar coated dialog between two men is unusually grating most time be funny though there are moments humor that break through its hard imagine how this association came be first place as two men are so diametrically opposed temperament style erudition but underlying tonys acceptance job offer came profound sense honor loyalty his employer one that couldnt be shaken by mob acquaintances dirty cops or genteel elite who profess surface politeness while refusing service member black race what particularly struck me was how only time dr shirley looked really happy was when he played at orange bird saloon deep south casting aside his refined demeanor really play his heart out audience that responded so enthusiastically what two men learn about each is directly at heart story one which transcends race religion background effort understand what makes people similar rather than differences that keep them apart,0.4725274725274726,0.092239010989011,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
