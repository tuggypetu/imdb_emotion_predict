10.0,Arnold's First,"I don't know if it wasn't meant to be but this movie is hilarious. How can you downgrade a movie that offers Arnold in his true form, no facial expressions, an accent that can hardly be understood, and muscles on top of muscles. If you have seen the DVD version you can watch the movie with his voice, which makes all the difference in the world, if you're an Arnold fan that is. My personal favorite is, ""I do nots care abouts ze zundaboats."" I don't think that line can ever be topped. And who can not laugh at the New York traffic sounds on Mt. Olympus.

3.0,"Might actually be fun, but Arnold Stang hangs around like a wretched fart and ruins everything","Over a decade before his movie career exploded and eight years before even Pumping Iron, Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in this cheapie B comedy playing the Greek demigod Hercules, who has been banned from Olympus by Zeus. Schwarzenegger can barely speak a line of coherent English at this point (the film is probably more commonly seen with his performance dubbed, but his original voice is available nowadays). Funny thing is, he's by far the best actor in the picture. Everyone else is just cringe-inducingly awful. The movie as a whole might have actually been watchable, if it weren't for the painfully stereotypical Jew performance by Arnold Stang, who dominates much of it. The film has Schwarzenegger (dubbed Arnold Strong) doing Schwarzenegger-ish activities like weightlifting, throwing cars around and getting into various fights. What would you do if you ran into a 22 year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger and he was annoying you? Start a fight? Well, if you're in this movie, that's what you do.

4.0,Goofy comedy with very early Arnie appearance,"A film of at times incredible and hilarious ineptitude (scenes of the ""gods"" on Mount Olympus are interrupted constantly by the sounds of honking horns, which are often louder than the heavenly dialogue) saved to some extent by the sincere starring duo of Stang and Schwartzenneger (whose voice is dubbed in the theatrical version, perhaps unintentionally making this film funnier for those like myself who've seen more than a few Italian ""pec epics"").  Not a true action picture, more of an attempt at comedy that is more often funny against its intentions.

,Arnold VS. The Bear in Central Park.,"That scene is by far the funniest yet horrible scene in film legacy. Arnold is in a chariot with his date when somehow a bear is on the loose in Central Park. For no apparent reason he runs off to fight it. They cut to the bear, And it stands up. Clearly, you can imagine the trainer behind the camera saying ""BEAR UP"" and it stands up. Now when Arnold fights the bear, It is a man in a costume which looks like it was purchased in Harlem. The back of the mans neck is showing as clear as day while him (the bear) and arnold duke it out. The man is swinging his fists like a MILL. You just cant take your eyes off it.

10.0,Hercules in New York is the ultimate comedy,"To me, it doesn't matter if things are intentionally or unintentionally funny. Intentions just don't matter that much in the real world. Hitler might have intended to make the world a better place, I don't think his intentions matter when you judge him. This is simply one of the most hilarious movies you'll ever see, it's filled with absurd scenes. And it's acted out to perfection. The combination of Arnie, and Pretzie, it's just magic. Pretzie overacts as badly as you can imagine, Arnie doesn't act and he does that as badly as you can imagine. But those aren't the only noteworthy performances in this movie. Check out the refinement of the screaming girl, in the infamous bear-attack scene. There are just so many little things in this movie, little details in every single aspect of this movie, that make this so extremely funny and entertaining. It just ignores even the most basic of things needed for a good movie, and it is exactly that, what makes this so good. Watch this movie, you won't be able to say that it is average, that's for sure. I've seen this movie 2 times, and I still regularly think about it.

3.0,What a goofy film!,"Clumsy comedy with cheesy ""special effects"" (if you want to call them that) and a dumb storyline. Still, this could be considered something of a cult item today, because it feautures Arnold Schwarzenegger in his movie debut; he is already impressive-looking, and his voice is dubbed throughout by a man who sounds nothing like him! What saves this movie from the lowest possible rating is its lack of pretension; the people involved in it must have known that they were making a bad movie and didn't try to hide it at all. For example, when Hercules fights a bear, there is no attempt to make the bear look even slightly real; it's all-too-obviously a man in a bear suit.

2.0,Great for a laugh...,"This is a very bad film--there's no denying this. Imagine having a young Arnold Schwarzenegger (whose command of English was MUCH worse than when he did his movies in the 1980s) playing a Greek god who comes to New York for a few laughs! Now the concept COULD have actually worked--if the leading man hadn't been barely cognizant of the English language. And, had the writers not been chimpanzees, the story could have been turned into a cute little tongue-in-cheek tale. But, in the end, through total incompetence, it's a dreadful movie. BUT, for people who like watching stupid films and laughing at them, then they are in for a treat with HERCULES IN NEW YORK! The film begins in a very minimalistic Mount Olympian headquarters for the gods. Including the cost of the pillars, I think the set was created for about $47.50. Well, in this sketchy looking layout, the gods are all standing around when Hercules announces he's bored and wants to go back to Earth. Zeus forbids him and they argue. Ultimately, Zeus tosses him out of the sky onto the earth and from here on Hercules has a lot of adventures. For the most part, Schwarzenegger plays the role like he's a lovable moron...goofy and looking a bit like Jethro Bodine when he first went to the big city! Among the exciting(?) adventures he has are various wrasslin' matches, fighting an escaped bear (a guy in one of the worst bear suits I've ever seen) and hanging out with Arnold Stang--a man who has somehow learned to talk entirely through his nose. I'd tell you more about the story, but really don't think it's all that important. Suffice to say, Jethro runs around New York (often with no shirt) and gets into wacky trouble.As far as the research for the writers goes, I think they'd have been better off if they'd read a few comic books or asked the average high school student for advice. When it comes to knowing even the basic information about the Greek gods, they often got is completely wrong--mixing Greek and Roman names for the gods again and again (for example, Juno, Venus and Hercules are Roman names and Zeus and Nemesis are Greek) as well as having little understanding (or care) about the gods themselves (Mercury was NOT Hercules' brother, Pluto was NOT the Devil nor did he live in Hell, etc., etc.). In addition, at the end of the film, Samson (from the Old Testament) and Atlas (whose job it is to hold the Earth) come to the rescue! There are also two versions of this film. Traditionally, the version most have seen has a dubbed voice for Arnold, as he's occasionally barely comprehensible. But, this is also really silly as the voice is very robotic and obviously not his. This is the case with the version posted on IMDb (though, oddly, this version also lacks music and many basic sound effects). For those wanting to see and hear Arnold, the DVD has the original restored voice--but won't give you the option to hear either one. Additionally, at the end, when he talks to Stang from the radio, it's NOT Arnold's voice but that of the robot-dude.Overall, the film was a shoddy and silly mess. But there was a certain goofiness that make it fun to watch despite its many, many obvious shortcomings. Not a good film at all, but fun to watch if you need a laugh.",great laugh,this is very bad film theres no denying this imagine having young arnold schwarzenegger whose command english was much worse than when he did his movies 1980s playing greek god who comes new york few laughs now concept could have actually worked if leading man hadnt been barely cognizant english language had writers not been chimpanzees story could have been turned into cute little tongue cheek tale but end through total incompetence its dreadful movie but people who like watching stupid films laughing at them then they are treat with hercules new york film begins very minimalistic mount olympian headquarters gods including cost pillars i think set was created about 47 50 well this sketchy looking layout gods are all standing around when hercules announces hes bored wants go back earth zeus forbids him they argue ultimately zeus tosses him out sky onto earth here hercules has lot adventures most part schwarzenegger plays role like hes lovable moron goofy looking bit like jethro bodine when he first went big city among exciting adventures he has are various wrasslin matches fighting escaped bear guy one worst bear suits ive ever seen hanging out with arnold stang man who has somehow learned talk entirely through his nose id tell you more about story but really dont think its all that important suffice say jethro runs around new york often with no shirt gets into wacky trouble as far as research writers goes i think theyd have been better off if theyd read few comic books or asked average high school student advice when it comes knowing even basic information about greek gods they often got is completely wrong mixing greek roman names gods again again example juno venus hercules are roman names zeus nemesis are greek as well as having little understanding or care about gods themselves mercury was not hercules brother pluto was not devil nor did he live hell etc etc addition at end film samson old testament atlas whose job it is hold earth come rescue there are also two versions this film traditionally version most have seen has dubbed voice arnold as hes occasionally barely comprehensible but this is also really silly as voice is very robotic obviously not his this is case with version posted imdb though oddly this version also lacks music many basic sound effects those wanting see hear arnold dvd has original restored voice but wont give you option hear either one additionally at end when he talks stang radio its not arnolds voice but that robot dude overall film was shoddy silly mess but there was certain goofiness that make it fun watch despite its many many obvious shortcomings not good film at all but fun watch if you need laugh,0.4721719070403281,0.03405359990886306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,The funniest movie of all time!,"Arnold Schwarzenegger. Way before he was Governor of California. Way before he was the Terminator. Before Conan. And yes, even before Pumping Iron. As a matter of fact, this was even before Arnold won a single Mr. Olympia, and was still only Mr. Universe. Arnold, age 23, is Hercules. In fact, he isn't credited as Arnold Schwarzenegger, but as ""Arnold Strong"". This movie, intentional or not, is one of the funniest, if not THE funniest movie of all time. The movie is extremely low budget, has horrendous acting, mind-blowingly sub-par special effects (even by the standards of 1970), and an overly-redundant soundtrack. Let's take a closer look.Hercules is bored with life on Mt. Olympus. The movie starts off with Hercules complaining to Zeus, and telling him that he wants to leave. After a few minutes of back and forth arguing, Zeus gets angry enough at Hercules to throw one of his lightning bolts (which look like they were welded together in a junk-yard) at him, and in a puff of smoke (cheap special effects) he disappears. Turns out he has fallen to earth, somewhere in the middle of the ocean. On his way down, he passes by an airplane, on which an extremely crazy lady with a funny voice and an even funnier hat sees him as she looks out the window, and has a fit.Here, he is picked up by a freighter, and tells the captain that ""no man is superior to Hercules"". He spends the rest of the voyage picking fights with the crew for no apparent reason. It is during this scene that John Candy makes his first ever (uncredited) appearance in his movie career. When the ship reaches New York, Hercules goes ashore, and is attacked by a group of hobos, who he takes care of with a wooden plank. This is where he meets ""Pretzi"", played by Arnold Stang. They hitch a cab ride, only to find out that Hercules has no money, because ""Hercules needs no money"". The cabbie tries to beat up Herc, who yells the hilarious line of ""HOW DARE YOU TOUCH HERCULES!"", throws him in the bushes, and flips over his taxi.Herc and Pretzi run off, and somehow end up in a playing field with college students training in discus, javelin, and far jump. Herc says ""Zoze men don't ssrow it faaar enuff"" and proceeds to humiliate the college students in all events. One hilarious part is when he takes his shirt off and does a titty-dance before throwing the javelin.After this, Herc and Pretzi are invited to a college professor's house and are sitting in the living room with his smoking-hot daughter (Deborah Loomis). At this point, her friend comes in, and after an exchange of words, he punches Herc in the gut, to which he replies ""YOU have strucked Hercules!"" and hoists the young man into the air.Hercules and the hottie end up dating. It is during their first date that they encounter an ""escaped bear from the zoo"", which is actually (quite conspicuously) a man in a bear costume. Herc pounds the bear into submission, with his girlfriend screaming in the background. This scene has to be one of the funniest in cinematic history. During one of their outings, Herc sees a poster of a Hercules movie, and in his outrage rips off his shirt in the middle of the street, starts posing, and demands to know ""who gave zees imperzonator permission to imitate Herkooles!"" Before long, Herc becomes a wrestler. Long story short, Pretzi is threatened by the mob to sign Herc over to them, and he does as he is told. Eventually, Herc goes up against ""Monstro the Magnificent"" in a weightlifting match, which he loses because Juno took away his powers. He gets jumped by the mob, and then its Atlas and Samson (yes, the biblical Samson) to the rescue. In the end, Herc goes back to Mt. Olympus.For one to fully appreciate this movie, it must be watched with Arnold's real voice, although the dubbed version is great for laughs too. This movie is an absolute jewel. It is so horrible that it's great. It has an innocent charm to it as well, and one can't help but love it. Arnold's acting is virtually nonexistent, and he exhibits less emotion than when he played the Terminator. This is balanced out by Arnold Stang's constant over-acting. Deborah Loomis is smoking-hot, but her acting skills are below average. Hell, everyone's acting in this movie is below-average. This movie contains literally dozens of hilarious one-liners by Arnold. The Mt. Olympus scenes are all filmed in Central Park, and traffic can be heard in the background. You know what? I'm just going to stop here. There are too many hilarious things to list. Go watch it!",funniest movie all time,arnold schwarzenegger way before he was governor california way before he was terminator before conan yes even before pumping iron as matter fact this was even before arnold won single mr olympia was still only mr universe arnold age 23 is hercules fact he isnt credited as arnold schwarzenegger but as arnold strong this movie intentional or not is one funniest if not funniest movie all time movie is extremely low budget has horrendous acting mind blowingly sub par special effects even by standards 1970 overly redundant soundtrack lets take closer look hercules is bored with life mt olympus movie starts off with hercules complaining zeus telling him that he wants leave after few minutes back forth arguing zeus gets angry enough at hercules throw one his lightning bolts which look like they were welded together junk yard at him puff smoke cheap special effects he disappears turns out he has fallen earth somewhere middle ocean his way down he passes by airplane which extremely crazy lady with funny voice even funnier hat sees him as she looks out window has fit here he is picked up by freighter tells captain that no man is superior hercules he spends rest voyage picking fights with crew no apparent reason it is during this scene that john candy makes his first ever uncredited appearance his movie career when ship reaches new york hercules goes ashore is attacked by group hobos who he takes care with wooden plank this is where he meets pretzi played by arnold stang they hitch cab ride only find out that hercules has no money because hercules needs no money cabbie tries beat up herc who yells hilarious line how dare you touch hercules throws him bushes flips over his taxi herc pretzi run off somehow end up playing field with college students training discus javelin far jump herc says zoze men dont ssrow it faaar enuff proceeds humiliate college students all events one hilarious part is when he takes his shirt off does titty dance before throwing javelin after this herc pretzi are invited college professors house are sitting living room with his smoking hot daughter deborah loomis at this point her friend comes after exchange words he punches herc gut which he replies you have strucked hercules hoists young man into air hercules hottie end up dating it is during their first date that they encounter escaped bear zoo which is actually quite conspicuously man bear costume herc pounds bear into submission with his girlfriend screaming background this scene has be one funniest cinematic history during one their outings herc sees poster hercules movie his outrage rips off his shirt middle street starts posing demands know who gave zees imperzonator permission imitate herkooles before long herc becomes wrestler long story short pretzi is threatened by mob sign herc over them he does as he is told eventually herc goes up against monstro magnificent weightlifting match which he loses because juno took away his powers he gets jumped by mob then its atlas samson yes biblical samson rescue end herc goes back mt olympus one fully appreciate this movie it must be watched with arnolds real voice although dubbed version is great laughs too this movie is absolute jewel it is so horrible that its great it has innocent charm it as well one cant help but love it arnolds acting is virtually nonexistent he exhibits less emotion than when he played terminator this is balanced out by arnold stangs constant over acting deborah loomis is smoking hot but her acting skills are below average hell everyones acting this movie is below average this movie contains literally dozens hilarious one liners by arnold mt olympus scenes are all filmed central park traffic can be heard background you know what im just going stop here there are too many hilarious things list go watch it,0.48226737420285803,0.10831180468277242,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8.0,A hilariously horrendous hoot and a half,"Legendary petulant strongman Hercules (an uproariously atrocious performance by Arnold Schwarzenneger in his first lead role) gets bored with Mount Olympus, so the cranky Zeus (essayed with eye-rolling hammy gusto by Ernest Graves) sends the powerful demi-god to Earth where he winds up in New York City. While in the Big Apple Hercules befriends excitable squirt Pretzie (a lively and funny portrayal by Arnold Stang, who's the best actor in the whole flick), becomes both a wrestler and a body builder, and mixes it up with a stereotypical bunch of no-count Italian Mafia types. Director Arthur Seidelman, working from a blithely inane script Aubrey Wisberg, relates the gloriously ludicrous story at a zippy pace and pitches all the dopey humor at an appropriately broad level. Gut-busting campy highlights include Arnold beating folks up as often as possible, Hercules overturning a cab because he has no money to pay the fare, Hercules duking it out with a bear that's obviously some poor zhlub in an unconvincing moth-eaten suit, a televised weightlifting competition with the boom mic constantly dipping into the frame, Hercules commandeering a chariot, and the priceless ending with Zeus coming to Earth as a Hasidic Jew (!). Arnold's extremely poor and frequently borderline incomprehensible elocution, the chintzy (far from) special effects (Zeus' thunder bolts look like they are made out of plastic), John Balamos' infectiously goofy'n'giddy Italian music score, and the sequences on Mount Olympus that were clearly shot in Central Park (you can even hear traffic noises in the background!) all further enhance the considerable hilarity of this absolutely sidesplitting cruddy riot.",hilariously horrendous hoot half,legendary petulant strongman hercules uproariously atrocious performance by arnold schwarzenneger his first lead role gets bored with mount olympus so cranky zeus essayed with eye rolling hammy gusto by ernest graves sends powerful demi god earth where he winds up new york city while big apple hercules befriends excitable squirt pretzie lively funny portrayal by arnold stang whos best actor whole flick becomes both wrestler body builder mixes it up with stereotypical bunch no count italian mafia types director arthur seidelman working blithely inane script aubrey wisberg relates gloriously ludicrous story at zippy pace pitches all dopey humor at appropriately broad level gut busting campy highlights include arnold beating folks up as often as possible hercules overturning cab because he has no money pay fare hercules duking it out with bear thats obviously some poor zhlub unconvincing moth eaten suit televised weightlifting competition with boom mic constantly dipping into frame hercules commandeering chariot priceless ending with zeus coming earth as hasidic jew arnolds extremely poor frequently borderline incomprehensible elocution chintzy far special effects zeus thunder bolts look like they are made out plastic john balamos infectiously goofyngiddy italian music score sequences mount olympus that were clearly shot central park you can even hear traffic noises background all further enhance considerable hilarity this absolutely sidesplitting cruddy riot,0.5921013126658287,0.06739805893031703,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10.0,A film of staggering genius,"Don't let the awfulness of this film fool you. Arnold's first and greatest film is, in fact, one of the greatest of all time. Just as financial firms regularly turn losses into gains by multiplying their balance sheets by -1, this film uses awfulness as a deus ex machina to capture the profound depths of our mortal fallibility. Pretzie is the ultimate everyman, selling pretzels by the water and figuring out ways to nickel and dime everyone and pocket the loose book every now and then. But he gets into trouble and has moments of revelation and regret. Hercules' simplicity and god-like physique, as well as Monstro the Magnificent's lopsided hair cut, symbolize the yin and yang of life and death, bigness and smallness, truth and the GOP.The frequent unfocusing of the shot shows that mankind's mind is frequently unfocused and Arnold's partially literate accent represents the garbled marbles we often use to express the inner desires of our hearts. On a daily basis we are tempted by god-like greatness but frequently fall short of the world's expectations for our bulbous necks and mountainous pecs. Hubris is a 1000lb barbell and it kills.

2.0,We all have to start somewhere I suppose.,"Screwball comedy Hercules in New York sees a 22-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger (billed here as Arnold Strong) making his screen debut as demigod Hercules, who visits Earth against the wishes of his father Zeus. Falling from the sky into the sea, Hercules is picked up by a ship travelling to New York, where he meets friendly pretzel salesman Pretzie (played by Arnold Stang, the voice of Hanna-Barbera's Top Cat), falls in love with professor's daughter Helen (Deborah Loomis), enters a strongman competition against bodybuilder Monstro (Tony Carroll), and upsets local mobsters in the process.Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen debut is shoddy nonsense that will test the patience of all but the most dedicated Arnie fan. The star's thick Austrian accent renders his dialogue laughable, the movie's intentional humour falls flat, and the plot is a meandering mess that feels like it was thrown together on the fly. Production values are incredibly low, most notably in the scenes set on the supposedly tranquil paradise of Mount Olympus (actually filmed in Central Park), where the props are cheap and nasty and the action is frequently interrupted by the sound of New York traffic and car horns.That said, Hercules in New York is almost worth seeing just for the hilarious sight of the future governor of California wrestling a grizzly bear (actually a man in a very unconvincing moth-eaten bear costume).Also look out for a guy who looks a lot like John Candy (the jury is still out on whether the bloke in question is actually the portly Canadian comedian in an uncredited role, but I wouldn't have blamed Candy one bit for not owning up if it was him).",we all have start somewhere i suppose,screwball comedy hercules new york sees 22 year old arnold schwarzenegger billed here as arnold strong making his screen debut as demigod hercules who visits earth against wishes his father zeus falling sky into sea hercules is picked up by ship travelling new york where he meets friendly pretzel salesman pretzie played by arnold stang voice hanna barberas top cat falls love with professors daughter helen deborah loomis enters strongman competition against bodybuilder monstro tony carroll upsets local mobsters process arnold schwarzeneggers screen debut is shoddy nonsense that will test patience all but most dedicated arnie fan stars thick austrian accent renders his dialogue laughable movies intentional humour falls flat plot is meandering mess that feels like it was thrown together fly production values are incredibly low most notably scenes set supposedly tranquil paradise mount olympus actually filmed central park where props are cheap nasty action is frequently interrupted by sound new york traffic car horns that said hercules new york is almost worth seeing just hilarious sight future governor california wrestling grizzly bear actually man very unconvincing moth eaten bear costume also look out guy who looks lot like john candy jury is still out whether bloke question is actually portly canadian comedian uncredited role but i wouldnt have blamed candy one bit not owning up if it was him,0.42125803489439856,0.13496326905417816,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
2.0,Hercules in New York was a pretty bad movie though the actual Schwarzenegger's voice-dubbed version was the most interesting of the two,"With today the day Maria Shriver officially files for divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger (serves him right too since he betrayed her by cheating on her with the maid and had a baby with her, to boot!), I thought I'd watch the former Governator's first movie that he made way back in 1969-Hercules in New York. I saw two versions: the first that I watched on Hulu had no music score and Arnold's voice was badly dubbed by another though compared to his real one, you could hear each word clearly and the second one I saw on YouTube which had his accented voice not always easy to understand (which made his confused mix-up on ""bucks"" and ""dough"" with ""bucs"" and ""doe"" not as funny) though it had a good Greek-like score. The rating for the first version is above while the other take gets a 4 from me. Arnold is credited as Arnold Strong since, I guess, his co-star happens to be Arnold Stang. Stang is such a one-of-a-kind presence that he brightens most scenes he's in. The only other player I recognized was James Karen who I knew from Poltergeist as well from a guest spot on ""The Golden Girls"". By the way, when Stang died in December '09, I couldn't help but think of his other roles like the voice of Herman the mouse in those Herman and Katnip cartoons, his role as Frank Sinatra's friend in The Man with the Golden Arm, and his recent roles in ""The Cosby Show"" and Dennis the Menace. Oh, and while I knew one player couldn't be John Candy since this guy was much older but Abe Holiday on that dock sure looked like him. So on that note, Hercules in New York is interesting for the early role of Mr. Schwarzenegger, not to mention his thick accent, and not much else though one can't completely hate a movie where Hercules fights an obviously bear-suited man. P.S. It was disappointing to hear that dubbed actor again instead of Arnold on the radio at the end of the second version especially since it was much softer this time around.",hercules new york was pretty bad movie though actual schwarzeneggers voice dubbed version was most interesting two,with today day maria shriver officially files divorce arnold schwarzenegger serves him right too since he betrayed her by cheating her with maid had baby with her boot i thought id watch former governators first movie that he made way back 1969 hercules new york i saw two versions first that i watched hulu had no music score arnolds voice was badly dubbed by another though compared his real one you could hear each word clearly second one i saw youtube which had his accented voice not always easy understand which made his confused mix up bucks dough with bucs doe not as funny though it had good greek like score rating first version is above while other take gets 4 me arnold is credited as arnold strong since i guess his co star happens be arnold stang stang is such one kind presence that he brightens most scenes hes only other player i recognized was james karen who i knew poltergeist as well guest spot golden girls by way when stang died december 09 i couldnt help but think his other roles like voice herman mouse those herman katnip cartoons his role as frank sinatras friend man with golden arm his recent roles cosby show dennis menace oh while i knew one player couldnt be john candy since this guy was much older but abe holiday that dock sure looked like him so that note hercules new york is interesting early role mr schwarzenegger not mention his thick accent not much else though one cant completely hate movie where hercules fights obviously bear suited man p s it was disappointing hear that dubbed actor again instead arnold radio at end second version especially since it was much softer this time around,0.47546897546897543,0.08485083756822889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.27}"

5.0,An Awkward Children's Movie,"As a child, I have seen movies that really grab the viewer's attention and have lovable characters that make a lasting impression. Children's movies like Gumby: The Movie (1995), Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000), and Space Jam (1996) all have the things a child could ask for. As for Hercules in New York, the film definitely made a lasting impression but on the weird side of things. Sponsored by the Tooniversal Company, this piece of cinema is fun to watch for nostalgia purposes only.This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's first film debut as the man who is part god, and part human. The story starts off when he is up in Olympus where he wants to be sent down to Earth because he is tired of hanging around with the Gods. So he argues with his father Zeus, who gets so livid that he sends him down to New York. Wait a minute, Zeus didn't want Hercules mingling with humans, so why was he sent down to New York in the first place? Why was there even an argument? Whatever.Along with Schwarzenegger is Arnold Stang, who plays a character called Pretzie, a wimpy man who carries a basket of pretzels in the first part of the film that he's seen. From there, he no longer holds a bag of pretzels, what a surprise. I will say, the actors picked for the roles of each character were picked accurately, but I'm not saying their acting is good. Stang plays as good wimpy character, and is funny to see his eyes bulge. Even Schwarzenegger is good as Hercules, but that's because of his physique and I assume that's really all he needed. That is one of the nostalgic points in this movie; Schwarzenegger's muscles. It's amazing to see how big he really was in the 70s. The other part that is nostalgic about this film is to see what SOME of New York looked like back then, but that's about all the viewer will get.What makes this movie so awkward are how the scenes are done. There are moments where Hercules is supposed to be doing something extraordinary. Instead what he does looks cheaply done and the sound effects don't help. Hercules knocks (more like love-taps) a man into a bay, and the splashing water makes it sound like a pebble was tossed. What? Who would have thought these brutes were made of confetti? There's even a scene where Hercules fights a bear. Yes a bear, and it doesn't even look like a bear. The viewer will be able to tell that this is not a bear, but a person inside a bear suit. To make matters worse, Hercules attacks the bear by slapping it; yes slapping it. Schwarzenegger slapping? It's really ridiculous to see The Terminator (1984) beat up a bear so poorly. As for the damsel in distress, Deborah Loomis, I have never heard so much screaming, almost as much as Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman (2002), if not more. My ears were ringing after hearing her. She even faints in once scene, and it didn't even look real. As for the music, which was composed by John Balamos, is not a whole lot better. I can't even tell what kind of instrument is used but it's not an orchestra I'll say that much. A lot of the music is the same and it sounds really corny. I'm really surprised Schwarzenegger has become such a box office hit by starting from this movie. This film obviously did not get him famous but if he had not auditioned for the role, we may not have any of the Terminator movies or Total Recall (1990), whatever. When the film finished, I was barely entertained and shocked to how bad the film was compared to its trailer. What shocks me even more is that the director of this film is still making movies today!Hercules in New York is a very silly kid's movie that may not even entertain the smallest of ages. Much of the scenes in this film are stupid and the only thing that may catch the viewer's attention is Arnold Schwarzenegger's bulging biceps.",awkward childrens movie,as child i have seen movies that really grab viewers attention have lovable characters that make lasting impression childrens movies like gumby movie 1995 thomas magic railroad 2000 space jam 1996 all have things child could ask as hercules new york film definitely made lasting impression but weird side things sponsored by tooniversal company this piece cinema is fun watch nostalgia purposes only this is arnold schwarzeneggers first film debut as man who is part god part human story starts off when he is up olympus where he wants be sent down earth because he is tired hanging around with gods so he argues with his father zeus who gets so livid that he sends him down new york wait minute zeus didnt want hercules mingling with humans so why was he sent down new york first place why was there even argument whatever along with schwarzenegger is arnold stang who plays character called pretzie wimpy man who carries basket pretzels first part film that hes seen there he no longer holds bag pretzels what surprise i will say actors picked roles each character were picked accurately but im not saying their acting is good stang plays as good wimpy character is funny see his eyes bulge even schwarzenegger is good as hercules but thats because his physique i assume thats really all he needed that is one nostalgic points this movie schwarzeneggers muscles its amazing see how big he really was 70s other part that is nostalgic about this film is see what some new york looked like back then but thats about all viewer will get what makes this movie so awkward are how scenes are done there are moments where hercules is supposed be doing something extraordinary instead what he does looks cheaply done sound effects dont help hercules knocks more like love taps man into bay splashing water makes it sound like pebble was tossed what who would have thought these brutes were made confetti theres even scene where hercules fights bear yes bear it doesnt even look like bear viewer will be able tell that this is not bear but person inside bear suit make matters worse hercules attacks bear by slapping it yes slapping it schwarzenegger slapping its really ridiculous see terminator 1984 beat up bear so poorly as damsel distress deborah loomis i have never heard so much screaming almost as much as kirsten dunst spiderman 2002 if not more my ears were ringing after hearing her she even faints once scene it didnt even look real as music which was composed by john balamos is not whole lot better i cant even tell what kind instrument is used but its not orchestra ill say that much lot music is same it sounds really corny im really surprised schwarzenegger has become such box office hit by starting this movie this film obviously did not get him famous but if he had not auditioned role we may not have any terminator movies or total recall 1990 whatever when film finished i was barely entertained shocked how bad film was compared its trailer what shocks me even more is that director this film is still making movies today hercules new york is very silly kids movie that may not even entertain smallest ages much scenes this film are stupid only thing that may catch viewers attention is arnold schwarzeneggers bulging biceps,0.5218161343161342,0.06540745290745291,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.22}"
2.0,Hercules has massive cleavage,"I've only seen a shoddy German dub of this prize pony but I guess the idea remains the same. Hercules is tired of laying around in Greece all the time speaking German and takes a trip to New York. A guy that vaguely looks like Woody Allen takes him under his wings and they get into oh so lighthearted adventures. To be frank I expected more ass-kicking from Ahnuld. He barely ever gets into fights and when he does he really just pushes the bad guys around a little, probably because the production values are low and they couldn't get those cool sound effects you get after punches(that go ""doosh"" and stuff). To give you an idea of the massive thought put into this movie,the script called for a bear and the director had a brilliant idea, putting some hobo in a bear suit bought from some guy's trunk. Luckily our hero Hercules is on the spot real quick to not punch the,ah well I'm in a good mood,bear. Meanwhile the not so pretty love interest is screaming her lungs out dead afraid of this short, skinny bear that has been standing on two legs for ages. Another action scene breaks out when Hercules joins a contest that should determine who the strongest man in the world is. And of all the ways that can pop up in your head, they go for the very lame idea of just lifting three different weights. I was at least expecting some wrestling or so but no, just lifting stupid weights. And if his opponent can lift 1000 pounds, why the hell did it already take the guy so much effort to lift 500? All these comical misadventures (there's more,but I can't work up the courage) are constantly interrupted by scenes of Zeus sitting in the director's back yard, I mean uhm, Greece.

2.0,"Good Idea, Bad Movie","There ought to be a very good movie available out of the gods being alive in the Twentieth Century (And not just those of the Greeks, but ALL of them), but this ain't it. This one is played out like a high school play with bad dialogue and some bad interpretations of the myths. Arnold could be a fair Hercules, but not then, and obviously not now. The actors playing the gods have no idea of the characters they are trying to play; I would have thought the Olympians to have kept up with the times. The music is also lousy and the plot is quite ridiculous as it goes no where. It merely circles Hercules confusion and disenchantment with modern civilization. Lets face it, Vanna White in ""Goddess of Love"" looks like Emmy material compared to this.",good idea bad movie,there ought be very good movie available out gods being alive twentieth century not just those greeks but all them but this aint it this one is played out like high school play with bad dialogue some bad interpretations myths arnold could be fair hercules but not then obviously not now actors playing gods have no idea characters they are trying play i would have thought olympians have kept up with times music is also lousy plot is quite ridiculous as it goes no where it merely circles hercules confusion disenchantment with modern civilization lets face it vanna white goddess love looks like emmy material compared this,0.5637500000000001,0.014791666666666689,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.48}"
