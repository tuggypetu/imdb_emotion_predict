,Notable only for how cheap it is and how little effort was put into it across the board,"Although he is Scott's cousin, Todd Howard has managed to dodge the ""family problem"" and is a perfectly normal young man starting a promising college career. Despite being very weedy and interested in becoming a vet, Todd has managed to get a sports scholarship without being sure why. Turns out that the Dean has assumed that Todd can do for the college boxing team what Scott did for his high school basketball team what with him being a werewolf and everything. Todd discovers this quickly and is keen to disappoint but his genes betray him as the ""family problem"" manifests itself suddenly. Overnight Todd is a star in the ring and on the campus – but can he manage this sudden change?When I read overly negative reviews of the first Teen Wolf film I can only silently shake my head and wonder what the same viewer makes of the sequel. I say this because, as basic as the original film is, Teen Wolf Too/Two/2/whatever is like the makers condensed the original film to the basics and then just put that out on as little money, time and effort as possible. It shows in all areas of the film but I have to start somewhere so I will do so with the actual story. The flow of it is this (a) studious kid doesn't really fit into school/college, (b) kid becomes werewolf, (c) kid becomes popular but also a major a**hole, (d) kid learns life lesson. OK, so you can see it is essentially the same film as the first time, with the sport and setting different. In terms of the telling of the story though, we literally jump between these parts without any gradual development between them. I'm not saying it needed a lot of complexity but maybe just one or two scenes bridging the gap between the elements – instead it will literally have 1 scene of him becoming a werewolf for the first time, then the next scene is him popular and doing a 50's twist (for some reason) at a party – not even a bridge which shows him winning over an initially hesitant campus. This is the same across the whole film and it makes it weaker as a film – a problem considering it would still have not been great with these scenes.This slapdash approach is reflected in the whole film and it is no surprise that the script is poor. The dialogue matches the ""good enough"" approach to the narrative – ie lines are clunky, obvious and lacking anything that would make you care enough to listen. However, producing even this level of trash was clearly too much for the writers because they appear to have been too busy to get laughs, fun or energy into the script. Visually it looks cheap. The sets are faded and unconvincing while the aim appears to have been to try and pull off ""crowd"" scenes with as few extras as possible. The wolf makeup is also really bad – never great of course but in Too it looks like a mask purchased at a corner store.With all this it is no surprise that the cast can do nothing with it. I feel sorry for Bateman but he is poor here and cannot do anything with the material handed to him. He has almost zero chemistry with Chandler as well – again neither of them helped by the material having no bridge between ""oh hi"" and ""you are the love of my life"". Astin must have hoped for more but, even though he has a glint in his eyes that suggests a fun role in the film, he does nothing and has nothing to do. Fratkin and Holton are both annoying and deliver nothing in the way of laughs that the writers clearly just assumed they would do on their own (wackiy guy and fat guy – practically writes itself.....errr, no, no it doesn't).The end product is not so much a terrible film in that everything was misjudged but rather a terrible film because nobody seems to have given a single, flying f**k about it from conception to final delivery. The plot is the same as the first film but yet so much worse and basic, with similar dialogue. The ""feel"" of the film is likewise cheap and ""make-do"" and it is no surprise that nobody in the cast can do much of anything with the whole affair. The only value the sequel has is making the first Teen Wolf film seem more fresh and filled with fun that it was.",notable only how cheap it is how little effort was put into it across board,although he is scotts cousin todd howard has managed dodge family problem is perfectly normal young man starting promising college career despite being very weedy interested becoming vet todd has managed get sports scholarship without being sure why turns out that dean has assumed that todd can do college boxing team what scott did his high school basketball team what with him being werewolf everything todd discovers this quickly is keen disappoint but his genes betray him as family problem manifests itself suddenly overnight todd is star ring campus but can he manage this sudden change when i read overly negative reviews first teen wolf film i can only silently shake my head wonder what same viewer makes sequel i say this because as basic as original film is teen wolf too two 2 whatever is like makers condensed original film basics then just put that out as little money time effort as possible it shows all areas film but i have start somewhere so i will do so with actual story flow it is this studious kid doesnt really fit into school college b kid becomes werewolf c kid becomes popular but also major hole d kid learns life lesson ok so you can see it is essentially same film as first time with sport setting different terms telling story though we literally jump between these parts without any gradual development between them im not saying it needed lot complexity but maybe just one or two scenes bridging gap between elements instead it will literally have 1 scene him becoming werewolf first time then next scene is him popular doing 50s twist some reason at party not even bridge which shows him winning over initially hesitant campus this is same across whole film it makes it weaker as film problem considering it would still have not been great with these scenes this slapdash approach is reflected whole film it is no surprise that script is poor dialogue matches good enough approach narrative ie lines are clunky obvious lacking anything that would make you care enough listen however producing even this level trash was clearly too much writers because they appear have been too busy get laughs fun or energy into script visually it looks cheap sets are faded unconvincing while aim appears have been try pull off crowd scenes with as few extras as possible wolf makeup is also really bad never great course but too it looks like mask purchased at corner store with all this it is no surprise that cast can do nothing with it i feel sorry bateman but he is poor here cannot do anything with material handed him he has almost zero chemistry with chandler as well again neither them helped by material having no bridge between oh hi you are love my life astin must have hoped more but even though he has glint his eyes that suggests fun role film he does nothing has nothing do fratkin holton are both annoying deliver nothing way laughs that writers clearly just assumed they would do their own wackiy guy fat guy practically writes itself errr no no it doesnt end product is not so much terrible film that everything was misjudged but rather terrible film because nobody seems have given single flying f k about it conception final delivery plot is same as first film but yet so much worse basic with similar dialogue feel film is likewise cheap make do it is no surprise that nobody cast can do much anything with whole affair only value sequel has is making first teen wolf film seem more fresh filled with fun that it was,0.49651334776334793,0.10351596320346322,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"

2.0,Ouch,"It's a sad truth that there are a lot of bad werewolf movies out there. But there are a few that really stand out as being among the worst of the worst ... and ""Teen Wolf Too"" is undoubtedly one of them.It follows pretty much the same plot as the first movie, which was itself a recycled formula. Todd Howard (cousin of Scott from the first movie), a hard-working science student, arrives in college wanting to work towards becoming a vet. But there's one snag -- he's there under a sports scholarship, and unless he performs well in the boxing tournament his place in the college is at stake. Thankfully, he finds himself succumbing to his cousin's lycanthropic curse and becomes a popular and agile werewolf. But in the process he, of course, forgets who his real friends are.There are numerous recurring characters from the first movie, some of whom have inexplicably moved to this college. There are Scott's high school chums, Chubby and Stiles -- Stiles is this time played by Stuart Fratkin, who also appeared in an episode of the TV show ""Werewolf"" the same year (""A Material Girl""). Scott's dad also makes a few appearances, as well as the Scott's coach, who is also played by a different actor this time. But of course, none of this matters ... without Michael J Fox, this movie was pretty much doomed from the start. He was pretty much the only thing that saved ""Teen Wolf"" from being a flop.The dialogue is unbearable, the directing is clumsy, and the acting in places is downright appalling. Since this is basically a remake of the first movie, there's absolutely no reason to watch it. Just watch the original, and forget about this one altogether. There's hardly anything good to say about it at all. And believe it or not, it still made money. In fact it's very surprising that we didn't see a ""Teen Wolf Three"" the next year.

,Sweet Merciful God Why?,"After a lifetime of watching movies and searching for the greatest moment in cinematic history, I've finally found it. Is it Orson Welles' breathless death-rattle of `. . . rosebud.' In Citizen Kane? No. How about Al Pacino giving Fredo the kiss of death in Godfather II? Try again. What about Peter Finch screaming into the Network camera `I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it ANYMORE!' . . . not even close.Are you ready? Here it is: the greatest moment in contemporary motion picture history is . . . in Teen Wolf Too when Jason Bateman (as the Wolf) runs across the park, leaps through the air in slow motion, and comes down with a Frisbee in his mouth-all without losing that stupid hat he had on!Oh, but this film is peppered with other fantastic gems. Like the part where the Wolf and Chubby where cruising around in the University Corvette (what, your school didn't have one?) and they almost ran that guy on the bike over and the Wolf just kept laughing and laughing--good times; or what about when Chubby was in the ring and he bounced the smaller guy into the ropes, put his hand on his hip, twirled his fist and knocked the kid out; ew! ew! ew! I know! What about when the Wolf was singing `Do You Love Me!' Remember? When he had that little suit on and he was strutting his choreographed stuff with the team of wannabe Solid Gold Dancers? Box office dynamite!I don't remember a huge portion of this film, because the part of my brain that controls my higher cognitive functions shut down somewhere between the part where Chubby farts and Stiles sits in the smell and the part where the science teacher walks away from Gomez Addams with a tail wagging from under her skirt. Just thinking about it makes my lobes tingle and go numb.If there was one thing worse than the moron who played Stiles in Teen Wolf, it has got to be the guy that played Stiles in Teen Wolf Too. Oh my God that guy was horrible. The only highlight of this movie was when Stiles gets punched-out in between rounds of the big climactic fight scene-I like it because I've convinced myself that it was an outtake and he REALLY got hit. Take THAT Stuart Fratkin! What was he thinking? `Yeah, I landed a SWEET gig on Teen Wolf Too-I'm STILES! Just the springboard my career needs!' Yeah, look out DeNiro, here comes Stuart Fratkin.My buddy Marc brought this movie over to my house and I'm not sure what to think. This is the same friend that exposed me to Pumpkinhead 2. The only thing I can figure is that he is one of many alien infiltrators sent to Earth to use bad movies to brainwash people into a zombie-like trance, making way for an alien take over. To those in a similar circumstance, I say RESIST! You're not taking my soul with Teen Wolf Too, Marc!

1.0,I don't even know where to begin.,"I am going to start out by admitting that even though I think the original Teen Wolf is a pretty stupid movie, I actually like it quite a bit. I don't know what it is about it that I like, but for the last couple of months I've found myself watching my copy of Teen Wolf about once a week.I decided to purchase (you gotta OWN these titles, that's the fun of it.) a copy of Teen Wolf Too on eBay for $4. The only other time I had seen this movie was when I was in 4th grade, which was over a decade ago. I didn't remember much about it, save a couple of moments involving Chubby.I just finished watching the movie for the first time in 11 years, and I can say with complete certainty that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a LONG time. In many ways, this is the *perfect* bad sequel... The first film wasn't especially good or commercially successful, so it seems pointless to have even considered making another chapter in the Teen Wolf saga. They also weren't able to get the big star of the first movie (Michael J. Fox) to come back, so they instead focused on his cousin, whose personality is almost exactly the same. Even further, they decided to bring back a few of the characters from the first movie, only two of which are played by the same actors. Stiles, who was corny but funny in Teen Wolf, has been replaced by an actor who isn't nearly as convincing or amusing. Coach Finstock, who was the only genuinely funny character in the first film, is now played by a man whose line delivery made me laugh exactly zero times throughout the course of the film.These discrepancies aside, the plot of this film is crap. It's basically exactly the same as the original, only even more sketchy. Anyone who hasn't seen Teen Wolf will probably not be able to make sense of the plot, not that any of them would actually watch this ridiculous film in its entirety.I could probably write a fairly long essay on the problems with this movie, but I'm limited to 1000 words here. I would comment more on the many specific elements that make this movie stupid, but I don't want to waste more of anyone's time. And since I'm trying to keep you from wasting your time, then I will recommend that you do not watch this movie. Ever. Anyone who says that this movie is not that bad is wrong.",i dont even know where begin,i am going start out by admitting that even though i think original teen wolf is pretty stupid movie i actually like it quite bit i dont know what it is about it that i like but last couple months ive found myself watching my copy teen wolf about once week i decided purchase you gotta own these titles thats fun it copy teen wolf too ebay 4 only other time i had seen this movie was when i was 4th grade which was over decade ago i didnt remember much about it save couple moments involving chubby i just finished watching movie first time 11 years i can say with complete certainty that this is one worst movies ive seen long time many ways this is perfect bad sequel first film wasnt especially good or commercially successful so it seems pointless have even considered making another chapter teen wolf saga they also werent able get big star first movie michael j fox come back so they instead focused his cousin whose personality is almost exactly same even further they decided bring back few characters first movie only two which are played by same actors stiles who was corny but funny teen wolf has been replaced by actor who isnt nearly as convincing or amusing coach finstock who was only genuinely funny character first film is now played by man whose line delivery made me laugh exactly zero times throughout course film these discrepancies aside plot this film is crap its basically exactly same as original only even more sketchy anyone who hasnt seen teen wolf will probably not be able make sense plot not that any them would actually watch this ridiculous film its entirety i could probably write fairly long essay problems with this movie but im limited 1000 words here i would comment more many specific elements that make this movie stupid but i dont want waste more anyones time since im trying keep you wasting your time then i will recommend that you do not watch this movie ever anyone who says that this movie is not that bad is wrong,0.4896019345238095,0.08234747023809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

1.0,"Dear God, Why?","This one ranks up there with Mannequin 2 and Weekend at Bernie's 2 as the worst sequels of all time. As if the cheesy first film starring Michael J Fox wasn't bad enough, some dink in Hollywood decided that a second must be made despite the fact that there were many obvious signs not to make it. Shouldn't the signs be clear when you can't get star of the film back, or half the rest of the cast who realized they'd be doomed to the C circuit forever?This is just a poor rehash of an already terrible idea. Geek (Jason Bateman) going to school, is somehow into athletics when he should really be into studying and insects, is in love with the hot chick on campus but doesn't notice the blistering crush the longtime girl friend has on him. He turns into a wolf, parties, gets really good at sports, learns a lesson, and then wins as himself instead of using the magic powers Oden inferred upon him and discovers that the longtime girl friend is the hottest chick in the movie. yay. I only have a few thoughts on this flick though. Why did they feel the need to bring back Mr Howard? I mean, they could have made a clean break, cast all new people and just made it another film that had a similar 'plot'. But instead, they bring back incidental characters from the first film that weren't that entertaining then. They bring back Scott's friend Stiles. How does he know Todd (Bateman)? I'm not really sure. I'm kind of surprised he knew him since this Stiles looks completely different do to either complete facial reconstruction or a casting change. Not that it matters, as the annoying character he is, the less you remember his face, the more better off you are. Why is Chubby in this film? I mean, talk about bringing back a character that brought nothing to the table. The only thing he did in the first film was eat jello from a girls cleavege. Sure, we all want to do that just once, but it still shouldn't mean getting into another film.And why Boxing? I mean, what colleges have a boxing circuit? And does Bateman look like he could hurt a fly? At least basketball, football or even baseball could pass. Hell, track and field!! But, alas, they decided Boxing was the way to go. Another great choice by these people. I'm shocked they're still working after all this.At least Bateman has redeemed himself by doing some good work on Arrested Development.

3.0,Realistic and funny,"Unfortunately Teen Wolf Too Is neither. I know what you're thinking, 'it's a film about a teenage who can turn into a werewolf, or course it's not meant to be realistic'. Fair point, but I know that whenever I see a person turn into a werewolf I at least react, usually by saying 'what the s**t is going on here?' That's the main problem I have with film. Jason Bateman turns into the werewolf in the middle of a boxing bout and the whole school starts cheering for the wolf, without even thinking 'wow, a dude just turned into a werewolf, that's a little unique'. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT. Possibly because the cast had seen the original Teen Wolf and knew that it is possible for college sports stars to morph into werewolves when they face adversity.

2.0,"If you loved ""Teen Wolf"", you may want to reconsider watching ""Teen Wolf Too"".","""Teen Wolf"" was a popular film. So, it's not surprising that the studio would want to make a sequel. The problem was that the star of the first one, Michael J. Fox, hated making ""Teen Wolf"" and refused to make the sequel. It's not hard to understand, as between the two films ""Back to the Future"" came out and shot Fox to greater stardom. So, in a pinch, the studio tossed out many of the original cast and tried to see if they could get away with it. Despite all this, the sequel still made a modest profit....though it also made IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. So, according to the list, this is the 62nd worst major release of all time according to users. When the film begins, you see that Jason Bateman is playing Todd Howard....the COUSIN of Michael J. Fox's character from the first film, Scott. Oddly, Scott's father (James Hampton) is in the movie and he's acting the role of Todd's guardian. Todd is starting college (which is odd, as Bateman was 18...and rarely do roles for teens ever actually go to real teens....often they are 21-30) and he's there on an athletic scholarship but apparently didn't deserve it...much like those actors and their kids you've heard about a lot in the news recently. However, in Todd's case he could get killed, as it's a BOXING scholarship! Will Todd's lycanthropy help save him from being beaten to a pulp? And, like every teen film of the 80s, will it help him get the girl?While I was NOT a huge fan of ""Teen Wolf"", it seems like ""Teen Wolf Too"" is a step backward in most every way. The biggest problem is the writing, as some of the characters are one-dimensional and ridiculous caricatures (especially John Astin as the Dean). They also often used slapstick instead of cleverness...and really, really bad slapstick....like the sort of stuff 6 year-olds would enjoy. Hard to watch...and easy to hate. So, while it's bad, is it Bottom 100 bad? Probably not. But I have noticed several other film franchises have the same pattern....a film is loved by its fans and the studios create sequels that simply stink. And, because so much love existed for the first one, there's a backlash and folks not only dislike but HATE the sequels. Some examples on the Bottom 100 are ""The Neverending Story III"", ""Son of Mask"", ""Jaws the Revenge"", ""The Human Centipede II"" as well as ""The Human Centipede III"". The same cannot be said of ""Baby Geniuses"" and ""Baby Geniuses II"" because both films made the list and both films are god-awful.",if you loved teen wolf you may want reconsider watching teen wolf too,teen wolf was popular film so its not surprising that studio would want make sequel problem was that star first one michael j fox hated making teen wolf refused make sequel its not hard understand as between two films back future came out shot fox greater stardom so pinch studio tossed out many original cast tried see if they could get away with it despite all this sequel still made modest profit though it also made imdbs infamous bottom 100 list so according list this is 62nd worst major release all time according users when film begins you see that jason bateman is playing todd howard cousin michael j foxs character first film scott oddly scotts father james hampton is movie hes acting role todds guardian todd is starting college which is odd as bateman was 18 rarely do roles teens ever actually go real teens often they are 21 30 hes there athletic scholarship but apparently didnt deserve it much like those actors their kids youve heard about lot news recently however todds case he could get killed as its boxing scholarship will todds lycanthropy help save him being beaten pulp like every teen film 80s will it help him get girl while i was not huge fan teen wolf it seems like teen wolf too is step backward most every way biggest problem is writing as some characters are one dimensional ridiculous caricatures especially john astin as dean they also often used slapstick instead cleverness really really bad slapstick like sort stuff 6 year olds would enjoy hard watch easy hate so while its bad is it bottom 100 bad probably not but i have noticed several other film franchises have same pattern film is loved by its fans studios create sequels that simply stink because so much love existed first one theres backlash folks not only dislike but hate sequels some examples bottom 100 are neverending story iii son mask jaws revenge human centipede ii as well as human centipede iii same cannot be said baby geniuses baby geniuses ii because both films made list both films are god awful,0.45568086883876363,-0.03362573099415204,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.17}"
4.0,Nothing here to see,"I didn't really think much of the first TEEN WOLF - an '80s high school comedy starring Michael J. Fox as a werewolf - so I wasn't expecting much from this forgotten sequel, either. Indeed, there's nothing much to see here other than a lame re-run of the first movie, with an added ROCKY-style boxing plot to add some action to the inanity.The problem with TEEN WOLF TOO is that it feels flaccid and badly dated as a high school comedy. The best high school movies are adult rated, delivering raucous entertainment that anyone who's ever been a teenager can readily identify with. By comparison, this is a cheap and cheerful sequel, the 'highlight' of which involves a huge '50s-flavoured dance off with our hero headlining in full werewolf costume.The narrative involves some kind of predictable moral fairytale in which our hero must learn humility and to constrain the excesses of his ego. It's all rather sanctimonious in approach, layered with '80s cheese and the usual stock characters: the nerd friend, the bad guy jock, the bimbos. Say what you like about the original, at least it had the likable Michael J. Fox as the lead, whereas here we're saddled with the annoying Jason Bateman instead. He's no match, and neither is this lacklustre movie compared to the warmly-regarded first film.",nothing here see,i didnt really think much first teen wolf 80s high school comedy starring michael j fox as werewolf so i wasnt expecting much this forgotten sequel either indeed theres nothing much see here other than lame re run first movie with added rocky style boxing plot add some action inanity problem with teen wolf too is that it feels flaccid badly dated as high school comedy best high school movies are adult rated delivering raucous entertainment that anyone whos ever been teenager can readily identify with by comparison this is cheap cheerful sequel highlight which involves huge 50s flavoured dance off with our hero headlining full werewolf costume narrative involves some kind predictable moral fairytale which our hero must learn humility constrain excesses his ego its all rather sanctimonious approach layered with 80s cheese usual stock characters nerd friend bad guy jock bimbos say what you like about original at least it had likable michael j fox as lead whereas here were saddled with annoying jason bateman instead hes no match neither is this lacklustre movie compared warmly regarded first film,0.47510101010101013,0.0903030303030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Awful and Lazy Sequel,"Teen Wolf Too (1987) * (out of 4)Todd Howard (Jason Bateman), the cousin of the teenage werewolf from the first film, finds himself in college on a sports scholarship even though he doesn't play sports. It turns out that Stiles (Stuart Fratkin) pretty much added him to the team hoping that he could have the same wolf powers. When it turns out Todd is a werewolf, his entire life changes.TEEN WOLF was a film that most people make fun of or look at as a piece of trash but I've always had a soft spot for it. Yes, it's quite stupid but at the same time it was a fun movie with some good performances and for the most part it featured a character that a lot of young people could connect with. TEEN WOLF TOO, on the other hand, is pure garbage and the worst thing is that it's pretty lazy and just a boring rehash of the first picture.Everything that happens in the first picture basically happens here, although the quality is much less. You've got a teenager struggling with life who finds himself becoming popular. The teen loves the popularity but soon realizes it is costing him real friends. He soon realizes that the party girl isn't what he wants. He realizes that the party life isn't what he wants. Does all of this sound familiar? If so, I'm sure you know how it ends.Worst of all is the fact that all of the goofiness that worked in the first picture just doesn't work here. Bateman is a complete bore in the picture. Fratkin can't compete with the original actor. Even John Astin is wasted in a boring role. The film has a couple cast members from the original but even they can't add much here.TEEN WOLF TOO is just a really lousy movie that was made to try and make money off of the original.

3.0,Lousy carbon copy sequel,"Clean-cut college freshman Todd Howard (blandly played by Jason Bateman) becomes the star of the boxing team and the most popular guy on campus after he discovers that he's a werewolf. Christopher Leitch's by-the-numbers direction fails to bring any freshness to the hopelessly clichéd and straight-down-the-line grindingly predictable story. Tim Kring's slapdash script not only blatantly rehashes the plot of the far superior original sans any wit, charm, or warmth, but also recycles entire gags and even the central message about being true to yourself. Worse yet, two of the most amusing and entertaining characters from the first one are recast with lesser actors: Paul Sands makes for a terribly glum and mopey Coach Finstock while Stuart Fratkin grates on the nerves something painful as slick hustler Stiles. James Hampton is wasted in a minor part as Uncle Howard and Mark Holton likewise isn't given much worthwhile to do as Chubby. This picture hits its absolute groan-inducing nadir with a simply pathetic song and dance number set to the song ""Do You Love Me?"" and the especially dopey moment when Todd catches a Frisbee in his teeth. On the plus side, Kim Darby tries hard as the sympathetic Professor Brooks, the fetching Estee Chandler delivers an appealing performance as the sweet Nicki, and John Astin hams it up with deliciously lip-smacking brio as the slimy Dean Dunn. Only the climactic exciting rough'n'tumble boxing match manages to rise out of the mire of numbing mediocrity.

2.0,"'If this is meant to be some kind of joke you'll notice I'm not laughing.' Yeah, I know how the guy feels.","Teen Wolf Too starts as teenager Todd Howard (Jason Bateman) arrives at Hamilton University on a sports scholarship because of a recommendation from boxing coach Finstock (Paul Sand) who is under pressure from Dean Dunn (John Astin) to win some trophy's & get Hamilton University noticed. Coach Finstock used to coach basketball & Todd's cousin Scott who had great agility & strength when he turned into a Werewolf & hopes that Todd himself is a Werewolf & can help the boxing team out. Todd isn't too interested in boxing & just wants to study science but is forced to take part in competitive matches, while being beaten in the boxing ring by an opponent Todd unexpectedly changes into a Werewolf & wins the match & at the same time becomes a local celebrity who milks his new found fame & popularity for all he can but Todd loses sight of who he is as the Werewolf inside takes control...Directed by Christopher Leitch this was the first & so far only sequel to the surprise box-office hit fantasy sporting comedy Teen Wolf (1985) which starred Michael J. Fox, Teen Wolf Too doesn't star Michael J. Fox & is basically more of a remake than an original film that tries to expand & develop the ideas seen in the original Teen Wolf & instead just blatantly copies them. The only great difference between Teen Wolf Too & it's predecessor Teen Wolf is that basketball has been replaced with boxing in which the central character must prove himself & his humanity over the Wolf. All the themes & ideas of the original Teen Wolf are shamelessly copied here, the high school loser & social outcast turned celebrity by becoming the Wolf, the good girl bad girl problem, the way schoolwork & study suffer, the way he goes from useless weakling to an overnight sporting success &, of course, the central moral message of just being yourself will be enough. Teen Wolf Too is throughly predictable, at over 90 minutes long it feels like it lasts forever & for a supposed comedy it's extremely unfunny, in fact I don't think I laughed once & the majority of the so-called jokes & gags are just plain cringe worthy. From a Frog fight in a biology class to the Dean & his pet Dog to the laid back Coach to the horrible musical montages featuring some hideous 80's pop music Teen Wolf Too is actually quite embarrassing to watch with zero plot (that was a really random twist at the ends up being totally pointless) & certainly not funny in any way.The whole film has a forgettable look to it, sure it's competent enough I suppose but nothing special. The special effects are poor, from the awful Werewolf make-up to the Wolf tail that actress Kim Darby has to wear that looks more like a static duster than the tail of a Wolf. About half way through Teen Wolf Too there's this awful musical number in which Howard the Wolf dressed in a purple suit does a song & dance number at a party with all the other students there joining in & thus making this big dance number which is truly horrifying to watch. Scenes like Howard the Wolf running after & catching a Frisbee in his mouth like a real Dog don't help neither does the fact that it takes half an hour before he even turns into the Wolf.With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 I can only wonder where all the money went? Apparently filmed at Pomona College in California. James Hampton & Mark Holton are the only returning cast member from the original Teen Wolf while Jason Bateman makes for a bland leading man & maybe the fact his dad Kent Bateman was the producer had something to do with his casting.Teen Wolf Too is a really bad 80's comedy fantasy that is actually quite embarrassing to watch, from the horrible 80's pop music to the lame jokes & gags to the wretched make-up effects one has to say that you would be better off watching the original Teen Wolf again & considering they are both virtually the same film you won't miss anything here.",if this is meant be some kind joke youll notice im not laughing yeah i know how guy feels,teen wolf too starts as teenager todd howard jason bateman arrives at hamilton university sports scholarship because recommendation boxing coach finstock paul sand who is under pressure dean dunn john astin win some trophys get hamilton university noticed coach finstock used coach basketball todds cousin scott who had great agility strength when he turned into werewolf hopes that todd himself is werewolf can help boxing team out todd isnt too interested boxing just wants study science but is forced take part competitive matches while being beaten boxing ring by opponent todd unexpectedly changes into werewolf wins match at same time becomes local celebrity who milks his new found fame popularity all he can but todd loses sight who he is as werewolf inside takes control directed by christopher leitch this was first so far only sequel surprise box office hit fantasy sporting comedy teen wolf 1985 which starred michael j fox teen wolf too doesnt star michael j fox is basically more remake than original film that tries expand develop ideas seen original teen wolf instead just blatantly copies them only great difference between teen wolf too its predecessor teen wolf is that basketball has been replaced with boxing which central character must prove himself his humanity over wolf all themes ideas original teen wolf are shamelessly copied here high school loser social outcast turned celebrity by becoming wolf good girl bad girl problem way schoolwork study suffer way he goes useless weakling overnight sporting success course central moral message just being yourself will be enough teen wolf too is throughly predictable at over 90 minutes long it feels like it lasts forever supposed comedy its extremely unfunny fact i dont think i laughed once majority so called jokes gags are just plain cringe worthy frog fight biology class dean his pet dog laid back coach horrible musical montages featuring some hideous 80s pop music teen wolf too is actually quite embarrassing watch with zero plot that was really random twist at ends up being totally pointless certainly not funny any way whole film has forgettable look it sure its competent enough i suppose but nothing special special effects are poor awful werewolf make up wolf tail that actress kim darby has wear that looks more like static duster than tail wolf about half way through teen wolf too theres this awful musical number which howard wolf dressed purple suit does song dance number at party with all other students there joining thus making this big dance number which is truly horrifying watch scenes like howard wolf running after catching frisbee his mouth like real dog dont help neither does fact that it takes half hour before he even turns into wolf with supposed budget about 3 000 000 i can only wonder where all money went apparently filmed at pomona college california james hampton mark holton are only returning cast member original teen wolf while jason bateman makes bland leading man maybe fact his dad kent bateman was producer had something do with his casting teen wolf too is really bad 80s comedy fantasy that is actually quite embarrassing watch horrible 80s pop music lame jokes gags wretched make up effects one has say that you would be better off watching original teen wolf again considering they are both virtually same film you wont miss anything here,0.4578815327184892,0.02351119894598155,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"

4.0,Wolf in the ring,"On the success of Teen Wolf for Michael J. Fox another Teen Wolf film was certainly in the offing. Fox declined to do the remake probably thinking there ain't no way he was going to be doing college basketball. Jason Bateman got the part for the remake and he plays Fox's cousin. As the film opens it's James Hampton who played Fox's father driving Bateman to college as a freshman.Where of all things Bateman is in on a boxing scholarship. I've never heard of one of these, but John Astin who overacts outrageously as the dean of the college wants a boxing team badly. Maybe even more than Philip Ober did for his army company in From Here To Eternity. Bateman's only activity resembling sports was playing clarinet in the school band.But Paul Sand knows of the pedigree in Bateman's family.

1.0,Howlingly Bad.....,"Although awkward college student Todd Howard is particularly adept at science, he's paying for school with an athletic scholarship that he will lose should he not fare well in an upcoming boxing tournament.Luckily for Todd, he has inherited the same family curse that once turned his cousin into a werewolf.As he transforms into the hairy, fanged, howling monster, he finds both his physical agility and his popularity skyrocketing -- but at what cost.......A cash in in every sense of the phrase TWT is a monstrosity from start to finish. Having to make references every five minutes is desperate enough, but to have two minor actors not coming back to the film, and have them played by someone who looks absolutely nothing like them, you may as well have had Bateman play J. Fox's character.It's a desperate attempt at cashing in on a film that was already cashing on the success of Back To The future. The make up is awful, there are no laughs in the entirety of the movie, and Bateman becomes highly unlikable when he starts to use his powers on a regular basis.And why boxing? Of all the sports the writers could have chose, baseball, Football, Athletics, Running, they choose boxing.It's as bad as people have been saying for the past 29 years, and i'm sure Bateman hates the fact that this is on his CV.But it does have one good line in it.You're wrong, and I'm late.dreck.",howlingly bad,although awkward college student todd howard is particularly adept at science hes paying school with athletic scholarship that he will lose should he not fare well upcoming boxing tournament luckily todd he has inherited same family curse that once turned his cousin into werewolf as he transforms into hairy fanged howling monster he finds both his physical agility his popularity skyrocketing but at what cost cash every sense phrase twt is monstrosity start finish having make references every five minutes is desperate enough but have two minor actors not coming back film have them played by someone who looks absolutely nothing like them you may as well have had bateman play j foxs character its desperate attempt at cashing film that was already cashing success back future make up is awful there are no laughs entirety movie bateman becomes highly unlikable when he starts use his powers regular basis why boxing all sports writers could have chose baseball football athletics running they choose boxing its as bad as people have been saying past 29 years im sure bateman hates fact that this is his cv but it does have one good line it youre wrong im late dreck,0.5381389906389905,-0.10444444444444441,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,great as usual,"This is another great 80s piece of garbage. The best role here is Chubby (Mark Holton), who is back from the original. In my opinion, he is one of the best actors of the 80s and should have won an Oscar for Buxton in Pee Wee Big Adventure. When you add a fat slob like Holton to a great, highly realistic script, bad hair, porn moustaches and feathers, and mesh hats, what more can you say than this movie is funny. It is not funny because it's good, but because it is so bad, and yet so realistic. I feel like doing handstands on cargo vans after this flick. Please, watch this and take special note of Holton as Chubby and then rent Pee Wees Big Adventure, then kill yourself because you obviously are an idiot! Mark Holton rocks!",great as usual,this is another great 80s piece garbage best role here is chubby mark holton who is back original my opinion he is one best actors 80s should have won oscar buxton pee wee big adventure when you add fat slob like holton great highly realistic script bad hair porn moustaches feathers mesh hats what more can you say than this movie is funny it is not funny because its good but because it is so bad yet so realistic i feel like doing handstands cargo vans after this flick please watch this take special note holton as chubby then rent pee wees big adventure then kill yourself because you obviously are idiot mark holton rocks,0.5248299319727892,0.20668934240362816,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.09}"
