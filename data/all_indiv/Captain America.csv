3.0,Not quite #63 bad.,"""Captain America"" (1990) was just added to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List....the one hundred worst rated major release films of all time. This is unusual, as this film did not (until now) have enough votes to make it elegible to join the ranks of awfulness. However, with the release of the latest Captain America film (""Avengers: Endgame""), apparently increased attention has been on this poor movie...hence it's inclusion. However, there is one huge problem with this....while ""Captain America"" is clearly a bad film, it is ridiculous to consider it's among the 100 worst ever. I wouldn't even place it in the bottom 1000....let alone 100.The first portion of the movie is actually pretty good. You get the creation of the Captain as well as Red Skull....and up until Captain goes into suspended animation in the ice of Alaska, I thought I'd probably give the film a 4 or 5...maybe even a 6. But the final portion was just terrible. First, the Captain was saddled with a stupid sidekick who looked like an extra from the film ""Valley Girl"". She was weak and silly...and totally out of place. Second, the climactic final battle was terrible. If Captain America is a superhero....why was he so wimpy...not only in the final battle but all the ones leading up to it?! Third, while he tried hard, Matt Salinger was a dull Captain America...very dull. Add to this, fourth, a weak script with weak dialog. Overall, one of the worst superhero films I've seen...but nothing like truly godawful films like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or ""Robot Monster"" (which, oddly, didn't even make the list).So would I recommend this movie? Probably not...unless you are intensely curious or like seeing all of the Bottom100 films.",not quite bad,captain america 1990 was just added imdbs infamous bottom 100 list one hundred worst rated major release films all time this is unusual as this film did not until now have enough votes make it elegible join ranks awfulness however with release latest captain america film avengers endgame apparently increased attention has been this poor movie hence its inclusion however there is one huge problem with this while captain america is clearly bad film it is ridiculous consider its among 100 worst ever i wouldnt even place it bottom 1000 let alone 100 first portion movie is actually pretty good you get creation captain as well as red skull up until captain goes into suspended animation ice alaska i thought id probably give film 4 or 5 maybe even 6 but final portion was just terrible first captain was saddled with stupid sidekick who looked like extra film valley girl she was weak silly totally out place second climactic final battle was terrible if captain america is superhero why was he so wimpy not only final battle but all ones leading up it third while he tried hard matt salinger was dull captain america very dull add this fourth weak script with weak dialog overall one worst superhero films ive seen but nothing like truly godawful films like plan 9 outer space or robot monster which oddly didnt even make list so would i recommend this movie probably not unless you are intensely curious or like seeing all bottom100 films,0.6558943089430894,-0.21036585365853658,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7.0,I loved it,"I cannot say I had no expectations from this movie, because I did. I expected it to be unwatchable crap that I'll give up on after ten minutes or so. I mean, it has rating 3,3/10 and it's bashed all over the internet. What can one expect from superhero B production of 80's anyway... But I was in for a pleasant surprise.The movie is shot at Adriatic sea, which guarantees a beautiful scenery, and chases in Dubrovnik are a real joy. I was worried because it's produced in Yugoslavia in cooperation with Jadran Film, but from the result I suppose 21th Century Production and Marvel Entertainment had most of the work done. Movie is pretty much faithful to comics and Captain America's costume is just as it should be. Acting is decent, action is few, but when it comes it's well directed, and movie has nice comic-book atmosphere. There's no nudity, vulgarity or explicit violence, except for gunfights and common fist-fighting, so it's whole family friendly. There are few nicely done emotional scenes and just a bit of humor. I enjoyed it very much.7,5/10",i loved it,i cannot say i had no expectations this movie because i did i expected it be unwatchable crap that ill give up after ten minutes or so i mean it has rating 3 3 10 its bashed all over internet what can one expect superhero b production 80s anyway but i was pleasant surprise movie is shot at adriatic sea which guarantees beautiful scenery chases dubrovnik are real joy i was worried because its produced yugoslavia cooperation with jadran film but result i suppose 21th century production marvel entertainment had most work done movie is pretty much faithful comics captain americas costume is just as it should be acting is decent action is few but when it comes its well directed movie has nice comic book atmosphere theres no nudity vulgarity or explicit violence except gunfights common fist fighting so its whole family friendly there are few nicely done emotional scenes just bit humor i enjoyed it very much 7 5 10,0.5434935897435896,0.18740384615384614,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4.0,Bad but not irredeemable,"Steve Rodgers becomes Captain America and must fight against the Nazi super soldier Red Skull. Captain America is however frozen in time until he awakens in 1990. Red Skull still wishes to fulfil his plan of world domination by becoming the president of the United States. I went into this movie expecting to hate it since that seems to be the general consensus. What I saw was bad on many levels but not what I would call irredeemable.On the positive side the production isn't too bad. The editing is passable except for those awful montage sequences. The cinematography and lighting is not what I would call inept. The acting is okay but the terrible writing makes for some awful line deliveries.However, this movie has quite possibly the worst superhero costume of all time, rivalled by the motorcycle helmet wearing Captain America from the 1979 TV movie. He seems to have prosthetic ears attached to his head and the wings makes his appearance seem comical. The tone is also all over the place. You have Nazis and Germans executing people and at the same time you have a running gag where Captain America pretends to be car sick and hijacks cars. It's bad in a cheesy way. I would say the Fantastic Four 1994 movie was miles better in being faithful to the source material while having an extremely low budget. However, as I said, I did find some little things enjoyable like the action, special effects and even production qualities. I think you will either hate it or find it as a harmless bit of cheesy entertainment and fun.",bad but not irredeemable,steve rodgers becomes captain america must fight against nazi super soldier red skull captain america is however frozen time until he awakens 1990 red skull still wishes fulfil his plan world domination by becoming president united states i went into this movie expecting hate it since that seems be general consensus what i saw was bad many levels but not what i would call irredeemable positive side production isnt too bad editing is passable except those awful montage sequences cinematography lighting is not what i would call inept acting is okay but terrible writing makes some awful line deliveries however this movie has quite possibly worst superhero costume all time rivalled by motorcycle helmet wearing captain america 1979 tv movie he seems have prosthetic ears attached his head wings makes his appearance seem comical tone is also all over place you have nazis germans executing people at same time you have running gag where captain america pretends be car sick hijacks cars its bad cheesy way i would say fantastic four 1994 movie was miles better being faithful source material while having extremely low budget however as i said i did find some little things enjoyable like action special effects even production qualities i think you will either hate it or find it as harmless bit cheesy entertainment fun,0.6150737283549784,-0.1745011498917749,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,Salinger treats it seriously,"Unfortunately, this is not the Marvel movie that will endear you to comic book movie adaptations. However, I think Salinger gives an honest performance as the title character, even if he spends more time out of costume than in. For whatever reason, the Red Skull is made Italian, rather than German, but it didn't bother me as much as it did some other viewers. For being a B-movie, Captain America is tolerable. Watch it first, before you make any judgements.

5.0,"Uninspired, but watchable.","After the Nazis have developed a process to turn an innocent boy into a super human entity, the Americans likewise experiment on average American youth Steve Rogers (Matt Salinger), who has polio. Steve develops incredible strength and resilience, is given a costume and shield, and is rechristened Captain America. The Cap fails spectacularly in his first mission, which is vanquishing Red Skull (Scott Paulin), the adult version of that Nazi experiment. He ends up frozen in Arctic ice for 47 years, reemerging in 1990 to do battle with the Red Skull once again.It may be that this initial feature film vehicle for the legendary comic book hero (after two TV movies in the 1970s) will appeal more to casual viewers than longtime fans of the character. As it is, it lacks the spit and polish of major American product, and it will come off as cheesy and tacky to many viewers. Also, the scenario requires Steve to spend more time in civvies than in costume.But this viewer didn't find it completely worthless; it's not without some amusements. Like the sight of the President (Ronny Cox), who'd glimpsed the Cap as a child, engaging in fisticuffs with various bad guys. Paulin is not a truly great villain, but he's a mild hoot anyway, and his minions include some very sexy (if inept) female assassins, including Red Skulls' own daughter (Francesca Neri). The action scenes won't blow the audience away, but they're adequate.The main draw is a remarkably sincere Salinger, who makes for an appealing hero. Kim Gillingham, who gets an ""introducing"" credit, plays both Caps' lady friend and her daughter, and comes off better as the older lady. A variety of familiar faces - Ned Beatty, Michael Nouri, Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, Bill Mumy - are kind of wasted here, although McGavin at least gets a chance to be somewhat funny (it'd be a shame if he didn't).Kids will likely be less judgmental than their adult counterparts, and might have some fun with it.Five out of 10.",uninspired but watchable,after nazis have developed process turn innocent boy into super human entity americans likewise experiment average american youth steve rogers matt salinger who has polio steve develops incredible strength resilience is given costume shield is rechristened captain america cap fails spectacularly his first mission which is vanquishing red skull scott paulin adult version that nazi experiment he ends up frozen arctic ice 47 years reemerging 1990 do battle with red skull once again it may be that this initial feature film vehicle legendary comic book hero after two tv movies 1970s will appeal more casual viewers than longtime fans character as it is it lacks spit polish major american product it will come off as cheesy tacky many viewers also scenario requires steve spend more time civvies than costume but this viewer didnt find it completely worthless its not without some amusements like sight president ronny cox whod glimpsed cap as child engaging fisticuffs with various bad guys paulin is not truly great villain but hes mild hoot anyway his minions include some very sexy if inept female assassins including red skulls own daughter francesca neri action scenes wont blow audience away but theyre adequate main draw is remarkably sincere salinger who makes appealing hero kim gillingham who gets introducing credit plays both caps lady friend her daughter comes off better as older lady variety familiar faces ned beatty michael nouri darren mcgavin melinda dillon bill mumy are kind wasted here although mcgavin at least gets chance be somewhat funny itd be shame if he didnt kids will likely be less judgmental than their adult counterparts might have some fun with it five out 10,0.48833333333333323,0.1590833333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.39}"
3.0,"Not a Good Film, But Enjoyable in its Badness","Steve Rogers is turned into a super soldier to fight the Red Skull during World War II. He loses and is frozen for fifty years. When he comes back, he finds the Red Skull has assassinated Kennedy, King and has become one of the world's most powerful supervillains and businessmen. Can he stop the Skull now? This film is fun if you like seeing a guy in a bad costume run around and throw a shield, while a man who looks and acts like Jimmy Carter is a crime-fighting president (and protector of the environment). It's light on plot, light on character development and even the action comes off as more cheesy than anything. But to be honest with you, this was more fun than almost any of the modern comic book films. (For example, ""Batman Begins"" is a phenomenal film -- but it's not as easy to sit back and laugh at with a beer.) Why is the Red Skull Italian? As I recall from the comics, he's quite German, and there was no real reason to change this for the movie. I mean, if you're fighting the Nazis, isn't it just more logical to have the villain be German? Where did he get a daughter from? This remains unanswered. Other things seemed fishy... and even the decoder ring, which was important to the story, never paid off as fully as I would have liked (and what exactly did it decode?).If you get a copy of this movie, keep your expectations low and your supply of Busch Light very high. Not a good movie, unless you love ripping apart such films. I do, so I loved it. But I wouldn't foist it anyone... but maybe the old ""Punisher"" film...",not good film but enjoyable its badness,steve rogers is turned into super soldier fight red skull during world war ii he loses is frozen fifty years when he comes back he finds red skull has assassinated kennedy king has become one worlds most powerful supervillains businessmen can he stop skull now this film is fun if you like seeing guy bad costume run around throw shield while man who looks acts like jimmy carter is crime fighting president protector environment its light plot light character development even action comes off as more cheesy than anything but be honest with you this was more fun than almost any modern comic book films example batman begins is phenomenal film but its not as easy sit back laugh at with beer why is red skull italian as i recall comics hes quite german there was no real reason change this movie i mean if youre fighting nazis isnt it just more logical have villain be german where did he get daughter this remains unanswered other things seemed fishy even decoder ring which was important story never paid off as fully as i would have liked what exactly did it decode if you get copy this movie keep your expectations low your supply busch light very high not good movie unless you love ripping apart such films i do so i loved it but i wouldnt foist it anyone but maybe old punisher film,0.4283226950354611,0.15291843971631208,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.27}"
4.0,No. it's so bad it's good. enjoy it to laugh at it.,"I'm confirming it is lame. It suffers from the same issues as the 1994 Fantastic Four, but unlike FF I can give it a, it's so bad it's good stamp (And I'm very happy about that).Captain America is a pretty easy comic to adapt to the big screen, it's just an action adventure war movie about a guy who sometimes wears a mask. They did take some liberties with the character that make my Fanboy radar point up, but it's superficial.Steve Rodgers is now a boy from Southern California who has polio and offered himself up to the super soldier experiment headed up by a woman who escaped from the Nazis (The idea of a woman creating the star spangled avenger was cool, not enough female brainiacs in the comic book industry ).Shortly after Steve Rodgers becomes Captain America the doctor is killed making Steve and The Red Skull the only one's like them. After stopping the Red Skull from destroying the White House he is trapped in Ice for 60 years and wakes up having to stop the Red Skull, who has formed an underground crime unit that basically is Hydra without saying it,again. Proving how well Cap works as an action movie, Matt Salinger who plays Steve Rogers, wearing some sort of padding to make it look like he's got more than he does, barely wears the cartoonish suit they made for him (of course wearing the uniform makes him Captain America, duh)It's got that 80s swagger to it. The Red Skull has his daughter do all the heavy lifting for most of the movie with her small army of rich Nazi brats who drive the fastest cars and wear the hottest fashions but more than capable with the guns.They took some liberties with The Red Skull's origin too, I think this was to save money and film the entire movie in Italy (I'm also guessing that certain places in Italy look more like Southern California than New York City)I am being harsh on the movie because I've grown to like the character more now than I ever did when I was a kid and saw this, but like I expressed before, the movie does have a so bad it's food quality that makes it real enjoyable. http://cinemagardens.com",no its so bad its good enjoy it laugh at it,im confirming it is lame it suffers same issues as 1994 fantastic four but unlike ff i can give it its so bad its good stamp im very happy about that captain america is pretty easy comic adapt big screen its just action adventure war movie about guy who sometimes wears mask they did take some liberties with character that make my fanboy radar point up but its superficial steve rodgers is now boy southern california who has polio offered himself up super soldier experiment headed up by woman who escaped nazis idea woman creating star spangled avenger was cool not enough female brainiacs comic book industry shortly after steve rodgers becomes captain america doctor is killed making steve red skull only ones like them after stopping red skull destroying white house he is trapped ice 60 years wakes up having stop red skull who has formed underground crime unit that basically is hydra without saying it again proving how well cap works as action movie matt salinger who plays steve rogers wearing some sort padding make it look like hes got more than he does barely wears cartoonish suit they made him course wearing uniform makes him captain america duh its got that 80s swagger it red skull has his daughter do all heavy lifting most movie with her small army rich nazi brats who drive fastest cars wear hottest fashions but more than capable with guns they took some liberties with red skulls origin too i think this was save money film entire movie italy im also guessing that certain places italy look more like southern california than new york city i am being harsh movie because ive grown like character more now than i ever did when i was kid saw this but like i expressed before movie does have so bad its food quality that makes it real enjoyable,0.42678155178155175,0.09696761571761572,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
5.0,This 1990 version of Captain America can be pretty entertaining despite some noticeable flaws,"Okay, so after watching the Republic serial from 1944 in which Captain America's alter ego was Grant Gardner, district attorney, and then two TV movie versions starring Reb Brown as Steve Rogers, occasional painter, I finally watched this 1990 version from Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation starring Matt Salinger as the super soldier from World War II that gets frozen for several decades before being thawed out. I liked the beginning where we find out about both his and The Red Skull's (Scott Paulin) early lives and there was a quite entertaining fight between them during the WWII sequence though it would have been nice to know what dastardly thing the Skull did that lead to that battle. But then we're abruptly taken to the present day to when Cap finds himself waking up to and it takes a little time to once again find some momentum. That said, having Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty as a couple of old pals now serving as president and reporter, respectively, was a nice treat for anyone who remembers them from Deliverance not to mention Beatty for his previous superhero encounter in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. And how awesome it was to finally see the CA costume done right this time with both the wings on the cowl and the shield just the right size and color. Even more so was all the hot women that abounded though I have to wonder how any of them could realistically be daughters of the disfigured Red Skull! So in summation, this filmed version of Captain America may be a little on the underwhelming side concerning story logic but the action for the most part makes it worth it for at least one viewing though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again. Can't wait for Chris Evans in Captain America: The First Avenger later this summer.",this 1990 version captain america can be pretty entertaining despite some noticeable flaws,okay so after watching republic serial 1944 which captain americas alter ego was grant gardner district attorney then two tv movie versions starring reb brown as steve rogers occasional painter i finally watched this 1990 version menahem golans 21st century film corporation starring matt salinger as super soldier world war ii that gets frozen several decades before being thawed out i liked beginning where we find out about both his red skulls scott paulin early lives there was quite entertaining fight between them during wwii sequence though it would have been nice know what dastardly thing skull did that lead that battle but then were abruptly taken present day when cap finds himself waking up it takes little time once again find some momentum that said having ronny cox ned beatty as couple old pals now serving as president reporter respectively was nice treat anyone who remembers them deliverance not mention beatty his previous superhero encounter first two christopher reeve superman movies how awesome it was finally see ca costume done right this time with both wings cowl shield just right size color even more so was all hot women that abounded though i have wonder how any them could realistically be daughters disfigured red skull so summation this filmed version captain america may be little underwhelming side concerning story logic but action most part makes it worth it at least one viewing though i probably wouldnt mind watching it again cant wait chris evans captain america first avenger later this summer,0.4698979591836734,0.19537414965986394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"
5.0,Lacked the Special Effects of the More Modern Captain America Films,"This movie begins in Italy just prior to World War 2 with government soldiers breaking into a house to kidnap a young boy and then murdering his family in the process. The reason for the kidnapping is that they need a test subject for an experiment which might allow them to create super-soldiers for their army and dreams of conquest. Yet, even though the experiment is a complete success, the doctor involved in it becomes horrified by the ruthlessness of those she works with and manages to escape to the United States with all of the secrets required to continue her work in her head. She then continues her research in the United States which eventually concludes with the making of a super-hero named ""Captain America"" (Matt Salinger) to counter the super-villain created in Italy who goes by the name of the ""Red Skull"" (Scott Paulin). Unfortunately, her success is short-lived as she is assassinated by Nazi agents and the secrets she had dies with her shortly afterward. But with war breaking out both Captain America and the Red Skull soon clash with each other and the story becomes even more pronounced after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say this the particular movie lacked the special effects of the more modern Captain America films which clearly resulted in an inferior picture by comparison. Even so, I didn't think the movie was necessarily bad as it still managed to entertain to a certain degree. That being said, I have rated this movie as about average and recommend it to those who enjoy films of this type.",lacked special effects more modern captain america films,this movie begins italy just prior world war 2 with government soldiers breaking into house kidnap young boy then murdering his family process reason kidnapping is that they need test subject experiment which might allow them create super soldiers their army dreams conquest yet even though experiment is complete success doctor involved it becomes horrified by ruthlessness those she works with manages escape united states with all secrets required continue her work her head she then continues her research united states which eventually concludes with making super hero named captain america matt salinger counter super villain created italy who goes by name red skull scott paulin unfortunately her success is short lived as she is assassinated by nazi agents secrets she had dies with her shortly afterward but with war breaking out both captain america red skull soon clash with each other story becomes even more pronounced after that now rather than reveal any more i will just say this particular movie lacked special effects more modern captain america films which clearly resulted inferior picture by comparison even so i didnt think movie was necessarily bad as it still managed entertain certain degree that being said i have rated this movie as about average recommend it those who enjoy films this type,0.4036535303776683,0.1432266009852217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"

,I'm just glad he wasn't a surfer dude or a crusading D.A.,"Like many Cap fans, I eagerly waited for the Captain America film and was disappointed when it went direct-to-video. When I finally saw the video, I was disappointed with the story. I did like the physical acting with Cap in costume, and I think that was the one true thing about Captain America. Rather than rant on about what was wrong, let me tell you Hollywood scripters how to do it right;1. The first movie must spend a great deal (if not the whole movie) in WWII, where his legend will start. No urban legend in the 21st Century.2. Steve Rogers is a NEW YORKER! He kept his optimism despite losing both parents to disease (alcoholism, pneumonia) during the Great Depression. Even in the new millennium, he loves listening to big band and 40s music and anything that sparks such nostalgia. He's still a BROOKLYN Dodgers fan.3. What the hell was that with the plastic ears?! (Sorry, had to get that one out.)4. Get that shield back...it was way better than not having one in the serial (a gun?) or a clear one in the TV movie.5. Don't forget that the costume has a star on the front *and* back.6. If you make the Red Skull (most likely villain) Italian again, so help me...7. I wouldn't mind seeing Bucky, but you can do like the Ultimates storyline and have him non-costumed in the war if it'll help. But please don't make Cap's costume like the one in the Ultimates (either version).8. Don't try to combine love interests (Bernie was the girlfriend during the 1980s, Sharon was the girl in the 60s and 70s, but it was wrong to make them mother and daughter.).9. I gotta say it again...don't make him an urban legend like Batman! Captain America was created to be a symbol and INSPIRE American public and forces as a response against the Red Skull. He can't do that if he's skulking the shadows.Thanks and good luck.",im just glad he wasnt surfer dude or crusading d,like many cap fans i eagerly waited captain america film was disappointed when it went direct video when i finally saw video i was disappointed with story i did like physical acting with cap costume i think that was one true thing about captain america rather than rant about what was wrong let me tell you hollywood scripters how do it right 1 first movie must spend great deal if not whole movie wwii where his legend will start no urban legend 21st century 2 steve rogers is new yorker he kept his optimism despite losing both parents disease alcoholism pneumonia during great depression even new millennium he loves listening big band 40s music anything that sparks such nostalgia hes still brooklyn dodgers fan 3 what hell was that with plastic ears sorry had get that one out 4 get that shield back it was way better than not having one serial gun or clear one tv movie 5 dont forget that costume has star front back 6 if you make red skull most likely villain italian again so help me 7 i wouldnt mind seeing bucky but you can do like ultimates storyline have him non costumed war if itll help but please dont make caps costume like one ultimates either version 8 dont try combine love interests bernie was girlfriend during 1980s sharon was girl 60s 70s but it was wrong make them mother daughter 9 i gotta say it again dont make him urban legend like batman captain america was created be symbol inspire american public forces as response against red skull he cant do that if hes skulking shadows thanks good luck,0.42423672818409663,0.08574846206425153,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.25}"
6.0,Not bad,"Despite its forgotten status today - especially in the wake of the recent mega-budget revamp - CAPTAIN America isn't bad for what it is, which is a low budget, cheesy, superhero family adventure film. Okay, so the director is Albert Pyun, who I have to say is one of my least favourites, and the paucity of budget is evident throughout, but other than that this is surprisingly watchable.I think it's fair to say that Matt Salinger is one of the more wooden superhero actors to be seen on screen, but the supporting cast makes up for that.

,What could have been the start of a potentially great franchise,"Half-way decent adaptation of the classic Marvel comics character, which many people either love or hate. Most of the half-way decency the film has it derives from star Matt Salinger, the son of over-praised asshole writer JD Salinger. In a role that could have been made comical or just plain bad by many other actors, Matt manages to imbue the character with an authentic feeling of sincerity similar to what Christopher Reeve gave to Superman and often missing from other actors in superhero films. Had this film been left with a bigger budget and gotten a big theatrical release it could very well have made Matt Salinger a star, or at least establish his name and allow him some leverage to pursue other roles in bigger projects like Helen Slater after the endearingly classic disaster ""Supergirl"" (1984). Actually I think both Dolph Lundgren and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively, were both considered for this role, but it's just as well that they didn't get it, seeing as how their accents would have worked against them playing this ""All-American"" hero. Although Arnold's name on the picture might have gotten it a theatrical release instead of going direct to video (a similar fate befell Dolph's ""The Punisher"").After Steve Rogers gets pumped up by the super soldier serum he becomes Captain America and gets into a disastrous first mission that ends with him getting his ass kicked by the Red Skull, who straps him to a missile pointed at the White House. Cap narrowly manages to cut off the Red Skull's hand and wrecks the missile so that instead of hitting the White House it lands in the Arctic and freezes him there, but not before he is spotted by a little boy who grows up to be President Ronny Cox. When Cap thaws out, he finds that much has changed while he's been gone, like his old girlfriend and her now adult daughter. He also finds out that the Red Skull is still alive and still out to conquer the world. Naturally, Captain America catches up with the Red Skull and beats the crap out of him in turn (""Stop calling me your brother!"") before saving the world.The guy playing the Skull is ineffectual, but he's got a nice looking daughter. Again, the real saving grace here is Matt Salinger's sincere performance as the title character, but even that can only do so much against a weak script and boring villains. Still, I enjoyed this film and I feel that fans deserved a chance to see this in theaters. And now I hear that Brad Pitt wants to play Captain America!

7.0,"""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves","Before 1998's ""Blade,"" Marvel Comics couldn't seem to catch a break when it came to movie versions of their different properties. In the wake of ""Iron Man 3"" and ""The Avengers,"" I know that's very hard to believe. There was a serial for Captain America released in 1944 through Republic Pictures. George Lucas executive produced a live-action adaptation of ""Howard the Duck"" in 1986.The next few years up to Wesley Snipes' take on the legendary vampire slayer were plagued with low-budget versions of the comic book publisher's characters. Dolph Lundgren's ""The Punisher"" couldn't even muster a theatrical release in the U.S. Roger Corman's ""The Fantastic Four"" never officially saw the light of day anywhere, although bootleg copies float around.21st Century Film Corporation released ""Captain America"" straight to video in the middle of those two disasters. For many years, the movie was hard to get a hold of and only released on VHS. Shout! Factory released it on DVD and made it widely available to those who sought it out for so many years as a sort of Nerd Holy Grail.Several years after being caught by Red Skull and left for dead, Steve Rogers is found frozen in the ice and thawed out. He discovers Red Skull received plastic surgery to hide his true identity and is heading up a group of world leaders set on kidnapping the President of the United States for their own diabolical ambitions.Is ""Captain America"" filled with cheese? If you judge it from a modern standpoint, of course it is. If you look at it as being a piece of World War II propaganda filmed in the 1940s, you'll find it totally hits its mark. That's the standpoint I choose to view it from.My only real issue is that we only get about 5 minutes of face time from the real Red Skull. The rest of the film features actor Scott Paulin in flesh-colored make-up topped with scar lines. It's a real letdown for fans of the Red Skull who wanted to see the character the way he looks in the comic books.I still think that ""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves. Is it on the same quality level as ""Captain America: The First Avenger?"" No way! However, it has an inviting and personal flavor to it that still works 23 years later.

8.0,Not bad for its time,"Captain America was a 1990 direct-to-video release from 21st Century Films starring Matt Salinger (son of ""Catcher in the Rye"" author J.D. Salinger) in the title role, Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, and Scott Paulin as Cap's nemesis, ""The Red Skull"".Sure this movie's ridiculed now, but as a child growing up in the 1990s it was this, or literally nothing. Superhero movies weren't the box office blockbusters they are today, and as such this film was quite the novelty back then.Now you can walk into any store and find tons of Marvel merchandise, but it was a different story in the early-to-mid nineties. It was a lot harder to find anything Marvel related, but thankfully times have changed and people now see comics as great resources for turning out highly entertaining films. Truly, kids don't know how lucky they have it now.Sure, this movie had more than its fair share of flaws including transforming Red Skull from the German Nazi of his comic continuity into an Italian fascist for the film version, a choice I'm still puzzled by. Taking two of Captain America's unrelated love interests from different eras and making them mother and daughter in the film also seemed an odd decision, but what seemed utterly unforgivable to me as a kid was the costume designer who forgot to put a star on both the front AND back of Cap's uniform! The one thing they got right on the money was his shield.Comic fans are an interesting bunch, and I'm proud to call myself one of them, and one thing that drives us all mad is taking liberties with the source material. I think had this movie tried to stay closer to its comic book roots it wouldn't have been criticized so harshly.Personally, I believe had the filmmakers focused on making this story more of a period piece set in the 1940s during the height of World War II, I think the end result would have been a lot better. It would've given us the chance to see why Captain America was considered an American legend and war hero. As it was, it seemed the screenwriter was more focused on trying to propel the story into what was then present day. I would say that maybe roughly fifteen minutes, if that, takes place in 1943 while the rest of the movie takes place in 1993.In conclusion, I'd say that ""Captain America"" isn't a great movie, but it's not that bad, and before you rip it to shreds, try to remember the time period from which it came. A time when comic book movies weren't the norm, and kids were happy to have something like this to watch.If you're curious to watch it I'd say you probably won't be able to find this on DVD and certainly not Blu Ray, but check around on online auctions websites for used VHS copies, or any other popular video streaming sites where I know it's available to watch for free.I'll be curious to see Captain America: The First Avenger when it comes to theaters in 2011, with Chris Evans (formerly the ""Human Torch"" from the two abysmal ""Fantastic Four"" movies) taking on the mantle of Captain America.",not bad its time,captain america was 1990 direct video release 21st century films starring matt salinger son catcher rye author j d salinger title role ronny cox ned beatty scott paulin as caps nemesis red skull sure this movies ridiculed now but as child growing up 1990s it was this or literally nothing superhero movies werent box office blockbusters they are today as such this film was quite novelty back then now you can walk into any store find tons marvel merchandise but it was different story early mid nineties it was lot harder find anything marvel related but thankfully times have changed people now see comics as great resources turning out highly entertaining films truly kids dont know how lucky they have it now sure this movie had more than its fair share flaws including transforming red skull german nazi his comic continuity into italian fascist film version choice im still puzzled by taking two captain americas unrelated love interests different eras making them mother daughter film also seemed odd decision but what seemed utterly unforgivable me as kid was costume designer who forgot put star both front back caps uniform one thing they got right money was his shield comic fans are interesting bunch im proud call myself one them one thing that drives us all mad is taking liberties with source material i think had this movie tried stay closer its comic book roots it wouldnt have been criticized so harshly personally i believe had filmmakers focused making this story more period piece set 1940s during height world war ii i think end result would have been lot better it wouldve given us chance see why captain america was considered american legend war hero as it was it seemed screenwriter was more focused trying propel story into what was then present day i would say that maybe roughly fifteen minutes if that takes place 1943 while rest movie takes place 1993 conclusion id say that captain america isnt great movie but its not that bad before you rip it shreds try remember time period which it came time when comic book movies werent norm kids were happy have something like this watch if youre curious watch it id say you probably wont be able find this dvd certainly not blu ray but check around online auctions websites used vhs copies or any other popular video streaming sites where i know its available watch free ill be curious see captain america first avenger when it comes theaters 2011 with chris evans formerly human torch two abysmal fantastic four movies taking mantle captain america,0.507766439909297,0.1874149659863946,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10.0,Best film variation of a superhero yet!,"Many critics have panned this film, and I think it's a sad fate for such a well done and thought-out movie. It doesn't rely on over-the-top special effects and overblown action scenes. Instead, this is a thinking man's superhero movie, focusing on the power of the characters to show what true heroes are.Captain America and the Red Skull are counterparts, both representing the pride of their countries, America and Germany, respectively, back in WW2. Both have been shot with a super-serum which transforms them into world-class athletes. They fight, Cap loses and is tied to a runaway rocket, which crashes into Alaska. He is preserved there until the 1990's, when he get resurrected and he realizes Red Skull is still alive and healthy, because the serum has allowed him to last this long. He is responsible for the deaths of several historic figures, including Robert Kennedy, John Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. And his next target is the newest U.S. president. Cap must stop him before it is too late, and at the same time, he must come to grips with the fact that he is in a strange new world and everything he has ever known in gone forever, and that if it hadn't been for him failing to defeat Skull the first time, many people would still be alive.The Red Skull, also, hates what he has become, and Captain America resurfacing represents a part of him he wishes was dead. He therefore takes all measures to make sure Cap is killed. The way they constantly pursue each other is both exciting and moving.As someone mentioned, this is a great deal like ""Forever Young,"" especially the way Cap comes back to life and finds his girlfriend extremely old. And ""Cap"" is the better of the two movies. It has a government-conspiracy plot worthy of a Dean Koontz novel, and it also throws in a lot of comic-book silliness.

Matt Salinger does his best with a lousy story. Captain America doesn't even finish one mission before he's frozen in ice, only to be thawed out 50 years later. The Red Skull is the villain, but in most of the movie he looks like a guy with acne problems. However, we do learn that the Red Skull had a hand in the JFK assassination. How Oliver Stone missed that lead is beyond me. The Captain's super powers seem to be limited to throwing his shield and faking car sickness. On the positive side, at times the film does have the feel of a 40's serial. I would've liked to see that carried out, but the film never decides whether to be serious or kind-of-corny. Instead it just ends up being boring.",comic fans beware,ive never read captain america comic book but i dont have know that any fan comic wont be too pleased with this film matt salinger does his best with lousy story captain america doesnt even finish one mission before hes frozen ice only be thawed out 50 years later red skull is villain but most movie he looks like guy with acne problems however we do learn that red skull had hand jfk assassination how oliver stone missed that lead is beyond me captains super powers seem be limited throwing his shield faking car sickness positive side at times film does have feel 40s serial i wouldve liked see that carried out but film never decides whether be serious or kind corny instead it just ends up being boring,0.5289802789802791,0.14476911976911977,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
