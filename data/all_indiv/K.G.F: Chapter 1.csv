1,Over-hyped movie with very ordinary plot line,"Saw the 8+ rating of the movie and decided to give it a go. During the whole movie I tried to stop watching it multiple time, but kept on going hoping something good will happen and was utterly disappointed at the end. The movie has very old and cliche plot line. Typically, there is a protagonist who literally eve-teases a girl who at the end is wooed by his ""persistence"" (no wonder a lot of street goons are inspired by such characters making our country an unsafe place for women). The action is typical comical south-indian movie style where one punch from the ""hero"" sends villain in alternate dimension. The dialogues are crowd pleasing one line punchliners which might appeal to certain audience. Only good thing about the movie was decent acting by the lead actor.",over hyped movie with very ordinary plot line,saw 8 rating movie decided give it go during whole movie i tried stop watching it multiple time but kept going hoping something good will happen was utterly disappointed at end movie has very old cliche plot line typically there is protagonist who literally eve teases girl who at end is wooed by his persistence no wonder lot street goons are inspired by such characters making our country unsafe place women action is typical comical south indian movie style where one punch hero sends villain alternate dimension dialogues are crowd pleasing one line punchliners which might appeal certain audience only good thing about movie was decent acting by lead actor,0.4763585434173669,0.07662464985994398,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.48}"

1,I'm honestly writing My Reviews about my feeling towards this movie,"Yeah ! I rated 1 stars, You know why? This movie makes no sense, and I'm completely shocked about how much hyped the movie is. Firstly, The main character Rocky is shown as a superhero ,yeah right an over the top action film protagonist , who fights with hundred people , and they just fly away. Yeah, it makes sense in South Indian Films where law of physics are not counted. But we are in 2019 now and still watching this cringe? You are going to say, Superhero movies in hollywood does the same and we don't talk about that. duh, these are completely different genre. secondly, dialogues in the movie is okay for movies that released in 90's times. "" Gangster to jo gang leke aata hain, wo hai monster"" I Can't take anymore of this cringe. In fact, they wasted the whole film duration in developing the characters, Not a single shot where, Rocky is not shown. Maybe one or two? And the plot? Well, A boy from slum , his mother dies, this kind of story is common now.You want a gangster movie? Watch once upon a time in mumbai, see how it entertains you without having masala elements.

4,Basically a stylized exercise in hero worship! [+44%],"K. G. F Chapter 1 might be an astonishing wonder for one section of film-goers who haven't yet been exposed to world cinema. But, honestly, it is little beyond an overstretched exercise in hailing the protagonist as invincible. The problem with films that have invincible heroes is that none of the challenges that the screenplay poses turns out to be engaging enough. This, in turn, makes K. G. F Chapter 1 a less than exciting experience.Prashant Neel has packaged the film with all necessary massy ingredients: there are slow-motion intro sequences, exquisitely staged yet pointless fights, and excessive hype created around the protagonist's indomitable aura. There are a bunch of scenes that try to reinstate the fact that Rocky (Yash) is unbeatable. It's clear from the very first scene that he's in. Yet, the director chooses to drive the point home over and over again. The dialogues too are some of the campiest I've heard in recent times. It's like no one in the film speaks normally. Everyone speaks as if they've been preparing their cheese-filled quotes/monologues for years, just waiting to spit them out at first given instance.Character-building is one area that the film lacks terribly in. We have more than a dozen (main) characters being introduced but none of them (and I repeat, none of them) are well-fleshed out. Even Rocky's childhood is just a collection of massy moments: he is pushed to the limit; his mom utters philosophical nonsense, and the next thing you see, he's beating people up in a jiffy. When Rocky grows older, he beats even more people up. Basically, the film uses the tired formula of one-man-against-many to build hype around the character of Rocky. This is something good old Shankar tried more than a decade ago and emerged a winner at. Prashant Neel attempts the same; he's supported greatly by his cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda (who assigns splendid colours to frames, often giving it a neo-noir touch), composer Ravi Basrur (the songs are bathroom-breaks but the background score was pretty epic), and the fine-looking production values (the set designs are elaborate).Where Neel lacks in the screenplay, he tries to compensate with cinematic gimmicks. The heroine, unfortunately, is a mere prop. She shows up in a couple of scenes (and a song) that do nothing but stretch the film's first half. In a film such as this, it would be criminal to even consider a well-written role for the heroine. In fact, the protagonist's mom (who appears in flashbacks) and a struggling pregnant mother at the gold mine receive better treatment than the heroine. Well, here's hoping she has something more to do in the sequel.The villains? I like how Prashant Neel tried to bring to the forefront not one, but a whole array of them. However, none of them manages to leave an impression. At the end of the day, they're just brawny halfwits who are not worthy of even tying the hero's shoelaces. K. G. F Chapter 1 certainly has a better second half (once the film shifts to the gold mine), though that it isn't saying much. I wish the director spent less time trying to write scenes glorifying Rocky and instead, focused on telling a more compelling story with well-rounded characters.I agree that a gangster movie needs its share of crowd-pleasing moments and even then, K. G. F Chapter 1 isn't a lot beyond an overly indulgent star vehicle. I'm not exactly sure if it's the packaging that impressed audiences or the frequent massy reminders; it definitely isn't the screenplay. Yash sleepwalks through the role of Rocky - one which thankfully doesn't require the greatest acting capabilities. This may be a benchmark for the Kannada film industry, but it's high time they realize they're still way behind when it comes to quality content and story-telling, because well, a brilliant technical crew can only do so much to elevate a mediocre screenplay. I hope to see more films along the lines of 'Lucia', 'Lifeu Ishtene', RangiTaranga', 'Kirik Party', and 'Thithi' instead of 'K. G. F'.",basically stylized exercise hero worship,k g f chapter 1 might be astonishing wonder one section film goers who havent yet been exposed world cinema but honestly it is little beyond overstretched exercise hailing protagonist as invincible problem with films that have invincible heroes is that none challenges that screenplay poses turns out be engaging enough this turn makes k g f chapter 1 less than exciting experience prashant neel has packaged film with all necessary massy ingredients there are slow motion intro sequences exquisitely staged yet pointless fights excessive hype created around protagonists indomitable aura there are bunch scenes that try reinstate fact that rocky yash is unbeatable its clear very first scene that hes yet director chooses drive point home over over again dialogues too are some campiest ive heard recent times its like no one film speaks normally everyone speaks as if theyve been preparing their cheese filled quotes monologues years just waiting spit them out at first given instance character building is one area that film lacks terribly we have more than dozen main characters being introduced but none them i repeat none them are well fleshed out even rockys childhood is just collection massy moments he is pushed limit his mom utters philosophical nonsense next thing you see hes beating people up jiffy when rocky grows older he beats even more people up basically film uses tired formula one man against many build hype around character rocky this is something good old shankar tried more than decade ago emerged winner at prashant neel attempts same hes supported greatly by his cinematographer bhuvan gowda who assigns splendid colours frames often giving it neo noir touch composer ravi basrur songs are bathroom breaks but background score was pretty epic fine looking production values set designs are elaborate where neel lacks screenplay he tries compensate with cinematic gimmicks heroine unfortunately is mere prop she shows up couple scenes song that do nothing but stretch films first half film such as this it would be criminal even consider well written role heroine fact protagonists mom who appears flashbacks struggling pregnant mother at gold mine receive better treatment than heroine well heres hoping she has something more do sequel villains i like how prashant neel tried bring forefront not one but whole array them however none them manages leave impression at end day theyre just brawny halfwits who are not worthy even tying heros shoelaces k g f chapter 1 certainly has better second half once film shifts gold mine though that it isnt saying much i wish director spent less time trying write scenes glorifying rocky instead focused telling more compelling story with well rounded characters i agree that gangster movie needs its share crowd pleasing moments even then k g f chapter 1 isnt lot beyond overly indulgent star vehicle im not exactly sure if its packaging that impressed audiences or frequent massy reminders it definitely isnt screenplay yash sleepwalks through role rocky one which thankfully doesnt require greatest acting capabilities this may be benchmark kannada film industry but its high time they realize theyre still way behind when it comes quality content story telling because well brilliant technical crew can only do so much elevate mediocre screenplay i hope see more films along lines lucia lifeu ishtene rangitaranga kirik party thithi instead k g f,0.5311386684303352,0.15757109788359785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.37}"

Pacing is abrupt.. some exposition scenes move too fast.. some scenes move so slow that you just want to fast forward them.2. Typical story: The backdrop of Kolar Gold Fields sounds interesting. Unfortunately, its only a backdrop and this film just becomes an ordinary gangster film. Hero infiltrates gang, woos heroine, kills villain. Have we seen this before?3. Too much cringe inducing Hero Worship: Yeah we get it, ""Rocking Superstar"" looks great and can make girls and some guys go gaga.. but having a slo-mo scene everytime he is on screen with voiceover explaining how he is the single best person on the face of this earth? Just pure cringe. Add to that the real world hero worship by the fans just shows you how politicians and film stars float on the sevenrh heaven in India.4. Headache inducing action: Rapid cuts and editing just make you dizzy.5. The heroine was there just for fun.. so were the item songs.6. What was the point the movie was trying to make? The mother makes her son promise that he will die a rich and powerful man. Ok understood. But richness and power can also be done in a legitimate way. Not by becoming a gangster and kiling people left right. An interesting story would have been if he got educated, became a minister or govt officer and then fought againt KGF mafia to win over the mines in a legitimate way. Maybe throwing in some fights for the required masala. Like Nayak.

8,Chapter 1 sets the stage for a Macro level showdown in Chapter 2.,"What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's ""The Oil""(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.",chapter 1 sets stage macro level showdown chapter 2,whats passion work or put efforts something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right which one loves holds close heart without getting distracted even second one interviews prashant neel director had said that he has watched kgf more than 150 times while editing he wanted make his kgf near perfect craft while shooting bhuvan gowda cinematographer used carry around 40kgs camera its accessories top while canning sequences windy dusty region gigantic sets used come down crashing after heavy wind rains yet art director shivakumar used go back erecting same sets as they stood earlier yash used give multiple retakes with no sign fatigue or feeling bored that dust bowl kgf will be made two chapters chapter 1 is out at outset it traces with pre historical chronology world events letting audience know importance owning gold battles it chapter 1 deals with micro level unorganized crime mafia underworld chapter 1 depicts about greed race one up man ship within many characters getting control goldmine kgf enter into macro level orbit world crime syndicate one has clear his way at micro level dirt has be cleaned make way top chapter 1 ends at doorstep chapter 2 which is meant open triangular battle between international mafia gold interruption indias govt rocky who valorously emerges out kgf slavery as messiah film is narrated through authors played by anantnag first hand experience news editor played by malvika avinash as his book gets banned by central govt he traces journey rocky his birth establishing himself as feared crime lord mumbai docks bangalore finally his destined place kgf mother sentiment is well crafted placed appropriately throughout film though story line is predictable replicates ugramm template kgf also just like ugramm many characters get introduced thus challenges ones memory remember count characters yashs introduction elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged makes glued screen kgf falters at few places first half yash srinidhi scenes could have been better army supporting characters may be revealed more chapter 2 its second half which meets expectation ends with retaliating climax leaving multiple threads open only be tied later chapter 2 another day kgf start finish is full high octane action sequences dialogues are sharp effective music is average but gets compensated through outrageous bgm some influence soundtrack hams zimmers oil dunkirk technical front captain kgf mines prashant neel director should take bow bringing his vision screen editing is very sharp multiple scenes are played parallel also intellectually blurred at few places showcase that character had no idea about things come ravi basrurs music is downer but his bgm raises milieu all sequences cinematography by bhuvan gowda is top notch world class he will get all awards if nominated functions pan india level 2019 never say die attitude art director shivakumar should get all accolades erecting such massive sets mines midst dust bowls kgf has used 90 sets just 10 vfx filming kgf chapter 1 sets stage macro level showdown chapter 2,0.40450793650793654,0.08580591630591627,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.45}"
