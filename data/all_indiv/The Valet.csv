8.0,"Simple, Fun & Enjoyable!","The Valet is a comedy, romance that is parts funny, serious, happy, sad and all around enjoyable.The storyline is good, it's well portrayed and doesn't get to crazy while also ensuring that it keeps you entertained.The casting was absolutely amazingly done, Samara Weaving is beautiful and does a fantastic job at portraying Olivia Allan, our leading man Eugenio Derbez who plays Antonia as well as the supporting cast. They all fit in just right with their characters and together immerse you in the world the film makers have created for you.This movie reminds me a lot of Marry Me, another film I enjoyed with a similar style of story, however the reason I cannot rate The Valet higher then a 8/10 is because I'm a hopeless romantic and I was rooting so hard throughout the movie for Olivia and Antonia to realize they're just perfect for one another. Unfortunately *Spoiler Alert* they remain just friends at the end of the film rather then ending up together like I thought and was hoping they would do.Besides that little grievance I thoroughly enjoyed the film and can definitely recommend it for comedy/romance or Marry Me fans.8/10 from me. The Valet is a solid, well done movie where I wouldn't have minded a sequel and I have my fingers crossed that they decide to do one. Maybe I'll get the ending I want and Olivia and Antonio will fall in love, realize their love and end up together. One can hope :)",simple fun enjoyable,valet is comedy romance that is parts funny serious happy sad all around enjoyable storyline is good its well portrayed doesnt get crazy while also ensuring that it keeps you entertained casting was absolutely amazingly done samara weaving is beautiful does fantastic job at portraying olivia allan our leading man eugenio derbez who plays antonia as well as supporting cast they all fit just right with their characters together immerse you world film makers have created you this movie reminds me lot marry me another film i enjoyed with similar style story however reason i cannot rate valet higher then 8 10 is because im hopeless romantic i was rooting so hard throughout movie olivia antonia realize theyre just perfect one another unfortunately spoiler alert they remain just friends at end film rather then ending up together like i thought was hoping they would do besides that little grievance i thoroughly enjoyed film can definitely recommend it comedy romance or marry me fans 8 10 me valet is solid well done movie where i wouldnt have minded sequel i have my fingers crossed that they decide do one maybe ill get ending i want olivia antonio will fall love realize their love end up together one can hope,0.6517063492063494,0.20577380952380953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"
6.0,Quite enjoyable...,"Now, I haven't seen the 2006 French movie ""La Doublure"" of which this 2022 comedy is a remake. So I can't say how much of a copy this 2022 version of the original movie.However, I must admit that ""The Valet"" from writers Bob Fisher and Rob Greenberg was actually rather enjoyable. The storyline is good and well-written, and have elements of romance and comedy to it, and it works out quite nicely.I was genuinely entertained by this movie, and director Richard Wong did deliver a wholesome and enjoyable movie.I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in ""The Valet"", but they had some great talents to portray the various characters. Eugenio Derbez (playing Antonio) was really a nicely cast actor for the leading part, alongside with Samara Weaving (playing Olivia).""The Valet"" is a movie that has a good atmosphere to it and it makes you feel good, so thumbs up to director Richard Wong on that accomplishment. Lots of good comedy moments that made me have good, genuine laughs.My rating of ""The Valet"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",quite enjoyable,now i havent seen 2006 french movie la doublure which this 2022 comedy is remake so i cant say how much copy this 2022 version original movie however i must admit that valet writers bob fisher rob greenberg was actually rather enjoyable storyline is good well written have elements romance comedy it it works out quite nicely i was genuinely entertained by this movie director richard wong did deliver wholesome enjoyable movie i wasnt familiar with cast ensemble valet but they had some great talents portray various characters eugenio derbez playing antonio was really nicely cast actor leading part alongside with samara weaving playing olivia valet is movie that has good atmosphere it it makes you feel good so thumbs up director richard wong that accomplishment lots good comedy moments that made me have good genuine laughs my rating valet lands six out ten stars,0.5299999999999999,0.4375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"

8.0,A lot more than Eugenio Derbez his best performance!,"This is a movie you have to see. Not often you will see a remake that is slightly better than the original. This one is. After seeing ""La Doublure"", I had to see this one. Thinking what do I have to lose, right? Well this movie is surprisingly funny and uplifting. The jokes are everywhere, in the words and also in the non-verbal communication. The interactions between Antonio's mother and Mr. Kim are unexpectedly sweet (she speaks Spanish and he speaks Korean and neither speaks English) which results in an amusing translation of their communication. The plot and subplot (the gentrification) twist you can see coming from a mile away but that does not have any negative impact on the storytelling. This is mainly due to the fantastic cast as a whole and the outstanding performances of both Eugenio Derbez (Antonio) and co-lead Samara Weaving (Olivia), YES, related to Hugo Weaving but she is playing the role of her lifetime. Also an excellent performance from Betsy Brandt (Breaking Bad Maria Schrader), who plays Kathryn Royce. And Kathryn is not happy to be the wife of a cheater and puts down an amazing performance. Even the side story with the two detectives who are rivals but become good friends is very well executed. At first glance, the film is just another romantic comedy. But soon you will realize that this movie (or version of The Valet) will defeat your expectations, whatever they are. This is a perfect example of ""Gestalt"" , a configuration or pattern of elements so unified as a whole that it cannot be described merely as a sum of its parts. It is more than the sum of its parts. But you will have to go and see for yourself. I rated this movie 8.1/10. A slightly higher rating as the original from 2006. As 8.1 is not allowed, ended up with 8/10.

8.0,Such a joy!,"I saw an unfinished version of 'the valet' earlier this year (or was it last year?)

I wanted to give feedback about the film but didn't think they would deviate from the original. To my surprise, they did. (Enough people must have complained. Lol) with the original film I would have given it a 7, because it is so funny and sweet and charming but the final act was like pricking a balloon. With the changes, I was happy to give it an 8. I know people will compare it to Jennifer Lopez's film that just came out 'marry me' (which is honestly superior) but it depends on what you're looking for.

7.0,One of the better reamkes of a French comedy I've seen,"Antonio Flores (Eugenio Derbez) is a parking valet from Los Angeles who lives with his mother cecilia (Carmen Salinas) during a separation from his wife Isabel (Marisol Nichols). During a spat with married billionaire real estate developer Vincent Royce (Max Greenfield) and his mistress prominent actress Olivia Allan (Samara Weaving) over Vincent's repeated delays in leaving his wife, Antonio inadvertently collides with them as the paparazzi photograph them. When Vincent's wife, Kathryn (Betsy Brandt) sees the photos in the tabloids Vincent concocts a story that Olivia was actually dating Antonio. When Antonio is approached by Vincent's lawyer, Daniel (Alex Fernandez), he tells him of the deal to pretend to be dating Olivia Allan which Antonio accepts for a modest fee he intends to pay of Isabel's debts. Over time Antonio and Olivia form a friendship as complications aplenty arise.The Valet is an adaptation of the 2006 French comedy of the same name by Francis Verber. Development began in 2014 with Eugenio Dubez slated to star and produce the film for Latin American aimed production house Pantelion Films whom the comedian had scored massive success with 2013's Instructions Not Included that served as something of a breakout(in the U. S.) for Dubez who although big in Mexico, had a less than ideal introduction to the United States with roles in the likes of Jack & Jill and Beverly Hills Chihuahua. The Valet fell into development limbo with Dubez prioritizing other projects like Overboard, Dora and the Lost City of Gold, or providing voices for the Spanish dubs of American films such as Secret Life of Pets or The Grinch. The film makes its debut on Hulu and surprising manages to retain the appeal of the French original, while also putting its own unique identity on the material.The movie follows the key events of the original Verber film pretty closely with the impetus for the lie and various developments in the jealousy of characters like Isabel and Vincent that are parallel to developments in the French original without being complete 1:1 copies. While details have been changed such as the mistress now being an actress instead of a supermodel or the billionaire being a real estate developer instead of an industrial magnate, the movie maintains the original core premise of a simple down to earth guy whose life gets enveloped in an elaborate and contrived farce. Much like the French original, there's a sweetness to this movie I the main character played by Eugenio Derbez and his humility and goodness is nicely contrasted against the glamour and excess he's thrown into, Samara Weaving is really good as Oliva Allan and much like the original film the characters of Olivia and Antonio maintain a plutonic relationship of friendship rather than a romantic one. The movie is longer than the original film by about 40 minutes, and while an increase in runtime is usually not good for a comedy, the movie plays itself a bit differently from the zippy farce of the original film and instead makes itself more of a character based dramedy and refines loose ends of the original material. For example in the original film, the billionaire was dealing with striking factory workers who didn't really tie back into the main plot, and in this film the developer is gentrifying Antonio's neighborhood which creates a greater sense of audience investment in seeing him get his comeuppance. The movie also gives character expansion to Vincent's wife Kathryn as well as expanding upon Olivia's role and it makes the characters richer as a whole. I also liked the refinements they made to how the lie is ended and it's definitely an improvement from the final gag in the original film that hasn't aged particularly well in an otherwise good movie.Deviating from the track record of American remakes of French comedies, the makers of The Valet manage to pull off an upset and produce a solid adaptation of the material that uses the same basic idea while also allowing its own mark to be placed on it. The movie features a strong ensemble of lovable characters and stands on its own apart from the original film. Key elements from the original story are kept while expanding or adding new material and I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this movie.",one better reamkes french comedy ive seen,antonio flores eugenio derbez is parking valet los angeles who lives with his mother cecilia carmen salinas during separation his wife isabel marisol nichols during spat with married billionaire real estate developer vincent royce max greenfield his mistress prominent actress olivia allan samara weaving over vincents repeated delays leaving his wife antonio inadvertently collides with them as paparazzi photograph them when vincents wife kathryn betsy brandt sees photos tabloids vincent concocts story that olivia was actually dating antonio when antonio is approached by vincents lawyer daniel alex fernandez he tells him deal pretend be dating olivia allan which antonio accepts modest fee he intends pay isabels debts over time antonio olivia form friendship as complications aplenty arise valet is adaptation 2006 french comedy same name by francis verber development began 2014 with eugenio dubez slated star produce film latin american aimed production house pantelion films whom comedian had scored massive success with 2013s instructions not included that served as something breakout u s dubez who although big mexico had less than ideal introduction united states with roles likes jack jill beverly hills chihuahua valet fell into development limbo with dubez prioritizing other projects like overboard dora lost city gold or providing voices spanish dubs american films such as secret life pets or grinch film makes its debut hulu surprising manages retain appeal french original while also putting its own unique identity material movie follows key events original verber film pretty closely with impetus lie various developments jealousy characters like isabel vincent that are parallel developments french original without being complete 1 1 copies while details have been changed such as mistress now being actress instead supermodel or billionaire being real estate developer instead industrial magnate movie maintains original core premise simple down earth guy whose life gets enveloped elaborate contrived farce much like french original theres sweetness this movie i main character played by eugenio derbez his humility goodness is nicely contrasted against glamour excess hes thrown into samara weaving is really good as oliva allan much like original film characters olivia antonio maintain plutonic relationship friendship rather than romantic one movie is longer than original film by about 40 minutes while increase runtime is usually not good comedy movie plays itself bit differently zippy farce original film instead makes itself more character based dramedy refines loose ends original material example original film billionaire was dealing with striking factory workers who didnt really tie back into main plot this film developer is gentrifying antonios neighborhood which creates greater sense audience investment seeing him get his comeuppance movie also gives character expansion vincents wife kathryn as well as expanding upon olivias role it makes characters richer as whole i also liked refinements they made how lie is ended its definitely improvement final gag original film that hasnt aged particularly well otherwise good movie deviating track record american remakes french comedies makers valet manage pull off upset produce solid adaptation material that uses same basic idea while also allowing its own mark be placed it movie features strong ensemble lovable characters stands its own apart original film key elements original story are kept while expanding or adding new material i was pleasantly surprised how much i liked this movie,0.5002250905659996,0.17949490534717805,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.48}"

Highly recommended for all audiences, tho kids might not find it as entertaining and there are a few parts with subtitles.",so great,i loved this movie lot reasons beginning with great unusual story direction thats not really romance not violent not trying too hard be funny instead its subtle beautiful had me smiling widely several times which is unusual me cast was fantastic directing editing just flawless excellent work thank you highly recommended all audiences tho kids might not find it as entertaining there are few parts with subtitles,0.7100925925925926,0.35194444444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.42, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8.0,The Valet,"Okay, I will admit I fully expected to hate this movie. Honestly, I had just watched ""The Gentlemen"" and needed something less intense and found this one. I have a little something for Betsy Brandt (sp) from Life in Pieces and figured I like what's his name from New Girl so... This show is so sweet, so well written and acted that there was a prequel or sequel I'd be the first in line to see it. Sure, there are some subtitles and even though I speak Spanish, I was grateful for them because the rapid fire exchanges between the four valets are hilarious. The gentleman whom portrayed Mr. Flores was excellent; so well played, so believably sincere that I genuinely wept.Watch it for yourself.",valet,okay i will admit i fully expected hate this movie honestly i had just watched gentlemen needed something less intense found this one i have little something betsy brandt sp life pieces figured i like whats his name new girl so this show is so sweet so well written acted that there was prequel or sequel id be first line see it sure there are some subtitles even though i speak spanish i was grateful them because rapid fire exchanges between four valets are hilarious gentleman whom portrayed mr flores was excellent so well played so believably sincere that i genuinely wept watch it yourself,0.5995896464646465,0.2301373106060606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
