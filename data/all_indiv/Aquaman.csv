5.0,The whole movie felt loud and relentless and so long,"There was embarrassing writing, embarrassing acting, and listening to Amber Heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting. Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - ""Wow there was a surprise and now we're accidentally holding hands"", ""Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you "" - give me a break. And whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed.",whole movie felt loud relentless so long,there was embarrassing writing embarrassing acting listening amber heard trying deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting why does half population atlantis sound like theyre california dialogue was never more than cliche with predictable plot advanced ancient civilization hidden away world trope is already old there was so much cgi that none action ever felt impressive or tense or real any time someone said ocean master with straight face i wanted laugh this wouldve been perfect movie not take itself too seriously go more lighthearted irreverent tone like thor ragnarok but they just try so hard it has none superhero charm that marvel manages carry over comics thus you have one very long boring slog how many scenes did we need where quiet moment was interrupted by exploding wall that didnt hurt anybody i counted three or four also that paint by numbers forced romance wow there was surprise now were accidentally holding hands wow there was explosion or something i grabbed you give me break whoever put together soundtrack this film should be summarily executed,0.49983333333333324,0.03922222222222224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"

4.0,"Visually striking, but little else to hold your attention","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningArthur Curry (Jason Momoa) is a half man, half aquarian warrior, who has been raised on Earth, and uses his special abilities to fight for justice. His latest escapades have seen him rescue an underwater boat from a group of vicious hijackers, one of whom is now eager for revenge. Meanwhile, in his underwater second home, tensions are brewing between rival kings Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), plunging him into a desperate inter-world battle, alongside the beautiful Mera (Amber Heard), to discover his true self.Suspension of disbelief is sometimes something you must be willing to engage with any regular movie, but with superhero movies, it's always something of a foregone conclusion, naturally with the inevitable fantasy element that is attached to the story. But, even by these standards, Aquaman, one of the most recent additions to the staple, rather pushes the boundaries. Opening in 1985, Nicole Kidman, as a mermaid, leaps out of the water by some guys house and comes into his life, living as a couple and raising a son (without, it seems, raising any eyebrows or contravening any marriage laws.) But this brief spark of incredulity serves as a sweetener for the lengthy vapidness that is to follow.Jason Momoa was a guy I'd never heard of before this film, and who on the back of it, it would seem, suddenly garnered the star power to charge £95 for his autograph at Comic Con. He certainly has the physical frame to fit the title role, and within the constraints of it, pulls off the grunting, edgy, wise-cracking tough guy in a perfectly serviceable manner, but nothing more than is required. The support cast is littered with big names, from Dafoe, Heard, Wilson, Kidman, and Lundgren making a pleasing big screen return in a none fighting role, all of whom are pretty much equally perfunctory.The film's big saving grace is it's magnificent visual spectacle, with some amazing CGI capturing a wonderous underwater kingdom, along with some snazzy costume design and amazing action. But it's at least twenty minutes too long and over indulgent, with a threadbare, unengaging story and empty, soulless performances. And that renders all that pretty meaningless. **",visually striking but little else hold your attention,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morningarthur curry jason momoa is half man half aquarian warrior who has been raised earth uses his special abilities fight justice his latest escapades have seen him rescue underwater boat group vicious hijackers one whom is now eager revenge meanwhile his underwater second home tensions are brewing between rival kings orm patrick wilson nereus dolph lundgren plunging him into desperate inter world battle alongside beautiful mera amber heard discover his true self suspension disbelief is sometimes something you must be willing engage with any regular movie but with superhero movies its always something foregone conclusion naturally with inevitable fantasy element that is attached story but even by these standards aquaman one most recent additions staple rather pushes boundaries opening 1985 nicole kidman as mermaid leaps out water by some guys house comes into his life living as couple raising son without it seems raising any eyebrows or contravening any marriage laws but this brief spark incredulity serves as sweetener lengthy vapidness that is follow jason momoa was guy id never heard before this film who back it it would seem suddenly garnered star power charge 95 his autograph at comic con he certainly has physical frame fit title role within constraints it pulls off grunting edgy wise cracking tough guy perfectly serviceable manner but nothing more than is required support cast is littered with big names dafoe heard wilson kidman lundgren making pleasing big screen return none fighting role all whom are pretty much equally perfunctory films big saving grace is its magnificent visual spectacle with some amazing cgi capturing wonderous underwater kingdom along with some snazzy costume design amazing action but its at least twenty minutes too long over indulgent with threadbare unengaging story empty soulless performances that renders all that pretty meaningless,0.5402808302808303,0.1180379188712522,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"

5.0,"I thought Disney bought Marvel, not DC","There is no reason that I know for why Aquaman turned into the modern CGI version of The Little Mermaid, liberally mixed with Aladdin and The Lion King. I mean, yeah, Black Panther was mostly Lion King, but it was interesting and fun and the world building was not bad. Aquaman feels cartoonish from the start to the very end. The pointless CGI, Heard's horrible wig, all the fairy tale characters that seek to show us how they are superior to people on the surface who have grown up reading about single dimensional characters like them, the predictability that one can find in children stories only. To be honest, the feeling I have most about this film is outrage. It is condescending and dumb. It's the Hollywood version of Homer telling Bart he's stupid.And then there is the cast. Jason Momoa, who I liked in Atlantis, the Stargate one, because he was supposed to have only one dimension. Amber Heard, who hasn't had a good role in ages and sporting that eye soar of a bad wig, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe getting their paychecks. And Dolph Ludgren? WTF?

4.0,The most overrated generic superhero film you'll ever see,"I don't know where the hype for this film comes from, because it can't be from the content. The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic.

,Everything But The Kitchen Sink,"Everything I saw, read and heard about 'Aquaman' before it came out had me convinced it wouldn't be my cup of tea. My impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog, a generic story and artificial looking CGI. However, once it opened, a passionate film fan I respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that I eventually got over myself and watched it.I think it was the moment when Nicole Kidman swallowed a goldfish that I started to suspect I might actually enjoy this movie. That suspicion, however, turned out to be wrong, because I didn't just enjoy it: I ended up ADORING it. The weirdest thing: the film DID contain all those elements I had feared - and yet none of that seemed to matter. It just works. It shouldn't, but it somehow does, which is why I've since come to the conclusion that director James Wan is some sort of genius wizard filmmaker. Don't let the generic superhero tropes and cheesy dialog fool you into thinking this was a typical mainstream movie (though I DO suspect those things managed to fool the studio executives into thinking exactly that: which is probably how James Wan got away with it), because in truth, this is the least generic, most bonkers big budget studio flick I've seen in ages. It's the film 'Valerian' wants to be. It's crazy; it's over-the-top; it's beautifully designed with incredible attention to every little detail in every frame; it doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn't expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginable, I had a stupid grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clichéd, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again, because I was so in love with its bonkers, ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink"" approach to filmmaking. Naturally, I now hope James Wan will also direct 'Aquaman 2', as I'm sure if given the chance, next time not even the kitchen sink will be safe.P.S.

3.0,"Aquaman: Basically what I expected, and that's not a good thing","Where could I even start?Let it be known immediately I'm unimpressed with the DC cinematic universe thus far, though not bad I've considered the movies very underwhelming for the most part. I think they dropped the ball thoroughly and rushed to make Justice League (2017) without debuting most of the characters first like Marvel did.Now Aquaman is a delicate one, because let's be honest he's hard to take seriously. He was silly in Smallville (2001), he was silly in his own cartoon, all the animated outings and the live action television series never even got past the pilot. It's a dude who talks to fish and once taken away from water doesn't really have a gimmick. For this reason (And many more) I was skeptical of the DCU version and with good reason, sure he was fairly neat in Justice League but here? Really?You see straight off the bat I'll say I like Momoa I'd consider myself a fan, he's a competent actor with a unique look. But he's not Arthur Curry! Aquaman is the blonde haired jock looking character, not long black haired bearded Samoan looking fella! So as much as I like the actor, I struggle to see him as this character who has been around since 1941 and has always had the same look which they've not embraced.So getting over that what do we have? Over 2hrs of CGI laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman, Atlantis, tridents, oceanic life fighting for him and goofy looking villains. In fact it's so CGI-laden and so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anyway.The story is very Hollywood, very by the numbers stuff so no surprise there. The cast is decent enough but people like Dafoe just look so out of place because they're too good for this.I'd like to say this is take your brain out fun but it's not, Suicide Squad (2016) was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself a full frontal lobotomy mediocrity.It's cheesy, it's tacky, it's over the top, it lacks the laughs that could have saved it (To an extent) and it's done nothing to redeem the DC universe in my eyes especially considering I'd count this as their worst movie yet.Aquaman is one of those critically acclaimed movies that I'll never understand why and can only assume it's fans are (Mostly) made up of children and ladies lusting after Momoa.The Good:Momoa is the personification of ""Cool""A few funny momentsSome very impressive visualsThe Bad:That simply isn't Arthur CurryHard to take any of it seriouslyTacky Hollywood nonsense",aquaman basically what i expected thats not good thing,where could i even start let it be known immediately im unimpressed with dc cinematic universe thus far though not bad ive considered movies very underwhelming most part i think they dropped ball thoroughly rushed make justice league 2017 without debuting most characters first like marvel did now aquaman is delicate one because lets be honest hes hard take seriously he was silly smallville 2001 he was silly his own cartoon all animated outings live action television series never even got past pilot its dude who talks fish once taken away water doesnt really have gimmick this reason many more i was skeptical dcu version with good reason sure he was fairly neat justice league but here really you see straight off bat ill say i like momoa id consider myself fan hes competent actor with unique look but hes not arthur curry aquaman is blonde haired jock looking character not long black haired bearded samoan looking fella so as much as i like actor i struggle see him as this character who has been around since 1941 has always had same look which theyve not embraced so getting over that what do we have over 2hrs cgi laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman atlantis tridents oceanic life fighting him goofy looking villains fact its so cgi laden so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anyway story is very hollywood very by numbers stuff so no surprise there cast is decent enough but people like dafoe just look so out place because theyre too good this id like say this is take your brain out fun but its not suicide squad 2016 was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself full frontal lobotomy mediocrity its cheesy its tacky its over top it lacks laughs that could have saved it extent its done nothing redeem dc universe my eyes especially considering id count this as their worst movie yet aquaman is one those critically acclaimed movies that ill never understand why can only assume its fans are mostly made up children ladies lusting after momoa good momoa is personification cool few funny momentssome very impressive visualsthe bad that simply isnt arthur curryhard take any it seriouslytacky hollywood nonsense,0.5820064484126983,0.13042309253246753,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"

1.0,Terrible female actor,Jason isn't the best actor - but I guess they picked him in looks? But Amber is unwatchable - why didn't they just pick a tv commercial actor = better result.It's common knowledge that 'movie magic CGI' and editing was needed to make it feel like there was some chemistry between Jason and Heard - and still it doesn't work - so money wasted.,terrible female actor,jason isnt best actor but i guess they picked him looks but amber is unwatchable why didnt they just pick tv commercial actor better result its common knowledge that movie magic cgi editing was needed make it feel like there was some chemistry between jason heard still it doesnt work so money wasted,0.43333333333333335,0.06249999999999999,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.44}"

5.0,"Terrible script, looks like it might be fun to watch in 3D","I was in the minority of IMDB reviewers who liked the underrated Justice League, and now, with the latest movie featuring Jason Momoa as Aquaman, I am in the minority again, this time having a far more negative reaction than most people.While the CGI action is *sometimes* fun, the dialogue is excruciatingly bad. Embarrassingly bad. This is particularly evident with Amber Heard, who hasn't developed the skill of more experienced actors like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe to find a way to speak drivel with conviction. Amber seems terrible in this, but I don't know how much of that is her and how much is the wretched verbiage she is forced to spew.People are going crazy for the muscly Momoa. I was underwhelmed by him in Justice League, and while he certainly has some amount of charm, he fails to make Aquaman particularly memorable.The story is predictable. Some of the action works, some doesn't. Everything that's not action is painful to sit through.I did notice that the movie is very much filmed for 3D. Perhaps that's why I was underwhelmed by a lot of the action; it was more designed for effects than fun. I do suspect I would have enjoyed this more in 3D. I also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed in all the dialogue.",terrible script looks like it might be fun watch 3d,i was minority imdb reviewers who liked underrated justice league now with latest movie featuring jason momoa as aquaman i am minority again this time having far more negative reaction than most people while cgi action is sometimes fun dialogue is excruciatingly bad embarrassingly bad this is particularly evident with amber heard who hasnt developed skill more experienced actors like nicole kidman willem dafoe find way speak drivel with conviction amber seems terrible this but i dont know how much that is her how much is wretched verbiage she is forced spew people are going crazy muscly momoa i was underwhelmed by him justice league while he certainly has some amount charm he fails make aquaman particularly memorable story is predictable some action works some doesnt everything thats not action is painful sit through i did notice that movie is very much filmed 3d perhaps thats why i was underwhelmed by lot action it was more designed effects than fun i do suspect i would have enjoyed this more 3d i also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed all dialogue,0.5142989417989416,0.07400793650793652,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.48}"
2.0,Jason Mamoa is the perfect Aquaman,"Jason is the best man for the job for aquaman, love him in this role. I have only ever watched this film solely for him.Now why did I give this film a two star rating?Amber Heard.I did not like her in this movie and I will be repulsed to see her in the next. Stop being freaking stubborn WB & DC!!! Remove her from the second film otherwise Jason and the rest of the cast will suffer in turn. It is incredibly unfair for them to have to take a hit as well in the succebox office success.We have been asking for years to have that woman removed and you morons still choose to keep her in this film.
